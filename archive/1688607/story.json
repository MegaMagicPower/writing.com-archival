One minute she broke the wrist of a pirate, the next he just... poofed. Looking herself over she found her suit much tighter, and instantly knew why. She was taller! She had to have grown a whole foot taller, and not just that, her body had changed along with her height. Her hips and thighs had gotten wider to go along with her longer legs, forcing her to change her stance. Looking over her shoulder she found her rear had ballooned into a round bubble butt, her costume more than skin tight and showing off her curves. Her bust had ballooned a well, going from a rather proud D cup in bra size to what felt like an ego boosting F! She almost felt like opening the clasp at the front just to let her chest have space to breath. Giving her new curves a feel, a light smirk crossed her ruby lips until her hands went to her abs, or rather the absence of them. Her middle seemed bloated, yet when she pressed down it was firm against her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to mull it over however when she heard voices from the hallway behind her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus approached the medical center. She was not exactly thrilled to be were she was today, but to maintain a license as a professional bounty hunter the federation mandated that all applicants health and wellness be up to date. As she walked through the doors of the featureless stark white building she turned to see a holographic display on the wall. Welcoming patients, and in this case specifically her, and displaying a path along the walls to appointed area for her physical. Following the guide she was led to a small room with a single metal chamber in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt quick glance through machines panel indicated that the medical test was automated and all she needed to do was, strip down to appropriate clothing, climb into the pod and run the program. Entering the pod, she quickly removed her jacket and activated her zero suit. The pod began to activate and quickly began scanning her whole body. After about 5 minutes the pod began stutter, displaying odd readings to Samus as she lay there. She began to go over the readouts, apparently there were some genetic anomalies in her system. Going through the report she noted that the anomalies were linked to a foreign DNA strand within her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metroid...dna...wait, I'm in a public area with....ah crap.\" Samus spoke out loud as an alarming series events played out rather quickly. Sirens began to sound in the background, and the pod she was in suddenly was awash in red light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no dammit, NO!\" Samus shouted kicking the pod door, but it was to late, the unit had already locked her inside, and was displaying a red biohazard sign.<br>\r\n\"I am not a dam metroid, Let me out, I know how the federation responds to this kinda crap, I don't care to be shot at today!! Now open up!\" Samus shouted anger beginning to rise up in her voice. She grabbed the control panel and began trying to override the medical pod. The unit rejected her attempts which only caused her to grow angrier. Suddenly she felt something shock her, like a small lighting bolt running up her arm. She looked down worried that the pod may have just tried to sedate her. Instead she found the unit lights had began to blow out all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not a great sign, but if the power is going out I bet I can force a manual override.\" Samus pondered out loud. She then began to flip through the control panel again. quickly she found the holo-display began to fade, every time she would touch it, the lights would fade a little more. Worse every time she felt those little botls of lightning shooting up her fingers and arm. She tried to stay calm, she tried to be rationale, she new if she stayed calm she could do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have faced down space pirates, metroids, X parasites, and escaped no less then 3 exploding planets.... I can do this....just keep calm, remember the chozo training.\" Samus spoke to herself as she began to make some progress on the quickly fading control screen. Finally she through sheer luck or malfunctioning tech she got access to emergency options screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...Now where is...\" FZZT<b> -BOOM-</b> the control panel quickly shorted out as Samus felt a shock and burning sensation run through her entire body. Samus stared blankly at the broken display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 Seconds...Many would call that an impressive amount of time to keep your cool and come up with a new solution to a possible life threatening situation.<br>\r\nFor Samus going from calm and collected to Berserk rage in 10 seconds was a new feeling. Especially considering the lack of life draining monsters involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"rrrRRRaAAHAGHH!\" the guttural scream startled the 3 federation marines and two federation medical hazmat workers. Each stepped back as the lid of  pod with a class S biohazard burst off its hinges. They weren't sure what could break ceramic titanium alloy off its hinges, but they also knew they didn't want to pick a fight with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizen you are infected with a Class S biohazard. Stand down and prepare for containment.\" Spoke the head medical worker his voice slightly mechanical sounding due to the suits speaker. Samus emerged from the pod, Standing her usual height of 6' 3\" looking around she took a breath and raised her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm calm, lets not due anything stupid. I really aren't in the mood to be shot at right now.\" She said as she began to raise her left arm. unfortunately one of the soldiers was a bit to much on edge, and launched a stun blast the bounty hunter. The blue ray of energy collided with her body and knocked her to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!, You Son of a Bitch. I have KILLED things for less than that you...oh, warm....\" Samus's rage trailed offed as her whole body began to heat up. A sensation like being bathed in sunlight filled her body. The hazmat workers stepped forward with their kits but then suddenly stopped. Samus's whole body began to move, outward. When it finished she was bigger. not by much only a couple inches, maybe she was nearly 6 and half feet tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Samus asked<br>\r\n\"We don't know Miss Aran but were here to help. please let us contain you.\" Spoke the lead scientist.</span></div></div>",

It dawned on the bounty hunter that she was now able to look down at space marines in full armor suits, not by much but still possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marines took a step back and leveled the weapons at Samus, notably keeping them set to stun. Injuring civilians is never a good idea, but given the person they were dealing with precaution was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, No...I mean I am threatening yes...but I am not a threat to you. I really don't want any trouble I was only here for medical reasons.\" Samus said bringing her hands up in a defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Aran that is why we are here. You may not be a threat but something in you is. We need to....help you.\" Replied the lead federation soldier in the medical suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen what the federation considers helping. No thank you.\" Samus said and took a step forward but stopped immediately as the federation soldiers trained their guns on her instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, Do Not Shoot Me!' Samus said as she began to carefully move to left avoiding the soldiers. The soldiers looked at the medical officer for advice, needing to know if the bounty hunter could leave, or if her contagion needed to be contained at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well miss Aran have it your way.\" The medical officer replied and moved out of her way. As Samus began leaving, one of the soldiers misunderstanding the commanding soldiers implied orders opened fire with his rifle on the stun setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-KZZTT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat slammed through Samus's back and she dropped to the ground, holding back a scream. She had learned earlier in life, don't scream from pain unless you need the strength to push through learn to deal with pain, by shedding attachment to it. Then the warm feeling flooded her body again. Her vision suddenly became red and it became harder to think clearly, but she saw the soldier leveling his rifle for a second shot seeing that the first had not dropped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Son of A...\" Samus stood back up and moved forward towards the marine, was it his imagination or was she bigger, maybe the legendary bounty hunter was just more intimidating in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the soldier was not seeing things, Samus Aran now stood 7 feet tall almost a foot taller in her zero suit then the soldiers in their armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Aran STOP!\" Cried the medical lead knowing how soldiers would react to a threat.</span></div></div>",

Did I not just say Don't Shoot ME!\" Samus meant the words to come out as a lecture but she may have put a little too much heat into her words, as she watched the federation soldiers step backwards and begin to cluster together in a defensive formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss Aran, yes he made a mistake but something is wrong. Just look at you!\" The medical commander spoke up, motioning towards her whole body, which was now the largest living thing in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked downward at herself. it was true, she was definitely different, it wasn't a lot, but even being 7 inches taller was a little alarming. The fact it was happening so abruptly was even more worrying. But she knew she could figure this out, back at her ship the chozo tech inside was still light years ahead of most federation tech, and if she couldn't get an answer from her ship, then she'd just head to the nearest functioning chozo ruins to figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allright, we are done here, I am leaving and I'm going to figure out whats happening to me. And no you are not going to quarantine me, and I don't care what your orders are of about the safety of the situation. Take my word on this as someone who's dealt with more weird stuff in my life then all of you put together, I am the most capable individual to solve my problems. GOT IT?\" Samus said placing her hands on her hips and glaring down at the soldiers daring any of them to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers looked at each other nervously. the lead medical officer stepped forward to speak up but he was immediately cut off by Amazon sized Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! that was not a suggestion. I am telling you how this is going to end. oh and one last thing, pay attention Mr. Trigger happy.\"<br>\r\n\"DO NOT SHOOT ME.\" Samus spoke loudly and clearly glaring at the one soldier in particular and then turned to leave......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-!!ZZapp!!-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt it again, a rush of energy as she stumbled forward. Turning her head slowly, her eye's wide and pupils dilated she looked to see what had just happened. They could not be that damn stupid right. But sure enough right there in Mr. Trigger happy's hand was a laser rifle with a glowing tip that had just been fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned and stood to her full height now 7 feet 4 inches. She looked down at the soldiers and proceeded to handle the situation well, she would say she handled the situation really well, for a woman who had just been shot 3 times in the span of ten minutes, she'd like to think she took the appropriate action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LITTLE F&amp;*$*($%, I'm Gonna Shove that RIFLE down your THROAT!!!\" Samus Roared and charged forward. She slammed into the Federation soldier with enough force to send the armored man flying backwards into the medical pod she had escaped. His rifle clattered to the ground, as Samus picked up the fallen door to the med pod and slammed it into place over the med pod trapping Mr. Trigger happy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about this time the rest of the soldiers sprang into action opening fire on her from behind. Half a dozen energy rifles still set to stun went off striking the enraged and enlarged bounty hunter multiple times and driving her to her knee's with enough collective stunning force to drop an elephant twice over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt the beams strike into her, then there was flash of heat, lots of heat. It felt....good, the first few times had been painful and clouded her thoughts, but this, the first had hurt, but the subsequent strikes had been like euphoria. Then she felt he body begin to tremble and then fill with...power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, Ohhh, OH wow, that's INCREDIBLE!\" Samus moaned as she rose to her feet, the marines promptly stepped back and trained their rifles on the bounty hunter, unbelieving that they may have to fire again, aiming upwards, higher...and higher..and higher....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's body stretched upward, as she rose from 7ft to 8, 9, 10.... and finally in one last spurt of heat and pleasure her body expanded to 12 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,,,Okay...yeah something is  wrong...umm lets talk about this okay.\" Samus said as she looked down on the room full of soldiers, the tallest of which barely came up to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

Samus begin to think quickly she had to dissolve this situation without violence, and without getting any bigger....no matter how good it felt. No she had to stop this, other wise soon she'd be to big for her ship, then She'd have to rely on the federation for help, and again she had seen what the federation considered helping, including using phazon, cloning metroids, and many more sinister projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Aran, you are infected with....something, and we need to bring you in to study it and make sure its not contagious. Will you please come quietly.\" The medical officer  replied cautiously while leveling his sidearm at the giant bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus Aran was not one to take threats lightly. Looking down at the men before he she began to do some quick calculations. It was already clear they couldn't stop her, heck she had done all this in just the zero suit. If she actually dawned her Chozo battle armor this situation would be child's play. But the federation might also perceive that as an attack. and they would start coming at her in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I guess there's only one thing to do.\" Samus said standing up straight and cracking her neck, goodness growing left her stiff. It was a moment later she realized that the simple gesture was somewhat cocky when she was her normal size...at her current stature of 12 feet of perfectly toned badass, that gesture might be construed differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she the saw the soldiers instinctively raise their rifles, the tension in the air suddenly spiked. Samus knew the next words she choose had to be chosen very carefully or this would not go well for anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHOOT HER!!\" came the frenzied cry from Mr. Trigger happy, still trapped inside the med pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone was practically enough to set off the room. Samus's response did not help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F&amp;^&amp;* OFF, I'll crush you between my perfect thighs till you beg for mercy or your head EXPLODES!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noops<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe federation soldiers immediately set their energy rifles to lethal mode and opened fire. Each weapon streaming a constant beam of energy, Samus was impacted by no less then 6 beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrghhh, Oh holy crap that hur...hur...ohhhh, oh,mmmmhhh, AH!\" Samus began to scream from the pain that flared through her body, in zero suit she had no chance of surviving such an assault normally. But the pain quickly dissipated, and was replaced by pleasure...lots of pleasure. Heat flooded through her body, warm and encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grew....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers watched as the form of the enormous 12 foot, skin tight latex bound woman began to expand, unlike before this growth was noticeable. Her form expanded, growing larger, and larger, and larger......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does Samus get? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly began to fill the room around her as 12 feet became 15 feet, then 17 feet. At which point She was forced to ground by her expanding body. She couldn't  stand upright unless she wanted to put her head through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe federation soldiers watched as the beautiful woman before them continued to grow, at 17ft she steadily expanded, her thighs and abs became more toned, her ass began to take on curves associated more with models and less with athletic women. Still she grew, and as she passed 20 feet the massive woman began to lower her self to avoid impact with the ceiling. The soldiers froze in fear as nearly 5 tons of sexy Samus fell upon them. Crushing most of them to the ground, fortunately federation power armor is really top notch stuff. Most were unharmed and simply trapped beneath the now giant Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her growth peaked at 24 feet. Breathing intensely from the incredible burst of pleasure associated with growth, Samus finally managed to clear her head and start to think again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I warned you not to shoot me. Serves you right...assholes.\" Samus added the last curse mostly out of resentment for the treatment not anger. Indeed she felt far to go good to remain angry at the soldiers beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, Like I said I think I'm going to leave and head back to see if my ship's computers can help get to teh bottom of this mystery. Thank you for your service boy's....and seriously....Do Not Shoot Me Again....got it?\" Samus said adding a bit of actual anger to the few words, while she had mostly calmed down she didn't care to let this get out of hand. Though at least at her current size nothing short of a tank or a fighter unit would stop her from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-How do you plan to get out? You're to big now. You can't fit through those doors.\" The medical officer cried out from beneath her massive weight, judging by the sound of his voice he was trapped somewhere under her left thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same way I get out of most places, by force.\" Samus replied and she rolled onto her back, not even giving the soldiers enough time to escape as she pushed up and flipped around. The 7 men let out a cumulative gasp, and then cry of pain as the massive Samus came back down on them, this time pinning the entire squad under her firm and now curvy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to kick at the nearest wall, while bracing her back against the corner of the room she was closest too. With each each kick the wall, neigh the whole building shook. Sure enough though cracks slowly began to form along the wall. Of course with each kick and subsequent shaking of the building and her body, the soldiers trapped under her ass let out breathless shouts of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPmPhh! Miss Aran, please stop we..OMPH! We can help you, just let us make a call and well have crew come by and cutopmhjh! Cut an exit in the wall\" Shouted the medical officer trying to at least get her to relent with the kicking, high tech armor or not he and his squad could only take so much of a beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is faster.\" Replied Samus causally as she planted another building shaking kick against the wall, and her massive ass and thighs slammed the men further into the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss OpHH!, Miss Aran please!\" shouted the officer beginning to make his argument again when he was cut off by another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let her kick the Damn wall down man! At least it'll get her fat ass off us!\" came a sharp shout from beneath the giant womans ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the kicking stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT, did you just say?\" Samus said closing her eye's and thinking over the situation. She could not have possibly heard that correctly. No one would dare say that about her, hell the space pirates wanted her dead and tried to make it a reality every time they met. But even they weren't dumb enough to take a shot like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seargent, keep quiet.\" came the medical officer's reply<br>\r\n\"Fuck that, she's made it clear she just wants to leave and be left alone.\" came the soldier reply, a man who apparently had been hired for his bravado and certainly not his foresight or discernment.<br>\r\n\"I said get your size XXXXL ass off me and my men and leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus slowly turned her head toward the soldier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I have new idea....I'm Gonna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every shot from the rifles and I got bigger. The medical pod shorting out and a small burst of size. The Metroid contagion alert.\" Samus said quite causually as she began to reach under herself and around the room picking up the fallen energy rifles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical officer who had basically reached the same conclusion but was afraid to say anything for fear of...well creating this exact situation...stared up in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!! Miss Aran please, we don't know what's happening to you. you could...\"<br>\r\n\"I think its obvious I'm absorbing energy like a metroid, but with more...pleasant side effects.\" Samus cut off the officer as she ran one of her hands over her breasts, each at this point as large a beach ball and weighing something in the vicinity of a couple hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered up the rifles and the extra energy clips, and with a second thought the plasma grenades the marines had brought as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm how to take this in....I'm not sure If I'm resistant or immune to energy damage.\" Samus pondered out loud placing a delicate finger on her chin. Giving the impression of a certain airheaded stereotype. The soldiers got the feeling something was actually wrong at this point. They had all read dossier's on the legendary bounty hunter. She was powerful, cunning, strong, sexy, smart, and vigilant. But airheaded, and playful? Teasing and cruel? Not common words used to describe the bombshell bounty hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she was just playing with them, which most were sure was the case, this was a noted deviance of her normal behavior. The contagion they had come to contain was definitely messing with her mind on some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Aran PLEASE! Please think before you act.\" pleaded the medical officer<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, maybe....if he'll apologize.\" Samus replied pointing at the soldier that had insulted her weight and appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seargent....apologize.\" the medical officer commanded<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry Miss Aran.\" came a deadbeat tone from the man trapped under the 25 ft giantess's ass.<br>\r\n\"I Supposse that will suffice....\" Samus began only to be interrupted<br>\r\n\"For calling a sextuplet XL ass only a quadruple you heavy HOE!\" shouted the soldier in spite and possibly due to not enough air getting through to his brain, likely from said nigh perfect 5 ton ass that was crushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blinked, The other soldiers gawked, and there was the distinct sound of the medical officers hand slapping his helmet as he face palmed at their soon to be doom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I stutter?\" asked the soldier bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LITTLE FUCK!! I'll show you a sextuplet sized ass!\" Samus roared as anger returned to her voice and she immediately swallowed the payload of energy cells and grenades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" asked the medical officer, voice void of hope<br>\r\n\"Please she was in pain when we shot her, then she absorbed the power. This'll probably kill her and we'll just have to clean up a corpse....a really heavy corpse.\" shot back the seargent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly  it happened, there was a muted roar of explosion and thermal energy. The giant samus double over clutching her stomach in pain. Then it hit her. Heat, lots of lots of intense, searing, pleasurable heat. It spread throught her body in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus had expected her body to react like before, to slowly metabolize the energy and feed her body's growth. But apparently taking in a large of amount of power quickly did not have the same effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's size exploded outward. In the first few seconds she doubled in size from 25 feet to 50 ft. As her expanding form slammed into all the walls of the room Samus let out a moan of sheer frustration mixed with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, yes, YES. More. I Want MORE!\" She roared as her form that now filled the entire room continued to swell. the building groaned from the stress and the weakened wall from earlier gave way as her long beautiful legs shot outwards into the crowded street. People were sent running, cars sent flying from the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it feels amazing. Oh god, its happening again...yes, yes, more more more MORE!\" Samus screamed as second growth spurt kicked in and her head and shoulders shout out the other side of the building. 50 ft quickly becoming a memory as her size grew to 75 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally standing up to her full height she gazed downward towards teh soldiers below. Low and behold their armor had endured her massive growth spurt. Shaken and beaten they were still prone on the ground before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ASSHOLE!\" Samus roared from 80 ft above them. Looking up the soldiers, particularly the sergeant saw the still growing form of Samus Aran. She was still expanding, her zero suit pulling tight along her massive well toned body. 85 feet came and went and the soldiers watched in horror as she turned around and spread her legs. They had a beautiful view of her enormous woman hood through the skin tight zero suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n90 ft came and went and Samus spoke again \"This is Sextuplet XL sized Ass. Have a CLOSER look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Samus Aran lowered her now massive ass and all of her 400 plus tons of mass onto them. 100 feet of titanic pissed of bounty hunter impacted the street crushing the soldiers below and sending a spiderweb of cracks throughout the street for twenty feet in every direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that, that's finished. Time to do something a little more constructive.\" Samus said as her head finally cleared and she could think clearly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing around at her new surrounding Samus decided to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a problem and it needed addressed.  Unfortunately she also had another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unlike anything she ever felt before. Like there was this hole inside her, the size and shape of her entire body and she needed to fill it. It kept burning, and clouding her judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to...to my ship...need to figure out whats...what's...\" Samus began speaking aloud as she rose back up to her full height of 100 feet. She meant to start heading out of the city, but instead somethi g caught her eye. A power pole, a semi-wireless system the federation used to transmit and receive power through the city grid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need, I need.....more power, I need to feed on muh,muh, more.\" Samus droned as she sat down in front of the power pole, grabbing a small lead from the top meant to receive power,  she placed the wire into her mouth. Heat slowly and pleasurable flooded her body. Starting innlips and working it's way through her entire being. Unlike the previous exposure to energy the constant but regulated thrum was not enough to trigger her growth, but it was enough to satisfy her hunger and trigger something else. Samus felt the familiar sensation of heat building between her legs. She raised one hand to her enormous breast and began to grow herself. Content to bath in the power and heat she was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......elsewhere.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe federation tank rounded the nearest corner it's two inhabitants inside one a driver and one a gunner carrying on...<br>\r\n\"I don't see why we needed a tank\" the driver said navigating the streets of the city taking to an urgent distress call.<br>\r\n\"Because the federation distress signal was coded to indicate an ally had turned on us, and further details indicate it might be the bounty hunter Samus Aran.\" Replied the gunner.<br>\r\n\"But sir this is fully operational combat model, star class, battle tank. Our main gun is a plasma cannon with enough punch to tear through a cruiser on a direct hit\"<br>\r\n\"Dammit rookie! This is Samus Aran, the woman has destroyed no less then 3 planets and nearly wiped out an equal number of species from existence,  frankly the tank might not be enough....\" the gunner stated angrily, he didn't know many of the details from the distress call other then an class A threat identified as samus was actively resisting federation law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God help us if this like that time with parking ticket....\" the gunner said absently<br>\r\n\" I thought that a was company joke sir, I mean an entire federation police dept.....by herself...it seems....\"the driver began  but stopped speaking as they rounded the next corner brining their objective in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere sat the mighty Samus Aran. Paying them no head slowly groping herself,  legs spread partly. It would have been less a cause for alarm if she wasn't occupying the entire street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...orders sir?\" <br>\r\n\"Keep us steady, something's wrong, time to fix it\" the gunner replied charging the main cannon the tank.<br>\r\n\"Sir you're not gonna....shouldn't we try talking first?\"<br>\r\n\"Talk?! Look at her, she's 100 ft tall and a step away from masturbating in the street, I think we'll talk after we have an advantage.\" And with that the gunner slammed the console initiating the fire sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down from her feeding. She was getting ridiculously horny, she had to do something before this went to far. She saw the tank, she saw the cannon charge. And she could feel the energy from the weapon from here. Her eye's went wide and her mouth opened to say something.  Maybe it was stop, maybe it was fire but we all know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do Not Shoot M....\" but samus was cut off by the roar of plasma cannon. It cut through the air an slammed into her chest. And fore filled her breasts, intense and painful, but only for a second. Then the pleasure started again, this time even more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, fuck yes!\" Samus cried as she heaved back and pushed her chest forward. The soldiers in the tank gazed at their view screen convinced something was malfunctioning. Her breasts were growing, larger and larger. The zero suit she wore stretched tighter and tighter over her now expanding bosom. As the The energy from the cannon dissipated, her erect nipples could be seen beneath her suit straining outward. Samus's once giant car sized B cups, has grown a full cup size. It wasn't  the most impressive ratio in the world but on the 100 ft tall titan she was now, her breasts could easily crush a man....a small car...or a tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Amazing....again,  do it again!\" Samus shiutednher eye's focused on the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  a second shot fired out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really sir?\" Asked The gunner <br>\r\n\"Shut it private, I'm in charge, I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shot slammed into Samus's chest again, and once more hear and pleasure filed her entire body. Her breasts began to expand again, swelling larger and larger, pulling her zero suit tight enough to partially be see through.  C cups swelled larger and Samus moaned in pleasure. As she stood up her now massive D cup chest bounced. The  leaning over the tank Samus took one step forward and placed it under her  massive womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, more power, more heat, do it , give me MORE!!\" samus roared and brought her weight down on the vehicle, the  slowly working her hips back and forth she began to grind herself against the cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sir we're trapped, and the hull\" -PTING- a screw went flying across the inside of the tank.<br>\r\n\"All right rookie time for the rocket man maneuver, full reverse on my mark!\" The gunner ordered<br>\r\n\" b-b-b-but sir that will give her exactly what she wants!\"<br>\r\n\"You prefer to be crushed under a giant tank eating pussy.....cause I'm good either way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More damit I said more!! Fire already you little....ohhh, ah, ah, Ah, AH, Yes, YES, FUCK YESSSS!\"  Samus roared as her threat was answered by the tank engaging a constant stream of plasmafire directly into her vagina. She dismissed the zero suit and simply tried to engulf the whole tank with her pussy. She did not succeed, but as she pulled back to grind the vehicle again it fired free from her clutches, streaming a massive amount of energy straight into her womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climax was Amazing. Samus orgasmed and as she did her entire body grew upward. She grew in short intense bursts, screaming in ectasy with each one. 100 feet became 105, 110, 115, 120, and finally 125 feet. Further more her pussy lips began to increase in size. Growing larger and more robust, even her clit doubled in size and became clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her orgasm passed, Samus looked around her power hunger had funal,y abated and some other new d she didn't really want to admit she had was also satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sami, time to get to the ship before you do something you really regret.\" She said to herself  aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she....</span></div></div>",

She was still smaller then a lot of the buildings, but large enough to get an idea of the lay of the land around her. Also at her size not much was crowding around, quite the opposite. Since her recent growth spurts most civilians had evacuated the area. That certainly made getting  around easier, since she didn't have to worry about accidently stepping on anyone, well not anyone innocent  anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moves through the streets feeling the pavement shift beneath each step she was reminded of the initial soldiers remark on her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid pavement, Weak streets, I'll have you know for a woman  of my.....stature I am appropriately weighted.\" Samus spoke aloud mostly to sooth her ego. It may have worked better if the street hadn't choose that exact moment to give way beneath her and cause her to stumble forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...no,no,no,No!\" She shouted panicking as fell forward she instinctively reached outward and turned the fall into an awkward somersault. There was a terrible sound of steel and concrete crumbling and deforming as the 125 ft bounty hunter rolled forward and sprang back up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's probably gonna cost me.\" Samus said as she gazed back at what her impromptu gymnastics had done. The entire street was a disaster, concrete was reduced to rubble and an enormus sinkhole had opened up where she had initially impacted the ground with her full weight. Even worse a large amount of nearby buildings were now precariously tilting to one side or just flat missing chunks from their sides. And every vehicle that had been I  her path was reduced to flattened metal slab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus could practically hear the street calling her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, leaving, not dealing with this. I'm worry about my looks after I get back to normal.\" Samus turned to walk away and ran smack dab into a federation star cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of Chozo.....really? Really?!\" Samus practically screamed at the cruiser. A smaller ship by federation standards meant to bridge the gap between fighter and destroyer. Of course size is a relative term, in this case that \"smaller\" ship was fully 100ft long  600 tonne rectangular metal weapon. Nearly the same size as samus herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a minute to contemplate her situation, the ship was actually smaller then her. That was...empowering to think about. Though she wasn't really sure if she was more devastating then the modern weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aran, this is captain Reckt of the SS sunspark. Please stand down or we will be forced to make you stand down.\" Came the semi-robotized voice of the ships captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no. Every time you idiots engage me this problem gets worse. Did you know I started today at 6' 3\"?\" Samus said motioning to herself and her now staggering size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time you interfere the situation gets worse. Normally cause some idiot shoots me....,do not do that by the way, you won't like it.\" Samus ended her rant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, Miss Aran. Please stand down.\" Came the captain's reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I am going to my ship and I am going t--URGH!\" Samus let out a grunt of pain as gravity around her increased by 10 fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Miss Aran, but I have my orders.\" Came capt. Reckt's reply as the ship turned its tractor beam onto Samus. Setting it to push with the intent of holding her down until she submitted or passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better release me...or...else..\" Came Samus gritty reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response the ship increased the tractor effect to 20 fold. A pale purple light surrounded the giant Samus. Bit then something happened, it was subtle at first but slowly and surely Samus began to grow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt it happening again, right as the ship had increased the power of the beam. The original effect had been warm but also held her motion, the  increased beam became....pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great here we go again.\" Samus muttered to herself as she felt her body begin to expand. It was stunted, lime her body wanted to grow but couldn't at first. Still after a few seconds of struggling it started happening, very slowly Samus's size increased.125 ft became 126, then about 10 seconds later 127ft......128.....129....130....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir she appears to be growing again!\" Came thenhurried shout of an officer monitoring Samus's state.<br>\r\n\"Oh no she doesn't not this time, full power knock her out, Now!\" Came the captain's reply as the ship's crew hurriedly obeyed and cranked the tractor beam up to maximum she increasing gravity by 200 fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt the surge of power and her mind lit up with fire and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes you fool's. More, gimme more, more power, More!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to shout as her whole body shuddered. 130 ft became 140ft, then 150ft. Samus's form began to expand, and her muscles began to take on even more tone. 160 ft came and went the  at 175ft, she was finally able to rise under even the increased pressure from the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, more power. I want to be bigger, I NEED to be Bigger!! More, MORE!!! FEED ME MORE POWER!!\" Samus practically roared as she rose to 200ft. The low flying cruiser was knocked back as the giantess now fully twice it's size stood up to her full height. The men and women  aboard the cruiser could only stare in shock at the size of the woman in front of them. The  cruisers height was barely hovering at the level of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All power to thrusters flip us and full reverse!\" Came capt. Reckt's reply the cruiser turned and began to slowly accelerated away<br>\r\nThey didn't get far before the 200ft tall mega Samus pulled the ship back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the ship between her massive bossom, she enveloped the war vessel between her massive breasts.then she brought<br>\r\nThe engines close to her face,not caring that the hull began to shatter between her massive orbs of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, MORE! Mooooorrreeee!\" Roared Samus as she laid her mouth over the engines and swallowed up the power coming from them. She sucked and sucked and sucked on the engines, each time feeling the warm ecstasy of power filling her whole body. She just kept sucking, even as escape pods jettisoned out of the dying vessel. The  without warning, her whole body simply exploded with power. Samus could feel very cell in her being light up in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shock faded, Samus looked around. That last growth spurt had taken her from 200ft straight to 350 ft. She now srood taller then all but the tallest buildings around her. Her whole body finally settled, and her mind cleared again,  this time much quicker. She was perhaps getting used to the growth spurts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Samus walked away from city she began to consider everything that had transpired so far. The medical pod had identified Metroid DNA, she got ruled to be a class 1 Bio-hazard, she was shot at, grew, was shot at some more, grew larger. Then she may have gone a little overboard, crushed a bunch of marines, a tank, a star cruiser.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it wasn't like I had much choice. I mean they shot me, who does that?\" Samus wondered aloud as she came close to the city limits. Turns out being 300 feet tall will let you cover a lot of ground quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, who shoots at me. Samus Freaking Aran. I know Space pirates with more sense.\"<br>\r\n\"Well either way I just hope they've learned their lesson. I guess it doesn't matter, it's not like they have anything they can throw at me that won't just make me stronger...and bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pondered on the last part as she continued walking away. She knew again she had to get back to normal but she'd be lying if she didn't admit the ability to absorb energy was dam useful. Being immune to energy weaponry was quite a perk. The size increase also had some nice benefits. All the while she finally reached the city limits and began exiting the city and heading towards where her ship would be able to meet with her, preferably without attracting a lot of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:MEANWHILE: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an underground Federation facility general Marus moved through the hallways. Doors opened upon his approach sensing his ID chip, security personnel likewise allowed him to pass without slowing. His stride carried him to a nearby elevator which he inserted his key card and verified his identity via retinal and DNA scan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the computer verified the generals identity the elevator whirred to life in near silence. The only sound to be heard was the sound of wind rushing by just outside as the transport plunged quickly and quietly to bottom floor of the facility. Here is where the real test would unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarus stepped out from the elevator doors and was immediately greeted by two federation soldiers. Energy Rifles raised and leveld at the generals head.  Behind them stood another two squads flanking to the left and right of the elevator, and still more soldiers positioned about every 20 feet throughout the room. An intense amount of security for a glorified lab chamber, with only one test tube, but not unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, present ID, and please state today's passcode...you have 10 seconds.\" Spoke the nearest soldier no hint of anything but cold professionalism in his voice. The general lifted his Keycard to be scanned, once complete he spoke aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero, Alpha, Alpha, Nine, SR, Zero.\"<br>\r\n'Thank you sir, welcome to X lab. What is the purpose of your visit?\" Inquired the federation soldier his insignia identifying him as a corporal.<br>\r\n\" I need to speak with the doctor, in regards to the project status. He should be expecting me.\" Replied the General No sooner had the general spoke then a short man with pitch black hair like a wire brush stood up and moved away from the central chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes general I know what you're here for. Come this way, everything is ready to proceed assuming proper orders.\" spoke the MD <br>\r\n\"I have your orders but first show me the subject, I need to verify with my own eye's that it is what you claim.\" responded the general, as he and the doctor both moved across the lab back towards a central unit.  A large test tube housing a single amebic looking blob of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it? that's the X parasite?\" Marcus asked, he had seen photo's of the creature but never seen the creature in person, it was eerie, not powerful looking, but it gave the impression of a biological weapon...that is to say deadly but sublime.<br>\r\n\"Yes this is her, permission to execute the operation general?\" the doctor asked a small smile playing over his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no choice, the bounty hunter has become unstoppable. If all information we currently have from the salvaged med pod and the first hand testimonies are correct, she's immune to all forms of energy weaponry.\"<br>\r\n\"So...\" the doctor asked arching and eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reply the general lifted a single silver case. opening it revealed the contents to be a large golden strand of hair. taken from the initial encounter, Samus may have been immune to energy but she was still mostly human. The hair had come loose at some point and contained all the genetic info they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo revive SA-X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I assure you general we have placed sufficient encoding into the creatures genome. It will be under our direct control\" the doctor said as dawned a pair of gloves and gently removed the hair from the container. then looking at it and doing some quick math in his head, he pulled back with a start and turned towards the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, this sample, the report said it was a full strand....but that would make the bounty hunter nearly.....100...no 100 plus feet tall.\" the doctor replied<br>\r\n\"Bigger actually, she left 100 feet in the dust after she practically ate a star cruiser.\" Marcus said, his tone devoid of any humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding the doctor took the sample to central tube. He could now truly appreciate the issue at hand. At first he thought his project had been approved simply because Samus Aran had gone rogue. The reports stated her to be growing, and he figured as part of the metroid vaccine she had received years ago for the BSL station incident her suit had simply become a living organism. But if it truly was her....then this type of size shouldn't be possible. Yet here he stood holding direct proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut questions would come later. The doctor administered the hair sample to the tube and then stepped back and watched. The amorphous blob quickly took in the hair sample, and within moments began to shift its form back and forth. Slowly growing larger, sprouting limbs from four directions, then a stump and short ball on a limb. Quickly the Parasite began to take form, growing to a full size of 6' 3\" humanoid. Then it filled in the details of the creature it was mimicing. its flat chest began to expand outward. Forming two large but well supported breasts. Likewise the forming SA-X began to take shade, skin pigments followed, then actual hair. Finally musculature and and the expansion of its ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally done the newly born SA-X floated in the tube before the doctor, general, and gathered soldiers. It opened its eye's and revealed the pupil-less whites that made up its sensory organ. The only thing the X parasite never seemed to get quite perfect were the eye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unnerving to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay general, it's already genetically pre-programmed, just give it an order.\" the doc said<br>\r\nGeneral Marcus turned to the abomination he had just authorized and spoke clearly and decisively, if he had any fear he certainly wasn't letting into his voice, especially not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awaken SA-X, designation Sax. Your mission is to search out your original and destroy her. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X or Sax responded....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>SA-X stared back at the general for a moment. She could feel the change in her body coming. Something in her mimicked RNA was trying to place a coded signal to obey. Well she didn't need that tying her down. With but a moments effort she destroyed the useless genetic safe proofing the Federation had employed to try and influence her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was however still trapped in a glass tube.  She needed to take stock of her situation. Thinking quickly she closed her eye's as if preparing to respond to the general's questions. But instead searched out this beings capabilities. It was strong for a host, still young, full of life, agile and...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSax looked forward smiling. There in her host's ability was the unique ability to absorb energy and convert it to mass/matter. Even better it seemed to be done in such a way that she could circumvent most restrictions of physics. She only needed ample power, and she could already sense that power all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroy Samus Aran....Of course.\" SA-X replied to the general<br>\r\n\"Excellent, well will prepare some armaments and an escort, what do you believe you will require for this mission.\" the general inquired. He didn't fully trust the SA-X so he wanted to see how it thought and what it felt about being monitored on mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I require?\" SA-X said and smile began to spread across her lips<br>\r\n\"Yes, what resources do you need to accomplish this mission.\" the general replied, maybe Sax was indeed simpler then he originally thought.<br>\r\n\"Power.\" SA-X replied her smile growing inhumanely wide and displaying a set of somewhat to large teeth.<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" The general began but he was cut short as SA-x threw herself at her containment unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X threw her self at the containment unit and its security measures kicked in. Releasing a shock of energy through the whole tube desinged to incapacitate her. Unfortunately for the federation SA-x now possessed Samus' ability to absorb energy. and as teh shock coursed through her, her whole body lit up with pleasure. The gathered soldiers grouped up and trained their weapons on SA-X's containment and watched in bewilderment as the naked form of Samus Aran began to grow. 6 ft became 7...then 8... then 9 feet just from the initial shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, she's been able to override our genetic locks. Oh no, the system....shut it down, shut it down before she...\" but the doctor's cry for action was cut off as Sax threw herself against the containment tube once more this time shattering the safety glass. Stepping out from the tube, the fullly nude SA-X looked around the room, everything around her was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more power. I must have more.\" SA-X stated as she whipped her head back and threw her hair forward. It streched outward modified by her own semi-amorphous genetics and entangled the weapons of the nearby by soldiers. The men never stood a chance most dropped their guns and immediately went for their side arms, but were stopped by a strange sight. Power rushed through SA-X's hair back into her main body. and her entire form lit up for a moment in bright red, making her body nearly translucent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grew<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 9 foot woman/monster hybrid began to expand 10ft, 15, 20....25 feet. She reared her head back and let out a hollow laugh deep and rich with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, I need more, I have to get bigger. I'm going to devour this base, the bounty hunter, the world, and then everything.\" SA-x screamed her voice echoing off the metal halls of the room. Unlike Samus she had zero compulsions about using her power to her benefit. This was what X parasites were meant to do, absorb, grow, multiply and devour. To replace the world with their own perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE, what are you waiting for. FEED ME!\" SA-X screamed becoming Unhinged as she threw her hair out again. This time it latched onto the 20 plus gathered soldiers and she physically drew them into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general and the doctor were both already to the elevator the moment Sax started acting up.<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" demanded the general<br>\r\n\"It looks like she's combined the X's penchant for assimilation with the energy absorption ability.\"<br>\r\n\"English DOC!\"<br>\r\n\"She can eat energy and matter.\"<br>\r\n\"No...no...she'll...she'll be an even larger threat then Miss Aran.\"<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately.\" and the conversation was cut short as the elevator arrived. The two men looked back as SA-X devoured a room full of soldiers. Immediately her body began to grow. 25 feet became 30...35...40....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough. I need MORE!\" SA-x cried frustrated. The power and pleasure of growing was fading. She needed it. Needed to be bigger. She walked over to the nearby control panel and slammed her fists into it. Sparks flew and SA-X fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general and doctor arrived top side of the base and began to run top speed for the emergency exit. All this time shouting to sound the evacuation. Hitting the exit they immediately hopped into a hover jeep and began to speed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" asked the doctor<br>\r\n\"Now we go find Samus. Apologize, and hope she can do the impossible.\" the general replied<br>\r\n\"And that she doesn't kill us...right...right.\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly Doc, that's an acceptable trade if it means the federation will be saved.\" The general said, though he doubted Samus would kill them she was prone to anger, but not rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back inside the base SA-X fed, and fed, and fed. Drawing in more power, growing larger, and larger by the second. Her body slammed into the ceiling and she simply tore into it. Spreading her Hair and arms outward, soaking up energy. Growing from 40 ft to 50, then 55, 60. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, MORE!\" SA-X roared in a mix of lust and hunger. as her growing body destroyed the base around her. suddenly  she felt it, she hit the stations power generator. It wasn't much just a simple fission engine burning through some radioactive isotopes. Practically archaic, but also a lot easier to maintain then a fusion engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X swallowed the reactor whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand with that a flood of power coursed through her. and she grew, and grew, grew, and grew, and grew....60 ft doubled immediately to 120, then in another burst of power 240ft....finally as she was rising from the destruction of the building SA-X roared and literally just began eating the remains of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough!\" MORE! MOOOOREE!\" SA-X screamed as gorged herself on everything around her 240 ft became 300ft....then 350...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>SA-X rose from the destroyed facility that have served as her birthplace. Standing up to her full height of 350 feet tall she looked around at her surroundings. The base was located outside most civilized area's, surrounded by by large hills and few mountains. Then she felt it, the same hunger that had gripped Samus after her first major growth spurt. But SA-X had far less control over her primal urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, so hungry, more power, more food. I need more.\" SA-X cried as she doubled over clutching her stomach. Staring outward she tilted her head up and sniffed into the air. This body wasn't as adept as some the X had mimicked over the years, but it had one thing going for it. She could smell, sense and practically taste the energy nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lip SA-X began to move forwards. Her enormous covered hundreds of feet per step. She quickly crossed the land and came upon her first obstacle. One of the mountains that helped to hide the federation facility. The 1/2 mile tall rock and grass covered impediment was little more then a step to her. She climbed over it, step by step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile far below on small houses across the nearby country side, people looked up to see something terrible. What appeared to be a giant Samus Aran was emerging from the nearby mountain range. The news spread quickly all around the world. It certainly broke as a top story given that there was already an enormous amount of coverage about a near equally naked giant Samus Aran emerging from a nearby city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X continued forward till she came to her target. A power plant, a small metal dome with thousands of wires and relays running in and out of it. This was a proper source of food, she could sense it, and her original host's understanding of such things informed her it was some type of fusion plant. Much stronger then the last energy source she had devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X looked down at the facility and her face split into an enormous smile. Finally she would feed to her hearts content, and grow, and assimilate, and then grow some more, and then keep feeding. After this nothing would stop her. The enormous woman stepped forward and straddled the enormous structure. She was barely able to place one leg on each side of the dome, but this body was flexible, even more so due to her amorphous X nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below the power plant works looked skyward. They had gotten a report earlier today about an enormous Samus Aran, and that all facilities were to be on high alert. While unlikely, the bounty hunter had apparently been exposed to a metroid based bio-weapon and was now seeking energy as ravishly as the alien life suckers them selves. They hadn't thought it to be true, some sort of hacker playing a joke, but news footage had backed up the claim and now...well now their own eye's had confirmed their worst fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men and women watched as 15,000 tons of giant woman descend from the sky above. Her perfect thighs lowered her ass, and woman hood directly onto the building. The structure of course had never been intended to support such weight and surely enough the dome began to buckle and crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X looked down she could practically feel the energy within the dome, coursing outward. She wanted it, NO! She needed it! She began to grind her massive hips and pussy against teh structure wearing it down with every motion. Far below her many people fled for their lives. Still some remained, captivated by her sexual and lavish display of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right, stay there, watch as your goddess feeds, and grows. Enjoy your last moments. EMBRACE ME!\" SA-X roared as she ground herself harder and harder into the structure. Finally it gave way, and her enormous crotch came crashing down onto everything inside, including the reactor. Alarms blared, and evacuation notices sounded at every corner, but it didn't matter. SA-X's pussy had made direct contact with the fusion reactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY FUCKING GOD!\" YES, YESSS, MORE!\" SA-X roared as her whole body lit up in power and pleasure. It course through her pussy right up her hips and into her chest, then her mind and down every extremity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCKING MORE, MORE, MORREEEE!\" She screamed absolutely ravenous as her size began to increase and fast. Her growth was explosive destroying everything around her. 350 feet gave way 400 feet, then 500....and SA-X moans of ecstasy increased. 600ft, she continued to grind the building below her now only half her size into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, Harder, Bigger, BIGGER!\" She screamed and more and more power came to her. within moments her vagina had grown large enough to devour entire fusion core. 42 feet of minuature sun was trapped inside her....and then it went critical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...wha...oh yes...yes, yes...I LOVE IT. More!! Oh God MORE, MORE!!! Fuck YEsSsS MooOOREE!!\" SA-X roared, her shouts shattered the sound barrier as her growth sped up and she reached critical mass. Her orgasmic screams tore through the country side....when all was said and done SA-X had become....</span></div></div>",

It was quite possibly the single best experience of her life so far. Though the view before her was close second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the country side for miles from her perspective. The last moments of her previous romp with the power plant had provided her unimaginable power and pleasure, and she now gazed down upon the land from her towering stature. From 2 miles up the world was so insignificant, people were insects, not even worth being food anymore to her. Entire cities were small gray carpets, filled sparkling lights and life. More importantly they were the nearest source of power. and she needed power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause even at a towering 2 miles, SA-X had not had enough. Far from it she wanted more. Much, much more. She wanted to grow, and cum, and grow some more. Devour everything before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will all be mine.\" SA-X declared as she rose to her full height and headed for the nearest city that still possessed power. probably some 40-120 miles away or for her, a short walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile far across the country side. Samus had rendezvoused with her ship as was currently going over her current state. thank chozo the zero suit expanded with her and could project a holo display otherwise she wouldn't have been able to make out a thing from the medical computer's readout. As she scrolled through her results she had her ships computer to notify her of any breaking news reports containing info regarding her. Stuff, like Samus, Aran, Military dispatched, Giantess, and another dozen or so tags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne can imagine her surprise when information was dumped onto her holo-screen by her ship's computer detailing the attack by samus on a nearby city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not attack, a city, I may have attacked an unusual number or trigger happy federation soldiers in the city but this...this is.. just...wait...what?\" Samus started but stopped when she got the details. Samus Aran now infamous bounty hunter strikes down local power grid, 2 mile tall apocalypse on route to destroy East City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, thats not me. Computer! I want an anaylsis of these events and notable incidents.\" her ship whirred in response and suddenly turned left and began sampling the atmosphere.<br>\r\n\"Umm computer I said events, not...wait what's this.\" She said looking down at the display. Samus had long ago configured the systems on her ship to note the detection of certain elements and bio-signs. Phazon, Metroids, X parasites, space pirates, Chozo tech ect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, can't be....that's SA-X's signature...but she's oh god.\" Samus said as she read the report from her machine. SA-X was alive and growing, a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fuck me. Fine I guess we're doing this now. I swear it never rains it only pours.\" Samus said, looking across the country side she could already see SA-X the creature had become enormous. A tower mega monstrosity, and in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF course she's nude, why wouldn't she be...chozo dammit, this will never die now that it hit the web.\" Samus said as anger started to fill her. Not only did she not like the idea of throwing down with SA-X again. She was pissed that it was besmirching her good reputation....okay her semi-decent reputation, killing planets does tend to ding your good guy rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reached outward to her ship and opened her hand. then sent a command from her holo-display. teh ship immediately deposited a dozen adn half power bombs into her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay time to fix this.\" Samus said, only slightly hesistant, these bombs were essentially mini-nukes, this was going to....well honestly it was probably going to feel great. but still that didn't mean she wanted to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus threw the payload of power bombs into her mouth, all save for one that bounced off her chin and toppled into her massive chest. Then her body lit up in pleasure and she expanded in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, Oh, Ah, AH, FUCK YES that feels so damn GOOOOODDD!\" Samus screamed, as her whole body began to rise upward, 300 feet became 400...500...600....700....then in a sudden burst her body practically exploded with energy and her form raced towards the heavens....800ft....1,2000.....2,400....3,000....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OH GOD, need to stop...need....need....more, MORE, MOOORRRE!\" Samus screamed as her form continued to rise higher and higher. She had meant to wind up about 2 miles tall just big enough to rival SA-X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have over done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Samus realized she had over shot the power requirement. But then again, 2 miles would have been a fair fight....5 miles on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this will work. Hell why fight fair at this point. I need to end this quickly....wait why does my chest feel warm.\" Samus looked down and the one power bomb that she didn't eat had found its way into her cleavage. It chose now to detonate. Samus watched in shock as her already massive D cups blossomed outward. Her breasts ate up the nuclear power like candy, and promptly grew larger, and larger, straining the already tight zero suit even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit had never left much to the imagination, but now over her DD sized chest it was all but see through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever...fix it later...or not.\" Samus said semi-playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to confront SA-X<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus ran across the country side, her enormous steps left craters on impact. When a 5 miles tall woman goes full speed across the land the effects can be felt for miles. Thunder sounded from her charge, and the very world shook all around her. But it was worth it, she made it to SA-X in record time. Her holo-display indicated she had reached her objective covering 300 miles in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that's where the good news ended. Samus came upon SA-X who apparently remained ignorant of her approach. A seeming impossible feat. After all, what on earth could ignore a super sized 5 mile tall busty blonde super giantess coming at you at top speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the answer was a 20 mile tall giga sized giantess. Samus slowed her approached as she closed with SA-X. She couldn't believe her eyes. She new SA-X lacked inhibitions but she didn't think the monstrosity would be able to get that big, let alone so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got right up to the sitting SA-X's ass, and stared upward. She was huge, she was towering over Samus while sitting. Causally draining the nearby metropolis of its power. Samus peered around the larger woman's thigh and saw anger etched onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough, I need more. More Dammit! More, more power, I want to be bigger!\" SA-X was screaming at the city all around her. She was easily nearly 1/10 the size of city and power was flowing out of the city directly into her body. streams of energy flowed into her body, and her whole form shook and glowed from the power coming in. But she wasn't getting any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not enough, I'm not big enough. MORE! I need to GROW!'' SA-X roared as she stood up. and Samus realized she might have a harder fight then she thought on her hands. SA-X was prepared to start rampaging when a blue beam fell from the sky. It slammed her form and froze the area along her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGHH!\" screamed the monster as she fell to the ground. Looking around for the source she finally saw Samus. She was about to take revenge, she didn't know how the bounty hunter had done that, but she knew she was smaller then her. SA-X also knew she had to stop samus while she had the advantage, if she waited the hunter would no doubt somehow turn the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs SA-X rose up again, adn prepared to attack a second beam fell from the sky. This time a plasma shot, normally it could be absorbed by either woman, but it struck the iced flesh of SA-X and her body shattered. Screaming in pain SA-X faltered backwards, and her whole form<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched as SA-X lost mass dwindling from 20 miles to 16. Finally the cavalry was being good for something. That was no doubt a pair of federation satellites laying down damage. A few more well placed shots and Samus would be able to bring SA-X down, she already knew how to destroy the parasite, it just seemed a near impossible task upon arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X looked skyward as a second Ice beam slammed into her stomach. Recoiling in horror she began to stand again, but she saw samus smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it. STOP IT! Not again, you won't stop me again! IF Nothing else you DIE HERE!\" Roared the still massive SA-X as she lunged forward and tried to grab Samus. But this was far from Samus's first fight. She was ready and as SA-X came lunging forward she lept towards her much larger attacker. Landing on the 16 mile tall womans arm she kicked off her and launched herself back into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Samus hadn't accounted for was that her jump would carry her straight into the plasm beam from the second satellite. Heat swarmed her body and Samus felt it happening again. That pure sensation of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X shook the ice from her chest. her breasts bouncing as she did, the sound of thunder rolling through skies as her enormous jugs collided with each other. She knew she couldn't afford to leave that ice on her. The enemy had figured out a way to hurt her. This was serious. As she turned to face her opponent, she had a plan, she just had to lure Samus into an ice beam, at her pitiful size the shot would destroy her in one blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X turned and was about to enact her plan when her she came face to face with a giant pink wall. That hadn't been here before. What had they erected a freaking force field now to keep her in place. Oh crap what if they had...she was too big to dodge, if she didn't have room to move and run for miles she'd be killed in quick order. Looking left and right and saw she was indeed surrounded on all sides by some type of pale wall. actually it looked quite familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen realization struck SA-X<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,no,no NO NO!\" SA-X cried as she cranked her head back looked upward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere towering above her, having absorbed a full blast of the satellite cannon's plasma was the original Samus Aran. The sexy blond bounty hunter towered over her even while laying completely supine. SA-X could barely make out the top of Samus' enormous womanhood. Still she had to know, she lept with all her might and then when that wasn't enough, morphed her hair prehensile wise to climb atop. When she reached the top of the enormous mountain of pink she was greeted with  15 mile wide smile...attached to a 400 mile goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playtime's over SA-X you lose.\" Samus said and reached for the smaller woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus reached down and picked up the \"small\" SA-X. the creature should have dodged, but instead it seemed frozen in place. Samus had seen this before, once in a while X parasites would freeze in place before attacking, often when their mortality was made apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X on the other hand simply stood there, the color drained from her face as she watched the hunter bend forward and garb her with ease. It wasn't fair, how did she get so lucky. She wasn't even trying. SA-X was feeding and absorbing as much as possible and she still got outplayed by her inferior.  Just look at her she was weaker in every way clearly. She was....okay bigger, yes, but she physically she was...and it was the first time SA-X noticed some key differences. Samus's size wasn't the only difference between them. SA-X's breasts were her hosts standard size, but Samus was much much larger. Literally larger then the biggest mountains. At 20 miles each they were mountains in their own right. As SA-X was lifted into the air she watched the enormous landscape so Samus pass beneath her, she was more tone too, her muscles still supple but definitely there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X realized that the hunter had molded herself differently...was that the secret, had Samus actually willing choose this form. Focusing her efforts in certain area's to become the ultimate life form? A perfect specimen? SA-X didn't think she was that type of being. She knew her own drive to be everything and perfect was a real thing, but it was her right....not a product of Samus's genetics...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus lifted SA-X to her face and the parasite stared at those huge deep blue eye's, and fear crept into its heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay no more you. This has gone on long enough, but you might be the key to undoing this. X's can gain and lose mass....and I kinda need to lose some mass.\" Samus said staring at the X clone of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" SA-X replied<br>\r\n\"Listen I don't expect you to understand but I don't want to be this big.\" Samus explained <br>\r\n\"Well duh, clearly you want to be bigger. I get it. I want to be bigger too.\" SA-X reasoned to samus, not even sure why she was talking she knew it wouldn't do any good.<br>\r\n\"Wha...NO I want to be smaller, I don't want to be a huge...chozo only knows how many tons....woman.\" Samus said becoming annoyed with the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X thought carefully for a minute, it was clear something had not gone according to Samus's plan but what. She was bigger...was something about her size misplaced? She mentioned weight, SA-X probed her host's absorbed memories...looking for something to answer this situation to understand. Then she had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're worried about your weight?\"SA-X asked innocently as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus Glared. Okay yep that was positive, but why...then SA-X understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, OH OH!\" SA-X began to cry, this was fun, it never had a chance to explore its own mental capabilities, being sentient was a treat. But now she knew what to do, she had come to the...or an answer to her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you finally figure something out.\" Samus asked somewhat bored, but mostly angry<br>\r\n\"Yes i get it, the bigger you get the more energy it takes to GROW!\" SA-X shouted <br>\r\n\"OH, Uh no not exactly I..\" But somehow the tiny 16 mile X clone managed to cut off Samus, impressive considering every time Samus spoke the sound barrier shattered.<br>\r\n\"Of course it makes sense, stay small, absorb as much energy as possible. Then you can maintain maximum saturation of your cells. Then you could get...big...like really big....yeah...\" SA-X explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was going to cut off the little rambler but then a thought occurred. SA-X intrinsically understood size and growth. If she could get her to reveal the secrets of such things, even lightly, she could figure out how to control this new power of hers. Hopefully before she out grew the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Yeah, I was hoping for maximum....control, but I need to undo it, go back and..try again.\" Samus lied to the SA-X<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE! that makes sense to go from a larger state you'd need a huge source of power! But if you start at max saturation of your cells you could then grow, and keep feeding them. maintaining the maximum. That's why you made your breasts so large right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I what...well, I mean..\" Samus was going to explain her increased bust was a side effect from one to many trigger happy idiots...and her own misluck.<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, that tissue around your chest is deliciously dense. You can cram a lot of power in there and use them to regulate the flow of power to other cells.\" SA-X chattered, then stopped speaking and stared at her own chest. Blinking she then began to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched as the breast's of the SA-X standing in the palm of her hand began to change. They grew, no power required, they simply grew, bigger, and bigger, and bigger. C-cup gave way to D, E, F....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh thats probably, yes thank you for the example. But...\" SA-X's chest continued to grow...G cups<br>\r\n\"That's enough, SA-X, it doesn't matter, you're going on ice so we can figure out how to undo this.\" Samus said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally SA-X stopped adjusting her bust. G cups...they would do, bigger could be better but for now she needed to conserve some mass. Then she looked up at Samus, and simply sat down accepting her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get it. I lost.\" SA-X spoke with a hint of sadness<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Samus asked quirking one enormous eyebrow<br>\r\n\"Can't win, done fighting go ahead put me up there.\" SA-X said. Samus wasn't sure what here game was but she knew she still needed the creature defeated. So Samus finally sat up fully and rose to her full height. All around the world people stared skyward. From almost anywhere on half the planet you could see the enormous woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus raised teh SA-X skyward, then realized she was so tall she literally could see the high orbiting satellite, it wasn't even eye level. It was actually chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her holo-display lit up, a message from the federation. Stand down, allow us to freeze X. then prepare for relocation.<br>\r\n\"Re-location?\" Samus said activating her voice to text module, so she could communicate with the federation.<br>\r\nThe holo-diplay relayed the federations reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-your weight is a threat to the planet, you could accidentally throw off the orbit or destroy continents. Just by sitting down.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, I think they're implying you have a fat ass. funny they didn't mention your breasts....idiots missed the whole point didn't they.\" SA-X said and looked up at Samus....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus</span></div></div>",

Taking step forward, sending cracks spindling throughout the planet below her. The federation satellite immediately began moving in response, and sent out another message.  Samus didn't even bother reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS ALL STARTED WHEN YOU IDIOTS WOULDN'T LISTEN, JUST DON'T SHOOT ME HOW FUCKING HARD IS THAT...HUH HUH!\" Samus roared and swung her hands out grabbing the satellite and shaking it viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile SA-X went flying...Loosed from Samus's grasp she was flung into the cold void of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FREAKING FOOLS DID THIS TO ME!\"Samus continued to rant tearing the 75 mile super station apart.<br>\r\n\"LOOK AT ME! AM I FREAK! AM I GODDESS!\" Samus continued to tear the satellite apart when a blast of plasma hit her from behind. The federation if nothing else was a well funded organization.

She knew it, it was just too much to believe things might get better. She really didn't want to turn around, she knew what was there. if she didn't turn around maybe it wouldn't exist...maybe if she just closed her eye's and opened them again she would wake up in her bed aboard her gunship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe space pirates would save christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned around despite knowing what she saw would be nothing but bad news. What she didn't know was just how bad that news would be. She looked ahead, and saw...a wall...a peach colored wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, that can't be good....\" Samus said as she raised her head to look upward. Something she hadn't had to do in quite some time given her recent growth spurts. She looked up, and up, and up, and up, and up and up. Only to see to massive nearly perfect round orbs, suspended in zero gravity, attached to largest woman she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X's form eclipsed the world, and Samus easily. Her enormous form hovered in space and Samus could see something else around her. Breast's each as large as a star, legs that could stretch from mercury to earth, and a vagina that could devour the entire federation and have parsecs to spare. Worse Samus saw things in motion around the cosmic sized SA-X, Saturn....the planet was orbiting the massive X clone of her, as well as a few other notable planets. SA-X was holding the solar system in her orbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what did you do?\" Samus asked as she gazed at SA-X's massive godly form. She was a new definition of big. Samus was twice the size of earth. SA-X....she couldn't even see SA-X's face due to her massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DID WHAT YOU KNEW WAS BEST. I FOUND A SOURCE OF ENERGY AND MAXED OUT MY CELLS. IT LET ME GET...BIG....REALLY BIG.\" SA-X replied and slowly began to bend over so Samus could see her enormous smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...where?! Where did you....wait....no...\"Samus said as she realized what must have happened.<br>\r\n\"OH YES, YES I DID, AND IT WAS AMAZING!\" SA-X replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's mind began to race, how did she deal with this. How?! How did she even begin to go about stopping someone the size of a solar system. Before she could speak SA-X spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY IT?\" Came SA-X's playful reply as she quirked and eyebrow and continued to smile.<br>\r\n\"Would i....like..to...wait what..?\" Samus said, her brain not quite comprehending what just happened<br>\r\nSA-X was a X parasite, an apex predator with no equal and no concern for other life...why had it just asked that. Was she being cruel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY IT?\" SA-X repeated herself and then she craned her head back and whipped her hair forward the massive strands became amorphous and stretched far longer then should have been possible. Wrapping around the nearest star, goodness only knows how many light years away. and Bringing it back to Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I UNDERSTAND NOW, BUT YOU GOT CAUGHT UP BY THE FEDERATION, THATS WHY YOU THREW ME AT THE STAR. I'M SORRY I TRIED TO ABSORB YOU EARLIER. I THOUGHT YOU WERE A THREAT TO MY KIND, BUT CLEARLY YOU HAVE THE SAME GOAL AS US, BECOME THE ULTIMATE LIFEFORM.\" SA-X said offering Samus the star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's warped mind thought Samus was it's ally. Samus couldn't believe her luck, she could take the star and undo the problem...maybe...but then again should she take that kind of power? Was it justified, if she didn't if she rejected SA-X its likely that creature would simply destroy her. But if she took it, fought SA-X on that level...the conflict could destroy the star system....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus.... </span></div></div>",

Breasts that could have destroyed the solar system stopped Samus from using any information other then the lunatic smile she got a glimpse of when SA-X had intentionally bent over to make its offer to feed her enough energy to out grow most of the solar system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the creatures body language was a sure clue to its intentions...but Samus knew...She knew no one should have that kind of power, it was too damn tempting to abuse. So despite the correct thing to do probably being to accept the offer and Reign in SA-X's by force. She was going to have to refuse and appease herself to the creatures new found reason. Hoping that just maybe intellect would win out over instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SA-X, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-ZZZZTTTT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's attempt was interrupted by the sound of plasma fire from a federation satellite. Normally that wouldn't even phase her at her current size, but the beam had been fired directly on her. Samus turned her head to glare at the tiny 75 mile long vessel, when she suddenly felt the sweet warm sensation of growth again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation immediately turned to bewilderment as it didn't leave her ass. Looking down she saw a single scorch mark in her zero suit right over her left ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no...no don't you dare tell me.\" Samus whispered but at her size it came out quite clearly. SA-X inclined its head downward again to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly Samus's already plump ass expanded outward. Stretching the zero suit to its absolute limit. Samus watched with flushed cheeks as her already massive rear grew, and grew...and grew some more. Till without warning, the it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-rrrriiiipppp-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus had watched the whole thing. Watched as her ass grew beyond reason, watched as her suit strained and became practically see through. Watched as a piece of Chozo tech designed to handle light plasma fire finally met its limit. Bearing her ass to world at large. A world she had deliberately left intact because she was a good person dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the holo-display on her arm lit up. The title \"New gravity well from ASS-tronimcally large object threatens planet. The weight of this situation may be to much for Earth to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Samus snapped. The entire days insults about her weight, her ass, her size, and everything else came flooding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"OooOOOHHHH.\"</font> Came SA-X's booming voice as she watched the tiny hunter slowly begin to parse out her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me with it.\" Samus said looking up at SA-X<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"....WHAT?\"</font> SA-X replied, it still didn't quite understand subtext and metaphorical implications<br>\r\n\"The DAMN SUN! give it to me! Feed ME! Make me BIGGER!\" Samus roared<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">''YOU, YOU AGREE?!''</font> SA-X shouted excitement filing her eye's mouth widening into a smile.<br>\r\n\"YES! Make me the BIGGEST damn thing EVER!! I want to GROW, and feed, and destroy, and GROW! DO IT I accept you offer. MAKE ME A GODDESS!!\" Samus began to ran and rave loosing control of the delicate temper she had managed to keep in check the entire day, through shootings, growing, being cloned by the X, fighting, growing, and getting shot some more. It all fell apart as the planetary sized blond bombshell began waving her arms and screaming at the top of her lungs for power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X was delighted. A huge smile spread across her entire face, showing far to much teeth. The smile filled her entire face in a not entirely human way, a way that could only be done by a creature whose natural formed allowed for such blending of physical features. Then stretching its Tendrils/hair out the Massive Solar system Dwarfing SA-X reached out and granted Samus's demand to join her and rule as a perfect example of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X didn't hit Samus with one star, no she gathered a dozen from nearby systems of varying sizes and crammed them all together and then doused the tiny Samus Aran in fire and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus gasped as the overwhelming large amount of plasma and heat engulfed her. She knew that absorbing energy could be painfull, but she didn't expect it to fell so.....good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus let out scream after scream of ecstasy as her whole body bucked with pleasure. Amidst the enormous sphere of flame, her own form barley a pin prick of a shadow began to quaver and shift. Power and pleasure overwhelmed her, but she held it in check. She resisted growing for as long as she could, to make sure she absolutely maximized her potential growth spurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grew...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>SA-X watched as the tiny form of Samus Aran, most feared bounty hunter in the universe, began to grow within the giant ball of fire she had brought to her. It was nice to watch. from SA-X's point of view, as a being so large she now held the solar system in check with her gravity, watching the comparatively small planet sized woman float around her engulfed in flame was both fulfilling and entertaining. As far as SA-X had known, no one had ever bested Samus Aran, and as she had her hosts memories she knew dam well that was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut far below her hovering just below her navel the sphere of fire began to gradually shrink. Its mass and power absorbed by the real Samus Aran in turn to become fuel for her growth. and dim shadow within the sphere began to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH, here it comes! I wonder if she took my advice to store extra power in her chest...or maybe she's gonna put that ass to use....or what if...\" SA-X was rambling to herself while she watched the tiny Samus begin to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:Meanwhile on a federation satellite:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, its worse then we thought, all this time we've been trying to contain the bounty hunter, so this wouldn't happen but now its here. She's absorbed enough energy to overload her cells...and at the worst possible size.\" Came a bridge lieutenants report<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain of the vessel stared out into space, then back to the general and black ops scientist who had brought them the warning that they needed to help stop SA-X or Samus aran would RISE to the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd rise she did, the captain looked out the view screen, as the massive woman who had once been engulfed in flame now stood before them. Her head turned back to look over her shoulder and she simply smiled. Then she grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe federation space armada was treated to the sight of Samus Aran and her giga sized booty, and as leaned forward and thrusted her massive ass outward she grew, and grew, and grew. Until her her perfectly curved cheeks were the only things the view screen on station could display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the screens.\" that captain said calmly<br>\r\n\"But Sir.\"<br>\r\n\"I want to see just how bad it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view screen dropped and the blast doors on the satellite opened. normally most objects were to small to be seen without the aide of enhancing technology. In this case all that could be witnessed was an enormous Ass, continually expanding outward threatening to consume everything in its path. <br>\r\n                                                                                      .........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked around as the fire subsided, she was growing, and it felt so damn good. She didn't want to stop, she never wanted this feeling to stop. She looked upward as SA-X's form came into view. She had started her growth spurt barely the size of grain a sand before the monstrous impostor. Now she was nearly a tenth SA-X's size, and her growth was only picking up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom high above SA-X looked down on the doll sized Samus. She watched as Samus expanded outward in every direction. going from a 1/10 her size...to 1/5...to nearly half her size. Samus's growth had finally kicked into full gear, and the growing sexy bounty hunter was now doubling in size every few moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X stared still smiling as the hunter reached the same size as her. Now two cosmic sized Samus Aran's held the entirety of local system within their gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Samus got even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X watched as Samus's body continued to expand. The huge smile on her face dimmed a little as she watched the hunter rise above her. Then she found herself face to face with Samus's enormous breasts. For one brief moment she found herself tempted. As an X she didn't really have anything like a sex drive, but at the same time she intimately understood the overwhelming urge to reproduce. All this was quickly overshadowed as Samus's massive form continued to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on SA-X's face quickly vanished as she looked upward, Samus was now twice her size. Worse she wasn't showing any signs of her growth slowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything it was getting stronger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X watched as a view of solar sized tits, became one of a well toned set of abs. Then quickly  was replaced by an absolutely overwhelming vagina. A woman hood so large it could consume entire star systems...could consume SA-X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down from on high, she could no longer make out SA-X the enormous star crushing F-cups she now possessed for breasts. Bending over at the waist, she was able to bring the now insignificant sized SA-X into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X trembled before the enormous hunter. This was her idea, but she had forgotten about that primitive emotion tied to survival...FEAR. The hunter had been terrifying when she was a normal human, armed only in chozo tech. At this size, she was a  actual living breathing nightmare, neither phaze, nor pirate, nor X in their wildest dreams had ever imagined they'd face this kind of threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"SO, I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY MEAN TO MAKE ME QUITE THIS BIG.\"</font> Came the rumbling voice of Samus, the force of it able to echo through space literally carrying atmosphere in the direction she wished to speak by sheer force alone.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, no...well..ye-..uhhh\" SA-X began to stutter having trouble forming thoughts<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"WELL ANSWER ME TINY, WAS THIS ON PURPOSE?\"</font> Samus asked again a little less playfully<br>\r\n\"Uh,yes, YES, of course it was! Look at you you're beautiful, and big, and beautiful, and huge. You're breast's do more for this galaxy now then the stars ever did and you ass, just....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus glared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ass, is perfectly shaped and not all fat.\" SA-X concluded in a very small whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down and realized she had a decision to make, do what she was supposed to, that is save the federation from its own idiocy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, rule alongside SA-X.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus looked at SA-X for a moment. Then back to the federation forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it she thought. Let's see  how this plays out. And with that thought Samus turned back to SA-X and smiled. SA-X for her part wasn't sure what to make of the smile. Seriously why did creatures keep trying to interact with her using body language and non-direct communication, did they not get how hard this was, she was a parasite shapeshifter. Nothing about that description magically endows an understanding of culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO YOU DID THIS ON PURPOSE?\" Samus asked as she floated slightly away from SA-X and then using both hands cupped her massive breasts together. The amount of cleavage created by the action was staggering and even SA-X's brain had to take a moment to sort instinct, from higher thought.  It might seem fun to hurl herself into that massive chest that made the stars look tiny, but it would not likely be conducive to long term survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-ye-Yes, well actually if you recall I said you should have made those bigger....like these\" SA-X commented bringing her arms together and pressing her ample G-cups together. It may not have been quite the same effect but technically SA-X was proportionately larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down in surprise....<br>\r\n\"HA, YES, YES YOU DID DIDN'T YOU?\" she replied a beat later. And then turned around and displayed her full rounded ass to SA-X. Then with a motion that sent asteroids hurtling away from her orbit by sheer force Samus brought down one enormous hand slapped her own ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact rocked SA-X backwards and her eye's went wide.<br>\r\n\"AND WHAT ABOUT THIS!?\" Samus inquired.<br>\r\n\"That was the federation's fault! Though it could be more like this.\" SA-X replied turning her own body around and began to twerk her massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared in shock, and then awe as with each shake SA-X's ass began to expand outward. <br>\r\n\"HMMM CUTE, AND IMPRESSIVE BUT I CAN'T REALY SEE IT.\" Samus responded,her growth had never actually stopped and she now loomed over SA-X, at over 100 times her size.<br>\r\n\"LET'S FIX THAT SHALL WE? I HOPE YOUR HUNGRY! CAUSE I WANNA SEE A SEXY, GALAXY DESTORYING TWERK FEST YOU LITTLE SLUT!\" Samus said as she reached out towards space and began gathering up stars....lots of stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not SMALL, I can eat suns as a snack! I burn more calories blinking then consuming a planet would net me!\" Shouted back the now somewhat indignant SA-X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, SO YOU'RE HAPPY, YOU DON'T WANT THESE?\" Samus asked and SA-X'S jaw practically unhinged and fell to her knees. Samus had gathered up thousands of stars and somehow drawn in a few hundred small nebula together into a huge ball of power. Pulsing with various colors of lightning and fire.<br>\r\n\"I..i...i..\" was SA-X could get out between drolling and and her body screaming that she needed to feed, on that..right now.<br>\r\n\"YOU GONNA GIVE ME SHOW, PLAY NICE AND HELP ME BECOME  EVEN BIGGER? OR SHOULD I JUST TAKE THIS FOR MYSELF?\" Samus asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,YES! GIMMIE! Anything you want, please, PLEASE just feed me, feed me, FEEEEDDDD MEEEEE!\"SA-X Started screaming as she slowly started racing up Samus's massive form. At somewhere around 200 times her size SA-x had wound up glued to hunters gravity and standing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">ALL YOURS, EAT UP TINY!\"</font> Samus roared as she hurled the massive sphere nearly as large as she was towards SA-X.<br>\r\n\"MIIINEE!\" Screamed Sa-x, as she lept forward<br>\r\n\"AND DON'T FORGET MY SHOW!\" Samus added as she waited to see just how big SA-X would become.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus watched as Sa-x lept into the giant ball of energy. She then floated back and looked around. She could see the federation armada assembling as tiny little dots and fleeing for deep space. Speaking of deep space Samus's growth had finally stoped and she could see for lightyears. She could actually  make our the huge swirls of the milky way galaxy. Now that was big, she thought, plenty of power and stars to feed on and share. Time to talk and teach Sa-x what's important. Yes once they devoured a galaxy surely no one would fuck with them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fucking gawd, YES!\" Came a ragged half hoarse shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned around again, and holy crap. Sa-x had already devoured the entire sphere, that thing had been over 200 times her size...after Samus had condensed it from what she had gathered. She thought it would take the X parasite at least a few minutes to devour it. Just how ravenous was the copy of her. And how much of it was X instinct and how much was copied instinct from her own gene's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tiny. How does it feel? Anything to say?\" Samus asked being down and cupping Sa-x in her hands. Pulling her up to eye level and leaving her floating there at chest height so she could keep track of the little parasites growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x wanted heavily and then smiled. She finally for a brief moment was satisfied. Then she felt it, heat, wondrous wondrous heat. The pleasure ceneter of Sa-x's mind lit up and she felt her growth spurt coming on. And she knew, she just knew how big she was going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're in for a BIG show.\" Sa-x said lust and need flowing into her voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Samus said but was greeted to Sa-x turning around and begging to,....twerk.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no Sa-x, that was humor, you don't have.....to...to....uhh\" Samus began to explain to Sa-x before her voice failed her. Before her Sa-x twerked her ass, once, and her growth erupted, going from the size of a small coin, to nearly 1/4 Samus's size. In one twerk the blond sexier proportioned clone of her had grown nearly 50 times larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sa-x did it again. Her round ass lifted and fell moved by muscles that could crush a billion earths easy. And Sa-x grew to nearly half Samus's size. The next twerk equalized the size between the two enormous women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus however, from having put Sa-x at nearly eye level, was not staring her equal face to face but instead at an enormus naked ass. Techincslly her ass, but a bit thicker and a pussy that was just... perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sa-x, you need to move that before....Before.\"<br>\r\n\"KISS ME, kiss, kiss! \" Sa-x shouted  wiggling her enormous but left and right.<br>\r\n\"What, I?...Sa-\"<br>\r\n\"KISS MY ASS!!\" Sa-x roared and slammed her woman good into Samus's face Samus blushed and tried to push Sa-x off but her copy was just to big. So she expediated her solution, and gently kissed Sa-x's womanhood. Sinking her lips deep into Sa-x  and pushing her tounge lightly into Sa-x.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x screamed. Oh holy fuck. So that's why her instincts kept insisting on this part of her anatomy being used. That was great. She needed more. But with Samus, and while growing.....And feeding....but first she needed to do what she meant too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There happy?\" Samus asked and then watched as Sa-x pulled forward and began to twerk again.<br>\r\n\"Wait aren't you done?\" Samus asked but Sa-x answered the question by simply working her ass in rhythmic motion faster then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with each twerk she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared in horror as Sa-x doubled in size,  Now twice her size, it happened again, and again, and again. Sa-x was already 8 times her size. And still she grew, twerking harder and faster, her ass expanded in every direction, and her body began growing even faster, tripling in size, then quadrupling. Sa-x got to over  100 times Samus's size and began to witness as the galaxy came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her growth exploded. Each twerk added 20 times her size, then 100 times! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched in shock Sa-x was quickly approaching the size of the galaxy.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x, stop!\" Samus screamed as Sa-x's enormous ass came down again, blasting out a hole in the surrounding galaxy equal to nearly 10% the celestial objects mass.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"STOP! NO! MORE, SA-X GET BIGGER, TWERK HARDER, GROW MORE!\"</font> Sa-x roared as her eye's went wide filled with lust and hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sa-x continued to work her money maker and grew 1,000 times her size per twerk for about 20 shakes. Her body rushed outward in every direction, her enormous breasts plowed through star systems by the thousands.  Her expanding pussy would have destroyed a good chunk of the milky way except that her growth happened so fast the galaxy was forced away by the sheer gravity of her now galactic sized was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she twerked, giving Samus the show of her life, or it would be if Samus could see anything other the  an enormous flesh colored wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x's body finally reached its climax. And over the last minute she went from galaxy sized ass, to galaxy devouring pussy. Then a galaxy size clitorus, and finally as her whole body rumbled Samus heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"Yes, YES! Here it COMES! OH GOD MORE! IT WILL ALL BE MINE! MINE! BIGGER C'MON BODY! GROW, GROOOWWW!\"</font><br>\r\nSa-x roared as her body grew one last time her breasts obscured all vision of her face as they pushed out another cup size, and her ass rumbled outward sending waves of force outward scattering nearby nebula's to nothing. At her crotch, hovering not in front of her pussy but in front of a single pubic hair was the entire galaxy. Barely 1/10,000 it's size, and entire galaxy was now a microbe and somewhere inside it Samus looked up with utter fear on her face...there was no stopping Sa-x now...</span></div></div>",

She had fed Sa-x with the intent of making her big enough to chat and respect each other, then maybe re-arrange the galactic federation till life accepted their new rule. Instead she had created a goddess. A power mad clone of herself with almost zero inhibitions. Whose current size was impossible to pin down, but if the blond shade of the sky were an indicator then Sa-x could causally wipe out all known galactic civilizations simply by moving the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh chozo what have I done?\" Samus said as she moved forward, she walked along the \"ground\" the same color as her own hair till she reached an enormous Cliffside. <br>\r\n\"Maybe it's not as bad as it seems...maybe I can....\" Samus thought aloud but her thoughts stopped short when she beheld the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape below the cliff changed, into an ungodly sized pink land mass a top what could only be called celestial trench. She was staring at Sa-x's womanhood in all here exposed glory and it was humbling and terrifying. Even worse Samus saw lights, swirling masses of light and power, galactic super clusters, normally composed of tens of thousands of galaxies each were gathered above the massive universe devouring vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the chozo, it'll barely even register to her, oh no, it won't she probably doesn't even know whats happening.\"  Samus wondered aloud as she bore witness to what would be the end of the universe. It was all being drawn in towards Sa-x's goddesshood. In a few moments all creation would quite literally be fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"OH I KNOW WHATS HAPPENING\"</b></font> Came an absolute voice, so powerful Samus more felt it then she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned and looked behind her. There low and behold was Sa-x's smiling face. The devourer of the universe had sat up partially and was holding down her bosom with one arm. A bosom Samus noted that had grown even larger since last time, not that it mattered, all creation couldn't even fill one of her celestial breasts, trying to passing a cup size relative to the now goddess's body was semantics at their worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said it was H, Samus couldn't help but think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Sa-x, umm we kinda need to talk, you're about to do something terrible.\" Samus said and noted her voice was quivering. She would say she had no fear, but she never had to star down something that big, let alone in the image of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"> \"OH THIS IS NO MISTAKE, IT'S JUST WHAT ITS GONNA TAKE.\" </font></b> Sa-x replied again her voice shaking the foundation on which Samus stood.<br>\r\n\"But Sa-x please, it's not enough, surely you can see that.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sa-x did next surprised Samus, the massive creature went wide eye's and looked at all creation gathering before her crotch. Puzzled she tilted her to one side and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"NOT ENOUGH? BUT YOU, REALLY? O-OKAY IF THATS WHAT YOU THINK...I..YEAH I CAN FIX IT, BUT....WOW....JUST....WOW\"</font></b> Sa-x replied nervousness entering her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was confused, and then she watched as Sa-x leaned forward and placed her breasts in front of all creation.<br>\r\n\"No wait, X, stop not like this at least give them a....\" but Samus was cut off as Sa-x gripped her tits between both hands and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was sure she was going to titty fuck reality into oblivion, I stead Sa-x squeezed her chest and poured out milk. Milk composed of X parasites that quickly swarmed reality and then replicated it. Hundreds of times over, then thousands, then millions finally trillions. When all was said and done the \"universe\" had been increased, the mass of light and power before Samus and X was nearly twice  the volume of Sa-x's massive jugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared in shock. Sa-x could just make more matter, she could get as big as she wanted, she never had stop. And just as all hope was about to drain from Samus, Sa-x spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"huh HAH, OKAY THERE YOU GO, THAT'LL DO IT. NOW EAT UP!\"</font></b> Sa-x rumbled as she gathered the super universe into a tight ball,  no larger then 1 millimeter around and pushed it at Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's eye's went wide and before she could respond the small orb flew downward and straight into her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt the big bang go off in between her legs, delicious heat and pleasure unlike anything else. She came, there was no resisting it, and then her body metabolized the energy of all creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus grew, and grew, and grew till she re-defined the term Big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big is that?</span></div></div>",

The hunter had literally asked to be bigger. That hadn't happened yet, Samus's requests were always odd, some sort of reason  holding her back. But Sa-x knew, knew when she heard Samus's concern that a universe would not be enough that Samus finally understood. So it was with anticipation that Sa-x watched her....what was the word, she searched her hosts mind....ah yes friend. She waited for her friend to start growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have kept her head back. Samus's growth literally exploded. One second she was less then an atom to Sa-x, the next Sa-x pulled her head back as Samus's head slammed into her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUCH! Okay my bad, I underestimated how  fast you would....\" Sa-x looked forward, then using her tendrils touched the pink wall before her. The  tendrils told her immediately, this was areola tissue?....A nipple?<br>\r\n.Sa-x look upward and saw only pink, she was trapped next to nipple so large creation was non-existent beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard Samus utter single cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size8\" style=\"\"><b>\"MMMOOORRRREEEE!!!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Samus tore free from reality, there was an enormous sound as the void was rent asunder. Still Samus grew. She was expanding outwards trillions of times her size every nanosecond. When her growth finally stopped She was staring at white void filed with black orbs each containing a myriad of color and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed around in wonder, noting that some of the universe were the size of her fingernails, while some were so big and so far away they made her look insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus had transcended space....She was unstoppable, she could do what ever she wanted, fuck universes, devour them, feed them to her tits, or her ass, she could grow her tits and was till they devoured all reality alone, she could use the ever expanding multiverse as a throne,  seat, bra, dildo. It was all hers.....or she could feed it to Sa-x, grow herself a partner in power and fuck till all reality collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down and decided</span></div></div>",

No I'm not i'm...\" Sa-x began but then stopped, she thought about her situation, for a second. Okay yes she was actually enormous. She was literally bigger then some universes. But something was off about how Samus had worded her reply. Sa-x took a moment to search her hosts memories and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Samus didn't really have a good understanding of what was being displayed. That worried Sa-x a bit, and she decided to get some clarity while watching carefully. She had a feeling this was gonna be another one of those things where what the bounty hunter was saying was not the same as what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...wait, could you repeat that.\" Sa-x said while scrunching up her brow and carefully studying Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't help but be partially amused, the creature looked like her but it certainly pulled off naive cuteness much better. Mostly because Samus hadn't been that naive for a long time. So she decided to try her hand at this again, and this time putting more easily understandable emotion into her voice and body language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> \"YOU SAID YOU WANT TO DEVOUR EVERYTHING.\"</font> Samus turned her hips sideways and pulled her massive arms up clasping her hands and pulling away from Sa-x<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\" BUT YOU'RE ALREADY SO, TERRIFYINGLY HUGE, WHAT EVER SHOULD I DO, WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF I DON'T DO AS YOU ORDER.\"</font> Samus concluded again playfully and this time floating downward, placing the absolutely minuscule Sa-x above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x looked down at Samus. and studying for a moment, then pulling information from not only her own gene's but the X colony as a whole she found what she was looking for. Samus was playing with her....according to her memories from sapient life friends did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....She had made a friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x didn't know why that felt so good. Or why it was important but some part of her being told her it was. So she played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, y-you'd better feed me or...or maybe I'll uh...I'll crush you with my massive tits!\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"OOHH, THEY ARE REALLY BIG, I WOULDN'T WANT THAT. MAYBE I SHOULD FEED YOU BEFORE YOU DESTROY ME...OR I COULD DO..THIS.\"</font> Samus cooed as she turned to the left and hefted her massive bosom with her arms, propping her enormous endowments up, she then used her other hand to sweep a few hundred smaller universes into her chest. Her breast immediately, and hungrily devoured the new sources of power and mass, and added it not to Samus's over all size, but to her Chest alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched as the massive blond goddesses tits began to expand. Sa-x had constantly told her to just increase their size to make for better energy storage, but she didn't think it this far through. Sa-x had H cups, her breasts only stayed floating perfectly above her waist because she was no longer subject to gravity. Samus....Could not quite say the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x gazed in awe as the F cup bosom increased in size, pushing outward, larger and larger. With every universe they absorbed they grew, wider, rounder, yet still perfectly balanced. Till Samus stood in front of Sa-x with proportionately K cup jugs. That in itself was impressive, they fell beyond her waist even in zero this gravity environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'd better make me bigger...or...OR I'll crush you with my enormous ASS!\" Sa-x shouted, a small smile on her face, she knew Samus didn't like the size of her rear, surely she'd cave and feed her after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBust Samus only smiled.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"OH NO NOT YOU'RE ASS, I'D BETTER ACT QUICK.\"</font><br>\r\n S he turned and allowed her immense perfect rear to collide with a nearby cluster of realities. Sa-x watched in shock as Samus \"allowed\" her ass to expand outward, easily doubling in size. Samus now stood as not quite the goddess of Thicc, but she was dam close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x smiled, she was earnestly having fun. Never mind countless lives had been destroyed since they started this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh YEAH! Well...you better make me bigger right now...or I'll Feed you to my pussy! You remember it right, when you stood on one of my lone pubic hairs. That's how big I am, I'll fuck you into submission.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked up at the tiny Sa-x. Now there was a thought, and a fun time waiting. But she did what she knew would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\" OH NOT THAT, YOUR PUSSY IS WAY TO BIG, PLEASE SA-X NO, NOT THAT. HOW COULD I EVER STOP YOU. YOU'RE JUST TO POWERFULL, BUT THEN AGAIN...MAYBE IF I REALLY TRY I CAN.\"</font> Samus in turned backed away from Sa-x playing at fear and she simply spread her legs. The effect was almost immediate. Samus only need will it and she found she could control her gravity and power. Thousands of Universes came rushing into her, enough heat filled her womanhood that she had to pause for a moment and focus. It felt amazing, but it wouldn't do to lose control...not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched in awe. Samus's vagina not only grew, thicker and stronger. But this time Samus herself got bigger. Sa-x smiled and tried to keep track but the vast cloud of spiraling lights and darkness made it all but impossible for her to guess how much power Samus had just taken in.  She looked towards where Samus should be again for confirmation but she didn't see anything. As a matter of fact everything around her was black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what is..oh..oh wow.\" Sa-x craned her head back and extneded her supernatural senses. Only then did she realize the truth. Samus had expanded so fast Sa-x was lost somewhere in eyer pupil. High above her countless parsecs away, universes continued to be drawn closer. Sa-x knew she had to act fast before Samus forgot about her, couldn't find her....or worse lost control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr,....NO MORE GAMES! YOU'RE GODDESS DEMANDS POWER! AND FOOD! AND TO BE BIGGER...NO THE BIGGEST! DO YOU HEAR ME TINY. MAKE ME BIGGER, NOW! NOW! NOW! <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>BIGGERRR!!!\"</b></font> Sa-x roared at the top of her lungs hoping to get Samus's attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus simply moved her head back, She had been able to see Sa-x to the whole time, she was right in front of her eye after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"EEEK! SA-X NO! I'M SORRY, PLEASE DON'T EAT ME. HERE TAKE IT, ITS YOURS TAKE IT ALL!\"</font> Samus shouted in fear, that quickly became a shout of passion and temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x cocked her head left then right. Then realized the universes floating above her were merely the ones that were constantly replicating and escaping Samus's grasp. The Utlra sized woman had already gathered nearly 90% of the known multiverse to her. and while it was still expanding in every direction and some of it escaping she held almost all reality in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she forced onto Sa-x. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was buried under a near infinite and growing amount of power.....the resulting growth from it caused....</span></div></div>",

This was gonna feel amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus likewise above watched the giant sphere of darkness that was most of the multiverse descend on little Sa-x. This time she committed to watching the events unfold. last time she looked away for a few seconds, and when she turned back she was dealing with a being to large to accurately describe. Well not this time, she floated back comfortable and drew a small amount of the universes she couldn't get to her. They were still multiplying exponentially, and would no doubt re-populate the multiverse with enough food for her to grow again as needed, especially if Sa-x emerged from her current situation in a less then amicable mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been reasonably nice so far, since I hurled her into that star...but I don't want her thinking she can just play with me like a toy.\" Samus sighed to herself. Realizing teaching a being like Sa-x that was one part apex predator, and one part not samus, would be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within the dark expanse of infinity Sa-x gorged herself on...well everything. She devoured Stars by the trillions, and grew larger and larger with every passing second. Galaxies and nebula's were pulled towards her and she absorbed them in any way she pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate some, committed others to her still expanding ass and breasts, and to her pleasure. Oh definitely to her pleasure, as she grew larger and larger, pulling in what amounted to hundreds of thousands of realities, Sa-x encouraged most to seek to be absorbed by her massive ever hungry vagina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OH YES, it feels so DAM GOOD! SO much food, more More, MOOOREEE!\" Sa-x roared as her whole body began to glow. She had finally reached maximum power saturation. Now the real show would begin. In seconds her form began to expand in every direction, filling the space around her and continuously absorbing more and more power, more and more universes, by the millions, then billions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, YES! I need MORE, I want to be bigger. NO! I NEED TO BE BIGGER!  More power, MORE POWER!\" Sa-x  screamed in ecstasy as she began to grow exponentially. she went from the size of 100 universes, to nearly  100,000 times as large in the span of a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT's not enough!! I want MORE! I want to grow bigger, and bigger! I need it ALL!\" Sa-x roared as she felt her grow begin to slow to something reasonable, aka not exponential, aka not nearly enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sa-x had an idea. She tapped the minds of the beings she had absorbed, and began adding their knowledge to her own. Soon she figured out what she needed to do. Sa-x began to concentrate, she re-arranged her own body, making it more able, stronger, hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she adjusted herself so she could expend power as well, and with a huge push she released a wave of energy and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched the the still quite large ball of reality in front of her, it was constantly shrinking, then expanding. No doubt Sa-x was gorging herself, but the realities were still multiplying, as new futures and events changed. Suddenly the entire sphere shuddered and a blast of light emanated from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm that's interesting. Hope she's okay...\" Samus thought aloud somewhat concerned, after all she had gone all in on the crazy train, which meant Sa-x was going to be the only being around to keep her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the sphere of universes Sa-x watched as her plan unfolded. everything around her began to glow, and then. Reality it self began to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, YES! It worked, I can change it, I can create energy, and matter, and alter it! I...I....\" Sa-x smiled immensely showing all her teeth as her grin pulled back covering more of her face then humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM A GODDESS! BOW TO ME! FEED YOUR GODDESS!\" Sa-x half shouted half laughed as power flooded her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative Miss Samus, You will stand down.\" came a reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x's Head snapped forward so fast it sent entire galactic cluster spiraling into the void. Did someone just talk back. Then she saw the source of defiance. An assembled fleet of federation ships, from nearly every contained reality that they had ever existed in. It was...impressive really. the entire fleet while small, had enough ships to actually surrounded her...completely. That was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh actually, Sorry, I'm Not Samus...I know I look like her. But I'm Sa-x! \" Sa-x replied smiling politely<br>\r\n\"Better known as, <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">YOU'RE NEW FREAKING GODDESS!!!</font>\" She shouted, and the force of her voice disintegrated nearly a tenth of the assembled federation armada. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative X parasite, You will be terminated!\" Came the federation<br>\r\n\"You got to be...you cannot be that dumb.\" Sa-x said as she began searching her hosts memories to see if the federation was really stupid enough to engage an actual reality altering super being. She found the memories quite quickly and very recent, then her eye's narrowed.<br>\r\n\"Do not shoot me.'' Sa-x replied in a flat tone. The federation ships began to flow with tiny pin pricks of light<br>\r\n\" I mean it. Don't you dare. Do Not Shoot Me!\" Sa-x replied again. She wasn't afraid of it, it would only make her bigger, but after searching Samus's memories she now had a very negative opinion of being shot at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe federation......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From outside the universal mass, Samus began to wonder. It sure was taking Sa-x a while, realistically she knew this expanding orb represented 90% of a near infinite amount of mass, the math of which she really didn't care to think to deeply about. But now the orb was expanding again. Gaining mass, had been ever since that burst of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she's okay. I'd hate to have to start digging through multiverses for another playmate.\" Samus spoke and continued to absorb reality around her, growing larger every few seconds to ensure the multiverse stayed smaller then her. After all, that was the way things were now. She was in charge then Sa-x, then her. Simple, and the multiverse would just have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Meanwhile, inside the multiverse attempting to deal with it****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x glared at the ships.  The federation ships in turn continued to charge their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, the weapon is ready...your orders captain?\" Came a voice from behind the fleet admiral<br>\r\n\"You're sure its the being we were looking for?\" Replied the admiral<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, probably the only one that made it to this size. Still nearly invisible to her, but definetly what we were looking for.\"<br>\r\n\"Then relay the co-ordinates to all vessels, and Open FIRE!\" Roared the admiral as men and women on the bridge rushed to obey.<br>\r\n\"Lets see how the bitch likes dealing with someone her own size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched the ships closely. This was a key moment, If they accepted her rule. Then everything would be fine, she'd have to find a way to stop Samus from instantly destroying them all. And find a way to prevent them from shooting Samus on sight....but it would all work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the federation opened fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"You dumb fucks. That won't even, I'm...WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!\" </font>Sa-x screamed more out of frustration she inherited from Samus then at her own situation. as an uncountable number of lights shot forward towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Well you had you're chance. Now, NOW I'M ANG....\"</font> Sa-x began to shout but stopped as the beams coalesced in front of her now actually hitting her. Had they stopped, had the federation really listened? If so it would be a first, and pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. Deep in space the creature the federation had found was bombarded with energy. It absorbed the energy and began to shake and tremble about, before gleefully begging to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single, galaxy sized metroid. A destroyer of all things in its own home galaxy. Was fed an enormous amount of power, and it did the only thing it knew to do. It grew...and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x stared at the point of light were the beams converged. It couldn't be this easy. The federation wouldn't listen to anyone unless they were out of ammo, dying, and the only functioning part of their anatomy left were their ears. Even then it'd be a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw it. A tiny green blob no larger then a quark to her. Sa-x couldn't quite make out what it was. Was it an acidic or chemical weapon maybe? a tear in reality? Then the thing grew, it went from quantum sized, to Sa-x anyway, to microbe, to 1/500th her size. then in one huge shudder it grew, and expanded outward, its huge green body destroying the federation. and it finally came to 1/4 Sa-x's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x recoiled back in shear insticntive fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metroid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, NO! NOT IN MY WORLD!! ABSOLUTELY NOT!!\" Sa-x screamed in anger and fear and unleashed her power. The metroid ate it like candy. and its whole body shuddered and doubled in size<br>\r\n\"EEEKK!\" Sa-x screamed and physically backed away.<br>\r\n\"No, no, no,no,no NO NO!! NO!!\" Sa-x screamed floating away. Then the metroid....talked? It didn't really, it just made that screeching sound, but Sa-x could understand the meaning behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SKreee!\" it shouted<br>\r\n\"I, what...no I'm not your momma....\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n\"Skreee!\"<br>\r\n\"OH, well I look like her cause I'm her.....lets just call us..umm...okay I'm a copy you understand that?\" Sa-x tried to explain<br>\r\n\"Skree, ree, ree\" came a more temperate reply from the enormous predator<br>\r\n\"Oh Yeah, I guess you would, that is pretty common way to replicate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x stared at the creature. It was definitely different from its brethren. It was intelligent for starters, and not openly trying to kill her, an X parasite, its natural prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what can I do for you?\" Sa-x asked wearily<br>\r\n\"Skree. Skree!!\" the metroid replied almost inquisitively<br>\r\n\"No I will not make you bigger.\" Sa-x deadpanned<br>\r\n\"Skree?\"<br>\r\n\"Take you to momma?\" <br>\r\n\"Skree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x thought about that for a minute. She could, but Samus had a soft spot for these creatures. Worse this one had evolved on some level. What if it bonded with Samus....What if evolved to be like her....What if took Samus's affection away from her....<br>\r\nSa-x was momentarily paralyzed by her own thoughts. It may have gone on a while if she wasn't interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skree? SKREEE!\"<br>\r\n\"UH, Oh. UM, well I...I Can't\" Sa-x started to reply but couldn't think up a good excuse.<br>\r\n'Skree?\" came a innocuous cry.<br>\r\n\"Because she's not...look I just can't\"<br>\r\n\"Skree, ree, ree, KEKE!\"<br>\r\n\"What?!? I am not threatened by your adorableness...wait how did you figure....\"<br>\r\n\"Skreeeee! SKREE SKREEKEKE!\" spoke the long winded creature<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x blinked at the last line of dialogue. The creature had just attested it wanted to see Samus, and Sa-x was blocking it because it feared its power. Its pull on the hearts of all because of its tiny squishy adorableness. Sa-x ran that through her mind, and began to wonder just what happened to this thing to let it one get so big, and two so demented if it thought it was cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't ugly Sa-x thought, and maybe it could be cute if....her heart stopped. She was becoming attached, No Samus's inherent likes were overriding her common sense regarding the creature. If it happened to her, it would definitely happen to Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away...eat some galaxies...but just go in peace.\" Sa-x commanded the creature trying not to engage it in a fight.<br>\r\n\"Skrreee.\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n\"SKREEEE!!\"<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT AFRAID OF....okay look yes, you're adorable okay...but there are probably a trillion Samus Aran's floating out here so just find one and be happy. and I'll go back to mine...deal?\" Sa-x spoke, and made a mental note that if the creature accepted to instantly devour all of reality into herself. Screw taking risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were quite for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SKREE, SKREEE!\" the metroid said<br>\r\n\"You want...my Samus...wait you can sense her...well to bad she' mine!\" Sa-x shouted in fear, if it could sense Samus it could find her as well. It made sense, Her Samus was the largest thing around, if the metroid could sense energy, Samus would be detectable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SKREE, KREEE, RERE!\"came the creature's retort<br>\r\n\"EXCUSE YOU!

An awful short sound made of screeching bursts, accompanied by its whole form quivering in rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched as the creature opted not to fear her, but take pleasure in her predicament. the sudden burst of anger, followed by shock, and then smoldering resentment brought her thoughts back into perfect clarity. She was after all a goddess, no need to actually play fair with this insignificant little wretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that the whole situation changed. Sa-x tipped her head back and inhaled while focusing her power. Within in seconds the reality that the metroid and Sa-x occupied began to tremble, Space itself folding and shuddering. Then it happened, so fast not many creatures could even understand what fate was befalling them. But Sa-x called the whole of multiversal mass into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was huge flash of light, and great sensation of warmth accompanied by the immediate screams of orgasmic ecstasy. And Sa-x Ascended. To say she grew is not quite appropriate. Growing creatures simply get larger. Sa-x drew the reality around her into herself and changed. Oh She definitely got bigger, but this time she grew in every imaginable aspect, size, power, mind, soul. Her body was overflowing with power, and even as her breasts and ass worked overtime to store power, growing larger and larger then there already preposterous sizes Sa-x could feel herself transcending the physical. As she grew closer to absorbing everything, she gazed upon her own form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness was flowing through her veins, accompanied by burst of lights and flashes of power. She could feel the universes still inside her. Multiplying granting her more and more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, finally. It's mine...ALL MINE!\" Sa-x roared and the last of the reality around her was absorbed and she returned to the white void the multiverse had occupied. Then she realized she was still missing something....no Someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, Ohhhhh Samus. I Have Something For You!\" Sa-x cooed turning to find.....</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't have just given up and stopped growing...would she?\" Sa-x wondered aloud as she continued to look all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet everywhere she looked she was greeted with the same blank white space, nothing else occupying reality except her and the void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, NO! This isn't right...maybe she...maybe she's to big, maybe I left for too long and she grew so much that...Yah that has to be it, I'm not looking at the void, I must be so small to her I'm looking at the whites of her eye's...Well I can fix that!\" Sa-x said aloud to herself, one might worry the enormous goddess might be going crazy, except Sa-x started life about as sane as the number purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger, MORE! I need more power, MORE! MOOORREE!\" Sa-x roared as she focused her energy, within her veins the multiverse pulsed and grew, accelerating its own expansion as Sa-x forced new realities into existence and cloned old one just so she could get the power she would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x could feel the energy pulsing inside her, begging to be used. So she put it to use, all to growth...every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next was a sight to behold. Sa-x's body shimmered with power and then she grew. Exponentially her size increased and she expanded outward in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, More, MORE, BIGGER!\" Sa-x said as nothing came into view. She was growing faster then she ever had before but she still couldn't make out anything but the white void...NO! the whites of Samus's eye's it had to be...she wasn't alone...no, not after everything she went through to get here she refused to believe she lost the only other being in the universe she cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FASTER! MORE POWER! I....NEED....TO...BE...<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">B-I-G-G-E-R!!\"</font> Sa-x roared as her enormous form continued to expand endlessly into the void. Closing her eye's she could sense her growth, her power, the multiverse's size and the energy it was and could feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer advanced senses informed her she had been growing for a full 7 minutes, and her size was well over hundreds of trillions its original starting size. So Sa-x opened her eye's and with one final push of growth she looked around to behold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no...no..please..no...\" Sa-x looked around she couldn't see anything but the void, she couldn't sense anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...what if she died...NO! How long do humans live...How long was I trapped in with that little green jerk and the federation?!\" Sa-x shouted, more to herself, and a separate part of o her mind responsible for high speed reality altering computations took over and provided her the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6 hours...that's it? Then, she didn't die....so where is SHE!\" Sa-x looked around, but again even at her size, Her immense multiverse devouring size, she couldn't make out anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...that doesn't make sense...she didn't just  disappear...wait I'm going about this wrong, I don't need to grow, I need to expand my senses!\" Sa-x declared, realizing she was relying on mundane means like sight, and touch to try and detect Samus. She had extra dimensional senses that could detect energy, space, life, lack of those things. Why simply get bigger, when she could just expand her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay lets try this again. I need power...lots of power...NO ALL THE POWER!\" Sa-x roared and her body responded, the multiverse in her again multiplied and grew at an accelerated rate.

Sa-x continued her search and threw more and more power into her mind. But it wasn't enough, Finally she double up on her power. Expending enough to grow, doubling in size every few seconds, which gave her more mass and more power to tap for her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly an hour...but finally she felt it. Something, else...something....BIG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, is that..her...no..what is that...c'mon brain think!\" Sa-x spoke aloud to herself trying to puzzle out what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's...a...negative infinite space minus 1??? WTF BRAIN!? How about putting that in a way I can...oh I see its the edge of nothing....wait...that doesn't make much sense.\" Sa-x spoke as her mind finally grew in power enough to comprehend the void she was existing in...sorta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. there is something here...AH Time?! Okay so this is in essence Time, all reality is still moving foward...even the universes I have in me are all advancing. So if I break this barrier...I can see throughout all Time and SPACE!\" Sa-x shouted happy to finally have figured out a use for what she dubbed the void previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then when I can see all of Time I can go see what happened to Samus! YES! Okay body...time to GROW!\" Sa-x said as she began to funnel all of her power into her growth again. Her entire form shimmered, then shuttered, then exploded outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE, FASTER, BIGGER, MORE!! I NEED TO BE BIGGER BODY!! MORE GROWTH! MORE POWER!\" Sa-x commanded of herself as reality warped around her. She was growing so fast it was insane, her body expanded exponentially in every direction, she grew monstrously larger every nano-second, but it wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE DAMMIT! MORE!!\" Sa-x cried as she felt her growth begin to level out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT NO!! NO I\"M NOT BIG ENOUGH! I STILL NEED MORE! I NEED TO BE BIGGER!!\" But while she grew the mulitverse had reached its limit. True it still grew infinitely within her, but she could no longer push it any faster, her growth had reached a constant state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand it wasn't enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE YOU! I am Sa-x! I AM A GODDESS! MY WORD IS REALITY! AND <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> I SAID</font> <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BIGGGGERRRRR!!!!!!</font>\" Sa-x screamed at the top of her lungs. When her body didn't comply she reached out and grabbed the void by its non-existence, pulled close and bit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly infinity seemed so small. Sa-x's eye's went wide as power rushed into her body, infinite fuel for the engine of her power, the multiverse shuddered and her whole body began to shimmer with swirls of white and black light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in one enormous surge of growth, Sa-x felt reality give way around her. The void in front of her tore asunder and Sa-x saw her opportunity to escape the bonds of Time as well as Space. She squeezed her head through and then her massive breast's. So large they tore the whole in reality even wider, easily allowing her to continue. Well until reality snapped shut on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Swear, Universe...if this is a comment about my ass, I WILL UNMAKE EVERYTHING!\" Sa-x roared part in anger but mostly in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she head it, a sound like billions stars all going supernova and collapsing in to blackholes instantly.<br>\r\nTurning her head to find the source of the sound Sa-x saw something she couldn't quite take in...as she was trying to figure out what she was looking at she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"<b>Y'KNOW, I HAD THE SAME EXACT REACTION\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x finally managed to focus her super senses enough to take in the source of the voice, and the previous...oh god was that giggling, it was, but it was the giggling of Samus Aran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus Aran looked down on the small infinite beam of reality. A tight white light that began at a small orb far off in the distance and shot forward forever. Or at least it had until she got here and promptly made better use of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x meanwhile looked up and down the time stream. All of reality was contained there in. She saw herself in the past struggling to grow and find Samus, further back she saw the multiverse at peace and blissfully expanding. She looked forward wondering what the future would hold. But she was greeted with a different sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's Aran's Cosmic sized pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of reality was flowing into Samus's womanhood. and with every passing moment her body was growing. The stream split at the opening to the time devouring vagina, and two smaller beams ran up and wrapped into Samus' Breasts. Each now filling with power. Inside Sa-x could sense entire multiverses expanding. Filling the Goddess's bosom with more and more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-h-hi Samus....Uhh you've been busy I see.\" Sa-x spoke trembling partly in fear partly in confusion. What was she even supposed to say. Samus was now the end all be all of reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x had figured herself a goddess when she could control the multiverse. She never considered there might a way to go beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI SA-X, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"time for what?\" Sa-x asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIME FOR....</span></div></div>",

The breast's quickly overshadowed everything below them and came crashing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x lept upward into the goddess's cleavage, then using her power managed to navigate through the celestial cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, please wait..I wanted...to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"SHARE RIGHT?

Allowing her pussy to continue devouring all reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will...really..it'll be you..and me?\" Sa-x looked up at the enormous woman's face. A face which broke into a huge smile, and Sa-x knew she meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what are you waiting for tiny!

When she landed Sa-x was supported entirely by her now absurdly huge tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus simply rolled her eye's as her pussy continued to draw nearer to the origin of all existence.

A slight tinge of warmth, not over her whole body but in her mind. Then it happened the tiniest molecular bond imaginable took shape, and her mind began to piece together memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came back slowly, as the med pod continued to scan. Throwing error after error, something about signal deficiency. Samus on the other hand was relieving very recent memories, at first she thought she'd finally snapped, that all the stress of bounty hunting, world destroying, and isolation had finally gotten to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she began to question herself the medical pod compensated for its scanning deficiency by increasing the power to the energy scanner, intensifying the beams energy and finally getting decent enough signal to get a biological readout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stronger beam hit Samus her mind raced, and her eye's flew open. It all came back to her, everything. Including the moment right before the finale, when she almost consumed the entirety of reality and all energy just for the sake of her own climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked....I did it?

The report confirmed it, her DNA analysis alone signaled she was one part human, one part modded human (Chozo dna), and one part federation implanted metroid DNA (Vaccine from fusion). Furthermore the report signaled some inconclusive changes in her anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, its all here, density increase, unknown cell types, high and varied mitochondria count, new neural cells and pathways. It, worked, I have the body I need, and I reset everything. But then why can't I...\" Samus began to ponder, her memories were still partly jumbled but she knew she should be a goddess, able to alter reality at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding the best way to figure it was some empirical testing, she lifted her hand and attempted to connect with some nearby free floating electrons.

She was the tech on weekend duty at the medical station and that meant not a lot to do. Most patients scheduled to meet with physicians on the weekdays. Weekends were mostly just people using the federation med pods for annual check ups and physicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wish there was at least something to do to pass the time, like anything, anything would pass the time better then just sitting here counting my heart wasting its beats on boredom.\" Jenny mused aloud, when the light on her console blinked indicating that the patient in room 13 was done, but had taken longer then necessary to review and depart. It meant she should go check up on them to make sure nothing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny got up and began to walk down the hall when she heard a strange sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was about six seconds from a rampage. Taking a deep breath and remembering how this all started, she exhaled deeply, took the machines report and filed it under advice. Then reached out for the release handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich didn't turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, turned it again...nothing. Stuck. She slowly began to apply more pressure, but the handle would not give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't do this, just let...me...out!\" Samus said and leaned into the handle. Which promptly snapped from its frame. Samus stared at the broken handle in her hand. She then realized that in two iterations of reality, this pod had trapped her successfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly this pod had done more to detain the mighty Samus Aran then all of her enemies combined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned the corner and stopped just beside the door. Smoothing out her military issued scrubs, which were too damn form fitting in her opinion, she then heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was this horrible screech, like metal shearing metal of ship collision, and then the doors in front of the medical tech burst open wide! Obliterated by the foreing object that had gone flying through the wall and door, and firmly implanting itself into the wall on the far corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gazed wide eyed. But only for amoment. Training kicked in and she immediately turned the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Are you...o...kay...\" No training in the world could have prepared Jenny for what she came face to face with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry 6'3\" blonde woman in a skin tight suit. Standing in the center of a destroyed medical pod mumbling under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un-make you from reality, if you ever try that again, you glorified tin can...\" Samus said as she stepped out of her handi-work. She knew she was strong, she knew she lost her temper, she didn't know her body could use its own energy more efficiently on herself. She may have accidentally increased her strength 100x for a brief second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned facing the Med tech who seemed to have been struck still by the angry bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...oh uh...sorry about that. You can bill me later, I uh...\" Samus began. But the tech cut her off.<br>\r\n\"Who are you!? What have you DONE!\" Do you have any idea what that costs! How did you even?!\" Jenny began to sputter quickly grabbing a holo-tablet and pulling up the patients info. Then she froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Miss Aran...um...I, well ma'am you'll need to uh...huh, I don't know if there's a protocol for this.\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about...Uh..PTSD, didn't realize it had finally gotten to me...just, send me the bill.'' Samus replied and began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, the bill? Oh right, you probably can afford that...oh okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus then....</span></div></div>",

Best to just let that woman occupy herself with the logistics of billing her for the medical pod she destroyed then stick around and  get tangled up in the whole mess. Besides she had important things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so my plan worked...sorta. I'm a goddess...basically. Now i need power, then I need to find Sa-x make sure I reset everything correctly and she hasn't reverted to power hungry monster. Then...\" Samus was ticking off a to do list aloud as she walked down the street and signaled for hover car. Her ship wasn't allowed in city limits and she figured the best to recharge herself was literally to just get on her ship, fire up the engines and bathe herself in high intensity ionizing radiation, and maybe a power bomb or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then once I have that sorted out I need to make sure the federation didn't have any contingent plans in place in case of reality warping threats and..omph!\" Samus was stopped dead in her tracks as bumped into something heavily armored. Looking up much to her displeasure it was not her transport, it was a federation marine unit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier immediately turned around and began to speak, some usual spill about citizen rights, and please back away for safety but then he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! Holy hell! Miss Aran, I mean er, SIr, uh Ma'am uh...\" The soldier went on flustered for moment. Samus wasn't actually surprised, this happened quite a bit around the circles that actually knew who she was. She was impressed the soldier recognized her so quickly without her armor though, that meant either he'd served in sectors she did and was privy to security/intel briefings, or that he was a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, oh crap. I uh, I'm on duty and this is gonna sound weird to have to tell you of all people this. Uh there's a disturbance and maybe you could....i dunno help?\" the soldier finally managed to stammer out. Samus looked forward and rolled her eye's, a fan. Dammit she was hoping for someone competent. Then again given her recent record with the federation maybe a fan was the preferable situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay soldier I'll bite, whats the problem, Just know I can't really help without clearance, or a bounty and my fee is probably way over your pay league.\" Samus replied, she wanted to get out of here, but she to do so peacefully preferably without being shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ma'am you see, a group of people transporting deadly materials lost a shipment, stolen by local underground figures. We need to reclaim it for safety reasons.\" The soldier began.<br>\r\n\"And this requires me?\"Samus asked her tone implying he why.<br>\r\n\"Fortunately most of these men have a bounty and I can assure I am allowed to sign off on assistance in this matter. Sarge might have my head when he see's who I signed up but still....\" the marine replied not paying attention to her question<br>\r\n\"Soldier, why do you need me?\" Samus asked a bit more forcibly.<br>\r\n\"Oh right, Right!

No deal, Now if you'll excuse me I need to..\" Samus was cut off as a bolt of plasma ripped right into her. Warmth flooded her body and she dropped to the ground. Suddenly she was filled with a minor euphoria. Power, oh good sweet sweet power. She needed more RIGHT NOW, MORE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Son's of a Space Pirate!\" The federation marine dropped to the ground and took cover dragging Samus behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is lieutenant Hax! Confirmation of opposition armed and dangerous. Need immediate assstance! All on site units hold the perimiter! Do NOT let those assholes escape!\" Lt. Hax finished speaking into his comms and turned and eye towards his idol, who was strangely fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked back at the soldier, Hax was it? She felt her hunger surging, he had a federation issue Laser rifle, and two plasma grenades. And she wanted them, no she needed them! All she had to do was jump him, he'd never expect it. Samus shook her head violently to clear the thoughts, '<i>Okay Samus, no. We are not jumping a marine and stealing his power just cause we're a little horny and starved for power'</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am are you..okay.\" Hax asked tentatively as another few shots range out in the distance.<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine, I tougher then I look, even in this form.\" Samus lied hoping the soldier didn't know much about Chozo tech.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I didn't know the zero suit had that kind of defensive ablity, it can withstand plasma shots. That's Amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, wait plasma shot....I was just...they...\" Samus began but then her eye's widened as a realization set in.<br>\r\n\"Uh Miss Aran?\" Hax said suddenly worried again.<br>\r\n\"THEY FREAKING SHOT ME!\" Samus suddenly roared and her voiced echoed loud enough to be heard for blocks around. Booming like a minor clap of thunder.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....\" Hax said intelligently then watched as the woman before went from a 6'3\" blonde bombshell to a fully armored Chozo warrior.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to tear them to pieces! Offer accepted Lt. Hax.\" Samus said as she activated her suit and used her speed booster to run straight into the enemy compound.<br>\r\n\"....That is so freaking cool. Oh right, Lt. Hax to base, cancel that previous request for backup, and order a medical unit in its place please.\" Hax finished as he watched the universes most deadly bounty hunter tear full speed across the street and barrel through a solid concrete wall into the building where enemy was holed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus came crashing through the front wall she opened up with barrage after barrage of missile fire, regular, super, ice, she let them have it all. Her opposition was clearly not prepared for what was happening and most the men and women inside, though well armed thanks to their stolen goods, were no match for the sheer amount of raw power that came exploding at them from every side. Falling back into the interior they activated the security wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned on her x-ray visor and heard a small beep. Her suit's energy field has somehow sustained damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did one of them get off a lucky shot? No probably my own fault for going through the wall.\" She said as she looked back at the crumbling wall she had entered through, a space nearly 10ft wide was missing.<br>\r\nApproaching the sealed door her visor showed her the thugs were taking up flanking points in the next room. Fools as if they could hurt her. Not only did she finally feel great, but those weapons couldn't hurt her now even if she was unarmored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her Plasma beam at full charge Samus quickly melted through the door. Striding into the next room like she owned the place she turned her head from left to right in a slow sweep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you all. No sense hiding, come out and face me!\" Samus said and while she didn't think they were dumb enough to comply it was worth a shot.<br>\r\n\"All right asshole, you got it! Come on out boys and let him have it!\" came woman's voice from the back. She was first to step out, apparently their leader? Or at least in charge of this group. Soon another 20 some armed men and women appeared surrounding Samus.<br>\r\n\"Okaaayyy. Right then, not working with geniuses here.\" Samus replied looking around. When suddenly her suit beeped again this time insistently. Looking at her HUD she noted she was down to 10% energy levels. <i>'The hell? That can't be right, I haven't even been touched'.</i> Then the display bleeped down to 8%. Samus gazed wide eyed for a moment, did the criminals have some super weapon she wasn't aware of or...oh no, it was her, she was draining her own suit. No wonder she felt so good. Her power suit had been feeding her power for the past few minutes and she sucked it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as the thugs were closing in Samus's suit destabilized. Glowing bright orange and white for few seconds and then vanishing. The group looked on with glee. They couldn't believe their luck, the universes most dangerous bounty hunter theirs for the taking. It was then Samus heard the sound of 21 plasma rifles being charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know sweetie? The funny thing is we won't be able to claim any type of reward and all since you're legit, but doing this and getting a little DNA evidence will go a long way to boosting our cred.\" The lead female gloated as she raised her own rifle fully charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared at all of them. They couldn't hurt her, but they could inconvenience her. She didn't need this not right now.<br>\r\n\"I will give you all one warning. I am far more dangerous then any of you could imagine. I have killed entire planets, and genocided races wholesale for a paycheck.\" Samus began and the men and women around her began to hesitate for a moment this did seem awfully easy.<br>\r\n\" So I say this with all seriousness, If you want to make it out of here alive. Do...Not...Shoot...Me. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thugs<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just sat there, and let the power, and the warmth flow over her. It felt so damn good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crew continued to let loose hell with their weapons they soon started to notice something. The woman in front of them wasn't dying. Matter of fact it almost looked like she was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, more, keep it up. MORE!\" Samus said as she rose to her feet. The warmth and ambrosia like feeling were starting to fade. Her body had absorbed the initial burst of power. While she didn't feel starved anymore, she was now something worse. Frustrated. Standing to her new height of 6'6\", oh god this was going to take forever at this rate, she turned towards her assailants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said MORE DAMMIT!! More! More power! Give...me...MOOOOREEE!!!!\" Samus roared and the whole building shook. The thugs were forcibly thrown off their feet from the sheer power of her voice.<br>\r\n\"Wha...What the HELL are you!\" the lead thug replied as she began back away from Samus. She had heard the stories that the hunter was invincible. But she didn't think they were factual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you Stopping!\" Samus said she marched forward angrily. She grabbed the lead thug the neck and lifted her off the floor. The smaller woman began to kick and struggle, but it was no use. Normal Samus would have outclassed this bitch, let alone god tier Samus.<br>\r\n\"Please let go, I, we, I'll give you whatever you want!\" The woman screamed.<br>\r\n\"I WANT MORE POWER!!\" Samus roared at point blank staring into the woman's fear filled eye's. Then it hit her, the woman was terrified, like real terror, the same type she inspired into the space pirates. While Samus didn't have much pity for criminals and scum, she was not used to be looked at like that by another human. She dropped the girl and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving, put your guns down and surrender.\" Samus said.

Taking a deep breath she cleared her thoughts and used her holotablet to send in a mission complete signal to the federation marines outside. Not bothering to stick around she then left out the back. She encountered a locked set of doors on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead thug looked up. Suddenly clarity setting in. She was not going down her. She got up and tailed Samus as quietly as she could. Then she watched as the bounty hunter approached the door they chained shut. Then she watched in horror as Samus tore the chains right off the door and pushed her way out. Again, she knew the stories, Samus unstoppable badass super woman whom was indestructible, and unrivaled in her combat prowess. But seriously she still thought the woman was human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethings not right here.\" The woman thought to herself. She watched as Samus boarded her ship. Taking the chance, she climbed under the ship and pulled out a pair magnet gauntlets. Then she clung on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus got into her ship. One good thing that came from all this. She was on mission now, and could call her ship to her mission area. Now she could fly away and find a nice quite place to feed.<br>\r\nSetting her ship down outside of the city about halfway between the city and secret federation foundation holding the last x parasite.  Samus then got out of the ship. Her analysis during her ride had taught her something. She would need a lot more power this time around to kick start her godhood. Fortunately she had just the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had better work...or its gonna hurt like hell.\" Samus said as she pulled out a power bomb. One of the most dangerous weapons in her inventory, essentially a nuclear weapon. Using this would be dangerous, not to her, but if she couldn't contain or absorb the blast she'd have federation soldiers crawling over her position in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin watched from under Samus's ship as the bounty hunter exited holding something in her hands. Now, Lin knew her weapons, and while she didn't recognize the exact make she knew a nuclear level device when she saw one. ' What the hell is she doing?' Lin thought to herself. Then she watched something she didn't think she'd ever see happen. Samus Aran stripped away her zero suit, and Lin was taken aback by just how hot the woman was. She was bigger then life that was the best description Lin could think of. Double D's attached to a 6 foot plus woman with a six pack, with a long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass is a bit fat, but otherwise she's freaking gorgeous. Wait what is she doing.\" Lin whispered trying to deduce what was happening. When she saw Samus insert the bomb into her womanhood.<br>\r\n\"She's gone fucking nuts. Right, she can't, she...she...wtf?\" Lin began to babble when she saw an enormous flash of light and Samus's form lit up with power. The woman literally began to levitate off the ground. Then the screams came, sheers roars of orgasmic power. Lin began to blush, she felt like a voyeur, she also wondered what that felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY FUCKING GOD YES!!\" Samus Roared as power flooded her body. She began to levitate, didn't know how, didn't care why. She just finally felt right. Like she could breath again, like the world that was so dark was finally brightening around her.<br>\r\n\"More, More, MORE!\" Samus began but soon she was taken up by the sheer pleasure. Screaming in ecstasy, the hunter looked back at her ship. Her shrinking ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin watched in Awe. Something was wrong, Samus was growing. Lin knew a lot of rumors, they flew around the underground like ships in space. But she'd like to think she remember if there were any rumors about the Hunter being an unstoppable giantess. As Samus's body continued to expand, Lin watched as the woman's size went from 7 feet, to 8, 9, 10....<br>\r\n\"Is...is she going to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,ha,ha, ah. No! Not yet, I need more. MORE!\" Samus said as she laid her hands on her ship. She was 10 feet of sexy unstoppable woman and it wasn't enough. She needed this to keep going.  Slamming the hull, the ship allowed her entry. Quickly going in she tore a lid off a container. Not bothering with the lock, it came apart like wet cardboard under her powerful grip. She grabbed an arm full of power bombs and headed back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin watched Samus return. Holding a lot of those devices. She wanted to scream, she wanted to run. Instead she watched. Samus inserted device after device into her womanhood. Lin watched again and again as Samus's body lit up with power, and she screamed in orgasmic delight. Her form began to expand again. Lin watched as Samus fell back on her ass and went from 11 feet to 12, 14, 16, 20.<br>\r\n\"How? How big is she gonna get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n25 feet, 30, 35....Samus began to breath more steadily looking around. Then the power rush gave out. And her form began to compress. 35 feet suddenly shrank to 25.<br>\r\n\"WHAT! NO WHY!\" Samus roared and began to focus, and she soon found her answer, her body could actually regulate its size...sorta. She needed more power to sustain a larger size and her body had decided this size was the most efficient for the moment. Or at least it had until she had used some power to discern the reason for her shrinking. It cost her and 25 feet shrank to 12 feet.<br>\r\n\"You stupid, blonde...dammmit!\" Samus cursed she had just paid a high price for that knowledge. <br>\r\n\"Not to self, do not abuse power without thinking about it first.\" Samus said then boarding her ship Samus decided it was finally time to.....</span></div></div>",

The last thing she needed was for the federation to revive Sa-x before she had a chance to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus wasn't sure if everything she had done to alter reality had worked as she intended, and of all the things she needed to work it was keeping Sa-x as a friend. Partly because Sa-x might be the only being capable of understanding her, and secondly because she may have accidentally left Sa-x with god like powers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah definitely don't want her to wake up confused, only having her primal drives...or chozo forbid, angry.\" Samus mused as she checked the co-ordinates and allowed the auto-pilot to take her as close to federation base as she had official permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin meanwhile watched as Samus set a course. She had no idea where they were going. She only knew she was in far to deep to run now. She had seen things, she knew things that the bounty hunter would likely, no scratch that would definitely kill her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus landed and approached the Federation secret facility she was greeted by two heavily armed guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen, step aside.\" Samus said as she flashed her ID over a nearby terminal. It immediately lit up identifying the bounty hunter. The two guards looked at each other, then towards the Samus. Confusion evident in their body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ma'am, I don't think you were summoned. I can call down stairs if you like.\" Said the first guard, not hiding his staring. It was shocking enough to meet the universes greatest hunter. But to meet a 12 foot tall amazon version was something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...wasn't...a...request\" Samus said stepping forward calmly. Looming over the soldier she grabbed the man and tore his armor from his body effortlessly. Leaving him exposed and in shock. Samus turned her eye's to the other soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, key card is in his left belt pocket.\" replied the second soldier.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding lieutenant! Shoot her!\" ordered the soldier on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Do not Shoot me.\" Samus interjected in deadly cold tone<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't think it ma'am, honestly seems kinda stupid given your rep, and highly detrimental to my survival.\" answered the first soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blinked, then cocked her head. Had she found the only intelligent person in the entire federation. Regardless, she was not letting this go un-rewarded. She stepped forward, first retrieving the card from the other soldier and then dispatching him with a quick blow to the neck.  Turning toward the other soldier she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name sexy?\" She asked as she entered the elevator to go down to the base.<br>\r\n\"Uh, wha...OH UH, Lieutenant Steel ma'am.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait here Steel, I'll be back for you.\" Samus replied and entered the base. Leaving the Lt. befuddled, and a bit swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding down the base Samus began to wonder. Clearly they knew she was here, she hadn't really bothered with subtlety. But how would they respond. Was there even a protocol in place for dealing with her? With her out of her armor? A 12 foot tall impossibly sexy, temperamental her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator came to halt the door slid open. Stepping out Samus looked into the room and noted two things. First a simple X parasite contained in a 6 ft cylinder in the middle of the room. Second the platoon worth of Plasma rifles leveled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, that makes sense.\" Samus said almost bored. Noting the weapons were all energy she stepped forward and the soldiers didn't even give warning. The room lit up with plasma fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus continued to stroll forward undeterred. Energy soaked into her form and pleasure began to flood her body. Compared to her power bombs this was nothing, but it was at very least refreshing. As she approached the container she effortlessly smashed the containment unit and freed the parasite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a small piece of her own hair, she fed it to the x-parasite. <br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes...well everything really.\" Samus said as she watched the small blob take in the hair and begin to morph rapidly. The whole time the federation continued to pour energy shots into the hunter to no effect at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she! why isn't she even reacting?!\" Screamed a soldier<br>\r\n\"Keep up the pressure private! Commands been informed!\" came back a reply. and the barrage continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't even notice them. She was smiling down at the tiny 2 inch tall clone of herself.<br>\r\n\"Hi Sa-x, do you remember me?\" Samus said as kindly as she could.<br>\r\n\"I...you...I...wait. Samus. What happened, wait did you?\" Sa-x's eye's went wide as she looked up upon the goddess holding her. At a whopping two inches tall, the amazonian Samus looked enormous. But she was here, and Sa-x had memories. They were a little fuzzy but they were there.<br>\r\n\"You did do it! Oh my gawd, you're a goddess!\" Sa-x gawked looking at Samus's enormous face. Or at least what she could see. Samus was holding her at waist level and the amazon's enormous tits were kinda obscuring a good bit of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, well ya'know. Figured if I'm gonna dream. Dream Big.\" Samus replies and Sa-x smiled. Big, yes, they would both be very big before this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great Sa-x, But we really need to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Feed you, and get you back up to size.\" Samus finished. The tiny Sa-x was nodding eagerly in her hand. She wanted nothing more then to feed and grow, and feed some more. It would have been a glorious moment, Sa-x was truly moments from happiness when she heard a federation soldier cursing. She could barely make out the soldiers form behind Samus, as he grabbed the side of his rifle and tore something off the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck safeties, Chew on this Bitch!\" Cried the soldier as he pulled the trigger of his plasma rifle. With the safety removed the gun had no ability to regulate the energy output. The energy clip unleashed its entire payload over the course of a few seconds nearly melting the barrel of the weapon in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brilliant red beam lanced into Samus's back. Sa-x watched as Samus's body readily absorbed the power, her chest beginning to glow a deep red. But Sa-x found Samus's eyes more disturbing. The hunters eye's flared with small tinges of red energy, and then opened wide. Sa-x then realized she might not get to eat as Samus turned on the soldier swiftly. Staring wide eye'd at that man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"more....\"  the 12 foot tall amazon whispered.<br>\r\n\"Wha...what?\" The soldier replied taking a step back.<br>\r\n\"I..said...MORE!\" Samus's voice rose to a shout as she stepped forward and yanked the gun form the soldiers' grip and hurled it across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasted no time drawing a plasma grenade from his belt. Samus stepped forward preparing to continue her demand, but as she opened her mouth the soldier armed the grenade and shoved it in her mouth. Samus clamped down on the explosive and a moment later she was rewarded with the sensation of sweet sweet power. If flooded her body briefly, as enough thermal energy to melt a small tank was released into her system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched the whole episode play out. Then stared as Samus didn't grow, but that couldn't be right, unless. <br>\r\n\"Unless she's already fed, or her new body is....uh oh...\" Sa-x pondered for a minute. She had suspicion she hoped was wrong. But she couldn't let this continue, a raging power starved Samus was not very conducive to her getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, STOP!\" Sa-x cried realizing she probably couldn't do much at her current size and power. Much to her surprise though Samus blinked once, twice, then repeatedly as shook her head and looked down at Sa-x.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I uh...enough, you're probably hungry. Here.\" Samus said ignoring the soldier, bending over at her waist, and grabbing the second grenade on his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the soldiers hand grabbed hers and held tight. Sa-x let a low oooohhh sound, and Samus blinked again this time out of shock. She raised her head and the soldier was treated to eye's of the woman who had successfully destroyed entire planets worth of opponents. Cold emotionless eye's of a killer, and he realized that while shooting her, screaming at her, and attacking her may have not threatened her. The act of physically imposing  his presence, however mildly, had garnered a response, and not a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quick, Sa-x took the opportunity to run down Samus's arm and grab the grenade. While Samus's other arm flew up and decapitated the soldier. Sa-x rode the grenade to ground and straddled it while she slammed the button on top as hard as she could to arm it. The rest of the room went quite, the soldiers staring at Samus's bloody arm interposing the space between where a man's head should be, and vacant air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bright flash of light went off. Samus looked down and watched Sa-x devour a grenade. Sa-x meanwhile began to scream in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, oh gawd, yesssss!\" Sa-x screamed as power flooded her body. The flare of power erupted and immediately shrank back down as Sa-x devoured the energy. Gulping it up like water. The she grew. Her whole body began to expand. She watched the world come into view around her slowly getting smaller as she grew larger, and larger. Even better she felt the power course through her veins. It felt like her cells were finally filled, like they had been empty, filled with dust. But now they were filled with smooth delicious power. Power her cells immediately ate up and multiplied allowing her to grow and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooorreeee!!\" Screamed Sa-x as she tipped her head back and roared. Samus simply folded her face into her palm and shook her head. As the 1 foot tall Sa-x continued to roar, acting like the power she just absorbed had made her an unstoppable titan. She had effectively blown up over 500% in size, but really it was like watching a tiny kitten think itself the king of the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me! More food! More Power!\" Sa-x continued. Suddenly the sound of couple dozen guns hitting the floor could be heard. Samus turned her head and saw the soldiers abandoning their Gear. One female soldier with slightly more shiny markings on her armor hit a button on her wrist computer. A moment later the walls turned over and revealed new weapons. Weapons that Samus watched the soldiers load with bullets...real bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yah, no, you don't want to do that trust me.\" Samus said in a warning tone. The changes she made to her body, rendered her bullet proof, but those same changes also enhanced her senses. Basically she wouldn't be hurt, but her zillions of new hyper nerve endings would let her know what she was feeling. The original idea was the heightened senses would allow her to see and communicate with people when she was much, much larger then them. In this case, it would mean bullets hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n22 Federation Marines turned towards Samus and she heard the guns simultaneously loading.<br>\r\n\"Open fire on my command.\" The Leading marine shouted.<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, don't do it. Listen to me. Do not...\" Samus began<br>\r\n\"I WANT FOOD!!\" Sa-x interrupted both sides, her voice largely out of place with the size of her body. The sheer volume shook the room, stunning everyone as Sa-x threw out her hair. The strands came alive, each attached to discarded gun, or grenade, and pulled them all back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched as Sa-x's body began to absorb energy cells, and plasma grenades. Then the actual physical objects.<br>\r\n\"Oh. UH OH! No Sa-x Stop!\" Samus said as she realized what would be next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sa-x did not stop. Instead she grew. She devoured the weapons in seconds and doubled in size. at two feet tall she plunged her hands into the floor and ripped up the titanium alloy material. Everyone watched in horror as the tiny woman began to physically devour the room. All the while her form continued to expand. 2 feet became 2 ft 6\"...then 3 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, its not enough. It's Not ENOUGH! I need MORE!\" Sa-x roared sending out tendrils of her hair in every direction. Tearing apart the room around them, her whole body continued to shake and expand. 3 feet became 4, then 5 feet, then 6 feet. Sa-x finally ran out of dense material to absorb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sa-x. Good now?\" Samus asked looking down at a woman half her size. Sa-x stared up, at Samus and then threw her hair forward. Samus stepped back, had Sa-x just attacked her. No that couldn't be, but then she saw the hair tendrils had flown around her. Then Samus heard the screams. As she turned she watched the Federation soldiers get turned to into food for Sa-x's growth. 22 humans were absorbed in total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x grew 2 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, more, more, I'm so hungry. I...Need....MO-\" Sa-x was cut off as Samus grabbed her by the face and pulled her up to her eye level and locked her lips onto hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

Opening her eye's she found Sa-x staring back, eye's half closed and body hanging limply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing Samus put the smaller woman down. <br>\r\n\"Er, Ehem. So, good now X?\" Samus asked slightly abashed at her action. That certainly wasn't how she solved most of her problems.<br>\r\n\"huh? oh yah...good, that was real good.\" Sa-x replied.<br>\r\nSamus quirked an eye brow, after a moment she coughed lightly.<br>\r\nSa-x blinked again and then shook her head. <br>\r\n\"Right, yes, sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to...\" She looked around at the room, completely tore up and decimated. Walling gone, wires exposed everywhere.<br>\r\n\"Its fine X, but we need to get moving.\" Samus Said.<br>\r\n\"No you need to eat, before you starve.\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Samus said ignoring the comment<br>\r\n\"Are not.\" Sa-x replied matter of factually<br>\r\n\"X!'' Samus's tone rose slightly<br>\r\n\"Samus!\" Sa-x raised her voice louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stopped and stared. Was she really being lectured by a 6 foot tall alien clone of herself. Then she paused and thought about it. Sa-x was no longer her enemy, she hoped, but she was concerned about something.<br>\r\n\"Okay X, why do you think I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n\"You ate a grenade and almost devoured a person cause you're so starved.\" Sa-x replied.<br>\r\n\"I was not going to...\" Samus started but stopped, she actually didn't remember eating the grenade, what had she done those few seconds she couldn't recall about.<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Listen this place is dead anyway, its no use. and it has a reactor. Let just have a nice meal. Okay?\" Sa-x put forward, and Samus found she couldn't disagree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x ripped up the nearby power lines from the floor. Each one glowed and sparked with raw power. Samus Stepped forward past Sa-x. Then she sat down behind her. Sa-x went to turn but Samus pulled her down and sat her against her body. Sa-x found her head pressed against a 12 foot tall amazon's chest.  A pair of D cups that almost engulfed her head. She smiled and began to blush, while handing Samus a power line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Samus said licking her lips and placed the entire line into her mouth. Suddenly she was flooded with warmth and bliss. Sweet sweet power flowed into her body. She felt it flow down into her chest, then her abs, her ass, all the way down to her toes. Moaning loudly she sucked on the long metal shafted filament. More and more power was pulled through the line. Samus's whole body began to shudder and expand, slowly. 12 feet and 1 inches...2 inches...3...4. Her body began to swell larger, she could feel herself growing stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x looked up worried. This was fusion reactor, and Samus was barely growing. She need power, and lots of it. She watched Samus expand nearly 12 and half feet tall. She'd have to figure this out later. She grabbed her own power line and went to place it in her mouth. Suddenly something slammed around her head. Samus's moans intensified, and Sa-x felt soft, walls of flesh begin to smother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmmm, Sham-us, yur tits ur...mmphhh!\" Sa-x began speaking but Samus's swelling bosom quickly drowned any opposition to their expansion. Sa-x began to kick and struggle, but Samus was far to absorbed in her own feeding and growth to notice the struggles of someone half her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sa-x had enough. She plunged the power line into her womanhood. She' get her power one way or another. Then her whole world lit up. Power flooded her body and she felt her urge to grow become overwhelming. Her sexual appetite on the other hand was quickly being satisfied. Sa-x let out screams of ecstasy muffled by the 13 foot tall Samus's enormous f cup juggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was lost in sheer pleasure. Growing felt great, power was delicious, and the bigger she grew the better if felt. Also that sound in the background was getting louder to, and the pressure between her breasts felt like...like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's eyes shot open and she looked down. Realizing she was smothering Sa-x, she moved to release the smaller girl. But suddenly Sa-x's form bucked and went form 6 feet to 8! <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay, easy girl!\" Samus said as she pulled back a little, Sa-x turned toward Samus and slammed her lips into Samus's. 8 feet became 10, then 12, then 14. But Sa-x didn't care, she kept pressure on Samus, deepening the kiss more and more. Revealing in her expansion, her growth, her lust! She grew bigger, hornier, bigger. Her and Samus had both reached 15 feet in size, and Sa-x felt her pussy warming up hotter and hotter, climax was close and she wanted it.She needed satisfaction and she needed it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the facilities lights died.  Sa-x's pleasure dried up, and she ended her kiss. Samus looked up partly smiling, partly moaning. But she saw Sa-x's worried look as the woman's head swiveled left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X relax, that was bound to happen sooner of later.\" Samus said grasping Sa-x by the arm<br>\r\n\"But, but i was, I was about to...\" Sa-x stood up and looked down at the dead power line still inside her womanhood.<br>\r\n\"rrrRRRAAGHHH\" Sa-x screamed and pulled in the entire power line and absorbed it, gaining practically nothing.<br>\r\n\"X! Relax, we'll get more.\" Samus said also standing to her full height, and noting the ceiling was far closer then she liked.<br>\r\n\"But! BUT!\" Sa-x began then stopped she was staring hat Samus's chest.<br>\r\n\"You okay? Oh those yeah I figured It'd be fun.\" Samus replied as she noticed where Sa-x's eye's were locked. Sa-x's eye's went wide and she stared at her with huge puppy dog eye's. <br>\r\nSamus was a little disturbed by that. On one hand it was adorable, on the other she didn't like seeing that look on her face.<br>\r\n\"But...I'm supposed to be the busty one!!\" Sa-x whined.<br>\r\n\"You're kidding right?\" Samus asked flatly<br>\r\n\"NO! I like having big breasts, you like it too! I have the tits, you have the a-....uhh....assets.\" Sa-x said cutting off her sentence from implementing that Samus's ass was the larger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus simply stared. Then she inhaled deeply her massive chest rising. She could feel the extra weight, it felt good, but it made Sa-x feel bad so it would have to go. She exhaled and cleared her thoughts. <br>\r\n\"Enough, I'll fix my tits later, when we have more power and I can afford to do it. For now we're leaving.\" Samus said and turned towards the elevator and stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhh will that work without power?\" Sa-x asked as she watched Samus begin turning an angry shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus and Sa-x</span></div></div>",

Oddly enough even at 15 ft tall, both realized they could probably fit into the chamber, albeit barely. But having drained the facilities power source they wouldn't be going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for real? You Mean to tell me this place doesn't have a backup generator?!\" Samus asked aloud staring at the inert lift. This would make twice today that she'd been thwarted by a hollow metal chamber, stupid med pod, and that was unacceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Backup power source? Why are you still hungry for growth? Wait dumb question.\" Sa-x corrected herself<br>\r\n\"Glad you're thinking with something other than your stomach and loins, now\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you want more growth! Who doesn't!  Being big is awesome!\" Sa-x let out her joyful proclamation.more excited by the fact she wouldn't  have to work so hard to get Samus to grow and feed on power. Aside from her gaining sentience that was probably the roughest part of their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus simply sighed and shook her head. Wondering for a brief moment how her life had come to this. Standing in an underground federation lab, as a goddess, with barely any power, freeing what was arguably the most dangerous creature in existence, all because she wanted a friend. She swore she could hear the chozo laughing from here. They always warned her friendship and love would be the greatest challenges of life...She just didn't think they meant it would be like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, those birds were practically psychic\u2026\" Samus mused before turning towards Sa-x. \"We need to escape if we're going to find more power.\" Samus began to explain only to be cut off by Sa-x again<br>\r\n\"Oh, so why don't we power up the elevator and take it out of here?\" <br>\r\nSamus tilted her head and simply motioned her arm outward for Sa-x to proceed if she thought it was so simple. To which Sa-x stepped forward and placed her hand on the control panel. A moment later her delicate fingers morphed into liquid like tendrils. They infiltrated the panel and Sa-x used the barest hint of her own energy to turn the elevator back on, it didn't even cost her any height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stood shocked, then smiled, she could work with the easy solution. No need to constantly take the hard  way every time after all.<br>\r\n\"After you.\" Sa-x motioned as the doors slid open.<br>\r\nSamus hesitated only a moment, she still wasn't fond of metal containers and their tendency to trap her, but she wasn't one to let fear stop her from doing anything. As both 15ft tall, amazon sized women stepped into the pod, they realized it was going to be a snug fit. Samus pushed herself against the wall far as she could and Sa-x slid in next to her. In the tiny pod Sa-x turned around till she was facing Samus trying to get in far enough that the elevators doors would shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't they close?\" Sa-x asked frustration creeping into her tone<br>\r\n\"It's federation safety, nothing can be too close to the doors, supposed to stop idiots from hurting themselves\u2026..and prevent anything larger\u2026.than a...person from\u2026.leaving.\" Samus replied as her voice died down, she had just been thwarted by her own size and power.<br>\r\n\"I guess we have to expend some energy to shrink down.\"<br>\r\n\"NO! No get smaller, I hate being small!\" Sa-x screamed suddenly wrenching herself to the left, trying to make more room.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x it's only for a moment.\" Samus replied<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Sa-x roared, she actually roared, her voice booming up so loud it shook the whole complex.<br>\r\nSamus stared questioningly at Sa-x, waiting for an explanation.<br>\r\n\"You, you wouldn't understand, I...I was, and on some level, am just a single x parasite. I started life, and until just a few minutes ago was the size of a single cell.\" Sa-x said lowering her tone.<br>\r\n\"Oh, X, I, um\u2026.it never...that is\" Samus found herself tripping over words looking for the right way to comfort Sa-x, but Samus wasn't particularly good at comforting others, normally she solved problems with action, not words.<br>\r\n\"It's, it's fine, you didn't know. It's just that, when you're a cell everyone is bigger than you. Massive and powerful, and you can't do much about it.\" Sa-x let out her fears and worries. Cramped together in the tiny elevator with Samus. their bodies inches away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I don't want to be small, ever again. I just want to be big...like...real big, like massive!\" Sa-x continued<br>\r\n\"Oh,how big are we talking?\" Samus asked playfully,  taking the opportunity to relieve her friends worries.<br>\r\n\"BIG! Massive! I want to eat stars again! I want to grow and grow, and grow till galaxies are puny, tiny little cells compared to ME! I want creation to look up and not even see my face for the celestial orbs I will have for Breasts!\" Sa-x began to rant and Samus let her go, enjoying the imagery, the idea of Sa-x growing to an unstoppable, giga sized, universe eating goddess again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this whole universe to spin around a single pussy HAIR! I want the infinite multiverse to serve as fucking G-string, barely able to contain my GLORY! I WANT TO BE BIG, BIGGER THE  EVERYTHING!! BIGGER THAN YOU, AND TIME, AND SPACE AND AND\u2026.\"  Sa-x began to scream as her body began glowing with power attempting to fulfill her wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the light from her body suddenly dimmed. Sa-x realized what she had just tried to do. To alter reality, and she could have if she had enough power, but she just didn't have what she needed.  Then she remembered how Samus generally reacted to threats to herself and the galaxy at large. Sa-x paled, what if she just pissed off Samus, not only did the hunter have a good track record of killing things that made her angry, but that was before she was a goddess. Sa-x looked up and saw...Samus giggling? The fearsome 15ft tall blond haired, blue zero suit clad, bounty hunter was giggling? Sa-x said nothing, mostly out of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable when you're power hungry.\" Samus said as she finished tittering on. Sa-x simply blushed, and looked away.<br>\r\n\"Well if we're gonna get you back to a star eating, galaxy smothering, universe fucking, omni-goddess, we first will have to escape this sinister federation trap.\" Samus replied laughter creeping back into her tone<br>\r\n\"You're not angry?\" Sa-x whispered gently<br>\r\n\"I would be if I didn't know I was immune to the danger you pose. Being an actual goddess kinda puts things in a different perspective. Though honestly I think we have a lot to learn about being gods.\" Samus finished<br>\r\n\"Okay, so move your phat ass over so I can squeeze in closer.\" Sa-x replied.<br>\r\n\"Excuse you? My ass is not fat.\" Samus deadpanned<br>\r\n\"Well one of us is the problem, and it's not the shapeshifter.\" Sa-x replied smugly<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, your little assets are far too...small... to impede anything.\" Samus shot back.<br>\r\nSa-x simply glared, red blush filling up her face, that was a crack at her chest and she knew it. She wasn't an expert on this whole humor and joking thing yet, but she recognized an insult when she saw one. She had double D's where Samus currently sported a massive set of G cup sized melons.  Tits she only had thanks to Sa-x's suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr, fine move over tubby!\"<br>\r\n\"Tubby!\" Samus shouted, that one was uncalled for and she'd let the little mimic know it. Samus reached forward, grabbed Sa-x and plunged her head and torso into her own massive mounds.<br>\r\n\"Hold your breath\u2026.tiny\" Samus said as she watched the doors close.<br>\r\n\"Rrrmmmrphmmm!\" Came the angry muffled screams of the universe's secondly most deadly woman. As the elevator slowly began its ascent up to the surface. Moments passed and Samus sensed something was awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lights went out.<br>\r\n\"No\u2026..\" came Samus's anger through gritted teeth. This could not be happening.<br>\r\n\"Uh, why did we stop moving.\" Sa-x asked head still buried in Samus's enormous cleavage.<br>\r\nThe automated response came a moment later, a synthetic sounding female voice updating the occupants of the lift of their situation.<br>\r\n\"Caution, insufficient power to raise lift to desired level. Likely due to weight limit being exceeded. Help will be in the way shortly\" said the voice as a small red alarm light slowly faded due to lack of power.<br>\r\n\"Did\u2026.did it just call us fat?\" Sa-x asked hesitantly <br>\r\n\"No, it called itself weak.\" Samus again replied through tightly clamped teeth. <br>\r\nSa-x squirmed in place till she got one of her hands free. Gently patted Samus on the head. Samus took the condescending pat gracefully. Then Sa-x spoke again, malefic  is glee I her tone.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I still like you. Even if you are a bit on the heavy side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above at topside Lt. Steel was standing guard, he let the hunter in, calmly watched the alarms go off, heard the gunfire, and then even heard something that sounded like sex with a lightning storm. None of that phased him. Was it dereliction of duty\u2026.maybe, but he always thought of himself as a survivor first. That said, his survival instincts engaged their warp drive, and left his body frozen in place, when he heard what sounded nuclear detonation fighting a dragon. <br>\r\n\"Man, I hope whatever that was, Samus can handle it.\" Steel worried to himself aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was currently breathing deeper than she had in a longtime. She had plenty of life and death encounters, the sensation of her own heart thundering in her chest wasn't unusual. And labored breathing accompanied lots of stressful situations. Furthermore , her chozo training had prepared to handle all kinds of stress. Trapped in an elevator, a few hundred feet underground with a condescending 15 ft alien copy of herself, after re-arranging the universe at her whim however, may have been outside the realm of reasonable training scenarios and experiences. Sa-x grinned smugly from in between Samus's massive chest. Only face and a few strands of hair visible, between the enormous endowments.<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop being coy.\" Samus said, finally catching her breath.<br>\r\n\"Feel better after letting that out? If not You can take some more time, de-stress, maybe break a few sound barriers with your voice.\"<br>\r\n\"Enough, I am done with this place, and we are leaving. Elevator or no!\" Samus said as she reached overhead and popped the emergency release hatch. It would allow them both to simply climb up the shaft to surface.She hadn't wanted to climb chozo only knows how far to the surface, but she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus and Sa-x began to shift and squeeze around the tight confines of the elevator. Bumping arms, legs, tits, and was to add. Trying to find a way to reach the hatch. After about ten minutes of this they had managed to finally stand up, face to face, chest to massively tight chest, as the left side of the elevator simply gave, and crunched outward from the stress of a 15 ft Samus's ass pressed hard against it. Titanium alloy no match for huge hunter's buns of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed this was gonna take some work. She looked DOWN at her G cupped sized breasts, straining the fabric of her zero suit, nipples practically visible. She would have to expend energy to shrink down. But she absolutely hated the thought of doing so. She already felt cold and tight again, the heat and freedom of her last act of sucking dry the reactor core with Sa-x had faded minutes ago. She really didn't want to shrink her tits and lose height while doing so, but asking Sa-x to shrink would probably just proc another bout of shouting from her. The Samus had an idea, she didn't need to really shrink, and Sa-x was easily tall enough to reach the hatch, they just needed a few inches of room. If Sa-x could just shrink part of her anatomy, not her whole self they could easily climb out into the shaft and escape. Okay thought Samus, time to see how much she's willing to cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X, I know how to get out here without either of us shrinking down.\" Samus said cautiously <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay that's good, cause i hate being small, almost as much as i hate looking at your tits right now.\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n\"You don't like my chest?\" Samus said honestly a little hurt<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, no, it's not that, I just,umm, what's the word again\u2026.ah right I'm experiencing jealousy\u2026.I don't like girls with bigger tits than me. I really do like yours in general though.\" Sa-x explained. Gazing down at their chests, Samus and Sa-x looked at the swollen mounds of flesh, each set pressed so firmly together that the canyons of cleavage were only distinguishable from each other by the fact that Samus's were nearly 30% larger. To the point they were spilling almost on top of Sa-x's chest.<br>\r\n\"So how do we get out of here?\" Sa-x asked, looking innocent and hopeful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh,well we need to\u2026..that is\u2026\" Samus began and then she stopped, looked at Sa-x and then down to their compressed bosom, then back at Sa-x. Samus watched as her plan dawned on Sa-x, her eye's once filled with innocent hope, became worried, then fearful, and finally settled on the emotion Samus was sure her face wore 90% of the time, anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Sa-x replied calmly<br>\r\n\"X, please.\" <br>\r\n\"No.\" Sa-x said more firmly<br>\r\n\"You are a shapeshifter, I know you can do it without expending any of your power. So you won't shrink. Just your chest will.\" Samus said trying to reason with Sa-x.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you shrink then! It's your plan!\" Sa-x shot back.<br>\r\n\"X, one I'm not shapeshifter, two I'm the bigger of us right now it would take more power then you just moving some flesh around.\" Samus said, trying to speed this along.<br>\r\n\"Oh cause you're bigger? Bustier?! I'll show you busty!\" Sa-x shouted and before Samus could say anything back Sa-x screwed her eye's shut and began shifting her mass. She stole mass from her own ass, as she was a copy of Samus she had plenty to spare. Then she pushed it into her chest rapidly expanding her own bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt the pressure around her chest increase, and suddenly the already too tight chamber got even more cramped. As Sa-x's tits began to increase in size. Double D's pushing to F cups, then G. <br>\r\n\"This is the opposite of what needs to happen X!\" Samus said, as the increased pressure was making it difficult to breath. Looking  down she could see her and Sa-x's chest were now equal in size. The two massive bosoms competing to occupy the same space formed quite the mountain of cleavage. Two normal sized women with asset's this large would have been impressive to see, but two 15 ft tall amazons? At their size beach balls was a truthful description of their not so modest juggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sa-x kept going. Samus watched as the already enormous endowments of Sa-x continued to grow larger. Where on earth was she getting all this mass? The answer would have to wait as Samus watched her G cup sized breasts get overpowered by H cup sized monsters. But Sa-x wasn't stopping, H cups gave way to I cups, then her whole bosom began to shake. Centimetre by centimetre the gigantic chest of Sa-x began to push Samus's smaller tits into her body.<br>\r\n\"X! Enough, you're going to crush me!\"<br>\r\n\"Who's got the tiny tits now Huh! Who needs to shrink their bust so we can get out now Huh!\" Sa-x replied with anger evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x, stop, I can't breath!\" Samus said voice getting raspy<br>\r\n\"What? Yes you can you're a\u2026..\" Sa-x didn't finish speaking but her thoughts sped forward in her mind. <br>\r\n\"You're a mortal goddess, who can be hurt. Who I could lose again if I'm not careful\" Sa-x finished, as Samus currently smothered under j cup sized monster tits vainly pushed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus went flying forward in a split second most of the pressure removed from her chest. She looked forward and saw Sa-x standing there wearing a look of concern. Again it was very unsettling, Samus was sure there were emotions her face was never meant to display. She tipped her head slightly to see her and Sa-x were now sporting the same size bust. Which meant it was still really cramped in the pod but it beat what was happening two minutes ago.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x we have a lot to work out. About being goddesses of this world, what we feel about each other. But it starts with getting back to the surface. Okay? so just work with me, please.\" Samus pleaded, she was exhausted, hungry for power, and tired of being stuck in a small pod with another huge woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, and Sa-x made a pouty face, making her appear much younger than she was. Then she spoke, quietly and in a defeated tone.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll reduce myself\u2026..Just this once! So, don't go making a habit of asking me to do this, okay!\" Sa-x half shouted half pouted. Then with a look of concentration she focused on her breasts, and within a moment they began to shrink, as G cups became f cups, pressured backed off Samus's own chest. F shrank down to E, Then finally double DD's. The size Sa-x normally walked around at, aka one size larger than Samus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus immediately opened the hatch and started to pull up and was stopped by Sa-x. More precisely her body.<br>\r\n\"Okay X, this is where we started...you need to go smaller.\" Samus said as politely as she could muster<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Groaned Sa-x as her double D's deflated to D cups. <br>\r\nSamus managed to slip her own chest past Sa-x and began wiggling her definitely not fat, no matter what this elevators' weight limit said, body through the hatch. 15ft of gorgeous blond bounty hunter made it almost all the way, till her ass got stuck on something. Something soft yet firm.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh Sa-x, I'm a little stuck.'' Samus said <br>\r\n\"I can see that miss badon-ka-donk!\" Sa-x replied while staring at Samus's curvy bottom currently compressing her chest.<br>\r\n\"Right, so uhh...little smaller if you please.\" Samus said fully anticipating shouting, or maybe getting bit, or kicked.<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME! Smaller because your fa-, because your curvy ass can't fit through a 4 foot hole!\" Sa-x screamed<br>\r\n\"X please, can't we just\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"Rrrrragh! Fine! Freaking smaller it is.\" Sa-x half growled and took her D cups down to C's. Samus then attempted to lift herself further, and again got stuck. Sa-x watched with anger, glad Samus couldn't see the face she was making, and reduced her chest down to a B cup. It felt wrong, but Samus's curvy ass began to squeeze by.  Right till she had to twist her hips for the last part to get her legs through.  She couldn't get them to move left or right. Samus gulped, closed her eye's, and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X?\"<br>\r\n\"No\u2026..you can't be serious\u2026.\" Samus could hear the venom in her tone.<br>\r\n\"Just a little more, like an inch or two\u2026.\" Samus replied embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"You fat, fucking whore!\" Sa-x screamed and Samus winced, she knew that tone, it was the same one she used when she had to deal with too much federation paperwork, or any problem violence couldn't solve. Suddenly her hips came free. She could move! Then she went flying upward 4 extra feet as Sa-x slapped her ass with enough force to push her out the rest of the way.<br>\r\nSa-x climbed out of the hatch next, and Samus saw a sight she hadn't seen since was teenager. As Sa-x stood up, her chest was nearly perfectly flat, barely an A-cup for Breasts. Samus stifled a giggle, and covered her mouth  with one hand. Sa-x looked like she wanted to kill something, maybe everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free of their confinement both women made their way to the surface. To find\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>LT. Steel was still standing guard when he heard the sound of something climbing up the lift shaft. Made sense with the power out, and he hadn't heard any more thunderous roars, so clearly the hunter had dealt with the problem. However he also remembered the security briefing they had every month. Particularly the doppelganger protocols. The federation had become real strict on that stuff real fast after the first escaped test subject. Taking a risk he might regret steel picked up his plasma rifle and shouldered the gun, clicking the safety off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus emerged first. Climbing up out of the tunnel she was greeted to the sight of fresh air, sunshine, the standard security checkpoint housing, and Lt. Steel' s plasma rifle leveled at her head.<br>\r\n\"Soldier, I like you. So I'm going to give you some advice. Do not shoot me.\" Samus said very calmly. <br>\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of shooting the one and only Samus Aran, ma'am. Assuming that is you are her and not some alien doppelganger.\" Steel replied.<br>\r\n\"I, okay yes, that's a very good point. So I'm gonna stand up nice and slow and you tell me how I prove it's me, fair nuff?\" Samus asked<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead ma'am.\" Came Steel's calm and cool answer. Steel kept his rifle straight, finger on the trigger. A better soldier might have tracked the opponent's  head as it moved, but in Steel' s case he wound up too shocked to do much but stare. After all, the zero suit left very little to the imagination. As Samus rose up to her full height Steel found himself eye to eye with an enormous set of rising breasts, then waist, finally a blue synthetic clad crotch. The suit he was staring at was pulled so tight he could practically make out the camel toe of Samus's woman hood, straining against the confinement. Taking a step back steel gazed upon the giant blonde bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, ma'am, er, record has you at about 6 ft 3 inches. You're not making a convincing argument for the whole, not a shapeshifter deal.\" Steel said worry evident in his tone.<br>\r\n\"Yah, I know, just wait a minute.\" Samus said and turned her head to watch as Sa-x came out of the lift shaft next. Steel had been left speechless by Samus I  the zero suit. But the naked 15 ft tall Sa-x left him momentarily befuddled.<br>\r\n\"I, you, but that isn't. Is it?No, but, looks like\u2026\". Steel blabbered on as Sa-x rose to her full height next to Samus.<br>\r\n\"What's his problem?\" Sa-x asked<br>\r\n\"His mind's blown, I have that effect on most men, and some women, and the occasional alien. But few people can stand the sight of one of me let alone two, with one being naked.\" Samus answered.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that makes sense.\" Sa-x said as she began to stretch, pushing out her flat chest, and drawing attention to her toned abs. <br>\r\n\"Wait! OH holy hell, that's the doppel!\" Steel shouted, raising his rifle again and training it on Sa-x.<br>\r\n\"Yes that's my double, I'd ask you kindly not to shoot her either.\" Samus calmly stated, placing a hand on the rifle.<br>\r\n\"Why not? I could for a treat.\" Sa-x said eyeing the weapon.<br>\r\n\"Because Lt. Steel here is smarter than the average soldier. His rifle is set to inversion mode. It's set to ice. To drain heat.\" Samus said, taking the rifle from steel. He tried to keep ahold of it, but his strength though not unimpressive, was no match for hers.<br>\r\nSa-x lept behind Samus and immediately began to hiss. Her eye's turned to cat-like slits and changed color to an eerie golden green. While she raised her hair again, forming tendrils ready to strike. A goddess she might be but, just the idea of getting frozen was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd you know she was fake. I mean she's naked and all, but my own attire isn't exactly casual, or modest for that matter.\" Samus purposely stretching out her back and thrusting her enormous chest forward. <br>\r\n\"Well actually that was kinda it. Outside the creature not having clothes she's not modest either, meanwhile you might make the argument you're not super modest right now either, I can tell your putting effort into this little show. Too much to be natural  but that's expected of the universe's  most feared bounty hunter. Compensating one area with another.\" Steel explained.  Samus realized her over the top display hadn't quite accomplished what she wanted. But honestly she was just glad there was a soldier willing to talk before shooting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the real tip off was the shifters lack of anatomical understanding.\" Steel continued <br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Samus, and Sa-x poked her head out from around Samus to hear this conversation more clearly, while wondering  what she did wrong. Sa-x was an x parasite...her imitation was perfect, right down to every last strand of DNA. What had this soldier found that she missed, she had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Miss Aran, when you came out larger then when you went in, I was suspicious, but then I saw your...um..that is it's hard to ignore\u2026\" Steel began but stopped looking for a way to say what he needed that wouldn't result in his death.<br>\r\n\"My tits are huge, yes I know.\" Samus replied seriously, but the slightest smirk was on her lips. <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, that. But see it would be common for a normal person to over enhance their charisma \u2026, so that wasn't too odd given you walked in at 12 ft tall and something happened?\" Steel explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but how did you know, uh I mean, what makes you think I'm a fake?\" Sa-x asked not aware her speech patterns made it deathly obvious she wasn't Samus.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's simple. You have no chest. You're flat as a board. Clearly as some sort of shapeshifting predator you maximized your build for leanness, and reduced any unnecessary fat. You probably couldn't stand having normal sized breasts let alone Samus sized ones.\" Steel explained. Not realizing his tried and true survival instincts may have just critically failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus clapped her hands over her mouth to cover the smile and following laugh that tried to break out. Screw it she was keeping Steel, this man was too valuable, and entertaining to let go. Or that was her plan until she felt something going flying by her so fast it almost knocked all 15 ft of on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY BOOBS YOU LITTLE EXCUSE FOR CANNED FOOD!\" Sa-x said rushing forward and slamming Lt. Steel and his armor to the ground. She straddled the man and he was left gazing up at the naked form of a flat chested Samus Aran. Then he saw something he could barely believe. Sa-x\u2019s chest began to expand. Her breasts simply grew, larger, and rounder, and more firm every passing second. Soon they had gone from non-existent to freaking DD\u2019s. But they didn\u2019t stop. Sa-x forced more and more mass into her chest and leaned down. Intent to smother Lt. Steel, as the massive H cup juggs of a 15 ft tall woman fell forward, Steel was sure this was the end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steel thought this was the end, but really was this the worst way to go? Smothered in the cleavage of a huge sexy Samus clone. He could think of worse ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not to be. Samus stepped up behind Sa-x and lifted the  woman off of Lt. Steel. Sa-x had expected that to happen to little, that she simply hovered there in Samus's grip. Then turned her head towards Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Samus, I can't smother him if you hold me this high.\" Sa-x politely informed the goddess holding her.<br>\r\n\"Yes I know, but we need to go. Or we will be here all day. Beside. I like him.\" Samus said throwing Sa-x to the side. Sa-x hit the ground and looked up pouting and confused. What the hell was happening. Samus was her friend, she walked into a secret military installation just to get her. She threw away her chance at normalcy for this, why discard her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reached over and helped Lt. Steel stand back up. <br>\r\n\"C'mon sexy, you basically deserted your duty.If I don't keep you safe no one will. No follow my perfect ass back to my ship, we have work to do.\" Samus said and Lt. Steel began to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding off to the side Sa-x registered sound coming form Samus, but her whole world stopped and went dark, sound muffled, and everything but the image of Lt. Steel faded. The last thing she heard was C'mon Sexy. Samus thought he was sexy. Samus liked him, he would take her Samus away. He was supplanting her. The last time Sa-x experienced this kind of stress was when she stared down that metroid. The one that resembled the one from Samus's memories, convinced it was adorable and determined to supplant her and Samus's favorite.<br>\r\nFirst there was metroid, now there was Steel. Sa-x knew how to solve this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was walking forward when she heard the faintest sound. like a pillow softly hitting another pillow. She didn't think much of it at first. Then she thought for moment. Realized she hadn't checked on what Sa-x was doing in the last 10 seconds, and turned around jsut to be sure. Samus was both glad she did and horrified at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was wrapped around Lt. Steel, Her body half fluid, tearing apart his armor. while the rest of her maintained her form. It was freaky, it looked like Her front half exploded into slime and tendrils, while her face and legs held fine. A huge smile spread over her face. The last of Steel's armor dissolved, and he began to struggle violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SA-X STOP! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\" Samus screamed as she dashed forward and grabbed Steel.<br>\r\n\"NO! He wants to STEAL YOU! I WON'T LET HIM!\" Sa-x shouted fear and anger mixed in her tone. But she held onto Steel tightly. Steel could feel the acidic nature of the x parasite dissolving his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was done. She had reset reality, been trapped in no less then two metal death pods, been shot at repeatedly, lost access to her armor. Found one, ONE! intelligent person, and her friend and now her friend was trying to kill what was in her opinion the only other sane person left. She expended her power, shrank to 13ft, re-equipped her arm cannon and set it for ice mode. then she charged the cannon and pointed it at Sa-x's face point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was absorbed in her efforts, when suddenly she felt a sensation. One she didn't like, pain, cold, weakness. She looked up and saw the hunter leveling her ice beam at her. Sa-x froze, not literally, just stopped doing anything.<br>\r\n\"Sa-Samus....wha...what are you doing?\" Sa-x asked fear causing her voice to tremble.<br>\r\n\"Let...Him....Go.\" Samus said without any emotion.<br>\r\nSa-x did exactly as she was told. Lt. Steel fell to ground gasping  ,clutching his side Sa-x had started eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Samus watched as Steel stood back up. Then the silence broke. By a sound Samus was sure didn't exist. An impossible sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of herself crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that couldn't be, Samus didn't cry, period. And X parasite not only didn't cry, but Sa-x had only her emotions/memories to work off of, so she shouldn't have understood what crying was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...sniff...what is this...sniff...why am i...what are these.\" Sa-x said as she raised her hands to her eyes. Samus simply lowered her gun. She couldn't believe this shit. <br>\r\n\"Is this a joke?\" Samus asked still no emotion in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Lt. Steel who stepped forward. looking eye to eye with Sa-x, only possible cause the 15 ft woman was sitting down, he held out his hand.<br>\r\n\"I get it, I do. I have an extreme aversion to dying. Its served me well, but also means I watched a lot people I care for...disappear.\" Steel started.<br>\r\n\"I..sniff...What does that have to...sniff do with me.\" Sa-x replied, she could speak straight what the hell was wrong with her.<br>\r\nSteel leaned in very close, and whispered to her something in her ear. Sa-x froze, then blushed. Was it that obvious, or maybe it was a human thing. a moment later he said something else in hushed tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched this all play out. She couldn't tell if she was relieved or not. All she knew was Steel was sticking around until ...well until forever. Far as she was concerned he could be her high priest, or general, or whatever she ended up needing for her new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x stood up, turned towards Samus and then did something Samus didn't expect her to ever do sincerely. She apologized.<br>\r\nSa-x finally understood why on some level what she did was wrong. <br>\r\n\"I...I get it. You don't...your a goddess you don't just belong to me. Other people care for you, and so do I and....I would like to go with you, and I promise not to hurt anyone you care about.\" Sa-x said as formally as she could muster. Then she took off towards the nearest energy signature she could sense, presuming it to be Samus's ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched the 15 ft sexy clone of herself walk on by. Then she looked at Lt. Steel, and glared.<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon what?!\" Steel said exasperated all he wanted to do was not die.<br>\r\n\"You're dangerous...I like that, its cute, and attractive...but also makes you threat.\" Samus replied coolly.<br>\r\n\"Are you ever happy?\" Steel asked<br>\r\n\"This is me happy.\" Samus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus walked back towards her ship following behind Sa-x. She looked back only to see It. Steel moving at jog to keep up. Apparently not being 15 ft tall made keeping up with the two mini-giantesses somewhat of a challenge. As the group created a nearby hill Samus could see her ship sitting at the base of the nearby hill. Right where she left it. Unfortunately what wasn't as she left it was the small woman scurrying around the inside the ship. She couldn't tell who they were, but she could see movement in the cockpit. At this point with so little info, all she knew about the woman was one of two things. Either one she was another stupid fan girl, or two she had bad decision making skills to find herself in the universe's most feared bounty hunters ship. Either way this woman was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the ship, Sa-x turned towards Samus tilting her head. She could sense another life form in the ship. <br>\r\n\"Oh I know, and we're gonna fix this.\" Samus said as she summoned her holo tablet and opened her ship's doors.<br>\r\nLin saw the doors to the ship, she grabbed a handful of objects she was looting and ran for it. She had wandered into the ship to try and figure out a way to escape her situation, only to wind up locked inside. She had been gathering what she would need to blow or hack the door open, but she wasn't wasting this opportunity. Chozo knows if the bounty hunter found her in her ship she was a dead woman. Long story short, Lin was not going to question her only chance at freedom. She barreled down the open ramp of the ship at top speed and slammed face first into a wall of some sort. Rebounding backwards onto her ass Lin looked up, and was greeted with the sight even more terrifying than last time She saw Samus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin giantesses stared down at Lin. One clad in a skin tight blue latex suit, the other in nothing but the buff. Lin looked up and found she could barely confirm they were indeed Samus. To do that she'd need to see their faces, and two sets of enormous flesh covered beachballs were making that currently  impossible. Lin stood up to her full height to get a better view, and promptly regretted her decision as she came eye to thigh with the nude Samus. Blushing Lin looked upward and saw that larger woman staring back, a curious smile on her face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Asked the beautiful Amazonian Aran<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but she better have a good reason for being on my ship.\" replied the Samus in the zero suit.<br>\r\n\"Oh, um yes, sorry, let me introduce myself, uh...i'm\" Lin spoke nervously letting her anxiety and weak composure buy her some time. For whatever reason Samus didn't recognize her from earlier. So she needed a lie, something simple, harmless, that would get her out of here.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're Lin Daigon! Arms dealer and leader of\u2026..shoot was that gang's name\u2026.\" It. Steel spoke up answering for Lin<br>\r\n\"Arms dealer? Your people sell arms\u2026.I thought your species was born with all your arms.\" The naked Samus asked curiously.  <br>\r\n\"Yes Sa-x we are, what Steel means is...she...smuggles\u2026..YOU!!\" Samus's voice rose to shout as it finally dawned on her who the woman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin let out a curse, and turned to run. Hopefully all that extra mass meant the Hunter was slow to start in terms of sprinting. The 5 ft 2 inch woman soon found out nothing was further from the truth, as Samus Aran caught up to her in three quick steps. Lin felt herself lifting off the ground, and was turned to face Samus Aran. This woman had nearly killed Lin when she was only a few feet taller then, now she was nearly triple her size. Lin didn't like her chances, but then she remembered something. Something that might just save her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I saw you! With the power bombs! Please I can help you!\" She shouted as Samus began to apply pressure to the woman's neck, throttling her with a single hand.<br>\r\n\"I don't need your help, you followed me despite my warning, you raided my ship, you're trouble, that's all you are.\" Samus said her tone lacking emotion <br>\r\nFrom the side lines Sa-x turned her head towards It. Steel.<br>\r\n\"What's trouble?\" Sa-x asked <br>\r\n\"Seriously?  Don't you as an X parasite have like all of Samus's memories, surely you know what trouble is.\" Steel answered quizzically<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I try not to use them, relying on them too much means there's not much difference between me, and Samus. Also your language has a lot double words, with multiple meanings.\" Sa-x explained then asked \" So again, what's trouble?\"<br>\r\n\"Based on my recent experience, trouble is sexy.\" Steel answered smiling<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I trouble as well?\" Sa-x asked, she knew that word had multiple meanings.<br>\r\n\"Tons of it.\" Steel said not even hiding his stare as he ran his eyes up and down the gorgeous woman's body. Sa-x smirked, not only was she getting better at picking on body language, but she approved of this admiration for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough flirting with my doppelganger! We are finishing this and moving on!\" Samus interrupted, while still holding Lin by the throat.<br>\r\n\"Seriously...cough..I can help...get you power..cough...lots of power..\" Lin managed to choke out.<br>\r\nSamus was about to finish what she started when Sa-x put a hand on her arm.<br>\r\n\"How much is a lot?\" Sa-x asked, she knew Samus was still a starving goddess and she'd do anything to fix this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na lot is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samus looked skeptical but Sa-x nodded eagerly. <br>\r\n\"What have we to lose? We were going to have to do this sooner or later. Right?\" Sa-x asked, practically pleading.<br>\r\n''Sa-x, I don't think. Listen we can get a different power source, I'll find us something to..\" Samus began but Sa-x cut her off. Sa-x realized Samus wasn't going to feed fast enough, and if she didn't start absorbing power soon bad things could happen. Explaining that and convincing Samus would take way too long so Sa-x opted for a different approach.<br>\r\n\"But I want to power NOW! I'm HUNGRY, and I want to get BIGGER!\" Sa-x half whined half shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Samus took a step back and suddenly remembered Sa-x's feeding frenzy in the federation lab. She had tore up physical matter to satiate her appetite. Samus suspected if she didn't get Sa-x food and power soon she might just start eating the planet raw.<br>\r\nSo with great reluctance Samus put Lin down. She then motioned for everyone to get on the ship. Once aboard Samus told Lin to explain how to get to the city power grid. To Samus's surprise the woman provided some very competent directions. Apparently her and her gang smuggled guns using the city maintenance tunnels, and they had ways to bypass security locks with ease. After landing and finding an access tunnel, Samus, Sa-x, Steel, and Lin were inside face to face with a giant fusion reactor core. Everyone's eye's widened,  none of them had ever seen a city generator in person. The freaking thing was huge. A 100 ft tall and 50ft wide solid metal and ceramic structure, glowing with light from the power of a small star contained within. It was lined with tubes, valves, panels, and power lines all housed in a giant cylindrical structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus could feel her senses open up upon entering the room. The power and ambient energy leaking out of this bad boy was enough for her to passively start feeding. She could feel the buzz of electrons in the air, the warmth hitting her, the feeling of veins no longer feeling like they were pinched so tight she'd die. Her heart beating in chest, her chest quivering, nipples fully erect beneath the zero suit. Then her mind opened, she could feel the emotions and sense the others actions around her. Lin's heart was racing, fear and adrenaline vying for control. It. Steel was gawking, and not at the reactor, good let him stare, she thought soon the world would be staring. Then there was Sa-x, Samus had to look to confirm what her senses were telling her, but they were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was actively drooling, mouth open slack jawed, muscles tightened looking like she was ready to pounce and mount the reactor. Her massive chest heaving, making her tits bounce lightly. Remembering her promise from earlier, Samus used a little of this energy to adjust her own chest back from over ample G cups to mere D's. Then she began moving towards the reactor slowly walking, placing one long smooth leg in front of the other, cat walk style. As she slid up next to the reactor she could feel the eye's glued to her ass. Normally she'd be upset at such objectification, but given what was coming next she figured she needed to get over such modest concerns. Placing a hand on the reactor, Samus was rewarded with instant gratification, as power flowed from then reactor into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for X, it's dinner time.\" Samus cooed as her whole body began to glow and pulse with energy. Soon she felt herself growing, and it felt delicious. Her whole body was expanding growing bigger and bigger, each pulse caused her grow larger, 13 ft became 15 ft, then 17...20...25. Still her body grew, the zero suit was getting closer to its limit stretching thinner, hugging her every curve, tighter and tighter. Still her size increased as 25ft became 28...30\u2026.32, at which point her senses opened up even further she could feel the world around her. She could feel every molecule  of her being getting stronger, bigger! She could feel her tits and ass expanding larger and larger, pushing the zero suit to the straining point. And oh the lust! Her own was building, heat swelling in her womanhood, begging for release. Even more was the lust of the others. Lin, for all her fear was enjoying the spectacle of Samus's growth, Steel's libido pulsed a little harder every time Samus's ass pushed another few inches outward. And Sa-x\u2026.Samus's eye's flew open just in time to catch her copycat leap forward, intent on her face clear, to ride Samus to ground and give way to her primal urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Samus's wasn't done feeding, not by a long shot. She caught Sa-x in one hand slammed the X parasite clone into the reactor wall hard enough to send cracks through the casing. Sa-x screamed in frustration and pleasure as power flooded her body. Not even half Samus's size anymore, and she tried to struggle, to slip Samus's grip and make her pay. Pay in power and sex, and whatever else she could dream up. But Samus held her firmly down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here X, eat up! become a nice big strong girl for Samus! Ahahaha! Nom nom!\" Samus laughed perhaps a little too manically as she pressed Sa-x's whole body into the reactor. At which point Steel and Lin snapped out of their deluge long enough to look at each other, both their looks said the same thing, that laugh was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sa-x bucked and kicked and power and heat washed over her. But Samus wasn't going to let her out clearly.  Sa-x hadn't actually wanted to start feeding yet dammit. She knew Samus needed to grow and satisfy herself, and she wanted her to get her fill. Unfortunately, that plan came apart when Samus's ass almost doubled in size. Sa-x had barely contained herself watching Samus grow and grow, and grow. But the minute the zero suit stretched itself to the point of transparency and Sa-x watched Samus's breasts begin expand and her ass fill out, and every perfect curve, and her impossibly toned abs become visible she lost control. Samus of course had responded appropriately slamming Sa-x's whole head and shoulders into the reactor. If anything was going to quell her sexual hunger, it would be her lust for power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Samus didn't think this all the way through. Sa-x opened her mouth and literally inhaled as much energy as she could while holding back her growth. More and more power flowed into her, she felt her body start to thrum with power, she needed to grow...but not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More. I need more. More Power, I need to grow, need to get bigger!\" Sa-x shouted her voice muffled by the reactor chamber. Even so she took in more and more power, she felt her cells begging to be allowed to multiply and expand. Then with one massive suck the whole reactor dimmed for just a fraction of a second, and Sa-x felt her hunger finally abate, even if only for a moment.  Then she focused her power, not the use of shapeshifting her actual power as a goddess, and she made herself grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was holding Sa-x when suddenly she stopped struggling. Then in a huge burst of power Sa-x whole body exploded outward, she doubled in size early going from 15ft, to 30. The force of her growth knocked Samus onto her over sized ass. Samus recovered quickly, looking up only to watch as Sa-x's form continued to grow bigger and bigger. Over the course of several seconds she grew from 30 feet to 40, 50, 60! She was over half as tall as the reactor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, feel better X?\" Samus asked smiling <br>\r\n\"Just wait Tiny! I'm not done yet! I can still get bigger!\" Sa-x bellowed her voice massive and booming, as her already huge form continued to expand larger. She grew from 60ft to 70, then 80. Finally bending over at her waist then throwing her head back Sa-x let out a deep and booming laugh as her growth gave one last burst and she rose to a staggering 100 ft tall. Her laughter continued as her breasts proceeded to swell larger and larger with each deep throated chuckle, stopping only after they had doubled in size. Her ass swelled larger and larger colliding with the reactor behind her and sucking up even more power! Power that only served to further enhance Sa-x's already insane figure and super charge her libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!  Now, we're talking! More! I want to be sexier and bigger, and sexier!\" Sa-x roared as her ass spilled outward growing thicker every second. At the same time She finally started drawing power from her form, toning her six pack to an 8 pack, lengthening her legs and forcing her breasts to swell even larger.<br>\r\n\"Who's a goddess now! Me! And I'm only going to get bigger, and stronger, and bigger, and sexier, AND BIGGER! AHAHAHA!\" Sa-x roared with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked around for a moment. Perhaps forcing Sa-x to indulge herself was a mistake. She finally spotted It. Steel and Lin, they had retreated to the safety of a nearby control on the second story of the reactor room. Well, time fix this and test something Samus thought to herself.<br>\r\n\"X.\" Samus said, gaining the attention of the 100 ft , supremely busty and thicc  giantess currently gorging herself on power.<br>\r\nSa-x looked down at Samus, so tiny now, and cute. \"Yes Sammy?\"<br>\r\nOh we are going to have a talk about nicknames Samus thought, but first.<br>\r\n\"I want more. Feed me, now.\" Samus said coolly, while lifting up one of her breast's and suckling on it for Sa-x's temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Sa-x snapped at the sight of Samus purposely being sexy. She grabbed the bounty hunter faster than any could have anticipated and then slammed her while still wrapped in her hands into the reactor core. Samus's eye's snapped open as power flooded her body. It was like being bathed in liquid sunlight, which made sense given what a fusion reactor is. Samus's body bucked and began to expand. Suddenly a different power flooded her body, and she felt herself shrink. Then another pulse of the strange energy, and another, and another. She had gone from 32 ft, to 25\u2026.20...10\u2026..5\u2026 then she realized it, Sa-x was shrinking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X? X!? What are you doing?! Stop!\" Samus actually screamed slightly panicked.<br>\r\n\"No you need this, you need to be the right size to overload your cells or you'll never be satisfied.\" Sa-x said as she held Samus back from growing. Sa-x really hoped this worked. She had seen how much energy it had taken Samus to get to 15ft, and again the power needed for 32 ft. If she was right Samus would never be satisfied or get back to her previous multiverse sized state without a lot of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her cells were overcharged with energy, she could almost breath easy. If it just weren't for that nagging sensation, you know the one, where your whole body yearns to be the biggest, most powerful being in creation. No use in denying it any longer, Samus gave in to her desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was holding the hunter down inside the reactor.<br>\r\n\"Please work, please work, please work.\" She said then she felt it, Samus's whole body bucked in her grasp and felt like someone set a power bomb off in her hand. Sa-x couldn't have held the bounty hunter any longer no matter how hard she tried.<br>\r\nWith and enormous roar of pleasure Samus erupted from the reactor core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! OH FUCKING CHOZO YES!\" Samus screamed as her body grew and grew and grew. Before she knew it she was standing eye to eye with Sa-x. 100 ft tall, and still hungry.<br>\r\n\"More, I need MORE!\" Samus said as she stepped out of the reactor and wrapped her DD's around the fusion chamber. At her size her breasts were larger than tanks, and they easily smothered the top of the reactor in her giant cleavage. Slowly she absorbed more and more power. Growing larger and curvier with each passing minute. 100 feet became 110...120... 130...140...150. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x watched Samus get bigger, and bigger and for a brief moment dread filled her eyes. <i>\"Oh no, it wasn't enough, she should have been 4 or 5 times that size, oh chozo what do i do now\"</i> Sa-x thought. A whole reactor at optimal size hadn't given Samus enough power to break whatever barrier was still limiting her. Sa-x could tell, the bounty hunters body was huge but cells were chugging power like leaky ship engine. Not nearly efficient enough, and spraying radiation everywhere.<br>\r\n<i>I'll just have to figure out another way, maybe Lt. Steel will have a good idea</i> Sa-x thought, then blinked, since when did she trust Steel that much. She made a note to herself to make sure Steel wasn't secretly an psychic alien capable of influencing her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" Screamed Samus snapping Sa-x back to reality. Holy hell, the woman was nearly 200 ft tall now. the reactor barely came up to her crotch. <br>\r\n\"Hey! Leave some for the rest of us!\" Sa-x said as she rose to her height and began to drain the  reactors power for herself. She soon began to grow, it was so easy, and felt so dam good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel and Lin watched from the control room as the two enormous forms of Samus continued to grow larger and larger.<br>\r\n\"This! This is what I mean! This doesn't worry you?\" Lin asked<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Steel asked desperately trying to get his manhood under control, not an easy task with the sight before him. But he had too, he didn't care to know what Samus or worse Sa-x might do to him if they found him aroused.<br>\r\n\"WHAT! what do you mean WHAT! Look at them, they aren't right, its terrifying!\" Lin half shouted before bringing her voice back down, hoping Samus and Sa-x wouldn't hear. She didn't need the giantess's angry at her.<br>\r\n\"Okay and what do you suggest? shoot them, trust me that doesn't end well, and 90% of weapons are energy based now.\" Steel replied. He watched as the two now 200 ft tall blonde titans sat down and wrapped their immense cleavage around the  fusion reactor. Each smiling and wide and moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know. But we need to stop this before it gets out of hand.\" Lin said very seriously<br>\r\n\"Well, I could stop this, but you might not like the result.\" Steel replied<br>\r\n\"Oh who cares they're gonna be pissed when the reactor runs out of energy anyway. I'd rather deal with an angry 200 ft tall set of giantess's then an angry 500 ft tall set....or worse.\" Lin said<br>\r\n\"Heh, Okay but...well you'll see.\" Steel said as he reached down and twisted a knob on the control panel. Then he tried his federation access code. It still worked, made sense, he hadn't used it since Samus massacred everyone at the base, no survivors means no one to file the paper work to revoke your privileges. Next he turned off the safety regulations, then opened the power lines and reversed the flow. The generator went into battery mode, an emergency setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what...what are you doing?\" Lin asked worriedly<br>\r\n\"Federation Generators have a storage and burn mode. In case one ever goes critical, other generators and drain the power. Of course in this case We're draining power into a damaged reactor. So it'll blow, and stop their feeding down there.\" Steel said watching as the two 250 ft tall women began to look at the reactor, poking and prodding it curiously, wondering where their power went.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, thats good, thank you. I guess.\" Lin said reluctantly she.<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet, before it blows it's gonna draw in power from the whole grid, including at least 2 other generators.\" Steel replied<br>\r\n\"It's...going...to...WHAT!'' No, no no no!\" Lin started squealing in fear. But it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Samus was becoming annoyed her power trip had stopped and she was able to think again. And she thought she wanted more power dammit. Like wise Sa-x was staring at the reactor, the first second she was puzzled, the second few seconds she spent sad. Now she was just pissed and hungry.<br>\r\n\"What happened! I wasn't done yet! there should still be more!!\" Sa-x said confused.<br>\r\n\"I don't, know, I....wait do you feel that?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two cities worth of power flooded through the open and partially destroyed reactor. All that power leaked straight out as the core when critical. A small star exploded between Samus and Sa-x 's chest. The women roared in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin stared in horror. Samus and Sa-x grew, even faster then before. 250 ft became 300, then 400, then 500 ft!<br>\r\n\"Stop them! do something! ANYTHING!\" She screamed shaking Lt. steel.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, reactors already blown, only thing to do now is watch.\" Steel replied, and watch he did. He watched as the enormous and thicc ass of Samus Aran grew bigger and bigger. At 500 ft tall the huge globes of flesh were pressing into the control chamber.<br>\r\n\"No please, not like this. Not like this.\" Lin pleaded.<br>\r\nThe safety glass cracked, shards flew inward as Samus's gargantuan ass began to push forward. Steel and Lin were forced to put their backs to the farthest wall. Still the enormous wall of flesh moved forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus finally finished growing. She looked down and say the tiny reactor, no bigger then a toy now between her legs, and covered in. Samus blushed, she hadn't meant to do that, oh well not like anyone was gonna call her on her behavior.<br>\r\n\"Pervert\" Sa-x said playfully.<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck off.\" Samus retorted, but it was met with only giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen samus felt her body adjust without a constant flow of power it compressed itself to a more optimal size. Sa-x saw it happen and immediately adjusted her own size. She wasn't sure what Samus would do if she knew the two were different sizes. But she didn't want to risk the jealousy or anger of Samus Aran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked back at the control room, It was crushed. Her eye's went wide....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blushed again, but this time it was accompanied by fear and little guilt. <br>\r\n<i>please, oh please let them be okay, i really don't want to live with the fact my ass might have killed again</i> Samus thought as she pried loose one of the control room walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin stumbled out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For fucks sake! what is wrong with you! you fat assed, jiggly cu....\" Lin slapped her hands over her mouth, near death experiences always left her either immobilized or angry. Neither were good for serving really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared at the tiny woman for about 5 seconds. Before glaring and asking the obvious.<br>\r\n\"Where is Steel.\" she said in completely calm tone.<br>\r\nLin simply moved one hand and pointed towards the crushed control room.<br>\r\nSamus stared worried, when suddenly an armored hand popped out. Giving a thumbs up.<br>\r\n\"Second best near death encounter I've ever had!\" Steel shouted his voice muffled by the crushed remains of the room.<br>\r\n\"Second best!?\" came the reply of all three women. <br>\r\n\"Well there was that one time of galagon-7 with the stripper assassins.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smiled ruefully.<br>\r\n\"Let me get this straight. You think a group of stripper assassin's is a better death then by my perfect, and definitely not fat, ass?\" She said as she rose to her full height. Climbing out of the rubble Steel looked up, and up, and up. Samus may have shrank a little to conserve power, but she was still 325 ft. tall. She barely fit in the room.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, well, the one had really big tits.\" he said as playfully as he could through the fea.<br>\r\n\"OH! Bigger than these?\" Samus said as she brought her arms together under her chest. Zero suit pulled so tight it was see through. She leaned down and put her massive tits at the same level as Lin and Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel was about to answer when a huge tendril slammed into him and pulled him out. He was lifted up eye level with a much more angry looking Samus. Sa-x to be correct, and she wan't happy.<br>\r\n\"UH look, sorry. I'm not, I swear I'm not flirting...uh,,welll that is.\" Steel began to sputter, looking back as Samus. If he told Sa-x it meant nothing he may offend Samus. If he didn't tell the huge X parasite what she wanted hear well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! You almost died! You almost made my Samus SAD!!\" Sa-x shouted at the tiny man she was holding. Everyone in the room looked at her shocked. a few stunned seconds passed by.<br>\r\n\"Well its an improvement.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n\"Improvement?\" Sa-x asked tilting her head.<br>\r\n\"Normally you kill people who look at me with less then pure intent.\" Samus stated bluntly.<br>\r\n\"Oh those people were a threat, Steel's not threat, he's a friend.\" Sa-x provided as her reasoning.<br>\r\n\"So wait what If i think She's attractive?\" Lin asked before thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was sudden sound of thunder cracking as Sa-x shot forward, a blur of motion. Samus lept into action before she could even process what was happening. In the span of few seconds Sa-x was pinned to the ground and her form was shifting back and forth trying to escape. <br>\r\n\"SA-X NO! SHE'S JOKING, ITS A JOKE! CALM DOWN!\" Samus shouted her voice shaking the whole room<br>\r\n\"I\"ll END HER!\" Sa-x screamed and the various walls and supports of the room around cracked from the force of her voice.<br>\r\n\"NO, Bad sexy Sa-x, BAD!\" Samus said as she resorted to grabbing Sa-x's chest and squeezing. The effect was immediate. Strong as Sa-x was she still wasn't used to pleasure. Her mind flooded with bliss and she stopped struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin merely stared, she knew the Samus clone, or whatever she was, had a temper. But she'd never seen something so big move so fast. Even more terrifying, Samus had intercepted and stopped her. <br>\r\n\"Chozo almighty, what have we gotten ourselves into.\" Lin asked aloud.<br>\r\n\"Enough, time to go back to the ship. I'll explain everything there.\" Samus said as she finally released Sa-x. Noting that in her charge, Sa-x had not dropped Steel but had placed him firmly in between her cleavage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few more moments Sa-x finally calmed down enough to start thinking straight. She released Steel from her immense cleavage. The man dropped for the ground and was left staring up. It had all happened to so fast. Lin spoke, and the next thing he knew he was surrounded by the softest, bed he had ever known. Then just like that he fell out, and was back to cold harsh reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four beings made their way to the opening of room and encountered their first problem. A 10 feet wide set of double doors, aka the exit. Samus looked to Sa-x and was about to speak when Sa-x cut her off.<br>\r\n\"NO! Absolutely NOT! If you think for one moment I'm shrinking myself down, let alone my massive tits, again! To fit through that door YOU'RE the crazy one!!\" Sa-x shouted, flashbacks of the elevator escape till fresh in her mind.<br>\r\nSamus blinked that was not even remotely what she was going to ask. But she also knew not to let and opportunity like this pass by. <br>\r\n\"Sa-x Please! There's almost certainly a mechanism to operate the ceiling gate on the other side. Most reactors have either a upper or lower gate for emergency extraction.\" Samus looked up as she spoke. Sure enough there it was, a crease in the ceiling, but it was firmly shut. Worse with no power to the facility there was no way to open it.<br>\r\n\"NO! Make one of them do it!!\" Sa-x roared pointing at Lin and Steel.<br>\r\n\"I don't trust Lin..\"<br>\r\n\"As well you shouldn't\" Interrupted Steel, as Lin kicked his shins.<br>\r\n\"And Steel's, well kinda shaky since I almost..um...\" Samus started then stopped speaking.<br>\r\n\"Crushed him with your Sextuplet+++ sized ass?\" Sa-x and Lin both asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus glared, she didn't like taking those comments from Sa-x let alone the little criminal tag along.<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine, my Ass. Sa-x...Please, I'm...I'm already getting hungry again.\" Samus partly lied. She was feeling hungry but even more she wanted to see this prank through.<br>\r\nSa-x was taken aback. She had almost forgotten, she still didn't have a good way to feed Samus the power she'd need. Begrudgingly she relented, her Samus was more important after all.<br>\r\n\"Fine, Fine! I'll do it. What do I need to do?\" Sa-x asked she didn't exactly have any memories to tap for this. Samus hadn't spent a lot of time in federation power plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel stepped up, and motioned for Samus. The giant 325 ft tall women leaned over and for a second Steel wondered if he made a mistake. But then he whispered something in her ear.<br>\r\nOh, Samus loved it. Steel had caught on to her plan, and just supplied her with the next step. <br>\r\n\"Go out the tunnels we came down. You'll need to be no larger then 8 feet.\" Samus started<br>\r\n\"EIGHT! That's microscopic!!\" Sa-x cried<br>\r\n\"You'll see a maintenance shaft, climb up, and um well...flatten yourself to get through.\" Samus continued.<br>\r\n\"I'll flatten something.\" Sa-x mumbled and envisioned smashing federation city after federation city under her huge tits. Stupid humans building their power plants ass backwards.<br>\r\n\"Once you reach the top there will be panel. Open it and enter Steels code, S3x7, and it'll override the hatch locks, letting us out.\" Samus finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x Glared, looked at the tiny doorway, then looked at the ceiling. But before she could object, Samus leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek. Sa-x blushed, it wasn't even the worst thing they had ever done, but it was....affectionate. She could feel the intent behind the action. She realized something, she wanted more of that.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm going.\" Sa-x finally said as her form began to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel and Lin watched and marveled as the former huge, naked and devastatingly sexy woman went from 325 feet, to 225....125...25...10...and finally 8 feet tall. Still bigger then either of them. Then not wanting to waste time she reduced her chest size. Glorious G cups shrank, and shrank, and shrank, till she was once again flat as a board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel gawked in open horror. This was the opposite of a good thing. Before he could do anything Sa-x was staring. Well at least he understood the abomination that this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggling that followed was deafening in the near silent room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x turned and saw Lin covering her mouth. She glared at the girl. But Lin simply smiled, turned at an angle showing her profile and ran her hands over her chest. C-cups, not big, but not small by anyone's definition.<br>\r\nSa-x Nearly snapped, Her hair stood up independent of her own will. Her whole body began to expand this time with muscle.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x, we don't have time sweety.\" Boomed Samus from above. Sa-x looked up and was struck with fear. She forgot how imposing Samus could be when she was bigger then her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x Quickly ran out the doors. Mentally vowing vengeance on the little Lin next time she got her alone. Lin shook her own tits as she watched Sa-x run, the effect was the jealous x parasite didn't see the steel beam ahead. She went right through it. not stopping. Sa-x finally reached the maintenance hatch, god it was smaller than she thought. Even 8 feet would be to big. She shrank down, till she was 6 feet tall and lithe. She went into the hatch and found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!\" Sa-x roared as metal security tube shunted into place. Apparently there had been a security pad she missed. The tube was in lock down, to prevent intrusion. Sa-x growled, made sure no one was around to see her, then she compressed herself down to 3 feet tall.<br>\r\n\"I swear, when I get out of here. I'm gonna eat this fucking planet whole. I'm gonna feast on Stars, and galaxies, and freaking nebula's. Just you wait world.\" Sa-x mumbled to herself while climbing up the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the room. Samus looked down at Steel. <br>\r\n\"Will it work from here.\" She asked without preamble.<br>\r\n\"Oh definitely just get me up there.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Will what work?\" Lin asked, but she was cut off as Samus picked up her and steel and lifted them to the ceiling right where a small access panel was. Steel quickly input his override code. The massive locks gave way and ceiling began to open. Samus climbed out through the opening.  Soon the trio found themselves just outside the city, in a featureless concrete and steel lot.<br>\r\n\"No way. Oh, she's gonna be pissed!\" Lin said excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Yep, now for the icing on the cake. Sorry Miss Lin, this might hurt a little.\" Samus Said and concentrated on Lin's chest. Using her powers she forced reality to obey her whims.<br>\r\n\"What might...Oh, ow, ow, hot, ow, oh, ohhhh, mmmmmm.\" Lin began to shout but it died into moans of pleasure. She watched her own breasts expand, C-cups to D-Cups. <br>\r\n\"Okay get ready the hatch is over here.\" Steel said standing by the maintenance hatch. He could hear something crawling up it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x found the top. Finally, she could get out, open the doors, grow to respectable size, and maybe crush a few buildings between her tits, or Lin, she owed that flat chested bitch one smothering. Sa-x lifted the hatch, crawled out into the overcast and shadowy day. She turned her head to find the access panel and was met with the sight of a giant pair of tits. Contained in a black shirt, pulled down to expose the woman's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the 3 ft tall Sa-x's eye's went wide. It was Lin.<br>\r\n\"What's up tiny tits?\" Lin said pressing her newly improved juggs together.<br>\r\n\"What...but, how? when?! Why!\" Sa-x said as she stepped back, falling back she landed facing up and saw the sky. Except it was the wrong color. Skies aren't supposed to be peach colored. She was staring at the enormous F-cup rack of Samus. Thunder filled the air, but it was actually the mega sized Samus's giggles.<br>\r\n\"Hi X, what happened your so small.\" Samus said through her titters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x Saw red....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sa-x looked up the enormous giantess's around her, the massive mountains they sported filled her mind with rage, and sadness. She was hurt, she felt bad and she didn't understand. Oh she understood just fine why she was hurting, but she didn't understand why Samus would do this. She looked around and finally found the only person not making fun of her. Lt. Steel sat on the ground, legs crossed, holding his holo-tablet facing outward. Sa-x just happened to want to look anywhere else at the moment, she didn't want to look at Samus and Lin right now, and risk feeling more rage. Because of that, her eye's lingered on the tablet, one word written in large letters displayed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOKE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Sa-x a moment. Then her face shifted from one of near tears, to one of confusion, the realization, and finally a new kind of anger. The kind that comes from being bested in a competition rather than hurt by a friend. Sa-x stared up at the Samus's massive form, then at Lin. Two could play this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just thinking, when I was climbing up the tiny emergency hatch.\"some anger crept into Sa-x's voice \"How rough it can be for others.\" She finished, looking left and right at the two larger women. She watched as Steel walked away, those fabled survivors instincts no doubt kicking in.<br>\r\n\"Oh, do tell.\" Samus said looking down, she hoped she was looking in the right direction, with her breasts pushed into each other her cleavage obscured most of her view.<br>\r\n\"Well you see, I figure most women are filled with extreme jealousy at the sight of me. I thought you and Lin,might enjoy being the prettiest girls around for a while.\" Sa-x finished confidently. A confidence that may have been misplaced as she turned and saw an enormous black and pale wall descend on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you jealous, you flat chested, shape shifting, bitch.\" Lin yelled as she engulfed Sa-x's head in her enormous D-cups.<br>\r\n\"Um you might not want to do that.\" Samus replied as finally got herself situated on her side. Finally she could see around her chest and what was happening. She could see Steel running away at top speed, smart man. She could see Lin signing her own death warrant. More importantly she could see Sa-x, she was smiling.<br>\r\n\"Oh chozo, here we go.\" Samus said rolling her eye's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin held Sa-x in between her tits. She pressed as hard as she could, she didn't know if the clone of Samus needed to breath but she was dead set on finding out. Then she felt it, a strange sensation deep in her chest, something was getting heavier. <br>\r\n\"Uh-oh.\" Lin said as she felt it. Sa-x was growing.<br>\r\n\"No, No! Not fair! Stay tiny dam you!\" Lin pressed her tits together harder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly enormous orbs of flesh erupted from Lin's chest. The force of their growth knocking Lin on her ass. Lin stared at Sa-x's growing\u2026.chest? It was only her chest, just an enormous set of 4 foot diameter breasts, the 3 foot tall Sa-x standing behind them. Lin began to scramble backward as the titanic wall of tits moved closer, they were growing faster now. As she  stood up she realized Sa-x had grown her endowments to ten feet. Lin began to walk backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going flatty!\" Sa-x shouted from behind her chest. Lin didn't need anymore to know she was in trouble. She turned and ran, she got a good 200 feet away before a wall of blue descended. Samus's zero suit now barred Lin' s way, the massive 325ft tall mega sized bounty hunter had decided to sit down at exactly the wrong place. Lin turned around hoping to double back, but she was met with a truly awful sight. Two monstrously huge, curved walls. Lin gawked, they must have been over 100 feet each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I learned my lesson, I'm sorry...okay?\" Lin started shouting, even though the idea hadn't been hers she was willing to beg and plead. Especially if it meant not dying. The massive wall of flesh shivered and stopped. Lin let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll crush you!\" Sa-x shouted. Lin's eye's flew open and her heart began to race, she looked up and watched in horror as the mountainous mounds of Sa-x grew larger and larger. Lin backed away till she hit a solid wall of blue, Samus's zero suit. Sa-x's breasts continued to expand, soon they towered over Lin, a pair of massive 200 ft tall unstoppable tits.<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck me.\" Lin said as the titanic tits continued to expand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trapped between Sa-x's overgrown breasts, and Samus's massive womanhood, not how she thought it would end. She closed her eye's as the soft flesh surrounded her. Then, suddenly, the pressure disappeared completely. Lin slowly opened  one eye, then the other. There in front of her stood the naked, and quite Normal, sized Sa-x. The 6 ft tall blond beauty, leaning forward, her still generous chest sporting G-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha! You're kinda cute when terrified.\" Sa-x said patting Lin on the head.<br>\r\nLin went to spit out a string of curses but then thought twice about her actions.<br>\r\n\"That wasn't funny.\" Lin finally settled on for her response.<br>\r\n\"Yah, neither was making me feel smaller than you. But it still happened, so maybe we should just laugh and move on.\" Sa-x countered.<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my idea! It was her idea!\" Lin said pointing at Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x eye's went wide at Lin's exclamation. A moment later a shadow fell over the two women. Lin looked up to see the enormous breasts of Samus now hovering only a few feet above her. Lin scrambled behind Sa-x, trying to hide behind the larger woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wha-what I meant to say was, uh, this is, uh\u2026.\" Lin was stumbling over her words, she just couldn't think of a way out of this.<br>\r\n\"Fun as this has been, we need to get moving, my ship isn't going to come find us.\"  Samus replied, much as she wanted to lord her power over the two women there were important things to do.<br>\r\n\"But you already called your ship.\" Lin said pointing upward, while Sa-x nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned her head towards the direction Lin was pointing. Sure enough there was her ship floating just to the left of her head.<br>\r\n\"What, when\u2026.\" Samus began, but her questions were answered as Lt. Steel waved from the cockpit. Samus glared,as the ship landed. She took a  massive breath in and compressed her size down to 6 feet. She walked up to her ship, the door opening immediately for her. Sa-x and Lin followed shortly, both looking puzzled. Samus calmly walked to the bridge of her ship. Steel rose from the seat to greet her, and before he could speak Samus's arm lashed out. There was a blur of motion and Samus had the federation marine by the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have exactly 5 seconds to explain how you got into my ship.\" Samus said cool. She liked steel, but no one should know her passcode. If Steel knew it he was clearly more than he appeared to be. Samus didn't care for people who kept secrets from her, especially not people who worked for the  federation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch0z0, may not be the most secure password in the federation.\" Steel replied as he felt Samus's grip tighten.<br>\r\n\"True, so how did you pass the DNA scan?\" Samus asked still calm, but slowly tightening her grip, she could feel Steel's armor breaking under her grip. Chozo it felt good to be this strong.<br>\r\n\"K-k-kinda covered in it.\"  Steel choked out <br>\r\n\"Excuse me?! You're covered in my DNA? How, oh!\" Samus said dropping the man to the ground. Remembering that she nearly crushed him and Lin under her ass not even 30 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we all good now? Can we maybe get some answers as to why there are two of you? And why reality seems to bend to your freaking will!\" Lin shouted<br>\r\n\"Ugh where do I even start.\" Samus said massaging her temples. She wasn't used to any of this. Dealing with people, and problems she couldn't shoot.<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" Sa-x piped up cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sa-x lashed out at Steel and Lin with her hair. It morphed into translucent tendrils halfway to them. Coating their heads the tendrils began to pulse with blue and white light.<br>\r\n\"X...want are you doing?\" Samus inquired stepping closer <br>\r\n''Just giving them the relevant memories.\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can do that...of course you can, as an x-parasite you can just replicate the cells with the info.\" Samus starred thinking aloud<br>\r\n\"Yep, but that's not what I'm doing. I've just linked our minds, and now they can experience my memories. Way easier, and it won't result in their bodies becoming food for my cells.\" Sa-x said.<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026..good.\" Samus said, a little hint of worry in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the memory share ended, Lin and Steel had two very different responses. Steel turned his head towards Samus and stared slack jawed.<br>\r\nSamus started to blush, oh great, he knew. Now she would find out if she was a monster. Steel was mostly sane and stable, and his reaction would finally tell her what a normal person would think of this situation she found herself in. Or it would have if Lin could have kept her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory share ended. Lin saw everything that happened. She knew what Samus and Sa-x were now. Her brain was woefully unprepared for the truth. She wasn't sure when, but she started screaming at some point. She saw Samus take a step towards her, and she scrambled back immediately. She hit a wall still screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lin, stop please, this isn't helping.\" Samus said reaching out toward Lin<br>\r\nLin curled into the fetal position, she wanted to form words but she couldn't. She knew her reaction wasn't helping but she didn't know what to do. She kept screaming, what else could she do, she was staring down a literal goddess.<br>\r\n\"Lin, stop screaming. Please.\" Samus said again, she didn't like the girl but she truly hated people reacting to her like this. Like she was a monster. Lin stopped screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank yo-\"<br>\r\n\"You\"re a MONSTER! MURDERER! FREAK! MURDERER!\" Lin began screaming at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x tilted her head, she didn't understand. Why was Lin acting like this, Steel wasn't acting like this what was the difference? Before she could think further she sensed something, anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"ENOUGH!\"</font> Samus roared, giving off a wave of power that caused that whole ship to shudder. The force of her voice finally silenced Lin's screaming.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"I am not A MONSTER! I AM A GODDESS! And you will BE SILENT!\"</font> Samus roared, the ship continued to shake with every word.

No wonder Lin stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, calm down. I...I don't know why she did what she did. But, I...I don't think its her fault. Till today she was just an ordinary person.\" Sa-x started in as calm a tone as she could.<br>\r\n\"What are you implying.\" Samus asked her eye's were still burning with anger.<br>\r\n\"That maybe an ordinary person. uh isn't um...equipped to handle this. Look just....just blame me. Maybe I broke her brain with the memory share. I'm sorry okay.\" Sa-x said pulling her hand back, a look of guilt and fear on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared at the X parasite clone of her. She hated seeing her own face acting so weak, but it also gave her a face to look at that she respected. Even if that notion was misplaced, Sa-x wasn't her. More now than ever the creature was developing its own unique personality. Swinging from innocent and child like, to power hungry, to power mad, to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked back at Lin. Okay maybe she had been a little, cruel. Samus sometimes forgot this type of situation wasn't normal for most people. Her life was exceptional in that matter.<br>\r\nShe turned back to Sa-x, and saw Steel behind her, still on the floor being quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think. Am I monster? Is Lin just broken? Did Sa-x mess up?\" Samus asked quietly as she stepped past Sa-x to face Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel looked up at Samus. The memories still fresh in his mind. She had taken it all in. The woman before him had devoured and recreated all of reality. She was monstrous, but he didn't think she was a monster. No Steel knew, after thinking on it for moment. Monsters aren't a thing, even Sa-x, an x parasite, the closest thing to an amoral, single minded, killing machine the federation had ever discovered. Even she could change and make choices. So Steel realized what he did next, could very well shape the fate of the world. Because being a monster, just like being a hero, is a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel....</span></div></div>",

Steel stepped forward, and lowered himself to the ground, laying himself prone before Samus.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Steel, what are you doing?\" Samus asked, she was expecting an answer to her question not, whatever this was.<br>\r\n\"My goddess, glory to you. May your will be done and your power grow till it eclipses the stars in the sky.\" Steel praised Samus.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Steel, No. I...I didn't\u2026\" Samus stopped speaking suddenly, inhaling sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower, sweet, delicious power flooded into Samus's being. It felt like her whole body opened wide. She could feel her veins pulse with life, the world around her became more vibrant, more alive. She took a breath in, sweet air, filled her lungs and the constant feeling of suffocation vanished. Then warmth flooded her body, she could feel every cell in her body filling with heat and power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fucking gawd, YES!\" Samus screamed as the dreadful tightness she had been walking around with this whole time vanished. The world around everyone in the ship suddenly shook. Sa-x, Lin,and Steel looked around shocked.<br>\r\n\"More! Do that again!\" Samus half shouted half panted. Her chest heaving as she continued to relish being able to breath freely.<br>\r\n\"Wha\u2026.Oh, uh yes. Great Samus, goddess and mistress, may your power be known to all. May you grow ever stronger, bigger, and more glorious. More and more and more till you are overflowing.\" Steel stammered on,unable to think fast enough he simply let what was in his heart and head come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's body began to glow. She could feel it, the world opened up to her. She could feel the world around her, the thoughts of everyone gathered around her. But it was all a little fuzzy, not in a bad way, but in an everything is so warm and delightful way. Samus collapsed against the ship wall giggling, she couldn't help it, she just felt so damn good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x meanwhile was staring in shock. This was amazing, finally Samus's body was operating like it should, like a real goddess, instead of a dead cosmic battery. And it was all thanks to Steel, his earnest worship had generated some weird form of power that Samus needed. Steel, had solved the problem, now all Samus needed was\u2026.Sa-x stared off into space as a horrible realization dawned on her. Samus didn't need her, She only needed Steel. Steel would replace her, She would lose it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x turned her head and saw Steel kneeling and partly smiling. That son of a bitch Sa-x thought. She should have known better, the man was clearly a survivor and the best way to survive was to be necessary to God. Sa-x's eye twitched, and something in her finally gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RrrrrrRRRAAGGHHH!\" Sa-x roared as she shot across the room. Steel barely saw her move before it was too late. Fortunately for him Samus was very aware of her surroundings. With a simple wave or her arm, and a thought, she teleported Steel next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy X, you\u2026.\" Samus started but she was cut off by the sudden wave of rage that hit her higher heightened, now divine senses.<br>\r\n\"NO! He'll take you from ME! He needs to DIE!\" Sa-x screamed her voice pitching up and down as her form morphed and grew. She had already left a dent in the floor where she landed from her charge, and now she was adding more mass to her form.<br>\r\n\"Sa-x please, just listen for a\"<br>\r\n\"KILL YOU! SHE'S MINE!\" Sa-x roared, as her form grew from 6 ft to 8 ft. Her hands morphed ending in class, and her hair went full medusa, lashing out like it had a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed, raised a hand and expended a small amount of power. Chozo, was it really supposed to be this easy? She barely felt the power leave her. As Sa-x rushed forward again, the whole ship rocked with force she kicked off with. But she slammed straight into some unseen wall, part force, part gravity. It stopped her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at Samus, and then the tears came. Samus for one had finally had enough. She walked up to Sa-x kissed her gently on the lips, and then slapped her, hard. Sa-x hit the floor and her body de-morphed for a second, breaking into translucent x parasite matter. She looked back up and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, you can't go around acting so naive anymore. I have a lot to teach you, and it starts now.\" Samus said calmly.  Sa-x stared for a few moments, then accepted the situation. She felt Samus and her emotions, the love in her kiss was real, but so was the anger behind that hit.<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026.yes, okay. What next?\" Sa-x said<br>\r\n\"Next you get to learn why people are valuable, while I\u2026..explore some possibilities.\" She said her gaze drifting towards Lt. Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x was about to object, she Samus held up a hand.<br>\r\n\"Nope, Steel and I are going to go\u2026..worship. You are going to stay out here, and prove you can act like a free thinking being. Which I damn well know you can. So you and Lin get to spend some quality time together, enjoy.\" Samus finished as she walked towards her quarters, grabbing and physically dragging Steel with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door to her chambers shut, the color drained from both Lin and Sa-x's faces.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samus left her alone with this psycho, and told them to bond. Hell she'd be lucky if the monster didn't just absorb her and claim success. Lin's eye's widened at the thought, oh God, what if she did!? Sa-x was clearly some kind of shape shifter, what if she just ate her, absorbed all the info in her brain and claimed success. Better act quick, Lin realized she had to take charge of the situation if she wanted to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...what do you want to know?\" Lin asked<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Sa-x replied tilting her head, she was still trying to figure out the best way to devour the girl and then replicate an x clone of her, so Samus would think they bonded.<br>\r\n\"Well, we are supposed to bond, and you seem pretty...uninformed when it comes to humans and basic culture. H-how can I help?\" Lin clarified <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x thought for a few seconds. Okay sure, if Lin would volunteer some info maybe that would be helpful.

Now for the tricky part.<br>\r\n\"Don't bother.\" Lin said<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you can fuck off I need to\u2026..\" Sa-x started before Lin interrupted <br>\r\n\"Go in there, piss off Samus, and make her rely on Steel even more?\"<br>\r\n\"I...Nooo, I'll..uh.\" Sa-x's face became worried. Crap, that would be how it happened.<br>\r\n\"Stay out here and let your new friend Lin, teach you how to appropriately seduce a woman?\" Lin supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x stared at the woman, this was different, why the hell was Lin being nice to her. Something wasn't right here, she could feel it. She also knew if she didn't learn to understand this woman Samus would be upset. So she decided to solve the problem as straight forwardly as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you're up to, Or I'll eat you.\" Sa-x said while glaring at Lin.<br>\r\n\"I want a friend who's a goddess. So I can have power, and an easy life.\" Lin said flatly.<br>\r\n\"And, you think I will be your friend? I don't like you.\" Sa-x said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you like Steel even less. Besides, I can help you.\" Lin replied smiling, she had Sa-x right where she wanted her<br>\r\n\"I..i...Okay, fine let's say I give you a chance. Starting now you have one chance, so\u2026.Start!\" Sa-x commanded.<br>\r\n\"On one condition. You want my help, you have to trust me. When I say do something, you do it. No questions, got it?\" Lin said<br>\r\n\"Why can't I\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"No questions! You want to beat Steel? We ain't got time for me to explain every little detail! Dick Now!\" Lin interrupted Sa-x holding her hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x stood up to her full height, even limited by the ship, Sa-x was still 8 feet tall, almost twice Lin's size. Lin worried that her commanding tone May have been a little too much. She gulped as the Sa-x took a step closer. Lin was eye level with her and, looking down she watched in amazement as Sa-x's flesh morphed. Soon a small penis emerged from the flesh just above her womanhood. Barely 3 inches long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sa-x, No.\" Lin said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"But You said\u2026\" Sa-x started<br>\r\n\"Sa-x this is like everything else in life. Bigger is better!\" Lin interrupted <br>\r\n\"Ah, oh...OKAY!\" Sa-x said as she focused. Morphing her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x's new cock began to grow. 4 inches, 5...6...7.. It slowly pulsed and expanded. Growing thicker and longer every second. <br>\r\n\"Bigger! C'mon! I can't believe I have to explain this to you!  Bigger is better!\" Lin shouted, clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x focused harder. Fine, Lin wanted big, she'd show her big. Her dick began to expand faster, bulging from 7 inches to 10\u202613...18..24\u2026.It was two feet long now. <br>\r\n\"Thicker! More Girth!\" Lin said, she was actually enjoying this.<br>\r\n\"Bossy much?\" Sa-x replied focusing on her body again.<br>\r\n\"NO QUESTIONS! NOW, make it thicc!\" Lin shouted as she reached out and grabbed Sa-x's member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x's eye's flew open. Oh holy Hell, she had only been mimicking male anatomy from what previous memories she had of the human genome. She hadn't realized how many nerve endings were in one of these monsters. She let out a gasp of pleasure as Lin grabbed her cock. That felt amazing, she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her pussy began to swell between her legs, her ass grew outward, her tits began to swell filling with enough power and universes to drown reality a trillion times over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched as Sa-x began to grow, and grow, and grow.

Finally when she was nearly the same size as her Samus stopped feeding Sa-x.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay are you ready to...<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" Sa-x cut off samus and slammed her face into Samus's massive breast and gorged herself on power.<br>\r\n\"Unhnnh, easy Sa-x, thats..uhhh, that's really..mmmm\" Samus moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"FEED ME!

Only to return to normal, just in time for her massive ass to balloon to 5 times its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer awkward growth spurts continued.

YOU DARE DEFY ME!\" Sa-x said as reality failed to produce her what she wanted. No what she NEEDED. But moments later she felt something. She could sense it, she was looking for her Samus. But all across the multiverse there were no Samus's. Not a single iteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? NO...no, that...that can't be right.\" Sa-x finally began to calm down as this new information revealed there must be something missing. Her Samus might be gone, but why would all the others disappear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

Nowhere inside her was Samus Aran present. Not in a single universe, in a near limitless ever growing pool of universes, could she find a single iteration of the bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, that makes no Damn Sense!\" Sa-x shouted, frustrated by the lack of plausible answers. She knew Samus existed, the multiverse had untold zillions of universes that she had existed in. But now, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had an idea, what ifnshe simply looked for mentions of Samus. A moment later the enormus goddess, had literally searched over half  of the nigh infinite realities inside her, and had her answer. There were plenty of records, and even creatures with memories of Samus, up to a point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thats....something...maybe if I.\" Sa-x's words trailed off as she searched out the records regarding her Samus. It wasn't long before she intercepted a federation communication regarding the hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, if anyone also misses her surely it's her own people, or chozo, note to self check on chozo later now let see.\" Sa-x's eye's flashed solid red as she mentally watched a single universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABOARD A CAPITAL FEDERATION STARSHIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Serek, do we have we received new orders from high command?\" Came the voice of admiral  Rex , currently using this particular ship as his flag vessel.<br>\r\n\"No sir,it appears since the universes were split we've only managed to gather few functioning federations togethere. We appear to be in a holding pattern until more troops and resources can be acquired or created.\" The cpt responded promptly, if a bit tired, this was 3rd time today and 100th time this month he had reported the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe admiral sighed \"and what of project longinus?\"<br>\r\n\"Apparently only 50% successful according the Super AI's last report. The Bounty hunter was eliminated across all realities, but the parasite X, designated Sa-x, had differentiated her genome enough to escape deletion.\" The captain reported, knowing even now that was simply the AI's best guess to what outcome they were living in.<br>\r\n\"Captain, I trust I don't need to explain why that's a problem\"<br>\r\n\"No sir.\" Came the diligent response <br>\r\n\"Then why in the name of Chozo are we sitting around here waiting. There could be a reality altering X parasite on the verge of godhood out there. We need to do something! The federation must secure unlimited power if we are to brung order to the multiverse\"<br>\r\n\"Sir, the briefings are clear no action until the Super AI figures out how Samus and the X parasite accomplished what they did.further more admiral I will politely remind you, that we are not to speak of it, on the small chance she might be watching.\" The captain replied with emphasis  on the idea of shouting the hell up, politely that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe admiral rolled his eye's \"Oh please, the odds are what .00000001 to like the 12th hundred power t hats she's paying attention, I'll take that order from high command as suggestion thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOUTSIDE REALITY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x simply stood there, staring blankly into the void. They did it? They took away her Samus? How, why, it didn't make sense if anything the federation should have targeted her. They had been fighting her a few hours ago, before the giant metroid incident, after she ascended to a higher state of being. Sa-x gazed down at her hands, then her body, tracking the universes inside passively and she continued to think about what she just learned. But, but they knew they couldn't kill her, so they...They removed all iterations of Samus's DNA from reality. That must be it, an attack on her being on a metaphysical level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the rage hit. How dare they, Samus was perfect, as perfect as she was. That's why she had her form, her power, and these people just took that from her. Her whole body began to shake as she unconsciously gathered power, her hands balled into fosts and begsn to tremble. Sa-x looked around but realized there was nothing to take out tnis rage on. And so with  nowhere to go she internalized the anger, and then did something she didn't even know she could do. She fed off her emotion. Not just her anger, she tapped into all the anger in the multiverse. What happened next overwhlemed even her, Sa-x had thought stars and gravity and big bangs had brought her power. She was not prepared for just how mich anger people could generste or how well it converted to power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRRRAAAAAGGGHHHHHH! MORE, MORE POWER! BIGGER! MOORREEEAAARRGGHH!\" Sa-x roared as her already huge body exploded in growth, and power, her mind opened up even more, but it only hallowed more rage to enter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross then shapeless void a cry of pure raged echoed. And minutes later the already titanic form of Sa-x began to grow. Faster and stronger then ever before. Her whole body practically exploded in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts, OH FUCK IT HURTS! BUT MORE,  MORE, MORE!! I'LL...I'LL KILL AND DEVOUR, AND GROW, AND GROW, AND GROW!\" Sa-x began comrade as her powered continued to expand uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTill finally it happened, her chest was the first area to feel the effect. As massive breasts that could not be contained became the main reservoir for reality, they pushed outward from her chest heaving larger and larger with every breath, every scream. J cups, k, L cups, the monstorus mammaries remainex suspended only by the goddess will and sheer lack of gravity. The  they hit a wall. The edge of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x gasped as her explosive growth was brought to a sudden halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how, HOW!\" Wait, what what was I. Ow my head! And my tits? Sa-x said ollking forward butneven she couldn't see past her massive breasts, they were thenonly thing infront of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay, that what was I thinking? Okay note to self emltions are dangerous, don't do again. Also Samus, they killed my samus how do I undo it, there must be a way!\" Having calmed down,  Sa-x thought aloud and then it hit her. She needed more info, and there was only one way to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why is my adrenaline spiking, what the hell body?\" Sa-x said as she felt the equilibrium of her body shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time for THIS! I have to get into that universe, and get some answers....preferably by RIPPING THEM OUT OF THE FEDERATIONS SKULL!\" Sa-x began screaming and again anger started to flush through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! No, no....Snffff..calm...snffff...calm.\" Sa-x repeated herself dialing back her anger. It wouldn't do her any good her, and if she accidentally destroyed the universe she needed then she might never get her answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay its simply just project a copy of myself into the reality, just need to shave off a small piece...\" Sa-x began walking through her plan. She hadn't actually done this before but in theory it was possible. She was the X now. All she had to do was keep a connection with her cells but make a small fully functional copy, and then remote control it. Heck the copy, or her avatar would even be existing in her own system so it should be just like creating a super customized immune cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely Sa-x began to separate a part of her, which she then internalized by literally absorbing it through her massive chest, perks of being an alien parasite, and guided it to the universe in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now the tricky part. Just gotta transfer my consciousness, and....\" Sa-x closed her eyes, and felt a small pulse of power run from her mind, down her spine, to the level of her chest, and then after what seemed like forever into her breast's. Then she lost the feeling. Opening her eye's she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Sa-x wondered aloud but even as she asked she saw the white of the void had been replaced with the darkness of space. It had worked she was in a universe.<br>\r\n\"YES! HAHA!\" but elated soon gave way to confusion, then frustration. Sa-x gazed upon the world she was in, literally all of it. The \"Small\" avatar she had made was nearly 1,000 times the size of the entire universe in the reality she was vising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, Insignificant...how! WHY! Why are you all so dam small! and why does it have to inconvience me!! UGH, FINE okay, I'll just do it again.\" And with that Sa-x concentrated and again split her avatar, this time consuming the larger form for power. Even though she still had a direct line to her main body's strenght she didn't just want to leave a fully powered avatar sitting around for anyone to happen upon. And as she opened her eye's once again she was greeted with a much different sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small spinning disc, of stars, nebula's, asteroids, and planets. Very small, actually the entire galaxy was only the size of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RrrrrrrgghhhHHH.....*Snffff* *Phew* Its okay, its okay. There small, I'm big. That's why I'm a goddess and their...the ones who took my....NO! NO, thinking like that!\" Sa-x shook her head to forcefully clear her thoughts, she did not want to get angry, not this close to a reality. The results would be volatile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay last time! and at least at this size I can sense their ship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Sa-x closed her eye's split her body, again absorbing the larger avatar, and this time made sure to deposit herself right next to the Federation ship she was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x shows up and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sa-x blinked, the Ship simply levitated in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was supposed to...smaller...but...Fuck it! This will work.\" Sa-x said to no one in particular as she reached out and grabbed the capital ship. A 2 mile long starship, a crowning achievement of technology and war, or to her a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAboard the starship, klaxon's were going off at full volume. Men and women scrambled about the bridge and corridors of the ship.<br>\r\n\"SHIELDS UP! SHIELDS UP DAMMIT!\" The captain screamed as he snapped out of shock and saw the giant woman's hand descending towards them.<br>\r\n\"CAPTAIN! Is that what I think it is?\" Admiral Rex half asked half demanded.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I believe so sir. I think she found us.\" Captain Serek repilied<br>\r\n\"Dammit, try to survive.\" Admiral Rex sat down at his station overlooking the captains chair on the bridge, and began composing a quick message to send to high command.<br>\r\n\"I planned on it sir, but I'm not sure what we can do against something that big.\"<br>\r\n\"there finished.Okay Captain just survive helps on the way.\" Admiral Rex said as he finished and sent his message to high command, informing them of the situation. He knew this was their chance. They might never get another chance to study the godling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the thunderous sound. Like the detonation of small bomb in a giant hollow cavern. The whole ship shook and men and women went flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman from the communication and navigation center looked up. Then at her screen, up again. and finally to the captain. \"Uh sir, I think....I think...\"<br>\r\n\"She wants to talk.\" Said a young man as he climbed back into the communications chair next the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain looked at them, then up at Sa-x. Sure enough the shaking and booming had been caused by Sa-x \"gently\" Prodding the ship she was holding. She could have easily crushed them, but she was clearly being as gently as she could at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lt. Steel open the comms, hopefully she can figure out a way to communicate, Lt. Mirez figure out our best possible chance of escape.\"<br>\r\n\"Sir yes sir, opening comm lines.\" Steel replied<br>\r\nSir, I recommend sticking out head between our legs and...\" Mirez began to reply before being cut off.<br>\r\n\"LIEUTENANT!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, just stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain ignored his subordinate and turned to the problem at hand.<br>\r\n\"Attention, creature designated as Sa-x, Can you hear me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom far away Sa-x handled the little ship as gently as she could. She remembered much earlier when a whole fleet of these presented a good opportunity to feed and grow her. No the pitiful little thing was barely worth the energy to hold in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard it, well, more or less. She heard the thoughts directed at her. Which for her was far easier then trying to reconfigure her self to interpret electronic communications. Thinking back to the speaker, Sa-x began her conversation and subtly began to probe the speakers mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I hear you.\" Sa-x replied<br>\r\n\"You appear to have non-hostile intent, or we would already by dead. What is it you want?\" came the creature who self identified as Captain Serek. Along with with this Sa-x managed to begin gathering information on those aboard the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour minds stood out to her. The captain who had a wealth of general knowledge. A man at chair beside a woman. Each was unique, the male even in this situation wasn't just experiencing fear but lust as well. He liked her....even as she was. That was new for Sa-x the only other human to respond with positive feelings to her existence was Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was different yet similar story. She was jealous. Sa-x knew of this emotion, it drove her to kill the metroid earlier that threatened to take Samus's attention from Sa-x. But this girl's jealously was more interesting. It was mixed with Envy. Sa-x probed a little deeper and found she was jealous because of the attention Sa-x was getting especially from her male co-officer, and envious of her power. Well that made sense, who wouldn't envy Sa-x she was damn near perfect, but this man and woman had enough will it overrode their innate fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa-x like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was the mind of the admiral and upon probing she found what she wanted detailed info on Samus and project Longinus. Apparently it was still at Admiral Rex's foremost thoughts, meaning he was currently reviewing the info in his own head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this made things much easier.<br>\r\n\"What I want is....\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Came Captain Sereks response not expecting the woman to stop speaking so suddenly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To know everything about project Longinus.\" Came the reply from behind admiral Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eye's on the crew spun to see a completely naked Sa-x now standing on the bridge. More accurately they saw a naked Samus Aran, but most were briefed enough on their mission to know it was just the creatures preferred form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen..</span></div></div>",

Most of the men tried to run out when they realized what was happening, a couple failed to escape and were crushed under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ongoing screams of panicked Federation members, Samus continued to grow, lost in her own mind. Her thoughts were quickly becoming less and less rational, as her brain became clouded with dopamine and ecstasy. Meanwhile, her growing frame was crashing through the medical center, reducing multiple rooms to a pile of rubble, and causing the floor above where she lay to collapse in on itself. A soft \"...perfect...\" was all she could muster to say during all the pandemonium and destruction surrounding her sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her growth subsided at 120ft tall. Various staff members and federation soldiers at the medical center simply stood there dumbfounded at this titaness that had formed seemingly out of nowhere destroying property and even crushing a few team members. Samus hoisted her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was so much fun...\" The joyous words flew out of her mouth. She raised the back of her right hand up to her face and said... \"You know what? I'm gonna do something today that I haven't had the chance to do in a long time...\" She pushed a combination of buttons on the pink control pad on her hand. Once entered, her zero suit entered what can only be described as \"bikini mode.\" Most of the surface of her suit dissapated in a short burst of light, leaving only a nice, slim bra and panties on her body, exposing the entirety of her flawless skin and chilsed abs. A few of the federation soldiers whistled (including one female).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get to have much fun anymore...\" Samus mused to herself. She looked to her left to see a large window opening out to the planet's surface. With her newfound incredible strength, she broke through the wall with ease, letting herself outside of the medical center and exposing herself to the fresh air. She finally gave herself a chance to stretch, giving a wonderous view of her backside to the entire base behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stopped for a moment and turned around. \"Now... what to do with all of you?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A new Phazon enhancement device, which she was somehow supposed to believe would not backfire spectacularly? She felt she had seen just about enough of the substance these past months, bringing it up again seemed like a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the laboratory, she was greeted by the head of the project, Dr. Jim Morker. He seemed highly enthusiastic about the project, beyond just the fake cheery attitude that some scientists will put on in hopes of getting grant money. He acted genuinely optimistic about their work, assured of himself that it will be an actual aide to the Federation, rather than yet another detriment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they entered the main engineering hall and the device was revealed in person.<br>\r\n\"Here it is Ms. Aran, the PCM- the Phazon Conversion Module!\" Dr. Morker said with utmost excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus decided to cut right to the chase, \"Alright, so tell me doc, how is this device of yours different from the PED suit you guys made that almost killed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured you might ask about that,\" Morker responded, \"Your old PED suit took naturally produced phazon and applied its usage <i>directly</i> to yourself and your power beam. This, however, puts the phazon through a strict filtering process, and then applying a substance that the body can take with much fewer and less severe side effects. The substance it creates has a very long, scientific-sounding name, but the lab boys like to call it 'phakeon'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was still skeptical of anything involving phazon, but this did give her a small hint of optimism. \"So what did you want me here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Morker continued, \"There's not an easy way for me to say this... but, we think you would be the prime test subject.\"<br>\r\nSamus raised her brow.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know, a bit of a shock. But for starters, we've only been able to get our current prototype to work on females. Our test group, the female rats- no ill effects whatsoever. The male rats, however, all seizures, all the time. Hoo boy, not pretty. Secondly: The Federation is confident that you can handle tech like this. And besides, we'll take all the precautionary measures necessary to ensure that you don't just fall over dead. We have an emergency stop on the PCM, everything has been accounted for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus let herself think for a moment, but eventually realized that if she didn't agree to test it, the federation would just get some other unfortunate soul who was much less prepared for something like this.<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" she eventually said, \"Let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some hours of prepping, Samus had been stripped down to her zero suit, placed alone in a test chamber with the PCM attached to the back of her hand. The design was surprisingly sleek for a prototype, not jutting out too much, and having small injectors going up her hand, entering her body just above her wrist. To the side of the chamber was a window into an observation station, housing both Dr. Morker and two federation guards on either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Samus...\" He began, \"Let's get this show on the road. On your PCM you will see a digital display showing your current \"E.L.\" or Enhancement Level.  Your current EL is simply zero, of course, so raise that to whatever you feel comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reluctantly dials her EL up from zero to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her arms begin twitching, and with each twitch her arm gets a little bigger, a little stronger. Soon, her legs, abs, back, and pectorals begin following a similar pattern of twitchy growth for about 30 seconds. Samus's already toned musculature was already a beaut to look at. Now every strand in her body was looking as if it was trying to burst outwards, pumping more powerful size into her body, little by little. Each twitch was punctuated by a brief, soft moan escaping Samus's lips. After the first 30 seconds, however, her growth smoothed out, and the pleasure center of her brain exploded.<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh... this feels so amaaaazinnnng...\" she squealed, as every ounce of muscle in her body ballooned out even further. In the second spurt, her deltoids grew especially quickly, significantly broadening her shoulder width, and giving herself a very full, empowered figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her growth peaked a 6'9\", and the expansions to her frame and musculature made her figure look comparable to that of her power suit while still in her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo\u2026 Samus.\" Morker awkwardly began, \"It seems you enjoyed that first spurt... how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I feel?\" Samus gave her bicep a mighty flex, \"Mmmmm\u2026 I feel so <i>powerful!</i> I feel inhuman! Like every flex just turns me on even more!\" She bent herself over and gave an even more impressive double bicep flex, making sure to make eye contact with Dr. Morker through the window. \"Ooohhhh\u2026 see?\" Her tone switched to something more seductive completely instinctually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Morker attempted to keep some form of professionalism. He stood still, then grabbed a handkerchief out of his pocket and delicately wiped the sweat off his forehead. \"Yes... well, we actually did not expect the strength enhancements to be so substantial. So... it is probably in our best interests that we collect further data. Are you ready for Round 2, Samus?\"</span></div></div>",
