            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi, I'm Staci Parks, and this is my story. Well, <i>our</i> story, since it's about my friends, too. In fact, if we hadn't been such close friends, I don't think it would have happened to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, the six of us had grown up together in the same apartment complex, and we liked to do just about everything together. If you saw two or more of us together, it was usually a safe bet that all six of us were there. But we were in senior year, and college choices just might have split us up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor myself, the future was FIT. For the layperson, that's the Fashion Institute of Technology. If you didn't learn fashion in Paris or Milan, you damn well better have FIT on your resume. For me, it was nothing less than holy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boyfriend, Jesse Larson, made it to UConn on a football scholarship. Not prohibitively far, but who's to say what even that distance might have done to the thing we called <i>us</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave Forrester was going to Harvard. It was Step One of his career journey, and he saw himself changing the political system, even if Taylor Brown warned him that the system was going to change him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Taylor, she had been accepted by ICE, or the Institute for Culinary Education. It would have worked out great if it had been the New York ICE, but, unfortunately, she had to take the Los Angeles campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy Brown, Taylor's twin brother, was going to study music at Berklee. Yes, that's how it's spelled. Studying music was the obvious choice for him, given the guitar that he never liked to be far from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Quinn. She had a last name, but none of us ever used it, her least of all. Quinn was going to put on a good pair of walking shoes, pick up a good stick, and walk wherever the road took her. Seriously, that was what she was going to do, no \"until I get into college\" or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, those were our plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, looking back, I'm reminded of something Woody Allen said once: If you want to make God laugh, tell Him about your plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo commemorate what looked like the last time we would all be together, we decided to go camping, instead of going on the senior class trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saturday, and we'd driven to the campground, set up our tents, and had supper. As the sun set, we were content to while away the evening with s'mores and songs around the campfire. Tommy, of course, brought his trusty guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember what song we were singing when it happened, or if it was the fourth or fifth song of the evening. I just remember being distracted by this weird noise. It didn't belong in the forest, and it was getting louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, does anybody - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we came to, we were each a good 10-15 feet away from the campfire. The fire was out, and there was a mass in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe checked ourselves for any injuries, and found nothing. That's when we noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, does anyone else feel - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tingly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter who said what about the tingling sensation, because we all felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for us. We loaded everything back into the cars, and headed back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that thing was?\" Jesse asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, don't care,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat attitude would change.</span></div></div>",

This morning, even my bra and panties seemed too big for me. But, as I checked myself out in my full-length mirror, I couldn't see anything different. Naked, I didn't look the least bit thinner. So why didn't anything fit anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie, my stepmother, knocked on my door. \"Staci, honey, breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on my bathrobe and opened the door, to tell her to set up a doctor's appointment for me. Maybe Dr. Kumar could figure out why I was losing weight. That's when I saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, I had stood at 5' 8\", since my last growth spurt. Allie, by contrast, wasn't an inch over 5' 5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I opened the door and saw Allie standing there, the last thing I should have been doing was looking her straight in the eye. Which is what I was doing right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie noticed it, too. \"Staci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" I said. \"Go take care of Libby. I'll talk about it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed the door, and called Jesse. He picked up on the second ring. \"Hello?\" He sounded a little off, but I was too freaked out by my situation for it to register just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, something weird happened. You're going to think I'm crazy, but I swear to God, I'm - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Three inches. How'd you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened to me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us? \"You call Dave,\" I said, \"I'll call Quinn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I got off the line with Jesse, I called Quinn. \"Staci,\" she said, \"this has got to be a nightmare, but I can't wake up. Please wake me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you found yourself shorter,\" I said, \"it's no dream. It's happened to me and Jesse, too. He's calling Dave right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll call Taylor and Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung up, and the phone rang. It was Jesse. \"Dave, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same with Quinn. She's calling Taylor and Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn called back, confirming that it had happened to Taylor and Tommy, too. That made it unanimous. I cinched up my done (which, I now noticed, was now touching the floor) and went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on me. Allie had clearly told them about me. Not that I blamed her, or even that I didn't want her to. It saved me time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down. \"It's not just me,\" I said. \"All six of us have shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could cause something like this?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had only one clue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite how crazy it would sound, I had to make a report of what had happened to the local police department, so whatever was happening to us does not affect anyone else. I reported the incident to the dispatcher, who patiently listened. When I heard her sigh, I expected to be given a lecture about making prank calls, but instead, she calmly replied, \"Miss Parks, you are the fifth person to make this report, with identical details of this incident. We have sent a HAZMAT team to the site, and found the object in question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, I asked, \"Did they find anything to corroborate our claim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The HAZMAT team found a full grown bear the size of a kitten.\" To my shock, the dispatcher said. \"Anyone or anything unprotected from this thing will shrink.\" She paused, then asked, \"Do you remember how long your were unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hours...\" Horrified, I said. \"We need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain calm, Miss Parks.\" Firmly but kindly, the dispatcher said. \"An ambulance is on its way to you now. I suggest you contact everyone you had been in close proximity to in the last twenty-four hours, to have them checked out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped a second time, my hands trembling. \"I'll get ready.\" My voice quavering, I said. \"I have only been in contact with my father, my stepmother, and my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will send a separate ambulance for them.\" Serious, the dispatcher said. \"Tell them to get ready, as they, too, may have been exposed to this radiation through you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was terrified. \"Radiation?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, I turned to Allie, shaking. \"They're sending two ambulances, one for me, and one for you guys and Libby.\" Tearfully, I explained. \"It turns out we were all exposed to some form of radiation, and that is what's causing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Radiation is cumulative.\" Worried, Allie said. \"I'll grab Libby, and see if I can find something for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off to Libby's room and presently returned with a bra and panty set, as well as a skirt and blouse set that looked to be more in my size. \"Where on Earth did you find these?\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie blushed slightly. \"I tend to keep at least two outfits as you grow out of them, for memories.\" Softly, she admitted. \"We all have our own little obsessions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not comment on that, as I was grateful I had something to wear that fit. While I quickly got dressed, Dad and Allie rushed to gather what they thought we may all need for a lengthy hospital stay. The two ambulances arrived shortly after, with paramedics in Hazmat suits who quickly, but gently, put us on gurneys and rolled us into the ambulances. Allie carried Libby, who was crying at this point, frightened by all the strange clothed people all around her. I had to admit, I was crying in fear as well, at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to remain calm, Miss Parks.\" politely, one paramedic said. \"You are in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm scared...\" Crying, I admitted. \"Am I going to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we can help it.\" Serious, the paramedic replied. \"Just relax and let us take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember much about the ride to the hospital, as I felt a prick in my arm just before I fell into darkness...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I wasn't alone in the room. \"Jesse!\" I got up and hugged him, not remembering until he was in my arms that my gown opened in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to hold it closed, but Taylor's voice said, \"That's a bit like closing the barn door after the horses got out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned. The rest of our group was there, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, Staci,\" Tommy said. \"What happens in quarantine, stays in quarantine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing, I put my mind on other things. \"Which one of you was the first to call the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave raised his hand. \"I can be very persuasive, and this situation called for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let him fool you, Staci,\" Jesse said. \"He was freaking out as much as anybody when I called him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the containment room opened, and a figure in a hazmat suit entered. A figure with a familiar face. \"How are you, Staci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaller, and scared, Dr. Kumar,\" I replied. \"How are the folks and Libby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're doing well. Libby's playing with the other children. I think she'll come out of here with new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about us?\" Dave asked. \"Any word on what we're dealing with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the last I heard, young man.\" Turning to me, she said, \"Allie sent me to reassure you. She knew you'd be more worried about them.\" With that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I knew my family was okay, I turned my attention back to the group. Spotting Quinn sitting alone, I decided to sit next to her. \"You've been quiet,\" I said. \"Any reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering,\" she replied. \"How do you suppose that bear is doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. Classic Quinn. \"Nice to know that part of you is undiminished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother doctor came in. Seeing this, Dave asked, \"Can you tell us what we're dealing with? What is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact,\" the doctor said, \"we can pass along further information. What you found was... \"</span></div></div>",

We were the same size we were that morning. Then, they went to measure our families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat in silence for a while, until Jesse asked me, \"What's your mom up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, \"I only get updates in letters on my birthday.\" When my parents divorced, my mom embarked on what she calls a \"journey of self-discovery.\" Last year, she was in India. In my darker moments, usually when I had trouble making a design work, it would occur to me that the only things my mom had discovered about herself were that she didn't want to be married or have a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse put his arm around me. \"We'll be okay,\" he said, as if sensing my thoughts right then. \"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we shrink smaller than that bear?\" Dave asked. \"What then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear, I could almost hear the others glaring at Dave. \"Then we'll be okay tiny people,\" Taylor half-shouted.</span></div></div>",

And remember, they're not allowed in the building without permission, and I'm certainly not about to give it to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief. \"You always know how to make me feel better, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And seeing a smile on your face always makes me feel better, Staci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse came in. \"Time's up, Mr. Parks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a heavy sigh. \"Love you, Staci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, too, Daddy.

After all, you haven't got the cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two reasons, Mr. Forrester: First, we are confident that none of you represents what we would call a contamination hazard. Exposure to you will not harm anyone.\" To make her point, she removed her hood. \"Second, the fact is that, apart from your shrinking, none of you are ill in any measurable way, and we need this space for sick people. After lunch, telephones will be plugged in next to your beds, and you will get to give your families the good news yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that announcement, even another round of the BRAT diet didn't seem so bad. You'd have thought we hadn't had solid food in ages, the way we gobbled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, the orderlies hooked up the phones, and they were as glad to be out of the hazmat suits as we were to have the return home in sight. I took several deep breaths, composing myself and planning what I wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I made the call. Dad picked up. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Daddy, it's Staci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staci! God, it's good to hear your voice again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, Daddy. I called to tell you two things: First, tell Allie that, tomorrow, I'll be about five foot one. Let me hear you tell her that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Allie, Staci wants me to tell you that she'll be five foot one tomorrow. No, I don't know why, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second thing, Daddy, is... I'm coming home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home? Really?\" I could hear cheering in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Clean bill of health. You know, except for the shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My baby's coming home,\" Dad said, and I could hear him trying to hold it together for just a bit longer. \"You don't know how happy that makes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not half as much as it makes me,\" I replied, fighting back my own tears. \"I love you, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too, pumpkin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll see you tomorrow. 'Bye, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Staci. See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the call over with, I let myself cry, more tears of joy than you might expect from someone my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were all done calling and crying, we started talking amongst ourselves. \"What's gonna be the first thing you do when you get home?\" Taylor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat a steak,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pet my cats,\" Quinn said, \"if they want to be petted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to hug and kiss my whole family,\" I said, \"and I don't know when I'm going to stop.\"</span></div></div>",

They left it in a bit of a state, but we put it back together. Had to replace a few things, no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look at it later,\" I said, idly brushing Libby's hair as she lay her head in my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School wants you kids to attend classes as usual. But they're setting up so you can take your classes online if things get too difficult, you know, what with the reporters and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad specified the reporters, but I think we all knew what he really meant. Whenever we had to walk any distance, they had to stop and wait for me. It wouldn't be long before I could no longer get to class on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those concerns were for another day. Right now, I wanted to sit on the couch, with Allie's arm around me and Libby's head in my lap. I had five friends who had my back, and I was surrounded by my family. I didn't have to be afraid of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, I checked out my room. there were a few signs that something had happened in there, but it was in decent shape now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that I had some new things. My hamper was new, probably because my camping clothes had been tossed into it. The lamps were new. My bed was new,... and significantly smaller. But, when I climbed into it, my feet reached almost to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dresser was now stocked with the things Allie had saved. When my old clothes ran out, there were Libby's things. <i>Bless Allie for being a packrat,</i> I thought.</span></div></div>",

I had gotten into the habit of measuring myself, even though I was shrinking at a steady rate of an inch per day. I brought the tape measure up to the top of my head, then checked what it said: 4'10\". I was squarely in the elementary school phase of my wardrobe. <i>Next week,</i> I thought, <i>I'll be down to Libby's size,... until I get even smaller.</i> The only clue to how small I'd get was a bear the size of a kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie dropped Libby off at kindergarten, then drove me to school. Once there, I realized that, unlike my body, the media's interest in me and my friends showed no signs of getting any smaller. The moment Allie opened my car door, I had microphones and cameras shoved in my face. They all asked me the same asinine question: <i>What's It like to shrink?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie was overwhelmed, but rescue came in the form of some boys, who got between me and the reporters. When I looked up to thank them, I recognized them as members of the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like the circus?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer it when I'm <i>not</i> the star attraction,\" I replied, kissing him. Shrinking was hard to deal with, but at least I wasn't going through it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staci?\" called Morgan Detweiler. She was one of my best friends outside the group. \"Is... is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's left of me,\" I said, as we walked to homeroom. \"How was the class trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know. Nothing interesting ever happens on one of those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it from me, Morgan, you don't want to wish too hard for something interesting to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. Staci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel? Like, are you sick? Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't. In fact, I feel just the same as when I was your size. If I didn't have to crane my neck, or if people didn't have to slow themselves down for me to keep up, I probably wouldn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was wrong. There was plenty to notice. If not the stares, then the fact that my feet no longer reached the floor when I sat down.</span></div></div>",

Second rule of negotiating with my dad: When he does that, you've got him in your corner. \"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, the phone rang. Dad picked it up. \"Parks family. Oh, hello, George.\" George was Jesse's dad. \"We were just talking about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, Dad made some calls to the media.

We made this decision because, since our plans for life after graduation would take us in different directions, we wanted to have one last hurrah for our years-long friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were celebrating our first night camping, when our campsite was struck by what proved to be a meteorite. The shock wave from the impact knocked us all out. When we came to, we felt a tingling sensation that we couldn't explain. In a panic, we loaded up our things and drove home. We regret not striking our tents, as we should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a laugh. I made a mental note to thank Dad for suggesting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a few days, we realized that we had begun to shrink. The shrinking process occurs at a steady, reliable rate, and is causing us no pain or discomfort. As for how small we can expect to become, our only clue is an adult female bear, now about the size of a kitten. It broke Quinn's heart that she couldn't adopt the bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother laugh. Dad didn't suggest that one, it was my idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we took questions from the assembled media for a few minutes, then closed the press conference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, reporters no longer hectored us.</span></div></div>",

I, a 17-year-old girl, was now shorter than my 5-year-old sister. I now stood at 4 feet even, or the average height of a 4-year-old. This got me no small amount of teasing from Libby, and not just because I was wearing clothes from when she was a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dad stayed at home to finish making the apartment livable for me, Allie decided it would be a good idea to get out of the house while I was still able to do so. Had I known what that entailed, I would have insisted on staying home. The first humiliation came when I saw a second car seat had appeared next to Libby\u2019s. Turning to Allie, a mortified look on my face, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey, but children at your height are supposed to be in booster seats.\u201d After strapping Libby into hers, Allie turned to me and said, \u201cLibby doesn\u2019t have a problem with it; and, honestly, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to need one much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a 17-year-old girl!\u201d frustrated, I said, \u201cI have my driver\u2019s license; now you expect me to sit in a child\u2019s car seat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the only way we\u2019ll be able to go to the mall.\u201d Lifting me into the car, Allie said, \u201cI\u2019m not about to get a ticket because you were being stubborn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized there was nothing I could do to fight this, as humiliating as it was.  I gave in and let Allie buckle me in.  As Allie made her way to the driver\u2019s seat, Libby looked at me and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad sitting in a booster seat, Staci.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve basically been in one your whole life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the mall, I quickly realized that walking was going to be a problem.  Just walking the short distance from the car to the entrance had winded me.  I knew what was coming, but I was still embarrassed when Allie came over with one of those tandem rental strollers.  <i>Could this day get any worse?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the interview, I still got looks from people, as Allie pushed us through the mall as we walked into Sears to buy some clothes for Libby, since she\u2019d had a growth spurt.  While Libby was in the dressing room trying on some of the clothes, I stayed outside with Allie in the stroller.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhy did you have to bring me?\u201d frustrated, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m shrinking; I don\u2019t need to have it rubbed in my face that my 5-year-old sister is getting bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intent, honey.\u201d Kneeling down, Allie said, \u201cYour dad and I just thought you\u2019d like to get out of the house for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, an older woman came walking over to us.

I had half a mind to politely ask the woman to leave me alone. Only I was caught off guard when she offered me a business card. \"My name is Lauren Grey, owner and operator of Grey Line Dolls.\" Serious, she said. \"I create dolls of all shapes and sizes, for children and adults of all walks of life.\" She then motioned to a display nearby. It was wearing the same outfit Libby had picked out. \"Not only do I make the clothing for the dolls, I make them for the children who purchase them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have clothing that fits the modern trends in your size, no matter how far you shrink.\" Simply, Lauren replied. \"You don't have to settle for clothing made for a toddler or younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught my attention, as well as Allie's, who smiled. \"Do you have any outfits with you for Staci to try on, Miss Grey?\" Politely, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Grey.\" Politely, Lauren said. \"Also, please, call me Lauren. I have a shop right across the hall, if you wish to come take a look.\" She then motioned to a young girl no older than Libby, looking through a rack of clothes. \"I was here with my daughter, Fawn, when I noticed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn looked up, hearing her name, and smiled before shyly but politely waving. \"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a bit shy, due to mine and my husband's work.\" Lightly, Lauren said. \"But enough of that. Feel free to come to my store, if you are interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she walked back to her daughter to help her pick out an outfit. I turned to Allie, who was still smiling. \"I guess it was a good thing that you went shopping with us after all,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, but found it wise not to say anything, as Libby walked out, wearing a pair of denim overalls with a blue and white stripped short sleeve shirt with fluffed shoulders underneath. She giggled, twirling around once to show off her new outfit. \"I love it!\" Smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you do, honey.\" Kindly, Allie said. \"As soon as we are done here, we will be going to the shop across the hall to buy Staci some clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Libby looked out the door to the shop across the hall, and giggled again. \"We're taking her to a doll store?\" amused, she asked. \"I got plenty of doll clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doll clothes were not made with people in mind, dear.\" Patiently, mom said. \"The clothing your sister will be buying were made with people in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Confused, Libby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, and don't tease Staci too much, or you'll be grounded.\" Serious, Allie said. \"Just like I grounded her last year for teasing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibby pouted. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All our full-sized friends came. And the party felt more like a send-off, at least for me. Morgan was going to FIT. Connor would play in the Big 10. These friends would live out the dreams we once had for ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the ones we wouldn't see again. It was the end.</span></div></div>",

The mattress on the bed felt like a gym mat, and the comforter offered no comfort. So, with no other options, I stuck to sleeping on my big-girl bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching TV in my room felt like I was going to the movies.

After all, they already had the valedictorian to deliver a speech. I figured that Mr. Grey must have put them up to it.

With these tools at our disposal, we can face whatever waits behind the next corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time to receive our diplomas.

Closets had hangers for clothes. They could be plugged into the wall, allowing tiny LED bulbs to be turned on. They had working plumbing, with a reservoir of fresh water where the attic would be, and a waste water basin where the basement would be.

Her name tag read Dr. Rita Norse. \"Did anyone find anything new about these meteorites that are causing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we did.\" Serious, Dr. Norse replied. \"They are pieces of a newly discovered comet NASA has called Nymph, which is slowly breaking up as it passes through our solar system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"So there may be more pieces coming our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorse nodded. \"NASA is working on a way to destroy the comet before that happens, but that is all we could get from them for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, then turned back to see Nurse Sally emerge, wearing a stylish pair of pants and blouse with a blazer, smiling. \"This is so comfortable.\" Smiling, she said. \"Where on Earth did you find these clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Grey Line Doll Shop.\" Smiling, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then explained what the shop did, and what I will be doing to work there. When I was done, Nurse Sally smiled. \"Well, I guess I could take online courses, earn my PhD, and become your primary doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an idea.\" Smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie then turned to the other counselors. \"These should fit you better than the doll clothes you had been provided.\" kindly, she said. \"We brought some clothes for the kids as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counselors thanked Allie, then took the clothing to the children, who gratefully moved to private areas to get changed. Only I spotted one girl who was hesitant to move. \"Are you okay?\" Kindly, I asked. \"Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shyly shook her head, then reluctantly showed me a sleeping timber wolf cub she had hidden in her backpack. \"It was scared and alone.\" Tearfully, she said. \"I just couldn't leave the poor fellow out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then called over Quinn. \"I think this is more your expertise.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn came over, saw the tiny wolf, and sighed as well...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In this apartment, we will place numerous dollhouses, from the Ultimate Dollhouse Collection. These will be your homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ultimate Dollhouses are high-end,\" I said. \"How are you going to get enough for everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By asking nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Allie said, \"you and the owner of Grey Line have the same last name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are married. But I still have to ask her nicely. I'm sure you already know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think we want to live in some cheap dollhouse?\" asked one of the counselors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheap?\" Mr. Grey was clearly offended. \"Ultimate Dollhouses are available only from Grey Line, which has furnished the very clothes on your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not kidding about the houses,\" I said. \"I've got one back home. They're quite realistic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. To continue: If you'd rather not live in a house, there are condominiums. And, while we couldn't put them in a commercially available dollhouse, we can install miniaturized appliances. And you can set up shops. It will be a village all your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to give this some thought,\" Allie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter is an adult, she can decide for herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to think it over,\" I said.</span></div></div>",

I liked the title better than the tagline (\"Real People. Real Stories. Real Tiny.\"), but I'm not in promotions. Giving us a preview was a simple matter, as the apartment they planned to use was in our building. (Lucky thing, as it would make spot inspections by Dad and the others easier.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our layout is in the living room area. Mini-cameras will capture everything. The bedroom is where we'll monitor what's going on, particularly the things that make for good television. We'll also be using the kitchen and the bathroom. We have varying elevations, allowing for a more visually interesting layout, as well as - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys\" Quinn yelled, \"a pool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it,\" Mr. Grey said, \"that's a bigger deal than I anticipated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suction units in full-sized pools could be hazardous to us,\" I said. \"None of us wanted to test the theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. The landscape can be altered to simulate the outdoors. We have bare trees for the fall, a snowscape for winter. We'll even decorate the exteriors for Christmas, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will the kids be staying?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At home,\" Mr. Grey replied, \"with their families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" Dave asked. He had really come to like the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever tried to ask parents for permission to take their children away and hand them over to complete strangers to raise? Spoiler alert: It's a legal nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we don't get to see them at all?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of them will have their own show. We're calling it <i>Growing Up Miniature</i>. Occasionally, we'll bring them by here, or you'll drop by there, get some cross-promotion going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad,\" Taylor said. \"I would have liked to have more time with kids closer to our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hear this from me,\" Mr. Grey said, \"but, uh,... \" - he pretended to look around - \"one of the camp counselors is pregnant.\" He changed the subject. \"I'll let you be the first to pick out your homes for the show. We'll give you clothes to wear, especially since it doesn't sound like you've got your own swimsuits. And, Staci? Why don't you have a look inside the market, see if anything catches your eye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set me down in front of the market, which was laid out like a convenience store. There was food, beverages, candy,... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAMPONS!\"</span></div></div>",

The film crew had yet to provide us with miniature clocks, always saying they\u2019d arrive on Tuesday, so it was a hassle to figure out what time it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to the simulated sound of wind and birds outside my window.  Throwing off the covers, I climbed out of bed and walked to the window.  My place was situated so I had a view of the park a short distance away.  I could see a few people sitting on the benches, but couldn\u2019t tell who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed in some jogging clothes, I grabbed a bottle of water and ran out the front door. Despite the best efforts of the film crew, I could still tell the environment was fake; the trees were the fake kind you\u2019d find in a Christmas Village diorama. But I wasn\u2019t complaining; it was still a decent place to live, even if there were cameras everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jogged down the street to the market; which was really a distance of 8 feet but felt more like a mile. I walked into the store just as Grace, one of the camp counselors, came out. Looking down at her baby bump, I said, \u201cHey Grace, how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good. The baby\u2019s due date is in a couple of weeks.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI had a chance to talk with my wife last night; I know she\u2019s a bit confused about her role in raising our baby, but I reassured her that she\u2019d be a part of its life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no shortage of family turmoil here; between you and your wife, and Allison and her fianc\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, how are things with Jesse and you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse and I hit kind of a rough patch about 3 days into filming; he wanted to spend the night at my place, but I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready for that yet. \u201cWe\u2019re working things out.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI hate to say it, but there\u2019s not a lot of options when it comes to dating here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you two will work it out.\u201d Smiling, Grace said, \u201cYou two have been friends for a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Grace, I continued my jog towards the park.  I was just about to get there when I heard someone call my name.  Turning around, I saw _______.</span></div></div>",

See you later, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got out, I kept thinking about the matter. Jesse was right. That is, he had sized up the situation correctly. Miniature condoms were even harder to get right than miniature clocks, and, even if they could make birth control pills in our size, they couldn't run blood tests to make sure the dosage was correct. That meant, if we wanted to make love, we had to risk getting pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also, I had been thinking about us having sex ever since we'd moved into the village. Dad had made it clear that, even though I was under my own roof, I was still living in his home. Before we shrank, Jesse and I had talked about getting our own place one day, and everything that meant. Now, the opportunity was there, but I was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wanted to make love, just as much as Jesse did. Hopefully, I could resolve this dilemma soon, before I drove myself crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, well, it made for good TV, right?</span></div></div>",

Shall I bring her in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse and I nodded, and Mr. Grey walked off. Mrs Grey came in shortly after, carrying a tiny little girl, crying on her knees, in the palm of her hand. Hannah was petite, with long blond hair, blue eyes and doll-like features. \"Hannah, this is Staci and Jesse.\" Gently, Mrs Grey said. \"They have agreed to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Grey then gently placed Hannah onto the fake grass in front of us, where she slowly looked up, with tears in her eyes. \"I-I remember you.\" Crying, she said. \"No-No one else wants me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to cry uncontrollably, to which I gently took her into my arms with a warm hug, slowly rocking her back and forth to comfort her.

I then smiled. \"You're still getting a separate bedroom for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse chuckled at that. \"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of yips interrupted us, and we looked down to see the tiny timber wolf pup from before, wagging its tail happily at us. Hannah grinned, though still crying. \"Fozzie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grey chuckled. \"The kids proved to be just as indestructible as you, so we saw no harm in allowing Hannah to keep a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse sighed, though smiling. \"What a week.\" Bemused, he said. \"We have our first fight, and come out of it with a daughter and a pet timber wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that, and we both kissed Hannah on one cheek, before putting her down to greet her wolf pup.

I directed traffic during the move, and fed the boys when their job was done, then I helped Jesse unpack.

In this apartment, this past spring, they were for a 17-year-old girl who had shrunk too small to climb into bed any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked at Dad. \"You guys thought of everything, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie's the fast thinker,\" Dad replied. \"When we had time to plan, that's where I came through. How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've shrunk a foot and a half from stupidity. Other than that, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI signaled for Allie to put me down where Holly could reach me, then they left us alone. \"What's going on, Holly? You can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like, shrinking when you know where it'll stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I couldn't tell you. We were the first people to shrink, so we had no clue when, or even if, we would stop. As far as we knew, we might dwindle away to nothing. We just didn't let on to anyone except each other. We all celebrated when we stopped, because it wasn't a sure thing. Dad and Allie, in my case, wouldn't even let me <i>hint</i> at the prospect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My folks are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what: You call me when you want to talk about the stuff your folks don't want to talk about. I've been in that hole, so I'd like to help you out.\"</span></div></div>",

Fozzie, the shrunken timber wolf, was injured, after protecting the village from a real threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the cameramen had opened one of the apartment windows in order to smoke. That alone was forbidden, but what made it worse was that he neglected to close it. A house sparrow, 6.3 inches long, flew in and spotted the village. Normally, a house sparrow is a compact bird with a full chest and a large, rounded head. But, to the villagers, it was a monster that stood just as high as we did. It let out a chirp that sounded more like a screech to us and tried to peck at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that get in here!?\" Fearful, Taylor demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pointed to a window, to our perspective, miles away. \"Some idiot opened a window!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to strike the bird with his guitar like a club, until he became pinned down by the bird's talons. It was clear that the sparrow saw Tommy as a meal... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Fozzie jumped in, yipping and growling at the bird with all of its tiny might. The sparrow did not know how to react to it and jumped back, releasing its intended prey. Still, it gave Fozzie a strong swipe of its talons. Fozzie let out a loud yelp, but he was not done. He bit the sparrow's leg and held onto it as the bird screeched in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, move!\" urgently, Quinn screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others turned, then dived aside, as Quinn drove the car full speed into the sparrow, throwing it off balance. It fell from the table with the car going down with it. Fortunately, Quinn was able to jump out in time, and Fozzie let go as the sparrow fell. The bird hit the floor with a satisfying crunch with the tiny car landing on top of it. The bird was not killed but stunned enough not to want to fly back up. It instead retreated out the same window it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone okay?\" Worried, Quinn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll live, but Fozzie is hurt.\" Grunting, Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rushed over to Fozzie to find that his side took a bad hit from the bird's talon. \"This is not good...\" Tearfully, she said. \"I don't know enough to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm, Quinn.\" Firmly, Grace said. \"I'll walk you through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to Grace, surprised. \"You're a veterinarian too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my minor in college.\" Shrugging, Grace replied. \"You first need to get a towel over Fozzie's eyes, so he won't struggle too much while we tend to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Mr. Grey walked in and saw the open window. He turned to the table and found the crashed car along with feathers and blood. Fear filled his expression as he rushed to the table to find Tommy's left arm in a sling and Fozzie whimpering with his entire midsection covered in bandages. \"What happened here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some idiot left a window open, and a bird flew in!\" Angry, Quinn yelled. \"If it were not for Fozzie, we could have all become its lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grey closed the window immediately and turned to the cameramen. \"When I find out who opened that window, he is fired!\" Furious, he said. \"I am ordering screens and locks so this will not happen again!\" He then turned to the villagers, his eyes begging. \"I am asking you not to sue me over this, and to consider staying on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't show the footage to the camp kids.\" Serious, Tommy said. \"They're scared shitless as it is, they don't need to have this giving them nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grey nodded. \"I agree.\" he paused, his expression showing worry. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was still whimpering but wagging his tail, happy to see Hannah, Jesse, and me. \"What happened?!\" Concerned, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some moron left the window open, and it did not have a screen.\" Serious, Grace explained. \"A house sparrow flew in and found the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I thought we were indestructible.\" confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still feel pain.\" Serious, Tommy replied. \"The bird's talons left my arm a little sore, so I'm wearing a sling as a precaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Fozzie?\" Worried, Hannah demanded. \"Is he going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fozzie is fine, just a little scared.\" Calmly, Grace said. \"At first, we thought he had a big gash from the bird's talons, but it turned out to be an old wound that healed badly. The blood we saw was from the bird, not him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he bandaged up, then?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice.\" Sighing, Quinn replied. \"I have to learn somehow, and Fozzie is the only animal in the village.\" She smiled slightly. \"Fozzie does not like them, which is why he's whimpering, but, like Tommy, they are staying on as a precaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are impervious to harm but you still feel pain.\" Serious, Grace said. \"That said, you are not invulnerable... a strong enough strike could injure you, and I, for one, do not intend to test that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded in agreement, but I was still worried. \"Has Mr. Grey at least ordered in stronger safety measures?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor nodded. \"He has already installed screens and added locks to the windows, to prevent anything like this from happening again.\" Calmly, she said. She then smiled. \"We also got a theater and a college campus, to entice us not to sue, and to stay on the program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cameraman who left the window open has been fired.\" Serious, Tommy added. \"That, and the camp kids will never see the footage of the bird's visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, satisfied. \"So, what's playing at the theater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave rolled his eyes. \"<i>A Second Chance,</i>\" Frowning, he replied. \"It's a chick flick about a teenage boy who becomes a girl, due to some untested procedure to enable him to walk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds interesting.\" Bemused, Jesse said. \"For all we knew, that meteorite could have changed all us boys into girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, Taylor, and I giggled at that. \"Maybe we'll give you guys a makeover later.\" Teasing, I said. \"I bet we could make you boys look fabulous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, Dave, and Tommy all chuckled, though nervously, before Dave nudged Jesse. \"Don't give them any ideas...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, shaking my head then asked, \"When do we start college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next week.\" Smiling, Grace replied. \"It turns out that the counselors and I have the degrees to teach all of you in your chosen trades, so we all now have jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, then turned to Tommy. \"How long are you going to wear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed. \"Until <i>Doctor</i> Quinn says I can take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn grinned at that. \"He can take it off when he can lift his arm without saying 'ow'.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Printed posters indicated that the theater would show action movies, comedies, and other genres down the road. None of the movies were in current release, but nobody cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopcorn and sodas were available at the concession stand. They were store-bought and shrunken, rather than fresh-made, but they were still a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie screen proved to be a monitor, so we all knew that we'd be watching digital releases. Better than nothing, and real movie screens were too big for us to watch, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first trailer was well-received. It was for a movie about a teenage girl who found herself pregnant, even though she was a virgin. I think we all wanted to see that movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next trailer didn't go over so well. It was about a high school senior who was bummed because she was only five feet tall, but then she starts to grow. I guess the guys in the control room noticed it wasn't getting a positive reaction, because it got taken off the screen before she grew to more than 7 or 8 feet tall. I don't know if she got bigger than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know, I kind of liked the different perspective. I mean, sure, I would have liked to be five feet tall again. But I thought I was short when I was five-eight. Would becoming a giant be worse than shrinking to doll size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was good.

You know we all hope for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or at least the least worst. But the elephant in the room ain't going nowhere. At least, if it comes to that, I'll be with all of you.\" She paused. \"Uncle Tony is suggesting I move in with your folks until I'm your size. Would you be okay with me living in your old room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Just don't damage the TV, okay? And don't touch anything I left on the top shelves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laughed, and I knew then that I would be angry with whatever fate meant I couldn't hear her laugh again.</span></div></div>",

In fact, he was giggling much like a little kid, dancing around as he was walking my way. The sling was finally off his arm, but I had a feeling his euphoria went a little deeper than that. \"What has you high up on cloud nine?\" Curious, I asked. \"Did Quinn finally agree to go out with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy grinned from ear to ear. \"I'll be singing when that happens.\" Happily, he replied. \"No, I just got my first record deal, from Epic Records!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was surprised would have been an understatement, but Tommy showed me the letter and I let out a short scream of excitement, happy for him as we both shared a hug. \"Congratulations!\" Smiling, I said. \"I know how much this means to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy nodded, still excited. \"Mr Grey videotaped me singing a few of my original songs, and sent it in on my behalf.\" Still smiling, he explained. \"The record company loved it! So did Berklee, who called me up, offering me a full scholarship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like your dreams are coming true.\" Nodding, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy nodded back. \"I hope all of our dreams come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving him I saw Dave, also walking my way, with a sly grin on his face. Curious, I asked him, \"What's with the Cheshire Cat grin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave chuckled. \"I've found my calling in the political field.\" Grinning, he said. \"Instead of running for president, I'm going to start a school, teaching kids politics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will that change anything?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, we have not had any real presidential campaigns, just popularity contests of the millionaires club.\" Serious, Dave replied. \"However, in today's society, one can run for president through the vastly inexpensive social media hub. By learning the ins and outs of this system, anyone born in the great USA can run for president.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only shake my head. \"Looks like Taylor was right, the system did change you.\" I smiled. \"I'm glad it changed you for the better. When are you starting your school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon after I graduate from college with my degrees in business, social media and political law.\" Smiling, Dave said. \"I'm going to be hitting the books hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking with Tommy and Dave, I was in a very good mood, so when I saw Taylor walking my way with a smile on her face, I had to ask, \"Having a good day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor smiled at me, but with tears in her eyes. This made me worry, up until she responded. \"I got a letter from the Institute for Culinary Education...\" She began to cry happy tears. \"Gordon Ramsey wants to add my recipes to his Hell's Kitchen menu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was incredible news. Gordon Ramsey was one of the most famous chefs in the world. Both of us danced around, screaming and giggling at the same time. \"Congratulations! I can imagine how proud this must make you feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICE wants me on their team, the sooner the better.\" Smiling, she said. \"They want me to start classes before Gordon Ramsey offers his own school to me.\" She paused. \"I take it the others are getting good news, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy has his first album with Epic Records, and Dave is planning to open his own political sciences school, to teach middle class to poor students how to run for president on a dime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor giggled, shaking her head. \"I knew the system was going to change him.\" She then softly added, \"I'm glad it's for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both turned, hearing Quinn calling us as she ran over, with a letter in hand. \"Guys, I got some great news!\" Smiling, she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been getting good news all over the village.\" Grinning, I said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a letter from the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.\" Smiling ear to ear, Quinn said. \"They wrote telling me that I'm the perfect size to perform surgery on small animals, that would normally be a challenge for full grown veterinarians!\" She giggled. \"They want me in on a full scholarship, before some other college discovers my talents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave Quinn a warm hug, which she returned. \"I guess that only leaves Jesse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Jesse?\" Curious, Taylor asked. \"What good news does he have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"He's been getting letters from every college football team in the country, wanting him on their team, as he can spot mistakes the best coordinators might miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to be a tough decision.\" Shaking her head, Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" rolling my eyes, I replied. \"As for me, Mrs Grey wants me to take over the business when she retires, as her daughter has no interests in dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she interested in?\" Curious, Quinn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned. \"She's a singer, like Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was, in Allie's words, \"a lovely way to show friends and family who aren't nearby how much you've grown.\" The <i>you</i> in this case being me and Libby. Of course, now that I was under 6 inches tall, that raised a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still willing to do it,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never doubted it for a second, Staci,\" Allie said, \"you've been a booster for the cards since we started. But now, we have the matter of pulling it off. After all, we don't want to obscure your smiling face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the issue. We had always done full-body portraits. Now, though, the size difference meant nobody would be able to tell what my facial expression was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we go with a whimsical idea,\" I said, \"Grey Line has a full array of outfits I can wear. We've got everything from ugly Christmas sweaters to elf costumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's the key,\" Dad said. \"Instead of just showing us, we show how we're dealing with the big thing that happened this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was agreed: Our Christmas card this year would be us having an Ugly Christmas Sweater party, with Jesse and me in the foreground, close enough to register our smiles, with enough scale to show we weren't hiding how much we'd shrunk (as if that were possible, given our status as reality TV stars).</span></div></div>",

There were several tables being played, including dice and Roulette. Both of us got more than a few stares from the gamblers trying their luck, as we were escorted into the security rooms of the casino. There we met the owner, Mr. Benny, who greeted us with a polite smile. \"Gambling is a multi-billion dollar business.\" serious, he explained. \"We catch dozens of cheaters and hackers trying to get rich quick every year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard gambling is addictive.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Calmly, Benny replied. \"We also run a treatment center for those who get hooked. We are not in the business of robbing people of their life savings, just giving them the thrill, and sometimes the lessons, of risk taking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny then showed us one of the many security screens. \"Here we watch every table very carefully, as sometimes even our own employees try to cheat, as to give themselves a pay bonus, or to help a friend win a hand or two.\" Serious, he explained. \"We are only human, and thus vulnerable to temptation, but that is why rules and laws are written.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of rules, that guy just cheated.\" Blurting out, Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny turned to the screen to see the man at the dice table win a large bet. \"How are you certain?\" Curious, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back twenty frames.\" Serious, Jesse said. \"You will see that he took the dice into his right hand, but rolled them with his left, with them far apart from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny sighed, disappointed. \"He swapped the dice, a classic move.\" He turned to a security officer. \"Get to table seven, all of his bets are officially off.\" The man nodded and quickly left, as Benny then turned to Jesse. \"You have a good eye for detail. If you're looking for a job,...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse smiled. \"I'm the new official fair play watchdog for the NFL.\" Politely, he explained. \"I work for the organization to catch teams in the act of foul play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny smiled. \"So you are the one who blew the whistle on that irate fan who was hacking the scoreboard during the championship games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse chuckled. \"That was me.\" Smiling, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny laughed. \"You saved me a lot of money, I was betting on the winning team.\" he paused, then added. \"You also saved me a lot of money catching that cheater. It looks like the had all the tricks to rig every table in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one of his many talents.\" Kissing him, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse blushed. \"It's what I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny handed Mrs Grey a number of tickets. \"The least I can do is get you into the David Copperfield show at MGM Grand.\" Smiling, he said. \"I usually only offer this to my most loyal customers, but you deserve a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Politely, Mrs Grey said. \"We'll be off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the casino, I turned to Mrs Grey, who was carrying us in her purse. \"Why did you cut the tour short?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Benny is a likeable fellow, but he's also an opportunist.\" Serious, Mrs Grey replied. \"He did not bother to hide the fact he had a lot of interest in your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered at that. \"It's a good thing he doesn't know where we live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Grey nodded. \"Benny is not the type to just take what he wants, but he can be a persistent pest when he wants something.\" Bemused, she said. \"It's best to keep him at a distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse and I nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I decided to play a little hooky, and I... I went to Vegas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't,\" I said. If not for the Greys, I wouldn't have had the sense of dread which I now felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how they say, 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas'? Don't believe it. I saw... I saw this thing fall out of the sky.\" The tears really began flowing now. \"I thought I had gotten away from it, but I guess I didn't do it fast enough.\" She wiped the tears from her eyes. \"I'm shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why she looked off. \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"At least six inches. Maybe more. I'm scared to measure... What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down. As soon as this call is over, I'm going to call somebody. When they come for you, you will go with them. We'll take it from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... then you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never thought of myself as particularly vengeful, but I did hang up thinking that some form of justice had been dealt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that is the case, may I never find myself deserving of judgment.</span></div></div>",

After some back and forth, Dad and I picked \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" for the father-daughter dance, while Mrs. Larson and Jesse picked \"Forever Young\" for their dance. \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\" would announce it was time for everyone to dance, while \"Stand By Me\" would be the last dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Allie said. \"Now that I know this, I'll start interviewing ensembles for the ceremony, and DJs for the reception.

This, too, met with her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Mrs. Grey said, \"your gown isn't ready quite yet, Staci. But I have an A-line gown, to give us an idea of how you'll look on your special day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped behind a curtain to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came out, I was met with a round of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI changed back into my street clothes, we got back into our purses, and we left Grey Line. On the way out, the taller ones among us met with several men going in. Presumably, these represented Jesse; his best man, Dave; and his groomsmen.</span></div></div>",

I had thought it would be a straightforward process, but it turned out there was a lot I didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted to meet you,\" the printer said to me. \"May I call you Staci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got through the questions I figured would be asked, but I was surprised when he asked if Allie was my birth mother. \"Why do you need to know that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Staci,\" he explained, \"there is a tradition behind every word in a wedding invitation. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the monitor, and I saw the simulated invitation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Mr. and Mrs. Gavin Parks</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>request the honor of your presence</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>at the wedding of Mr. Parks' daughter</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Staci Elizabeth</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>to</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Jesse Larson</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you're getting married in a house of worship, so we say 'honor of your presence.' If you were getting married in a secular location, we would say 'pleasure of your company.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the next line. \"Allie fills the role of mother of the bride, but she is not your mother. Therefore, we do not say you are her daughter. See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"It makes sense, when you put it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jesse asked, \"where on the invite do we put the registry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't,\" the printer replied. \"That would be tacky. What we do is, we insert a separate card, directing your guests to your wedding website. There, you provide a link to your registry. This preserves the happy illusion that you think having people show up at your wedding is present enough, and the gifts are a pleasant surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got through the particulars of the design, the printer said, \"If you don't mind my asking, there is a practical matter to consider. Traditionally, the bride addresses each envelope by hand. Now, that's worked well for hundreds of years, but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the pen is almost as big as I am,\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of addressing the envelopes,\" Allie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took care of that matter, but it did get me thinking: How were we going to handle the other times when a signature would be needed? Like the marriage license? Like <i>requesting</i> the marriage license?</span></div></div>",

There was everything to make anyone happy, as an adult or a kid at heart, including a small batting area, swings, slides and picnic areas. I smiled, seeing the children from the summer camp playing there, just being kids. It was good to know they had a place to go, to forget they were very tiny people in a giant world. We set up a spot near the gazebo to have our picnic, where we enjoyed a peaceful lunch together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost as if nothing has really changed.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except we are all still together.\" Kissing me, Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and I began to make out until we heard giggles, coos, and whistles from some of the kids, who ran off laughing after we turned their way. \"What are you going to do?\" Ruefully, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them giggle, coo and whistle.\" Smiling, Jesse said. \"Here, they can just be kids. Let them have their fun.\" He then kissed me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, we were making out again, despite the unintended audience, who eventually left us to their own activities. \"What shall we do now?\" After the picnic, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we check out that new movie playing?\" Smiling, Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If I Could Turn Back Time.</i>\" Calmly, Jesse replied. \"It's about a boy who returns home after vanishing for six years, not having aged a day.\" He chuckled. \"Form what Dave told me, crazy things start happening shortly after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went to see the movie and Dave was right.

I trusted her, so I really wasn't spooked, but then she gently placed me down a moment later, and i found a black cloth bag being thrown over my head. Now I was worried, as someone pulled me through a doorway and slammed it shut. Before I could react, the cloth was pulled off of me, and I found myself in an open roof building, with what looked like a runway in the middle of the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I heard a chorus of voices yell, <b>\"Surprise!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around to find all of the girls I had met in my adventures, surrounding me, including the family doctor, Lisa Kumar; Mrs. Grey; and her daughter, Fawn. \"Welcome to your bachelorette party, Staci.\" Smiling, Quinn said. \"The theme, as you may have guessed, is a runway show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I hope you don't mind me being a part of it.\" Timidly, a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find Morgan, who was now no taller than I was. I sighed seeing her, and gave a warm hug. \"Of course, I don't.\" Smiling, I said.  \"Thank you for coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the party began with games, including crazy outfits which we all had to take turns showing off. Next was one of the men from the summer camp doing a little tease dance on the runway, which brought a lot of whistles and cheers from us. Fortunately, the little girls of the group were kept occupied in other rooms, with their turn to walk down the runway when it happened. We all laughed when Hannah asked us, \"Why are you all blushing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the presents, which were presented to us down the runway. One made me blush, as it was a pair of fuzzy handcuffs with two sets of keys. \"Really, Taylor?\" Half giggling, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor shrugged. \"You never know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther presents included sexy lingerie, a cocktail recipe book, a wishing bracelet, I Said Yasss Engagement Ring T-Shirt, Here Comes The Bride embroidered jean jacket, and so much more.

Then, we went to the store. Luckily, some pregnancy tests had just come in.

A conveyor belt had been set up temporarily, to bring the wedding party directly to the head table. We were heralded by \"Good To Be Alive (Hallelujah)\" , and none of us could resist boogieing our way down the belt. Good thing I had removed the train, and traded my pumps for flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we ate, it was time for toasts. (Don't worry, I made sure I had ginger ale instead of champagne.) Allie's was the one that stuck with me: \"If we were to measure based on the capacity for love, then I am in the presence of giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped up to the microphone. \"I want to thank you all for being here,\" I said, \"and being part of our day. Today is the happiest day of my life, and I know it's so cliche to say that. But I want you to know that it was a close decision.\" I took a breath. \"You see, yesterday, I found out that I'm going to have a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got more applause than I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all sat down to eat, which meant it was time for the grand tradition of the guests tapping their glasses with their flatware to demand we kiss. After a while, I had to ask Jesse, \"What do they think, I'm going to get <i>more</i> pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the cake cutting, and I was, and am, <i>so</i> glad I told Jesse not to smear cake on my face. If we have a girl, I'd like for her to at least consider wearing this gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first dance, we chose \"(I've Had) The Time Of My Life\", and you know we recreated the scene. It seemed to work, as people clapped and cheered at the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barstool was brought in, to serve as a dance floor for the father/daughter dance and the mother/son dance. Then the dance floor was open to everyone, and the sight of my father tearing up the dance floor will stay with me forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a completely cheerful note, Quinn found a foolproof method for keeping the guitar out of Tommy's hands without him complaining: she put herself there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with the last dance, we bade farewell to our guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it wasn't the wedding of my dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never dreamed I'd be less than six inches tall.

How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's really hit me that I'm going to be a mother. I'm glad I had you to teach me how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to surprise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you actually hold that little one in your arms, you'll find levels of love you didn't know existed. You'll be scared. And no matter how many books on parenting you read, it's going to feel like you have no idea what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, I feel that way now. Other times, I wonder if I should try my hand at designing maternity wear.\" I waved it away. \"I'm probably just getting a swollen head. I heard that big people want to get married in a copy of my gown, and it's stroking my ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to design maternity clothes for yourself, go ahead. You only need to worry about pleasing yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Thanks, Allie. I know this past year can't have been easy on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been harder for you, Staci. And you've held up better than I would have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I will warn you of one thing: I know you never wanted me to call you Mom, even though that's who you've been to me since we met. But this baby is calling you Grandma. No arguments.\"</span></div></div>",

A few of the couples even started discussing their own families. This was mostly people in their 20s, as opposed to the former camp counselors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI even showed it to Mira, who acted the most motherly I'd seen from her since I was a child: she hugged me, and gave me a kiss on the forehead. \"I'm happy for you, Staci,\" she said. \"I know you'll be a wonderful mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up.

Whatever, it brought tears to my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This calls for a celebration,\" Allie said. \"What would you like to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Grey Line,\" I answered. \"Let's see if she's got clothes my size, but a little more roomy in the waist.\"</span></div></div>",

Should we come back another time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting,\" I replied, \"but one thing I remember from when you were carrying Libby is how fast she seemed to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was that?\" Libby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you were born, Lib. I'll explain later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we can show her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask Allie what she meant by that, I heard Mrs. Grey's voice. \"Good to see you again, Allie,\" she said. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes shopping,\" Allie replied, tapping the purse I was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I figured you'd be coming in soon. What timing, huh? Let's get you in the back room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in the back room, Allie let me out of her purse. \"What's going on?\" I asked. \"Why so busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our new line of clothes and accessories,\" Mrs. Grey explained. \"Maternity clothes for dolls. It's already become our second most popular seller, right after a certain wedding gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not quite ready for that,\" I replied. \"But I do need something with a little more give in the midsection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. Let's try on some things, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy desire for clothes that fit was somewhere between hope and expectation. As ever for as long as I'd known her, though, Mrs. Grey did not disappoint. \"And I'll let you in on a secret,\" she said. \"When you're just puttering around the house, you can wear one of Jesse's shirts. While you're here, would you like to try on what's just ahead for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well. As I was telling Allie, I know from before Libby was born how fast babies grow when you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Grey nodded, and handed me an odd-shaped pillow with straps on it. \"Half the secret for our popularity,\" she said. \"From the outside, it looks just like a baby bump. So you'll know how you'll look in maternity wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly did. It started me crying all over again, the way so many things did now that I was having a baby. Once or twice, Jesse had jokingly asked if I wanted to see something sappy. You know, the kind of movie that would be guaranteed to bring on the waterworks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, satisfied that I had enough to wear for a few weeks, I charged my purchases, and Allie picked up some things for Libby.</span></div></div>",

That's what the village is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what's causing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I'm a fashion designer, not a physicist.\" I decided to change the subject. \"That ring around your neck. What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled it out by the chain. \"It's mine. Daddy bought it for me, six weeks ago. Before it got too big for me, I never took it off, except for bedtime and the shower. Oh, and when I cleaned it. Want to see it?\" She moved her ring toward me, to give me a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>something</i> pushed me backward. <i>Hard.</i> It knocked me off my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel noticed it, too. \"Are you okay? What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, standing back up. \"If I didn't know better, I'd swear you just punched me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her ring. \"Did <i>it</i> do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure seems like it. What can you tell me about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined the ring. \"It's a new gemstone. I can't pronounce the name. When I wore it, I felt stronger, more energetic. It couldn't be the ring, could it? I mean, I wore it long before I started shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You said you cleaned it? When was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Sometime last week.\" Her eyes widened. \"Right before I started shrinking. Did the cleaning solution do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the bottle of cleaning solution up to me. \"It's definitely a piece of the puzzle. It's not <i>pushing</i> me back, but I feel like I don't want to get too close. May I use your phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared the repellent objects away, then put her phone in front of me. I dialed Mr. Grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered on the second ring. \"Hello? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Staci, Mr. Grey. I'm here with Rachel Masterson. I think we might have found a clue.\" I described the ring, the cleaning solution, and my reactions to both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too much to be coincidental,\" he said. \"Alert the governor to expect my team. We'll examine the ring under secure conditions, then we'll see if we can help Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me?\" Rachel asked. \"Like how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get your hopes up too much before we know for sure,\" Mr. Grey said. \"But we just <i>might</i> be able to bring you up to or near your original height. We'll know for certain later. Goodbye for now.\" He hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel turned to me. \"Did he say he could restore my size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he would try,\" I cautioned. \"But we might have found what's causing the shrinking, and we can warn others before it happens to them. Go tell your folks he's coming.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad and Allie had to follow in the limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all of Rachel's asking, I wasn't allowed to be with her as they examined her. Instead, I waited with Mr. Grey for the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe only had to wait half an hour for some of the results. \"The gemstone's name is Gleaming Arguclasite. We've got a sample, if you're willing to test it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and he produced the stone. \"Commercially, it's called Halostone. Rachel isn't the only one who reported a stimulant effect. How does it make you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same as the cleaning solution: I want to get away, but I'm not being pushed like with Rachel's ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Grey nodded. \"It's not one or the other, but it's both. Any other cleaning solution, and the ring's effect wouldn't change. Any other gemstone, and it would just clean. But use this solution on this stone, and it releases the same radiation as Nymph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why Rachel is shrinking,\" I said. \"But why did it push me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've already shrunk. You're immune to the shrinking effect, and now it repels you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So you can alert the others who are shrinking, they can destroy their Halostone jewelry that's been touched by the cleaning solution. How's it looking for Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try something.

A veritable feast was set before us (a big treat for those of us who were eating for two), and we all had a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadurodam's honorary mayor stepped to the lectern. \"Welcome, one and all, to our celebration,\" he said, \"and a special welcome to our friends from America, for joining us this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe received a polite round of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not only the anniversary of the event that led to the building of Madurodam,\" he continued. \"By an extraordinary coincidence, it is the first anniversary of when our friends' story began. Perhaps one of them would like to share their tale with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunderous applause that followed told me that the residents would like to hear it, and Jesse's elbow told me that I was expected to do the honors.

We grew up in the same apartment building, and we've known each other our whole lives.

We'd gone to... where did we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPause for laughter, and for Jesse to remind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mystic Pines. We'd gone to Mystic Pines plenty of times before, so it seemed like the perfect spot. We knew the way, we knew the trails: It seemed like it held no surprises for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe the campgrounds held no surprises, but the same couldn't be said for the skies above. We'd set up camp, and we were celebrating around the campfire, when a fragment of a certain comet came crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we recovered from the shock, we called off our camping trip and went home. But the damage was done: three days later, we realized that we were shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come to realize that what brought us there that night was, ultimately, what helped us to deal with what happened to us: No matter how strange it was to get smaller every day, no matter how frustrating it was to have more and more things out of our reach, we knew there were... \" I paused to count, which got more laughter and applause. \"We each knew there were five others dealing with the exact same thing. We weren't alone: we were together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we stayed together. With the village, we found a way to follow our dreams while staying together. And some of us have become even closer. Just look at me, and you can see how close Jesse and I are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I go anywhere, people ask me, 'If you had it to do over again, would you change your mind about going on that camping trip?' I can tell you for certain: I wouldn't change a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a standing ovation, and I'm sure the tourists were wondering what the noise was, and what it meant.</span></div></div>",

Come, let us watch the fireworks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was lit up as fireworks were shot off to celebrate Madurodam's anniversary.

It might be more comfortable than the doll house.\" I paused, then turned to Tara. \"No offense intended, you did a great job here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara blushed, a shy smile on her face. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did far more than any of us could have ever asked for.\" Kindly, Sara said. \"I will get the others, and we can all discuss your offer together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to come in?\" Calmly, Sara asked. \"I can offer a cup of tea.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When it boiled, it was poured into a teapot that was filled with shredded leaves from a full-size tea bag. \"I used to do that myself,\" Sara said, \"but I'm a little ungainly now. Now, Toby sees to the boiling water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't a lot of the Nomads. Besides Sara and Toby, there was Sara's boyfriend, Caleb; her father, Cyrus; his mother, Lavinia; Caleb's younger sister, America; and two others, Dorcas and Elisha. Dorcas was the oldest of the Nomads, still active at 65, while Elisha was 22. He mainly tended to Dorcas when she wasn't feeling well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more than 150 years ago,\" Dorcas said. \"Our ancestors made camp in a peaceful little valley. They were undeterred by the warnings of the local Indians, who said that a terrible curse would be on their heads if they didn't give that valley a wide berth. The next morning, they found themselves only half their former size, and still getting smaller. They asked the Indians to remove the curse, but they could only shake their heads: The curse wasn't theirs, so they were powerless to lift it. All they could do was to warn others away from the place, and hope that they would listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've been wandering ever since,\" I said. \"Presumably, there was a fragment of a comet, like Nymph and her sisters. One such fragment interrupted our camping trip, causing us to shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There once were a lot more of us,\" Sara said. \"I can remember when there were 30 Nomads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Injury. Natural disasters. Being eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're invulnerable,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you are, young man,\" Dorcas said. \"As our ancestors were. However, this protection faded away over generations, leaving us as easily harmed as our full-size fellows. That is why Toby and Sara look for a safe place to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's here,\" I said. \"The village where we live is in one of the apartments above us, and we can accommodate you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may not be ready,\" Cyrus said. \"This is the only life we've ever known. I don't know if we can change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to make up your minds right away,\" I assured him. \"You can stay with us for about a week. Then, once you've seen what it's like, you can make up your minds if you want to stay with us, or go on being Nomads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was agreeable to them, but my thoughts went back to what Dorcas had said. Since finding out that I had become invulnerable, I had taken it for granted. Now, though, I knew that the baby inside me, and the others that would follow, would be more vulnerable. Eventually, my descendants would depend on the village, not just to feel normal, but for their very lives.</span></div></div>",

If we had stopped there, Sara would have been deliriously happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me, on the other hand, the heartbeat sounded strange, as if there were an echo. But I didn't want to scare Sara, so I said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" Nurse Becky said, \"let's see what's going on inside you.\" She flipped on the machine, and a picture of Sara's baby appeared on the screen. \"Here, we see the head,\" she explained, \"the arms, and the legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful, Nurse,\" Sara said. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something else I want to show you,\" Nurse Becky said.

It had gotten to the point where her family had to take her to a lab to monitor her. They said they would bring her back when she officially stopped shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all waited in the village square, hoping for Holly to be brought back. Hannah was cuddling Fozzie, and Jesse and I were holding onto each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grays had entered, with two people who clearly were Holly's parents, Chad and Erin. There were tears in all of their eyes except Mr. Grey, but you can tell he was trying to be strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, Taylor, Tommy, Dave, Grace, Quinn, Hannah, and even Fozzie, and I were waiting in anticipation, as the four large adults walked in with tears in their eyes, holding a petri dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How small is she?\" I said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Gray looked at the petri dish in hand. \"She's 1/12th of an inch tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were gasps from all of us. I wanted to cry, thinking about how that poor girl must feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you all to take good care of our little girl.\" Erin said, crying. Her husband tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Grey placed the petri dish onto the village grass. Jesse and I slowly walked over to it, and saw Holly completely naked in the fetal position. I very gently reached down to pick her up. I cradled her in my palm, like a small hamster. It was so strange to think that I was holding her in my hand at the same range that people for months have been holding me. If I was normal sized, she would be six inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly tried to look up at me and Jesse, afraid that we were now giants to her. She wanted to cry, but it was clear that the tiny naked girl had no more tears to shed. She stood up in my hand and tried to yell for her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad! Where are you? Please don't leave me!\" Her parents couldn't even hear her at the distance. As Holly could peek over the horizon, all she could see was the fabric of her mother's dress and the denim of her father's jeans. Her parents were now strangers to her, like distant mountains. Chad ushered Erin out knowing that the sooner they left Holly, the better it would be for them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm so sorry, Holly.\" Mr. Grey said, before he and his wife also left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of us were silent. The tiny teenage girl just stood there, naked, looking on at the horizon in my hand. I thought that we all had it rough, but she had it the worst. All I knew was that it was going to take all of us to help this girl live a happy life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly,... \" I said, bringing her closer to my face. \"I know that there's nothing I can say to make this better. But we all love you, and we're going to make sure that you have a home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked up at me, with her sad eyes. She wiped her face, and even gave me and Jesse a smile. \"You guys really care about me?\" the tiniest girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do,\" said Jesse. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked up and around, at all of the people gathered around her. This shrunken community looked at the tiny girl in my hand, and knew that she deserved all of their care, and Holly felt the love from all of our villagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a little smile to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she said. I hugged her close to my chest as much as I could without hurting her, and Jesse lightly rubbed my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly may be tinier than the rest of us, but she is home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

Her teacher, Professor Abigail Lemmon was very enthusiastic and super short at barely five feet tall. \"Well everyone, thank you for joining us. I'm so excited to see so many young and enthusiastic future chefs in my class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor grinned feeling good about herself. Her classmates seemed to mostly take to her as well. One girl named Natalie clearly didn't care for her but she was more passive agressive so that was fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to put you into pairs and you're going to have to find time after class to work on your recipes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody got put into pairs, Taylor looked around at her gigantic classmates as they got paired together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, you're going to be with Damien.\" Taylor looked up and she saw a very handsome black haired boy with freckles and minor stubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Taylor,\" he said with a casual grin. \"Ready to get started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor looked up smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Damien right?\" She extended her hand to shake it, and Damien smiling lightly shook it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they cooked in class, they worked on small plates with cheese. Taylor and Damien worked very well together. Damien mostly followed Taylor's lead with him lightly lifting her up so she could get to various objects and pieces of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's like I'm living in Ratatouille.\" She thought. Taylor was standing on the edge of the small pot of melted cheese trying to smell the aromas. <br>\r\n \"Definitely needs more Rosemary\" as Taylor went to climb down she found herself almost falling off but Damien caught her before she could get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, Taylor?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stood up in the giant chef's hand, dusting off her apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Thanks Damien.\" The two smiled at each other before getting back to work. It was very obvious to Taylor that Damien had a thing for her but she tried to focus only on her cooking.

I figured since they got me fired, I should get to show them who's boss.\" Derek said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put my sister down!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Mac said. \"This is your sister huh. She's quite the cutie. Ain't she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally I like this one more, the wild girl.\" Derek said grabbing Quinn. \"What do you say sweetie? Wanna play house ha ha ha?\" Quinn coughed at the smell of his pot breath drenching her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it's like a hurricane of weed, gross!\" Quinn coughed and gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put her down, you jerks!\" Tommy screamed from down on the table. Tommy tried to grab a pencil to fight back, but Derek lifted it up, bringing him to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mr. Music boy, if that girl is your sister, is this little doctor girl your girlfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn and Tommy blushed unsure of how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww look, they're shy, hey Mac, look, they're shy.\" Derek put Quinn and Tommy in the same hand gripping them together with his fist. \"They do make a cute couple I will say.\" Tommy and Quinn struggled to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac was having too much fun making Taylor dance around in his hand moving her arms like a puppet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! I'm not a toy! Stop making me dance!\" Taylor protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God this is hilarious. You're so sassy but you're so puny!\" Mac said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET US GO!!\" Taylor screamed. Mac then teasingly tossed Taylor lightly in the air and caught her in his fist. It seemed hopeless for Tommy, Taylor, and Quinn. They were at the mercy of these giant mad men and they had no idea how to escape their literal clutches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do with them now, Derek?\" Mac said as Taylor struggled to escape his grungy digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does do the giant kidnappers do with our three heroes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I sat there on coffee table looking up at the TV screen, I thought about how different things would be in life. College would be near impossible unless they'd accomodate someone my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV people were also very nosey and were starting to drive me crazy with all of their questions and asking me to try and do things like brush my teeth with a giant toothbrush or watch me climb the couch. I just wanted for me and my friends to have our normal lives and sizes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I just... I just wanna be big again.\" I felt like crying but my dad came over to me and gently scooped me into his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay sweetheart, it doesn't matter how small you are, you're still you and you've still got your friends and Jesse fighting with you. And you're strong. You're one of the strongest people I know, and I know my little girl is gonna get through this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiped away my tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad.\" I said sniffling. Suddenly something on the TV caught the eye of me and my Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBREAKING NEWS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA news reporter appeared on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, I'm Margaret Ashton and our top story tonight concerns the condition of the six shrunken teenagers famous on their reality TV show. A viral video of a man in Brooksville has surfaced with the person having a special message to the shrunken teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the news played a scratchy video clip. An old thin, lanky man with hardly any hair was looking directly into the camera in what looked like a messy shack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. My message is to the teens who shrunk. My name is Peter Minker. I'm a Nuclear Physicist, well former, but I've recently come up with a solution to make you bigger, I need you six to come to me. No one else. If anyone besides you six found me, I'd be in danger. Come find me. 928 Holden Street in Brooksville.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video feed suddenly cut out. I was stunned. I looked up at my Dad and he couldn't believe it either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is it possible?\" I muttered. I looked up at my dad, who gave me a concerned look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, do you think that man can really make us big again?\" I stood up with a new excitement and hope that I hadn't had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad simply scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, that man wanted you and your friends to go by yourselves to visit him. Doesn't that raise any red flags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad was right, it did seem sketchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but I have to try. If me and my friends can avoid being the size of dolls for the rest of our lives than we should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry young lady, but I'm not going to let you risk your life for some crazy person's false promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was furious. How could my dad not want me to do this? I couldn't look at him, I just sat in a fetal position in his palm. My dad knew I was upset with him, and so he just took me to my room, set me onto my massive pillow and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my father closed the door, all I could think about was the chance that someone out there could really do it. Me, Jesse, Dave, Taylor, Tommy, and Quinn could all be back to our normal sizes. Whether my dad wanted me to or not, I knew that this was a risk that we were all going to have to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, I asked Allie to give me a ride without telling my dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, we were all at our old clubhouse from when we were kids. It looked like a massive labyrinth, but we all sat around an old Monopoly board that we used to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think this could work?\" Dave asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" I said \"But we've gotta try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we can't bring anyone?\" Taylor asked. \"I mean, how else are we gonna get there? Hitchhike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn perked up. \"Why not? I was born to do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quinn, with all due respect, not all of us are as keen on traveling in the city on foot while we're all six inches tall.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, what choice do we have? Do you wanna be Tom Thumb for the rest of your life?\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, don't call me that ever again. Second of all, do you even know what could happen if we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse went over to me and put his hand on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staci, do you really think this is a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked into Jesse's eyes and told him without a word that I was 100% certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's do this.\" Jesse said. \"Let's find this guy and get our sizes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and spoke my mind. \"We're going to find this Minker guy. If anyone wants to stay they can, but me and Jesse are leaving. Who's with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly everyone raised their hand fairly quick, even Tommy, who knew this was his chance to be who he really wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, knowing that all of us would be together on this journey. Whether Peter Minker could make us big again was a mystery, but we were gonna find out together. All of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
