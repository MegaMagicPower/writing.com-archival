Maka, wanting to keep her top spot, ran to the library as soon as class was out. Once there, she started looking for a book that might be able to help her. She was so lost in thought, that she didn't notice the book near her feet until she tripped on it. After she stood back up, she noticed the book and decided to pick it up. As fate would have it, the first few pages were blank, and while turning a page, Maka got a paper cut. Before she could so much as say 'ouch,' the spell placed on the book sent her soul flying into...</span></div></div>",

In her research, she created a body swap spell, and used that spell on a book. Now, the book has the power to swap bodies, but the user can't choose who they swap with. A few weeks ago, the book was found by a DWMA squad and brought back to the academy. Not seeing it as a threat, they just left it in the library. That's where the story begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about everything is allowed. I'm not kidding, I'll allow all kinds of smut and/or murder scenes. All that I ask is that you don't just start doing random stuff (TG, TF, AP, AR, etc...) without e-mailing me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
