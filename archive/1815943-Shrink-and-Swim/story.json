            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early afternoon was always a hot time for people to start piling into the water park. Josh, the owner of the park, was just making his rounds near the front desk to schmooze with guests. The short 5'5\" fairly thin 22 year old jogged his way near the desk and scanned the crowd intently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Shrink and Swim!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh said to a family of four, the two sons looked about, amazed at how they just shrunk and went into (from the outside at least) what looked like nothing more than knee high, long plastic box. Their father was busy fishing money out of his pocket to pay the admissions clerk while the wife turned and gave a thoughtful smile while her children grew more and more impatient to start riding all the fantastic water rides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as the family went on their way. It really was a magnificent park, and who would have thought of shrinking people and making a tiny water park! It was even more genius since basically the whole park's water supply could run off a kitchen sink. Not to mention the shrink ray which was solar powered to reduce cost and increase productivity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It practically prints money!\" Josh thought to himself as he watched several more families pay admission and begin shouldering their way through crowds to the rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a stroll past some of the rides he had to inspect today. There was the popular family ride the \"Tubular Time\". Not to mention the speed slides for people who liked to practically fly down the slide called the \"Skin Burner\". Of course there was also the wave pool and lazy river which people who hated waiting in lines could always appreciate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning down the \"Employee only\" section he found the break room entrance. At least from the shrunken side. There was two ways into the break room, one that required going out of the park and around the back, or for the lazier just going in shrunk. \"Wonder who's on break right now.\" Josh thought looking down at his note pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his duties did include checking on the lifeguards in the break room to make sure they aren't late for their shifts as well as going to certain rides to relieve lifeguards from their current shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping over his note pad he noticed he had several new employees to interview in the near future. One of Josh's other more interesting duties is interviewing new employees to work at his water park, a process he often did while still shrunken in a special room near the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh we might be getting a few newbies sometime soon, better take a quick look at their files...\" Josh said to himself flipping through the profiles of the eligible young men hoping to become lifeguards at the pristine water park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are boss!\" came a familiar tone from across the walkway. Josh looked up and saw his head lifeguard, Tyler, running over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Ty, whats up?\" Josh said as the huge man came to a stop in front of him. Tyler was an impressive sight, 21 years old, 6'5\" with wavy brown hair concealed under his red lifeguard's hat, brown eyes hidden under his sporty sunglasses, and a nice strong looking dependable face. Tyler was certainly very easy on the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh don't you remember what you need to be doing right now? It's why I came over.\" He said as Josh's eyes wandered down Ty's strong tanned body. Particularly his massive pecs and sculpted abs. Snapping back to reality though he had forgotten what Tyler was talking about and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you gotta...\"</span></div></div>",

I had to come find you.\" Tyler said pointing over at the door leading to the interview room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... shit.\" Josh thought to himself flipping his notebook back to the new profiles. \"Let's see here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the profiles he took a glace at the first one. In the description was a copy of a neatly printed resume with the name \"Ricky\" printed at the top. Turns out he's 22 years old, has experience working as lifeguard and is CPR certified. The description states that he's 6'4\" blonde hair blue eyes and an athletic build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like he'd be easy to hire and just pull on board...\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh filed to a resume with the name \"Chad\" printed across the top. Looks like he's 24 years old and was in the military. Seems like he's listed as very dependable and strong guy. No experience as a lifeguard, which means he'll need training, but he is CPR certified so that's a plus. The description says he's 6'3\" with brown hair and brown eyes with an athletic build.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dependable... that's good we could use more like him.\" He thought as his mind wandered to less dependable workers he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last profile with a very bare resume had the name \"Scott\" printed across the top. He's 18 years old and has no real work experience. He did happen to list that he played four years of high school football, water polo, and lacrosse. Finally, it seems like he's not CPR certified nor does he have any experience life guarding. The description states that he's 6'11\" with short brown hair and blue eyes with an athletic build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus... this giant probably had more experience drowning people than saving them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turns and looks back at Tyler, \"Do you know which of these guys it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looks down at the profiles and points down and says, \"Yeah his name was...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyler did a playful salute and walked off. Now all that waited in front of Josh was the door leading to the giant he had to interview. Taking a deep breath he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was extremely large, at least for Josh that is. It was a squarish room with a chair and table at one end and a balcony at the other. Josh walked across the balcony to a small microphone that was used to communicate without shouting. Looking past the microphone Josh got his first look at Ricky. He was seated at his chair looking down at the ground. He was as the description said, tall with blonde hair and blue eyes. His hair was shaggy and went down about to his eye brows. He was wearing a tight blue button up tee shirt that looked much too small for him as his broad shoulders and impressive chest seemed to be trying to burst out at any second. His shirt was tucked neatly into a pair of black dress shorts. as expected in this hot temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ricky? Sorry I'm late I was held up. I'm the park's owner. You can call me Josh.\" Josh said into the microphone as clearly as he could. However Ricky, who was not paying attention, jumped at the voice addressing him and starting looking around for the source. \"Uh, over here Ricky, on the balcony\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky rubbed his eyes and leaned forward, looking at me from across the room. \"I'm sorry, I'm just in a little shock. I knew people got shrunk in the water park but I had no idea they were this small!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts pretty common for this to happen, in fact compared to a normal human the people in the water park are a measly 1/2 of an inch tall. \"Its ok, it must be a little shocking but let's get on with the interview shall we?\" Josh said as formally as possible. Ricky leaned back in his chair, resting his back as straight up as possible, which to Josh's prospective just made his chest seem all the more dramatically huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to get distracted by Ricky's good looks Josh tried mostly to look down throughout the interview. He went about asking him typical questions, what can you offer this company? Why do you want to work here? The usual. Of which Ricky performed very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his notes and saw Ricky out of the corner of his eye staring right at him. Josh went on to say \"Well Ricky I've decided...\"    </span></div></div>",

A question I guess.\" Ricky said suddenly standing up and walking toward the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's view was now completely obstructed by Ricky's stomach, which looking up he could barely see Ricky's face past his massive chest. Standing his ground though he answered, \"What question would that be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down so he could look at Josh face to face he replied, \"Well if you decided not to hire me, what's stopping me from just like... squashing you or eating you right now?\" Ricky's handsome face began to twist into a confident smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a step back. Its not the first time this kind of thing has happened. Sadly it was the price he payed for choosing not to just go around front and grow back up for these interviews. But he was confident that he could get past this any time it happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, you absolutely wouldn't get the job if you did that, and second if someone found out what you did you'd end up in jail.\" Josh replied as confidently as he could while trying his best not to shake in front of the eyes of this titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I did you'd also be dead, so you'd have that to think about. As for the police, how would anyone find out?\" Ricky said now starting to show a little teeth in his smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to back up even more, he could just run for it. He'd be safe back in the park. He turns back toward the door when suddenly a huge hand comes slamming down in front of him blocking his only way out. \"Going somewhere sir? I don't think you've come to a decision yet.\" Josh head Ricky's booming voice behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I gotten myself into.\" Josh thought as he turned and looked at Ricky's enormous face.

All the while Josh tried his best to keep a strong confident smile on his face. Hoping that Ricky would buy the act and sit back down. \"Now I kinda have to hire him though.\" Josh though as Ricky turned to go back to his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can you start?\" Josh asks now more calm that the titan retreated back the the chair. \"If its soon, I'd like to get you your uniform as soon as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can start tomorrow sir.\" Ricky said, still smiling over at Josh like a child who just won a argument with their parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Why don't you go on over next door, its the break room and I'll have one of the guys grab you a uniform.\" Josh said, still nervous about Ricky walking back over to him at any second. \"Sure thing sir.\" Ricky said moving out of his chair to the door, still with a self gratified smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Ricky finally left Josh gave out a sigh of relief. Hopefully someone's on break right now and can take care of the uniform. \"Otherwise I'll have to get it...\" Josh thought nervous to spend any more time around Ricky right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the interview room and walking into the break room Josh looked around to see if any of his giant staff could help him.

So where can I get a uniform?\" Ricky stated looking around the room then down at his new boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the room is designed to accommodate for small people coming in from the park. A computer system can be used to operate several different types of elevators and conveyor belts for travel across the room. One other function is getting out spare uniforms from the storage shed. Josh pulled up the program to retrieve a new uniform and looked over at Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What size you take, Ricky?\" Josh said calmly, trying to forget about the terrifying events that took place just minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked down at himself, patting his hands on his solid chest. \"Uhhh well compared to you, like a super XL!\" He said laughing at his own joke. \"Seriously though... like a large if you have any, boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shuddered at the comment of how small he is. \"Hope he doesn't get too used to this..\" he said to himself as he pulled up a large on the computer. Quickly it was delivered over to the room on a rack. The standard lifeguard uniform. Red board shorts, with a cross on them. A white tank top with the word \"Lifeguard\" across the chest. And finally a red hat. Josh looked over at the uniform hanging from the rack and gestured to it for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky grabbed the uniform off the rack and laid it down on the balcony next to Josh. Then he stripped off his button up shirt, Seemingly almost deliberately slowly. He showed off his huge biceps now uncovered by the shirt and his massive chest and stomach still covered by a tank top. \"Let's see how the top feels on me huh boss?\" He says as he peels off his tank top revealing his tanned torso and washboard abs. His pecs were so massive they bounced softly back down after he took off the top. Finally, he grabs the uniform top and slides it down on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a nice fit, nice and loose.\" He says lifting one of biceps and giving it a good flex. \"Do I have to wear the tank top when I'm on duty though?\" He asks, pulling it down and examining his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its not necessary, since chances are it will just get wet.\" Josh said, transfixed by the giant in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started to take off his dress shorts, revealing a massive bulge beneath his tight under armor compression shorts. He turned a little giving Josh a view of his fantastic bubble butt, huge enough to squash a whole ride. Ricky pulls up the red boards shorts over his underwear and ties the knot on loosely. His ass was so massive it almost sticks out of the tight back of the shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I guess those are a little too small, I can get you a bigger size.\" Josh says, blushing at the man changing before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah its perfect, shows off my ass a little bit which is great. You know what I'm talking about, right boss?\" He says looking down at Josh and winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah sure thing.\" Josh says looking away while blushing even brighter. \"All that's left is the hat and you're all set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky grabs his clothes and puts the hat on his head. Looking down at Josh once more , \"I'm looking forward to working for you, boss.\"   He says, licking his lips and rubbing his toned stomach over his tank top. He winks once more before walking out the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally... Josh sighed in relief. He was a bit nervous about how Ricky looked at him before he left... he looked hungry. Maybe it wasn't a bluff earlier but he knew now that he had to stay on his toes around Ricky.  </span></div></div>",

Without hesitation he licked his thumb and chased tiny Josh with it, pressing him gingerly on to it. With his captive now on his thumb Ricky stood back up to his full height. Looking down at the tiny man struggle on his thumb he started to smile again as he brought him closer to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing?\" Josh thought as Ricky moved his huge thumb near his tongue. The enormous muscle lashed out like some sort of monster, licking the front of the giant man's thumb. Suddenly Josh knew what was going to happen and he tried his best to run from the gigantic thumb that was now perusing him. Finally, he fell to the floor and felt a sticky sensation all over the back of his body as well as a slight pressure of being pushed into the floor. Unhurt, but stuck he looked up at Ricky's handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still think I'm bluffing little guy?\" Ricky said slyly at his captured prey. \"Like I said I could squish or eat you if I felt like it. If you still think I'm bluffing, tell me would you rather be squished, or eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to choose how you think you can scare me! This is insane!\" Josh said suddenly welling with confidence again. \"Let me down now and I'll reconsider hiring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked down at the tiny man pathetically. \"Eaten it is.\" He says opening his mouth wide \"See that? That's where you're going, well technically...\" He gives his stomach a good smack, \"You'll end up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is either a really good bluff, or he's really going to eat me...\" Josh thought to himself as Ricky moved his thumb closer and closer to his gaping maw.       </span></div></div>",

The warm slippery muscles pushed him down while the sticky saliva he was covered in slowed his descent ever so slightly. Josh wiggled and tried as he might to make his way back up, but alas he was just too small. The sound of Ricky's heart beat was all he had on this terrifying descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all it took for Ricky to send the little guy down. Ricky put a hand on his throat trying to see if he could feel the little man struggle or fight. Once his hand migrated down to his chest he felt a small squirm, enough to make Ricky feel like he really ate something alive. Suddenly the squirming stopped. \"Must've dropped into my stomach. He sure went down easy!\" He thought smirking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the stomach little guy!

He's just too small.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving across the room he took his leave out the door. Still keeping his hand on his stomach he tried to see if he could feel the little man squirm at all in his stomach. After a few seconds he decided to give up and went on his way. Meanwhile, his stomach growled angrily at such a tiny snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right I skipped lunch... and that bastard showed up late!\" He gave his stomach a couple good pats. \"Serves you right! You get to be part of the lunch I missed thanks to you!\" Ricky's stomach growled once more. \"Better find some real food though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh dropped unceremoniously with a splat right into the very bottom of Ricky's stomach. \"This is insane! its so huge!

I can't die like some piece of food in this guy's stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELCOME TO THE STOMACH LITTLE GUY! HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR NEW HOME!\" Josh heard Ricky's voice, however muffled it was, it was still incredibly loud. \"That jackass... who welcome's someone to their stomach... either way I have to try to get him to throw me up.\" Josh though scrambling around trying to find the nearest wall of the enormous stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the stomach started to shift as the whole stomach moved around. Finally finding a wall Josh would feel the flesh moving back and fourth. \"He must be rubbing his stomach.\" Josh said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey let me out you asshole!\" Josh shouted while punching and kicking the wall as hard as he could. \"I've got to get him to throw up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRROOOOOOAAAN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the stomach shook violently as growled. \"Oh great he's hungry... and just after he ate too...\" Josh said sarcastically to himself. Suddenly Josh found himself flying across the gigantic stomach as if something smacked him across the room. After a few quakes the stomach died back down and Josh was able to stand once again. \"What the hell was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRROOOOOAAN<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little searching in the surrounding area around the park he settled on some fast food. A burger and some fries will do his hungry belly good. As he tore though his burger he tried to imagine the food piling up in his stomach hopefully smothering that tiny asshole. As he took a big chug of his soda he felt a bit of pressure coming from his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be good.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUUUURP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans back in his seat, rubbing his stomach proudly and thinking, \"Hope that was hell for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding his way back to a wall Josh tiredly continued his assault. \"He just... has to let me out...\" Josh kept telling himself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ricky's stomach swayed and churned, empty and hungry, as Ricky moved about. With a thud the whole room dropped a little. \"Is he sitting down?\" Josh wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly huge chunks of food started raining down on him. Hugging the wall as mounds of food fell into the middle Josh nearly avoided being crushed! \"Lot of good that'll do he's still going to digest me..\" Josh thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Ricky's stomach heard Josh's thoughts it began to churn and mix the contents of Ricky's stomach, letting out dangerous gastric acid. Scrambling to the mound of food Josh figured if anything he could stay alive longer on top of this mountain of food! Climbing up the side was a difficult feat, as it seemed to get even wetter in the stomach. Suddenly a flood of soda swept into the cavern with Josh barely holding onto the mushy pile of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was deafening and all the air rushed up and out of cavernous belly. \"This is how it ends...\" Josh said to himself as he started choking on the stale air of the stomach. Slowly Josh sunk down passing out, only to become part of some jock who thought he could bully his way into being hired.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The air was much chillier outside of the giant man's mouth and Josh started to shiver as he readjusted to the temperature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh cleared the strands of saliva off his face and looked up at his capture. Still smiling looking down at little man shaking violently in his palm in a pool of his own spit. Ricky extended a giant finger, gingerly rubbing some of the sip off his hand and around Josh. Slowly he then lifted Josh back to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Ricky opened his mouth again, \"Oh god no! Not again!\" Josh screamed expecting to be tossed back into the fleshy cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ricky simply blew on the tiny man, apparently just trying to dry him off. Although, he thought he was blowing gently it was like a small hurricane for Josh as he clung on to the skin on Ricky's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Ricky's deep blue eyes Josh whimpered, \"D-does this m-mean y-you're not gonna eat me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling Ricky responded... </span></div></div>",

What if he accidentally did swallow me!\" He thought to himself suddenly a little angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I have the job?\" Ricky asks suddenly with an optimistic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by the question Josh stopped to think how irrational the whole situation was. \"Well I hope you know that stunt you pulled didn't exactly impress me. What if you did actually eat me? Then the joke would have gone too far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually eat you?\" Ricky said casually opening back up his mouth and tilting his hand into his open mouth. \"That could be arranged. Maybe the joke hasn't gone far enough?\" Ricky taunted as Josh slowly started to slide back into the mouth he just narrowly escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Fine! You're hired! Let's just end this joke then shall we!\" Josh said panicked trying not to slip back into Ricky's maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" He said, moving his mouth away from his hand and lowering his new boss back down to the balcony. \"I guess I can let you down now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scurried quickly off the giant man's hand back to the safety of solid ground. Relieved to no longer be in the palm of that voracious blonde. Josh's peace was short lived when Ricky's voice boomed over him from behind. \"When do I start boss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified to delay having Ricky join the staff, Josh figured sooner was better than later. \"Tomorrow is fine, we just need to get you set up with a uniform.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great boss, you sure know how to make me happy!\" He said winking down at the flustered little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Josh replied nervously. \"Lets just go next door and grab that uniform.\" He said not wanting to spend too much time with the new recruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully someone will be there to take care of it for me...

There didn't seem to be anyone in the kitchen or lounge, running over to peek through a window it seemed no one was in the workout room either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" he thought. 'I'll have to pull one up on the computer for him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Ricky came walking through the door. He strolled casually over to the balcony, spotting Josh. \"Nobody's here boss.

Looking down at himself he ran his hands down his chest, then down his back, and finally rested them on his butt. \"Uhhh I'm like a large if you got any...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large it is.\" Josh said punching the code into the computer. Shortly after that a fresh uniform was whisked over on a rack. Nothing special just red board shorts, with a cross on them. A white tank top with the word \"Lifeguard\" across the chest. And finally a red hat. \"All right all set!\" Josh added, eager to get Ricky to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait boss lemme try it on first!\" Ricky said, eyeing the little man intently. Stopped in his tracks Josh realized he had to wait. Ricky nodded at his new little boss and unbuttoned his shirt. Deliberately taking his sweet time to reveal a white tank top he was wearing underneath. Ricky removed the sweaty top and laid it down next to Josh, letting the smell of his sweat waft over the little man. Meanwhile Josh was transfixed with the sight before him. Ricky's chest was mountainous to him. His pecs bounced softly as he leaned over to pick up his uniform top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pulled the tank top over his chest and rolled it slowly down over his chiseled abs. Smirking at his tiny boss the whole time. \"Why is he looking at me like that?\" Josh thought, blushing ever so slightly. \"How's it fit?\" Josh asked blankly at the adonis before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fits great boss, probably won't wear it too much. Part of being a lifeguard is showing off, am I right?\" He said in a cocky tone as he peeled off the tank top revealing his magnificent torso once more. Josh's eyes widened at the giant man before him then started stripping off his black dress shorts. Pulling them down leaving him in just his spandex underwear. Ricky's bulge was only a few feet from Josh, however just by the sheer size of it it seemed like some massive monster in the distance. Ricky turned leaning over to pick up the board shorts, deliberately sticking his ass out to show for Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god.\" Josh thought. \"That's big enough to flatten a ride easily...\" Josh fantasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the show he was giving his tiny boss he pulled the shorts up over his spandex. The snug fit made his butt seem even more incredible. \"Nice fit boss, shows off my ass pretty well, don't you think?\" He said turning more and moving in closer to the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks great.\" Josh answered honestly. Ricky turned back and looked at the little man and smirked once more. \"Well all that's left is the hat and you're good to go!\" Josh said hoping to get rid of him this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky grabbed the hat, putting it on sideways looked at his boss. \"Think I look cool?\" The shirtless hunk asked the retreating little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty awesome, Ricky.\" Josh answered hoping to finally be on his good side. \"And with that, I'll see you tomorrow!\" Josh added desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave Josh walked toward the door back to the water park. </span></div></div>",

I know it must've been kinda scary, but you were very brave and that impressed me, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the giant man Josh smiled and took a step forward. \"I appreciate it Ricky, and its not actually the first time I've been threatened like that.

Obviously, that's the first time I've ever had a little person in my mouth. I felt so powerful to be that in control over another human being's fate.

Josh looked over the side of the massive hand and saw his options were to either obey, or drop to his death. Reluctantly he decided to follow the stud's orders and he dropped down into the massive fabric enclosure. Josh slide down the the comfy material until he reached the bottom, looking up he saw light start to fade and Ricky released the opening of the pocket, letting it press firmly against his well trained pecs once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky gave the pocket a little pat. Satisfied with the torture he was inflicting on the tiny man so far he turned to leave the room. Grabbing the handle to the door he pushed it open and smiled as the bright sunlight greeted him on his way out. Starting to walk away from the building, suddenly someone stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude!\" Called the voice as Ricky watched a huge shirtless man come running over to him. He seemed slightly bigger than Ricky but that being said he had no idea who he was. \"Maybe one of the lifeguards.\" He thought to himself as he put on a fake smile. \"Hey what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just got interviewed right? Just wanted to meet the new guy before anybody else!\" Said the burly stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky rubbed the back of his neck and tried to come up with a lie. \"Oh well I don't know if I got the job or not actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dude, Josh is a good guy. He wouldn't turn someone away without a good reason.\" The man said confidently. \"Look, I'm head lifeguard after all. If he had any doubts I'll put in a good word for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked at the man surprised. Why would he go out of his way like that for someone he's never met? Not to mention he spoke so highly about his boss... either way, he wasn't about to reveal what was hiding in his pocket. \"Thanks dude, that's pretty cool of you.\" He said finally to break the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky waved good bye to the friendly man as he went along his way, making sure to stop at a restaurant on his way home to get his fill of food finally. Satisfied, he made his way home and unlocked the door. Walking over to his kitchen table the handsome man started to think about what he was doing with his tiny captive. Slowly he reached down into the pocket, barely feeling the little man he plucked him out and set him on the table. Finally seeing the light of day once more Josh was was excited to be free of the prison, yet equally terrified of what Ricky had in store for him next.

Even with that dark looking smile, Ricky was still incredibly handsome, but at this point he was too disgusted with how he's been treated to dignify Ricky with a response. Ricky simply laughed at the tiny man's defiance. Knowing he was in total control no matter what Josh did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met one of your workers. Some guy who called himself the head lifeguard?\" Ricky said trying to draw Josh's attention. Turning to face Ricky, Josh started to grow concerned over what happened with Tyler. \"He seemed to think very highly of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my employees do, as do I think highly of them! We all care about each other and if they found out what you did...\" Josh said as he was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't care.\" Ricky stated blankly. \"They won't find out, especially not after they think you hired me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there dumbfounded. He couldn't begin to imagine what Ricky hoped to gain from all this! \"I'll just tell them you're lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky shook his head and sighed. \"You think I'm dumb? I'm not going to just let you go when I go back. No, you're gonna have a front row seat of all the action, little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll know something's up, I never hire someone and not tell anyone about it!\" Josh scoffed at Ricky angrily as the giant man swung around to a seat at his kitchen table and plopped his massive form down in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? I heard you're a good guy who doesn't turn someone away with out a good reason. That dope head lifeguard even said he'd put in a good word for me. I'll just tell them you called me later and that I had the job, but you were feeling sick and decided to stay home.\" Ricky said leaning back in his seat with an arrogant smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was furious, Tyler was he best friend after all and he really didn't appreciate this jerk talking down about him like this. \"You can insult me all you want, but Tyler will figure it out. He knows my protocol, he'll know you're lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler huh? Your dumb big oaf has a name? Whatever, he didn't seem too bright. I'm not worried.\" Ricky said as he stretched his body and yawned. Ricky unbuttoned his shirt revealing a tight looking white tank top underneath. His strong abs ad massive chest showed through the white shirt with ease as he stood up and tossed the shirt aside. Walking into his kitchen, he disappeared for a second while he rummaged through a cabinet and returned with a tall glass. Josh tried to scramble away as Ricky came over and quickly plucked him up and dropped his down into the container. Leaving once more, Ricky eventually returned from the kitchen holding a small pink piece of something, which he dropped into the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's watermelon.\" Ricky said as he looked down at the pathetic little man. \"Gotta have you aware for what goes on tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ricky left the room and shut off the light. Josh shivered in anger and fear as he looked over at the piece of watermelon. Sighing, he knew he needed something to eat, and the juice from the fruit would also be enough to keep him hydrated. Finishing his fill, Josh tried to make himself comfortable on the hard glass floor as eventually he drifted uneasily off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM BOOM BOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh jerked awake as the sudden rumbles came crashing through the room. Josh looked through the glass, reminded of his dire circumstances. Ricky came pounding his way over to the cup, and Josh could barely make out what the man was wearing. It looked like he had on some sort of black tank top, coupled with blue athletic shorts with a black strip on them. Looking up Josh saw Ricking looking into the cup. He was wearing sunglasses, hiding his dangerous blue eyes as he smirked in approval to Josh's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, runt.\" Ricky announced as he tipped the glass over, causing Josh to tumble off his tired feet and scream. Tipping the glass even more, Ricky watched as Josh rolled right to the edge. Quickly out of his pocket, Rick located an empty tic-tac container and poured the tiny man inside. Raising the container to his handsome face, Josh looked on in horror as he held his hands against the plastic of his new prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want you to try and pull a stunt and escape, now would I?\" Ricky laughed as he moved the container back to his pocket, shrouding Josh in darkness. Josh couldn't believe how well thought out Ricky's plan was. With the top of the container sealed, there was nothing Josh could do but sit in the dark and listen to his smug voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ricky ran a hand through his blonde hair. He was ready to work his magic on those fools at the park and put the tiny man in his pocket though hell. Turning and closing his door, he started his walk to the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching Shrink and Swim, Ricky already knew the two back doors. One was an interview room, the other was a break room. Walking toward the break room, Ricky confidently opened the door. Looking around it was mostly empty, that of course except for one other man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as planned.\" Ricky thought to himself as he spotted that dumb oaf from before, Tyler. Ricky smiled fakely as Tyler waved at him, recognizing him from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude! Ricky right?\" Tyler asked enthusiastically as Ricky walked forward to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're Tyler right?\" Ricky said smugly, happy that Josh accidentally gave away the man's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, judging by the fact that you're here today you must have gotten hired! I didn't even have to talk to the boss. Although I'm not sure where he went yesterday..\" He said looking down at the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me he wasn't feeling well in the interview. Also last night when he called me he did mention it again. Maybe he stayed home sick?\" Ricky said hiding a devious grin behind his thoughtful sounding words. Tyler rubbed his head. It wasn't normal for Josh to miss work because of being sick. Even still it was weirder he wouldn't call him and let him know. Shaking the thought, Tyler figured it was best to get Ricky situated first. Walking over to a computer panel, Tyler fumbled the commands a little as he entered Ricky into the system and had a uniform transported into the room. Handing it to the man with a smile Tyler turned as Ricky changed in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Ricky tried to take the tic-tac container out of his old pocket and move it to the back pocket of his new board shorts. Moving his hand swiftly, Ricky looked up as Tyler turned to him again. Ricky, stood up straight and patted the container as he felt it settle down beside his ass as Tyler looked at him...             </span></div></div>",

Gotta have fresh breath if I'm gonna save someone's life.\"  He flashed a smile as he tried to read Tyler's expression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I ask you for one?\"  Tyler asked.  \"I used up the last of my toothpaste last night and well... you probably don't want to endure my morning breath, especially since I'll be the one training you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washed over Ricky, relief that quickly gave way to an evil joy.  A wonderfully torturous way of disposing of his captive just presented itself to him.  While he had planned on dragging things out, this was just too perfect.  \"Yeah sure.\"  He pulled out the container and popped the top before handing it over.  \"Looks like it's my last one so you had better make it last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one?  Oh, well I don't want to take-\" Tyler starts to say before Ricky cuts him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it's no trouble.  I insist.  Here.\"  He starts shaking the nearly empty box over the now open palm or his unwitting accomplice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler relents, \"Well if you insist.  Honestly I probably need a few to tame this funk but it will have to do.\"  Ricky could barely contain his wicked delight as he saw the tiny man tumble out.  A second later and the hand holding him tossed him into the maw of his trusted coworker.  Tyler licked the 'mint' around but didn't recognize the taste.  \"Hey what flavor is this?  It tastes kinda... bland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky realized that he hadn't thought this through and racked his brain to make up an excuse.  \"Well... it's actually actually a foreign brand of mint.  I just use the tic-tac box because it's convenient.  It's... got a very mild taste and takes a loooong time to dissolve, fizzes a bit too.  You feel it, like it's moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pokes Josh into in cheek, \"Yeah... I do feel it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly crap he was falling for it.  Time to seal the deal.  \"Yeah they're a bit of an acquired taste these guys, I get them from a friend who travels.  Just suck on 'em for as long as you want and then swallow 'em down.  Oh, and don't take them out.  I don't know what it is but they stain fingers like nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... well thanks for the new experience then man,\" Tyler smiles having fallen for the crazy story.  \"Anyway, now that you are changed we can move on to the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could do nothing but listen as his captor tried to pawn him off as a breath-mint.  Being inside a mouth was terrifying and disgusting enough without having to worry about the smell.  There was no escape from the container though, at least until it turned upside-down.  The seismic shaking and smoothness of the plastic walls made it impossible to prevent the short fall onto Tyler's palm.  Disoriented, Josh called out, \"Tyler!  It's me!  Don't eat me!\"  His cries would go unheard as the floor went sideways and he tumbled into the dark mouth.  Josh screamed as flew through the hot, thick air.  He landed with a *splat* and an \"Oof\" in the middle of the sticky tongue.  The stench hit him like a punch in the gut.  It burned his throat, brought tears to his eyes, and made him heave.  Tyler was right, he certainly needed more than a mint to cover this nastiness up and unfortunately, all he was getting was his tiny boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue sprang to life and began tasting Josh, probing and sliding the slick, scum-covered buds against him.  Gooey saliva oozed from it and everywhere else to ensure that Josh felt violated.  Tyler's voice boomed around him as he spoke to Ricky, far too loud for Josh to make out and presented Josh with another dilemma, should he hold his nose or his ears.  Tossed in every direction, Josh smacked against hard teeth, spongy flesh and globs of spit.  The smell of his subordinate's horrible  breath made Josh wish that he would just pass out.  He tried to cry out for help, but he simply could not fill his lungs with the toxic air.  The weak shouts he could muster were drowned out but the wet smacking of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes had passed and the tour was going fine.  Ricky seemed eager and quick to pick up on things.  The only thing wrong was this this mint didn't seem to be helping.  Tyler's mouth still felt nasty and he noticed Ricky wince a few times when he got close.  Tyler excuses himself to the bathroom, hoping to find something else to deal with the problem.  Tyler worked the ineffective mint to the middle of his tongue and...</span></div></div>",

Ricky just must have been wrong about how effective these mints were. No matter how he shoved the thing around in his mouth, rolling it across his tongue every possible way, his breath just didn't seem to improve. But he wasn't about to just waste it. All things considered, he was starting to enjoy the taste a little. Besides, mints were food, like anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt Tyler's tongue shift for the millionth time, but he could immediately tell that it was for a much more sinister purpose. The broad, pink carpet rolled out beneath him, pushing him to the center. Tastebuds crashed across his face as he was forced downward. He couldn't see a thing, but he could immediately tell that he was further back on Tyler's tongue than ever before. \"No... no no nonononono!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed and tried to force himself to his feet as realization dawned. His body was soaked in Tyler's drool. It was nearly impossible to get to his feet on the already slippery surface. He pushed and scrambled, trying to grab anything that he could. But in the end, it was hopeless. He hardly had two seconds before Tyler's tongue reared up. It forced him backward, slamming his tiny form against the back of Tyler's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMashed between two muscles, one smooth and one rough, Josh knew he was screwed. In the moment before Tyler swallowed, he found himself hoping for a miracle. </span></div></div>",

Ricky gave off an unassuming smile as he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man. where do we start with this training?\" Ricky asked politely as he took his hand off his ass, moving back in front of his body along his torso. Tyler looked down at the floor, however at Ricky's discarded clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can hook you up with a locker you know. We got a pretty sweet gym here too, dude.\" Tyler said as he bent over to Pick up Ricky's clothes. Ricky simply smirked as the dumb oaf collected his clothes for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thanks dude!\" Ricky said almost condescendingly. \"You didn't have to grab my stuff for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply smiled, being the nice guy that he was as he had Ricky follow him through a doorway leading to the break room's personal gym. The pair walked past a couple of machines and weights as they got to the back of the room. There around a wall was a small locker room. Tyler looked around for a locker without a lock, opened it up and stored Ricky's clothes carefully inside. \"There! Locker 6! All your's dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky smiled fakely as he thanked Tyler once more, and the two left the locker room, back into the break room. Tyler stopped, putting a hand on his chin in thought for a second. Ricky hesitated, hoping the moron didn't realize something somehow. \"Ok, dude. So from what I heard you are CPR certified and you've worked at a water park before. So you don't really need training, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky sighed in relief, glad that's all the huge man had on his mind. \"Yeah for sure. I know all the basics. All you really need to do is show me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head as he headed for the door to go back outside. \"Alright, dude.

I forgot something I want to throw in my locker.\" Ricky said as he turned away from Tyler to make his way back into the locker room. Out of sight, and out of ear shot, Ricky pulled out his tiny captive as he made his way to his locker. Looking down at the little man in the tic tac box, Ricky smirked as he saw the pathetically small man pound on the walls of his plastic prison. Ricky simply chuckled as he lowered the case down into his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dumbass friend was retarded enough to give me this locker.\" Ricky mocked as he leaned over to look at Josh with his dangerous blue eyes with a lift of his sunglasses. \"Who knows, maybe next thing you know he'll forget about you and be my friend instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky laughed as he watched the little man fume angrily beyond the plastic walls. His pathetic voice was way to small to pierce the walls, as Ricky figured would be the case. Closing the locker, Ricky shook his head and smiled in amusement. He couldn't believe how easy this was after all. Looking around he found a little lock and key, laying on a nearby desk. Grabbing the lock, Ricky secured it to his locker, just in case any of the other morons around here got curious and snooped in his stuff. Dropping the key in a zipper pocket, Ricky patted it quickly as he made his way out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down in the darkness. Practically in tears, both from fear and anger, he couldn't help but pound his fist to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... why the hell did I do that.\" Josh cried as he shook his hand side to side. Sighing in angst, Josh couldn't help but stare down at the floor and feel hopeless. Maybe Ricky really had won after all. Tears ran down his cheeks finally as he thought about the terrible things he was saying about Tyler behind his back, only to go approach the man like dear friend. He couldn't help but feel disgusted, not only with Ricky, but in himself for allowing his to go about deceiving his friends here at the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at the top of the container he was help prisoner in, Josh wished there was some way he could escape and tell someone, anyone, about Ricky's scheme. Pulling his legs up against his chest and resting his chin, Josh couldn't help but feel his situation was totally hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they are too dumb to figure it out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, Ricky and Tyler had made their way around the park. The faker of a man even managed to meet every other lifeguard in the park, sucking up to each one as he made his way around with Tyler. Smirking to himself, he couldn't help but feel like his infiltration has been a total success thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Rickster!\" Tyler called at the blonde man as he looked like he was spaced out. Ricky quickly shook off his scheme to reply happily with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up Ty? What we doing next?\" He asked, trying to sound enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dude, it's lunchtime.\" Tyler said blinking a little confused. Putting a hand on his stomach Tyler felt the need to accentuate his point. \"I'm starved dude. Come on a few of the guys wanna split a pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, man!\" Ricky said with his fake smile. All the while thinking to himself this might be the perfect opportunity to show that pathetic speck just how reliable his staff is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way out of the park Ricky and Tyler joked back and fourth with each other as they made their way around the back of the building, going to the break room. Pushing the door open like he owned the place Ricky looked out into the room as the decadent aroma of pizza filled his nostrils. Two men sat down at the kitchen table, and the pair stood up to greet Ricky and Tyler as they made their way in.

He was the same height as Ricky and seemed quiet a bit leaner. His blonde hair was a bit shorter than his own and he even had similar striking blue eyes. He wore a shark tooth's necklace which rested perfectly between his pecs as well. Putting out his hand he, shook Matt's, quickly comparing his bicep to Matt's as he did. Backing away, he smirked as he realized he was definitely built a bit stronger than the leaner surfer dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! We got the pizza! Luke and and I are starved!\" Matt cried enthusiastically as he put his hands on his stomach, as Luke came forward putting his arm around Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky smirked as he looked at Luke. He was slightly shorter than him, by maybe an inch. But Ricky felt a little leery about him none the less. He was built like a tank. His muscles looked much more thickly than his or Matt's and easily would give even Tyler a run for his money. The buzzed blonde green eyed stud seemed like he could easily suplex him or Matt if he felt like it. His saving grace though, which Ricky realized all too quickly, was that he's dumb as bricks and easily the goofiest guy at the park. Ricky looked as Luke turned a little, showing his back, which reminded him that Luke had a tattoo of a bird on his back, between his shoulders. Either way, Ricky continued to smirk, knowing this clown couldn't possibly ruin any of his plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with Matt on this! Ricky, my man! Let's eat!\" Luke yelled as he drug Matt off back to the kitchen table to lay out some plates and grab a few drinks. Ricky turned and looked at Tyler, who simply smiled as he walked past him to go to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there, dudes! Just have to grab something!\" Ricky called out as Luke jumped up and down impatiently. Excusing himself, Ricky turned to go into the gym and toward his locker. He couldn't help but chuckle to himself. \"This is gonna be too easy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrogantly strolling toward the locker room, Ricky quickly fished into his pocket to pull out the key to unlock his locker. Undoing the lock and opening the door, he looked down at the pale disgruntled speck he held captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That room is just full of morons. Between that clown, Luke, that wimp, Matt, and your stupid oaf, you're as good as a pizza topping my little runt.\" Rick taunted as Josh stood up in his prison, attempting to scream as loud as he could to stop insulting his friends. Putting a finger in his ear and moving it around Ricky leaned forward. \"Sorry runt, your voice is just too wimpy and pathetic.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing some more as he watched the minuscule man huff and stamp his feet he figured it was about time he drafted his plan. Putting his hand on his chin he tried to weigh his options. He could just take the little runt out now and drop him smack dab in the middle of the pizza when he gets back. On the other hand, Ricky thought, he could keep him in his little plastic prison and sit on it while he prolonged the man's suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down to the tic tac container, Ricky made up his mind to...      </span></div></div>",

He heard a tiny voice start to rebel as he closed his hand into a fist, trapping little Josh inside. Dropping his fist to his side, Ricky put the tic tac container back in his locker and shut the door. Casually making his way out of the locker room, Ricky chuckled slightly to himself as he felt his tiny victim fight and thrash about in his closed hand. Bringing his fist up to his face he smirked as he whispered to the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't waste all that energy if I was you. Or you know, do. It'll make it all the easier for your friends to end you.\" Dropping his fist down, he felt the struggles cease. He smiled as he figured he must have sufficiently terrified the little man to the point where he froze up. Turning the corner Ricky reentered the break room only to be greeted by a loud strange noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGROOOOAAANNN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked over at the table, confused as he saw the three men sitting there with the food untouched. Luke clutched his stomach, rubbing it briefly as he turned a little red. \"Sorry that was me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky walked over to the table, pulling back a seat and looking at the men while he rested his fist on his lap. \"You guys waited for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke pipped up with a friendly smile as he stomach rumbled once again, albeit much less loudly. \"Much to my stomach's disagreement! But yeah of course dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to himself over how truly stupid all of them were, Ricky reached out with his fist, opening it over the middle of the pizza as he grabbed his slice. Looking at the pizza he could barely see the tiny man struggle as he fell helplessly into the sea of sticky yellow cheese. Satisfied that his work was done, Ricky took a bite of his pizza as he waited for hell to break loose for the puny speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling with tears in his eyes Josh tried desperately to free himself from the sticky cheese. He watched as one by one each of his friends reached in and grabbed slices of pizza. Somehow avoiding the first onslaught however, Josh couldn't help but think it was worse that his inevitable fate had to be put off. Waving his arms in every direction Josh hoped someone would spot him, if not someone would at least grab the slice of pizza he was on and end this whole horrible ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning as his body burnt in agony, Josh tried to fight the pain of the hot melty cheese as it cooked his skin. Trying to distract himself he looked out around. Luke was tearing through his slice of pizza without mercy. Josh watched in horror as the huge muscular stud swallowed huge pieces of his meal as he set it down to periodically take a large gulp from his cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUURRRAAPP!\" Luke bellowed intensely as he rubbed a hand on his solid 6 pack. Matt laughed at the obnoxious belch as he swallowed down a bite of his own pizza. Tyler leaned toward his friend, patting him on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You getting full already, buddy?\" Tyler asked raising an eyebrow as Luke started to dig back into his pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding!\" Luke spurted with a mouth full of food, while he chewed with his mouth open. He quickly swallowed the food as he finished, \" I was just making room, brah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stared up at the men as they joked and chewed their food rudely. Looking over at Ricky however, Josh saw the enormous man smirking evilly at him. Wincing in pain from the molten cheese, Josh started to tear up as Ricky addressed his friends. \"So fellas. I wanted to let you know I heard a few rumors about this place before I left the other water park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stopped chewing, immediately swallowing the rest of his pizza whole. Pounding his chest for a second, he took a deep drink of his soda to get the huge chunk to go down. \"Like what, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so get this.\" Ricky said moving in closer to try and draw everyone's attention. \"I heard the owner here has some crazy shrinking fetish. That's why he made the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped chewing for a second, swallowing his food as he started to clench a fist. Looking up however, his tension was quickly relieved by Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does seem to prefer being small all the time, but so what dude?\" Matt said taking a sip from his soda. Ricky quickly glared down at the tiny speck in the pizza before looking back up at the idiots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that's weird or suspicious at all?\" Ricky tried to plead with the men as he desperately wanted them to turn against their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure he's even mentioned to all of us at some point. Besides if that's his thing, that's his thing. Who are we to judge?\" Luke said professionally as he munched away at his crust before he moved on to another slice of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Ricky sneered at Josh's direction as he tried to concoct a new lie, trying to get any kind of disgust for these men to feel for Josh. \"I heard another rumor too. A rumor that the owner is gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke put down his crust and crossed his arms. \"Dude that's not cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky perked up, happy to see Luke was on his side. \"Yeah dude, not gonna lie I was feeling real uncomfortable in my interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude.\" Luke said looking at Ricky seriously. \"You're being uncool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt decided to chime in as well. \"Yeah seriously, dude. Even if it were true, who cares? Or did I forget we were living in the 50's or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed as he gave Matt a high five. Tyler simply smiled as he took another bite of his food, glad to see he didn't have to step in to defend Josh. Meanwhile Ricky sat there, dumb stuck as he stared at Josh's tiny form in the cheese, looking like it was dancing with glee. Fuming with rage, Ricky clenched his teeth as he decided to...        </span></div></div>",

Little fa--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky was cut off suddenly as Tyler shoved the table while he stood up suddenly to punch Ricky square in the jaw. Knocking the man to the floor in surprise, Tyler looked down at Ricky with fire in his eyes. \"Don't you fucking say another word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky sat up slightly, rubbing his jaw in surprise. Before he could even retaliate, he watched as Tyler walked over, looming over him while Luke and Matt sat off to the side, watching in a bit of fear. \"You never talk about my friend like that, got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started to back away using his hands as Tyler stomped his foot down, right in Ricky's chest. Stopping in his tracks, Ricky figured this situation was a bit far gone. \"Awww did I touch a nerve, Ty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck out.\" Tyler commanded as he took his foot off of Ricky, allowing the man to stand up. \"Get out. Grab your stuff and leave. You're fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky couldn't help but smirk as he rubbed his chest while he walked past Tyler. Laughing to himself since he was never really hired in the first place. \"Last I checked you aren't the boss.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take responsibility when I see him. Get out.\" Tyler commanded once more while he watched Ricky leave to the locker room to retrieve his belongings. Tyler sighed as Ricky left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew he was such an asshole?\" Tyler said, looking down in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Luke looked at each other, wondering if it was safe to respond. Luke, figuring it wasn't him Tyler was mad at, decided to speak up. \"Don't worry dude. We all thought he was cool at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over at the two with a half smile as they tried to smile back, trying to make him feel a little better. The moment was a bit short lived however, as Ricky reappeared at the doorway, changed back into his old clothes. Tyler glared at the man as he walked toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your pizza, retards.\" Ricky mocked harshly as he opened the door, disappearing to the other side without a word from anyone. Sighing once more, Tyler turned back to his chair and sat down with a loud flop. Resting his right arm on the back of the chair as he leaned back a little, Tyler looked down at the floor with a blank stare. Meanwhile, Luke and Matt inched their chairs back toward the table and set their plates back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, don't let him get to you.\" Luke said trying to get Tyler to get back to his normal self. Tyler simply took a sip from his drink, swallowing hard as he continued to stare at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine dude. Just lost my appetite is all.\" Tyler mumbled as his eyes wondered over at his unfinished pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool dude. At least sit with us and try to enjoy your break, man.\" Matt said with a friendly grin as he took a quick bite of his pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled as he looked at his two friends. \"Thanks dudes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh my head!\" Josh cried as he shook his head, wondering what the heck happened. His vision was still a little off, but the last thing he remembered the whole table shifted and he went flying off in some direction. Rubbing his eyes, Josh tried desperately to get his bearing before something bad could possibly happen. At the very least, Josh was glad to find the heat of the melty cheese was gone, however Josh now found himself...     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ricky looked at the men he met earlier as he recognized them both. First he looked over at Brody, the huge man easily towered over him by a few inches. He seemed like a really genuinely nice guy. He has short back hair and deep brown eyes. Ricky felt like the man could probably out muscle him if he wanted to as he looked up and down at his huge bouncing pecs and solid 6 pack complete with a black treasure tail leading down to his short. Around his enormous right bicep the hunk even had a tattoo of chain going around it. Shaking his hand as he came up, Brody greeted him with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the park, bro?\" Brody asked as Ricky simply nodded his head. That was another thing, Ricky remembered that this guy acted like a total bro the entire time he was talking to him earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Ricky looked over to see the other lifeguard, Brett, come over to say hi. Ricky couldn't really get a good read on Brett. He was only slightly taller than he was, and certainly a lot less thickly muscled than him. The thing that intimidated him about Brett though was his thin blue eyes, that looked as if they were judging every step he took. Not to mention his 8 pack, showing off the fact that he really worked hard on the definition of his long torso. Otherwise, the shaggy brown haired man seemed like a typical pretty boy, with a massive ego to match according to Tyler. Finally, Ricky peeked at Brett's left pec as he remembered the Japanese symbols he had tattooed on it. When asked, he was informed they stood for \"Courage\" and \"Strength\". Ricky swallowed as Brett stared at him with his sharp blue eyes as he extended out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick.\" He simply said as he shook the hand back with a nod. Sighing, he watched as Brett backed away, heading back over to the table. Ricky couldn't help but glare at the back of his head as he walked away. Turning back to Tyler and Brody, however Ricky smiled as he made his way to the door leading to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys I just gotta grab something real quick!\" He said as he slid through the door, dropping his smile to a frustrated frown as soon as he was out of sight. Gritting his teeth and tightening his fists, he couldn't help but feel an intense dislike for Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is wrong with that guy...\" He mumbled angrily as he made his way into the locker room. Pulling out his key from his pocket, Ricky popped open the lock and swung his locker open, revealing his still trapped little man. Seeing him curled up slightly, Ricky couldn't help but mock the tiny guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter little guy? Scared?\" He said in a baby voice as he looked at Josh's head perking up slightly. \"Too bad, runt. It's only gonna get worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky laughed as he grabbed the tic tac container and deposited it in his back pocket once more as he shut the door to the locker and made his way back out of the gym.  Walking back into the break room he smiled as he saw Tyler setting down some paper plates, and Brody grabbing some cups and soda. Sitting down at the table however he saw Brett, glaring at him. Dropping his smile to a straight face, Ricky started to sweat as Brett's eyes kept their unwavering attention on him as he made his way over to the table, sitting down beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you need to grab, Rick?\" Brett said coldly as he grabbed a bottle of soda, pouring himself a cup full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing important, man.\" He replied, not looking at Brett as he reached into the box of pizza to grab a slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Brett shot back with as much chill as before. Grabbing a slice of pizza for himself as Brody and Tyler pulled out pieces to put on their plates as well. Brett suddenly stood up with Tyler and Brody as the three turned their backs briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are those napkins, bro?\" Brody said, hunched over looking under the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started to sweat as he reached into his pocket quietly, pulling out the tic tac container and looking out at the three slices of pizza. Thinking for a second, he wasn't entirely sure if he wanted to to go with Tyler as his executioner after all. Brett was acting like such a smug asshole, it made Ricky's blood boil. Focusing again, Ricky decided to drop Josh on... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an arrogant smirk, Ricky decided he had enough of Brett's smugness. Whatever Brett's reason for disliking him, he didn't care as he tilted the tic tac container over Brett's pizza as he watched Josh's tiny body fall out directly into the sticky cheese. Looking up, Ricky saw the three men still had their backs turned. For good measure, Ricky chuckled to himself as he pressed Josh's flailing body down into the pizza, leaving a barely noticeable finger print. Retracting his hand just as Brett turned around, Ricky found himself being greeted with the same, disapproving gaze. Sitting back in his chair, Ricky simply put his hands behind his head, smiling as he flexed his arms slightly as he revealed his hairy arm pits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett simply sat down as Tyler came around the table, dropping off the pile of napkins the three men found. Tyler rubbed his hands together as he looked down at his pizza, grabbing it quickly by the crust and nearly shoving the entire piece into his mouth. After only a few chews Ricky watched astonished, as Tyler swallowed the huge bite down in one gulp. Blinking in amazement, he started to regret not putting his tortured victim on Tyler's piece as he looked over at Brett who barely bit into his pizza on his first bite. Sighing to himself, Ricky was a little disappointed. If Brett kept eating his pizza like that he'd take forever to carry out his nefarious plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRP!\" A tremendous belch erupted from the other side of the table. Ricky looked over as Brody was patting his stomach as he set down his cup of soda. \" 'Scuse me bros! That was as nasty one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett actually set down his pizza to laugh at Brody's reaction, the first time in fact he's shown any emotion since Ricky got here. Ricky, meanwhile took a bite from his own pizza. Closing his eyes now he felt dumb not to even have considered executing that little runt using Brody. Even he was eating his pizza with much more rush and hunger than Brett! Swallowing his food down, as he peeked over at Brett while he took another bite. Remembering where he pressed the pathetic little man in, Ricky started to get impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not hungry, Brett?\" Ricky asked politely as he watched Brett stare down intently at his pizza. Bret simply shot Ricky a quick glare as he set the slice down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno why, but I've felt sick to my stomach all day.\" Brett said as he squinted his eyes. \"Right about since this morning actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked away, down back at his own pizza. His mind started to race over what Brett could possibly mean by that. Looking up he looked at Brody as he picked a piece of crust out of his teeth before licking it back up and swallowing it down. Out of the corner of his eye he also saw Tyler, sitting there eating his food in an unusual silence. Starting to sweat, Ricky just took a big bite of his pizza and hoped the guys might just converse amongst each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled and squirmed as he tried to peek his head out somehow. The sticky and hot pizza burnt painfully on his skin and face as he tried desperately to free his head. Not daring to open his eyes until he did, Josh finally looked out to see none other than Brett holing onto the piece he was stuck to. His mouth still covered in cheese, Josh tried with all his might to scream something as he watched Brett's mouth close around right in front of him. Barely avoiding being take in the bite, Josh started to sob as he imagined it wouldn't be long before Brett took his next bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Brett slowly chew the mass of food in his mouth was like watching some sort of horror movie. Just tried not to imagine to hell that would be the inside of the sexy stud's mouth as the food is mushed to bits in seconds as Brett's saliva soaks the part of the meal before finally sending it down to his cavernous belly. Josh winced as Brett finally did in fact swallow. Opening his mouth once more Josh watched as he moved closer and closer to the dark cave that would surly engulf him. Out of the corner of his eye however, Josh caught a quick glace as he saw a faint smirk form on the face of Ricky as Brett's mouth finally closed down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bite of pizza was quickly detached from the main piece as it sat precariously in the middle of Brett's massive tongue. Josh tried to breath in through his nose, but the foul air was filled nothing but the scent of cheese and sauce as he almost coked on the thick air. Josh closed his eyes. Knowing there was no way out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched with baited breath as Brett sat there with the piece of pizza completely vanishing into his mouth. Biting his lip, Ricky watched as Brett...       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ricky watched as Brett held on for a second, before simply swallowing the small morsel of food. Sighing as he set his pizza back down, Brett casually put a hand on his stomach. Ricky smirked, realizing what just transpired was too good to be true. He was pretty sure Brett didn't even chew the piece, meaning he sent that tiny bastard down whole. Laughing to himself in his head, Ricky instantly got put in a good mood over the small ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, man?\" Ricky said showing fake concern for the stud he just unknowingly fed a tiny person. Brett simply turned his head, giving Ricky a disapproving look. Looking back forward once again, Ricky seemed disappointed by this whole mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude.\" Tyler finally chimed in as he looked at Brett. \"I don't get it. What's your deal with Ricky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett simply scoffed as he couldn't believe he was actually being questioned on why he does or doesn't immediately like someone. Brody looked at Brett with a frown as well however. \"Come on, bro. He's a nice guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked at Tyler and Brody, dumb struck that they suddenly came to his defense like this. Smiling, he knew exactly how to play out the situation. \"It's alright guys. He doesn't have to like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett looked down, sighing as he turned to look at Ricky for the first time without a glare. \"I'm sorry, man. I just had this weird feeling about you in the pit of my stomach. Maybe I have been a little too harsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just indigestion!\" Ricky said on purpose, but trying to make it sound like a joke. Brett chuckled as he put a hand back on his stomach once more. Ricky smirked as he suddenly had an amazing, and horrible plan. \"If your stomach is really bothering you, maybe you should take tums or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett took his hand off his ripped abdomen and looked over at Ricky with a friendly grin. \"You know, that's a great idea, Ricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky smiled innocently as he watched Brett stand up and walk his way over to the bathroom. A few seconds later, he saw the pretty boy return as he popped a few antacid chewables into his mouth. Ricky stood up as he grabbed an empty plastic cup and filled it with tap water. \"Here dude, drinking water will help too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the cup, Brett thanked Ricky for being so helpful as he swallowed down a gulp full of water. Brody and Tyler looked at each other with smiles on their faces, glad to see that Brett was finally calming down. Sitting back down, Brett and Ricky continued to chat with each other as Brett exclaimed that his stomach felt like it was settling down already. Ricky patted his new \"friend\" on the back, pretending like he was glad to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on up there!\" Josh yelled as he stared up into the deep darkness. Somehow the acids in the stomach managed to break him free from his cheesy prison, but it seemed like the caustic prison took a break for no apparent reason. Josh's nose twinged a little as an odd smell wafted about the already horrible smelling chamber. Mushing around in the mess of half digested food, Josh found the source of smell. Looking down at in the darkness he could barely make out a pinkish color as well as it having a somewhat chalky texture to it under a layer of slim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tums?\" Josh said to himself as he recognized the smell, as he needed to take the antacid occasionally himself for some less than agreeable foods. Josh looked around as his eyes finally started to adjust. The walls of Brett's stomach swayed and churned slowly and in eerie rhythmic patterns. Josh swallowed nervously as he realized it really was like the stomach was on break. With the medicine doing it's job, Josh figured the acid in Brett's stomach would be neutralized for at least a hour or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is a good thing. Maybe it gives them time to find me!\" Josh exclaimed as he started to move away from the chewed up pile of antacid. A noise suddenly erupted from above as Josh looked up excitedly, hoping maybe it was a sign he would be brought up any second. Instead, a torrent of water crashed down into Brett's massive belly. Josh struggled to find the surface of the water as he swam viciously in an upward direction. After a second however, the liquid managed to disperse fairly evenly across the expansive cavern. Taking a breath as he reached the surface, Josh choked for a second as the putrid stomach air filled his lungs. Frowning, Josh tried his best to locate some solid piece of land to take shelter on as he swam along listening to Brett's stomach sway and churn it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a half eaten piece of pizza, Josh climbed aboard what was left before the tums kicked in. Josh looked out across the water, almost like it was a lost lake inside a cave nobody's discovered. Closing his eyes, Josh listend to Brett's powerful heartbeat tick along as the pulses sounded so close, yet to him the heart might as well have been miles away from where he sat, wet and alone within Brett's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last slice, you sure you don't wanna eat Brett?\" Tyler asked as his hand hovered over the last greasy piece of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, go for it. I actually feel good right now, I don't want that greasy shit screwing up my stomach.\" Brett replied as he leaned back in his chair, rubbing his defined 8 pack happily. Tyler simply snagged the slice, nearly shoving the entire piece into his mouth at once. Ricky watched his as he devoured the pizza like some sort of animal. It was a little disappointing to him that he didn't get that little pest to meet his end inside that ravenous beast, however he couldn't help but smile evilly to himself as he thought how terrified the little man must be to be trapped helplessly in Brett's stomach as it refused to digest him for awhile. Rubbing his chin while he was deep in his imagination of Josh's horrors, he snapped back to reality as Tyler swallowed down the piece with a large gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUURRRRRRP!\" Ricky watched as the sound nearly exploded from Tyler's mouth. Tyler stood up and started pounded on his chest, seemingly getting pumped up. \"Aw yeah! Let's go! I'm ready to guard some lives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody got up and followed as he and Tyler stormed out of the room, apparently eager to get to work. Ricky looked over at Brett, who shook his head as the two ran off. \"Guess that means I'm cleaning up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched as Brett stood up and started to collect the paper plates. Smirking, Ricky decided to stand up and help, further cementing his charming innocence he was trying to impose on Brett. Brett grinned as he saw Ricky close the pizza box and bring it over to the garbage can. \"Thanks, man. Hey... again I'm really sorry I misjudged you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky chuckled to himself with malcontent as he turned back around to face Brett with a fake smile. \"Don't worry, dude. I'm just glad we're cool now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett half smiled as he finished piling up the trash before he tossed it all into the garbage. \"Well, you gonna run off with those two? They seemed pretty eager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky shrugged, not really sure what he should do now that his charade was pretty much over. \"Dunno man. What were you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett ran a hand through his hair, scratching his scalp a little as he thought. \"I didn't really eat, so I thought I'd do a bit of cardio in the gym for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky smiled, wondering how much hell that would put that pathetic loser in Brett's stomach. \"That sounds good, man. Maybe I'll run with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett chuckled as he turned to go into the gym. \"Just don't get a cramp, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky rolled his eyes as Brett turned the corner and was out of site, mouthing the words \"Just don't get a cramp, dude\" in a mocking fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh lifted his head as Brett's stomach started to rock back and fourth. Holding on to his life raft of sorts, Josh realized Brett must be walking. Without warning, Brett's stomach started to bounce up and down violently as he moved in a back and fourth motion. Josh screamed in terror as he was easily flung off the piece of pizza he was feebly trying to take refuge on. The contents of Brett's stomach bounced in a flurry as everything started to mix and move in every which direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tumbled in dizziness as Brett's stomach swirled him around for what seemed like an eternity. Bumping around and sliding on slick mucusy walls, Josh couldn't even tell which way was up and which way was down anymore. Constantly fading between unconsciousness and consciousness, Josh got no rest as he was sudden jerked around in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything stopped and settled. Josh's head spun like he had been trapped on some amusement park ride for who knows long. Vomiting with pure agony from his stomach, Josh simply kept his eyes closed while he hoped the world would stop spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a clue how much time had passed, Josh tried to rest his head on the squishy floor of Brett's stomach. Unaware that tums had finished it's course by now. Fresh stomach acid started to well up and leak from the walls of Brett's stomach as the foul smelling liquid started to seep across Brett's belly. Feeling a twinge of pain on his face, Josh stumbled and fell gradually feeling his skin start to melt and peel as he writhed in agony. His time was finally up, and Brett's stomach was ready to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good run dude.\" Brett said wiping away some sweat from his face. Ricky simply smirked as he looked at Brett's impressive abs, knowing by now the little man must be delirious from Brett's run. Rubbing some sweat off his chest, Ricky smiled as he looked at Brett's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your stomach, dude?\" He asked, all too knowing of Josh's peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, man. You were a big help.\" Brett said with a grin as he rubbed his hand up and down his long abdomen. Ricky smiled ruthlessly as his plan worked out perfectly in the end.               </span></div></div>",

Making his way into the locker room, Brett stopped in front of his locker and opened the door. Opening up his mouth, Brett carefully removed the piece of pizza from off his tongue and set the wet and slimy morsel on the floor of his locker. Looking down in the cheese, he gingerly brushed his finger, moving aside some of the sticky cheese. Smirking, he watched as a tiny speck emerged from the cooling cheese, slowly unsticking himself as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brett... how?\" Josh whimpered, tears in his eyes as he looked at Brett's handsome face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the locker room this morning. Right on the other side of the wall from him. I heard what he said to you, boss.\" Brett replied, looking very proud of himself. \"He locked his locker though, so I had to improvise. Brody's known since this morning too. Him and I planned the lunch to lure him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wiped away his tears, as he couldn't believe someone really was looking out for him this whole time. \"What about Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shook his head, biting his lip. \"He had no idea, dude. We told him when Ricky wandered off to get you just a few minutes ago. Brod and I had to convince him not to tackle the smug bastard when he came back in. We didn't want to risk hurting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled. It was the first time he actually felt safe and secure in the past day and a half. \"I was so scared, Brett...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett leaned down a little closer, and smiled genuinely at his tiny boss. \"You can tell us all about it, right after we get back at this piece of shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head, Josh was curious what Brett was talking about. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up and crossing his arms, Brett set a cocky looking smirk on his face. \"I was going to lead him to the break room while we're both still small. That's when Brody was gonna snatch the bastard. After I make my way back around we'll make him pay for what he did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down. He couldn't believe Brett and Brody would go through so much planning not only to save his life, but punish the one who did this to him. \"Make him pay how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett put a hand on his chin, narrowing his deep blue eyes in thought. \"Well his plan was to feed you to one of us. Maybe we should do to him what he was planning on putting you through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh twiddled his thumbs. Ricky was clearly not a good person. He kidnapped him and treated him like dirt. Josh bit his lip, wondering to himself if he should put the man through the same. Josh sat there for a second wondering, does Ricky really deserve a taste of his own medicine?      </span></div></div>",

Brett leaned forward and raised an eyebrow, unsure if he heard Josh correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Well we could think of a different way to do him in.\" Brett smirked as he bent down in to talk to Josh a little closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, feeling like a bad person just thinking about it. \"No, Brett. I mean in general. He's a human being too after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett's smirk turned into more of a frown as he heard the distressed tiny man's words. \"You didn't develop Stockholm's syndrome or something, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was barely even around him!\" Josh shot back, feeling a little insulted. \"I'd feel the same no matter who he was. A person is a person. We can't just get rid of him because we don't like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, boss! He tried to feed you to me!\" Brett pleaded, pointing at himself for the added effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. We aren't hurting him.\" Josh said, putting his tiny foot down finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smiled as he looked down at the floor laughing. Josh grinned as the man's pearly whites showed while he laughed. \"Alright. You're too nice, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head while he watched Brett stand back up to his full height and straighten his back as Josh spoke back, \"It's the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett nodded as he turned away from Josh, leaving the door to his locker open. \"I'll have Brody or Tyler come get you in a minute. I wanna make sure this lucky bastard is out of the building and at least 100 feet away before we take you back out to the break room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down, nodding in agreement. Even if Ricky was being let go, Josh was glad that Brett would show such caution just in case. Seeing Brett turn the corner and out of view, Josh leaned back on the floor of the locker. Smiling, he truly felt like it was the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett made his way out of the gym, turning the corner back into the break room. Looking over at Brody and Tyler, the two quickly shot him a look as Ricky sat there with a confused expression on his face. Brett moved himself in front of the exit, blocking it for the time being as he leaned up against the door. Looking over at the men sitting at the table, Brett finally spoke...  </span></div></div>",

Pinning him with both hands, Tyler used all of his strength to hold him place in time for Brody to come around the table and help hold him down. With Brody holding down Ricky's hands, Tyler punched Ricky right in his smug cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking piece of shit!\" Tyler yelled as he spat strands of saliva into Ricky's face while he screamed. Ricky simply started to laugh as he looked at at Tyler's face, which was red in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boo hoo! Did you morons finally figure it out?\" Ricky sneered with an evil smirk. \"Your little friend is probably already dead by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler punched Ricky in the face a second time, screaming at the man in frustration. \"Where is he you worthless asshole!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky simply smiled as he spat right up in Tyler's face. Tyler didn't bother wiping his face as he dropped his hand down around Ricky's throat and started to choke the man in pure rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down dude, he's fine. I watched him put Josh in my pizza out of the corner of my eye.\" Brett said calmly as he walked forward to get a better view of the carnage by the table. Ricky simply blinked, looking confused as Tyler moved his hand off his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How?\" Ricky asked genuinely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smirked as he looked down at the pathetic man as he laid there pinned beneath Tyler and Brody. \"I've been on to you all day. I just kept my eyes on you till you fucked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky gritted his teeth. There was no way this could be happening to him! He worked out this entire plan flawlessly, how could these idiots figure this out? Relaxing his body for a second, he realized there was no point in struggling at the moment. Brody shook his head as he continued to hold down Ricky's arms, feeling them relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this, bro?\" Brody asked, as hoped maybe Ricky wasn't such a bad guy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky simply scoffed as he turned his head away from Brody. \"Because I hate weak, pathetic, useless...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off by Tyler as he punched him in the face for a third time. Spitting up a bit of blood on the floor, Ricky finished, \"...bitches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shook his head a second time, frowning. Looking up at Brett, he was curious what was next. \"What are we doing with him, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett simply shrugged as he watched Ricky bleed a little more from his mouth. \"Josh wanted to let him go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, Tyler, Brody and even Ricky exclaimed the same response, \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked down at Ricky as he was just as surprised as he was. \"Then why did we tackle him, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled evilly as a bead of sweat ran down his face, landing directly on Ricky's cheek below. \"Because we aren't letting him go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\" Brett said matter-of-factly as he walked around the room until he found some spare rope that was normally used to help pull people out of the water. Carrying the rope over, Brett had Brody and Tyler sit Ricky up and he went behind him, tying his hands firmly behind his back. Taking a little extra rope, he also made a quick couple loops around his torso, binding his arms firm to his body. Taking the excess, he tied it in the loop he had in the front, creating a makeshift leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up.\" Brett commanded as Ricky fumbled to his feet. Tyler grabbed the man by his arm however, forcing him up faster, roughly. Ricky leered angrily at the three men, still in disbelief he was somehow caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boss is weak. He really wanted to let me go? What a joke. You lackeys can't even follow orders right though. I'm sure that'll make him all upset.\" Ricky mocked in a condescending tone. Tyler's fist shook as he couldn't help but punch Ricky as hard as he could in the gut. Ricky fell back slightly, landing on his knees coughing up a little more blood. \"He might even wag his finger at you guys in disappointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kicked Ricky in the chest, causing the man to collapse back down on the floor. Coughing and wheezing with his face on the floor, Ricky couldn't help but smirk that he could get one last rise out of these idiots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez man.\" Brett said shaking his head. \"You're gonna kill him before we even have any fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having fun.\" Ricky spurted, in sarcasm from the floor as Tyler's fists started to shake again in anger. Brody grabbed Tyler on the shoulder, trying to calm him a little. Relaxing his fists, Tyler tried to just ignore the trash that laid on the floor next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.\" Brett continued as he pulled a sock out of his pocket. \"Let's gag him and lock him in the bathroom so we can get Josh out of here. I wanna get him home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward, Brett took the sock and forced it into Ricky's mouth. Gagging on the foul piece of clothing, Brett couldn't help but smirk at their pathetic prisoner. \"Like it? It's one of mine, just for you. Rickster.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men drug Ricky into the bathroom and Brett reached up into the cabinet, locating a roll of medical tape. Pulling off a couple of strips, he quickly pressed them over Ricky's lips. Filing out of the bathroom, Tyler was last to leave as he kicked Ricky in the abdomen once more. Satisfied with the painful groan it produced, he turned and shut the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so.\" Brett said looking at Tyler and Brody, ready to explain his plan. \"We'll bring Josh in here and I'll tell him I'll meet him back in the park. I'll explain the situation to one of the guys and have him bring Josh home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want us to do, bro?\" Brody asked as he peeked over at the door to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guard the door. Wait for me to come back, I'll bring a sack or something to toss that bastard in. Then we'll bring him around and shrink him. One of us will stay here and retrieve him after the other two bring him around.\" Brett said, making the plan sound very simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Brody nodded as they started to pick up some of the mess they caused in the tussle earlier. Brett meanwhile, left the room and turned the corner to renter the gym. Making his way back over to the lockers, he saw his locker was still open. Smiling as he approached his tiny boss, he saw as the little man got up to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go home, boss?\" Brett said with a happy grin as he reached down, allowing Josh to get into his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure!\" Josh pipped back. \"I thought Tyler or Brody were going to come get me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smiled, glad that was the only thing that Josh was worried about. \"What? Sick of my beautiful face already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scratched his cheek as he almost blushed while looking up at the handsome giant. \"What? No of course not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smirked as he was glad he put his little boss at ease. Closing the door to his locker, Brett left the room and made his way back into the break room. Josh looked out as they entered the room, seeing Tyler and Brody both standing by the bathroom door. Josh smiled widely as he saw Tyler, glad to see his best friend again for real after his traumatic experience. Tyler almost leapt forward as he was stopped mid-action by Brett's hand on his chest. Brett simply smiled as he walked past Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, the three of us are gonna visit you later once you've gotten some rest.\" Brett said, looking at Josh, but mostly directing the words at Tyler. Tyler stopped as he went back to standing by the door as he watched Brett leave Josh on the balcony leading back to the park. \"I'll meet you around front, ok boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded to the shaggy haired stud as he turned around, ready to go into the park, and ready to go home. As Brett walked past Tyler and Brody, he nodded to the men as he made his way out of the break room and into the park as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett waved good bye to Josh as he and Ross stepped through the shrink ray to leave the park. Smiling, Brett quickly went to a nearly by storage room grabbing a large bag used to move deflated inner tubes. Leaving the park as well, Brett turned around to head to the back of the break room. Dragging the bag behind him, he swung open the door and greeted Brody and Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Josh ok? Who'd you send him home with? Did he look hurt?\" Tyler asked running up to Brett as he dropped the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had Ross walk him home, so he'll be fine. Don't worry Ty.\" Brett said with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed in relief. \"Oh good. I'm glad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward, Brett drug the bag to the bathroom door, opening it up and looking over at Ricky as he leaned up against the sink. Ricky glared as Brett walked over, tearing the tape off his mouth and pulling out the sock. Ricky simply smirked as he spat in Brett's face. Brett stood there, unmoving for a second until he wiped his face and called out of the bathroom. \"Yo, Ty? Stuff this trash in the bag for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler appeared through the door, shouldering his way past Brett while he cracked his knuckles and smiled menacingly. \"With pleasure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett walked out of the room, still rubbing his face clean as he heard muffled cries and sounds of fists hitting bare skin. A second later he turned around to see Tyler standing there with the bag slung over his shoulder with ease. Brett smirked as he looked over at Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so Brod. You stay here and pick him up after Ty and I drop him off.\" Brett said as Brody nodded in agreement. Tyler on the other hand, frowned as he dropped the bag to the ground, causing a muffled \"Oof!\" to come from Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude. I wanna pick him up. You take Brod to drop him off.\" Tyler said looking serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett put a hand on his chin. Tyler's motives might be questionable, but in the end, Brett didn't really care what happened to this prick. Shrugging, Brett decided to have...            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brett bit his lip for a second, but he decided it might end up being the right thing to do. Smirking to himself, he couldn't help but think Tyler wanted this more than himself or Brody combined. \"Alright man. Brod and I will bring him around. Be ready to pick him up in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply nodded his head with a very serious look on his face. Brody came up beside Brett as the two men grabbed the sack, carrying it together on their shoulders. Making their way out of the break room, the two were glad to see there wasn't a line to get back into the park. Activating the shrinking machine, the two miniaturized themselves, entering the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they came through the entry way a few guests walked by, seeing the two lifeguards holding the sack. Disregarding what they saw as work, the guests simply minded their own business as they went about the park with their friends and families. Brett motioned for Brody to walk through an employee's only roped off section of the park, so as not to draw too much attention however. The route was a little longer, but Brett figured it would be better than running into someone and having Ricky be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro...\" Brody started to say as he looked forward at Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably concerned about Tyler right?\" Brett said, practically reading Brody's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro. You saw how pissed he was.\" Brody replied, still thinking about how Tyler nearly beat Ricky to death already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to run off with this prick.\" Brett said as he patted the bag. \"You know that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda figured.\" Brody said as he looked down at the floor as they continued walking. \"You're letting him have him, huh bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Brett said simply as they turned the corner making their way to the entrance to the break room. Opening the door with his free hand, Brett looked out into the room. Truth was, he's never even been in the room while being small like this. He looked around in awe as he couldn't imagine how his boss did this on a daily basis. Even more terrifying, Brett looked up to see the now massive form of Tyler, looming over the balcony with a dangerous looking spark in his eye. Trying to act casual however, Brett simply waved up at the menacing behemoth as he and Brody dropped the bag down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah brooooo!\" Brody exclaimed with amazement as he looked up at Tyler. \"Dude! You're huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett rolled his eyes as he started to undo the knot on the bag. Opening it up he looked at Ricky's face as he had a fresh piece of medical tape over his mouth. Brett smirked as he decided to taunt the man a little. \"I was wondering why you were so quiet. I figured you were just too scared to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett ripped off the tape from his mouth as he started to pull the man gradually out of the bag. As he pulled the bag down he looked over at Brody, still amazed by Tyler's size. \"Bro! Flex for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled as he rose his eyebrow. Lifting up his right arm he flexed his bicep a little bit, much to Brody's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet bro! Talk about giant gains!\" Brody yelled up at Tyler, sounding like a typical frat bro. \"I bet I'd look good too if I was in your place, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed again as he lowered his arm. \"You probably would, dude. Anyway, where's that little bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett drug their captive over toward Brody by the leash he created earlier. Flopping the man on the ground Brett simply crossed his arms as he spoke. \"Right here, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at the tiny people, seeing the tiny blonde man tied up and laying on the floor. Smiling he reached down, carefully pinching the leash between his fingers and raising the little captive to his face. Looking back down at Brett, Tyler heard the tiny man speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ty. We'll be back around in just a few minutes. Hang tight ok?\" Brett said as he and Brody turned away to re-enter the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody turned and pointed up at Tyler with both is hands and clicked his tongue. \"Don't go no where, stud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chucked to himself a little over Brody's antics, but quickly turned his attention toward Ricky as they left. His eyes turned angry as he glared at the tiny man with all his hatred. \"You little punk. I'm gonna eat you alive and shit your bones out on your doorstep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky squirmed and flailed as he tried to break free from the ropes, finally realizing how deep of shit he may literally be in. Tyler smirked as he started to walk toward the exit of the break room, still glaring at the tiny pathetic speck. \"Nah that would be too easy. I'll think of something though while I make your puny life hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled as he opened up the door to the break room, leaving before Brody and Brett could return. Closing the tiny man in his hand, Tyler started to make his way home. All the while he thought to himself all the different way he could ruin this little guy's life before ultimately finishing him off. Making his way to his apartment, Tyler unlocked the door and went inside. Closing and locking the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing his tiny prey into his kitchen, he set the little man down on the counter. Tyler watched, amused as he saw the little guy struggle to get to his feet as he tried to run away. Tyler smiled as he made a noise with his throat and collected a hefty amount of mucus in his mouth, before spitting it all out in a long strand onto Ricky's position. Laughing as he saw Ricky struggle in the thick strands of spit, he couldn't help but mock the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spit on me, I spit back, runt.\" Tyler said as he leaned down, trying to intimidate the tiny blonde. Watching Ricky struggle, Tyler started to get bored with the little man's simple torment. Deciding to put the man though a different kind of torture, Tyler reached down in a drawer pulling out...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He was almost killed because of you me stupid assed stunt, so now I\u2019m gonna add you to this shake and have some extra protein! Let me make this clear dude, I\u2019m not going to just swallow you, I\u2019m going to eat and digest you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler went back to the fridge and pulled out a large sub sandwich that he had been saving for when his shift had finished, \u201cafter I send you down I\u2019ll be eating this so I start my digestive juices going, I want to churn you up big style Ricky boy! There won\u2019t be much left of you by the time I dump you in my toilet in the morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Ricky was in tears, he realised he\u2019d gone too far, and now he was going to end up as supper for this behemoth of a lifeguard, nothing more than a speck of protein, looking up at Tyler he pleaded \u201cplease, please don\u2019t eat me! I\u2019m<br>\r\nsorry man!\u201d I don\u2019t wanna die! Have mercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like the mercy you showed Josh? Nah bud, I don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re mine now, just be thankful that you get to be eaten by me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the protein shake in one hand and Ricky with the other, Tyler walked into to bathroom. Showing Ricky the toilet, Tyler smirked \u201ctake a good look dude, coz I can\u2019t wait to flush what\u2019s left of you into the sewer where you belong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Tyler dropped Ricky into the glass and watched as he frantically tried to stay afloat. Unfortunately for him though Tyler was already tilting the glass towards his open mouth, Ricky screamed as he was sloshed straight in at the first mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth full of shake, Tyler simply smiled as he tilted I\u2019m his head back and gave one big gulp, sending Ricky on his way to the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy the ride dude, it\u2019s the last one you\u2019ll ever take\u201d Smiling broadly Tyler went back into the kitchen and started eating the sub sandwich, \u201cmay as well have a complete and balanced meal\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ricky found himself struggling to find any sort of safe spot in the cavernous stomach, he couldn\u2019t believe that he was going to actually be digested alive by another guy. As he was trying to gain some sort of composure piles of chewed up sandwich cane falling into the stomach \u201cthat bastard\u201d he thought, \u201che\u2019s really going through with this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s stomach started to churn as more food entered, and to make things worse  Tyler let out a huge belch which compacted everything around Ricky, including the large amount of acid which was starting to collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Tyler rubbed his gut, \u201chope you\u2019re enjoying it in there Ricky, thanks for the extra protein!\u201d He then proceeded to finish the last of his sandwich in a single gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Ricky was running out of air, and the acid was starting to burn at his skin, finally the last bit of mushed sandwich landed right on top of him, forcing him right underneath into the pool of acid. Giving up the fight, he passed out and was slowly eaten away by the digestive enzymes in Tyler\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his stomach lightly gurgling, Tyler went into his bedroom and lay on the bed, rubbing his stomach, he couldn\u2019t help but feel so powerful, he\u2019d eaten a tiny guy, and was digesting him right now, he sort of hoped that other people would cross Josh\u2019s path so he could eat them too. Slowly, he drifted off to sleep, his meal digesting peacefully inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came, and Tyler got out of bed and went to the bathroom, feeling the urge to do his business. He dropped his tight Under Armour hipsters to the ground and sat on the toilet while he played on his phone. A few minutes later he turned and flushed what was left of Ricky away, just a few bones encased in his shit were left after his mighty stomach did it\u2019s work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long you piece of shit\u201d he smirked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now knew that he had to go back to work and face his boss and his colleagues, but what story could he come up with about what happened to Ricky?</span></div></div>",

Brett frowned as he wasn't finished making his point yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to sound like a dick, but this asshole would have probably gotten away with it if I didn't over hear him. You wouldn't have even known.\" Brett said as he turned and looked around the corner to see the kids were all almost through the shrinking machine. Turning back to Tyler, he saw him staring at the ground, looking upset. Sighing, Brett felt bad, he didn't mean to hurt Tyler's feelings after all. \"I'm sorry dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry.\" Tyler replied looking up at Brett. \"I was gonna run off with this guy on my own. This is better though, we can deal with him together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smiled as he looked around the corner, seeing the coast was clear. Motioning to Tyler, the two made their way out into the open and into the shrinking machine to enter the park. After the shrinking process was complete they looked around to see only a few people were lingering about at the entry way. Walking past a few groups of people, the two men tried to look casual as they made their way over to the other entrance to the break room. Brett reached for the door knob with his free hand and pushed open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett looked out into the enormous room in awe. Looking around, it dawned on him that he had never been in the room while being small before. Rubbing his eyes and he dropped the bag off his shoulder, he couldn't believe how everything looked so huge from this perspective. Looking up he saw Brody standing over the balcony with a friendly grin on his face. Brett smirked, had it been anyone else he would have felt nervous about having such a massive giant loom over him, but he knew Brody wouldn't let anything happen to him or Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two look so cute small, bros!\" Brody said as he leaned down to get a closer look at his tiny co-workers. Tyler shook his fist up at the giant, feeling patronized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you look like a big dumb building, Brod!\" Tyler yelled, not liking this whole shrinking business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww don't get all upset, tiny Ty!\" Brody chucked with a little enthusiasm. Tyler simply fumed as Brett pulled open the bag and dumped out Ricky's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Brett called out as Brody and Tyler stopped bickering to look over at Ricky. \"Tyler, did you kill him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett prodded the body with his foot as he rolled Ricky over on his back. Stopping for a second he saw the man take a breath. Tyler walked over and looked down at the still tied up man as he scratched his chin. \"I was gonna say, I was pretty sure he was alive. I guess I just knocked him out though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett sighed as he and Tyler got out of the way, allowing Brody to lift up Ricky's unconscious body up off the balcony and into his palm. Giving the two tiny men a thumbs up, Tyler and Brett turned to leave the break room. \"See you in a minute itty bitty Tyler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook with embarrassment as he and Brett made their way into the park, closing the door to the break room behind them. \"Can we shrink Brody next? I wanna step on him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett laughed as he put his arm around Tyler as the two made their way out around the park. Tyler couldn't help but chuckle as well, calming down from Brody's annoyance. Heading out of the park, the two regained their normal size as they made their way around the back of the building to the break room. Brett opened the door as he was greeted with an obnoxious sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUURRRRPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody patted his chest as the two men entered to room, curious what the sudden belch was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate him, bros!\" Brody said with a smile on his face as he patted his stomach. Tyler looked over angrily as Brett simply raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't.\" Brett said flatly as he looked at Brody's other hand, closed in a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody raised up his palm as he rubbed the back of his head with his free hand, revealing Ricky's still unconscious body. \"You're right, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smiled as he walked over to Brody to look at the little man, still not moving. \"You're a terrible liar, Brod.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believed him!\" Tyler said as he stomped across the room to look at Ricky with his own eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course <i>you</i> would.\" Brett chucked as he looked over at Tyler. Tyler simply frowned as he scratched his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Tyler asked as Brett simply shrugged with a smirk. Forgoing Brett's words, Tyler wanted to refocus on what to do with Ricky. \"Either way Brod, you should've burped on him. Maybe it would've woken the little punk up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody rubbed his stomach as he closed his mouth for a second. With a little less force than the first, Brody expelled a second burp, directly over Ricky's body. \"Wake up, you... uh... little punk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shook his head as he couldn't believe Brody just used the same insult Tyler did. \"Dude, you suck at being mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody reared his head back, looking a little offended. \"What are you talking about, bro? I just burped on the guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at Brett and nodded his head. \"Nah, Brett's right, dude. You're like the nicest guy at the park along with Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! I can be mean!\" Brody yelled as he looked down at Ricky again. \"Wake up! Or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed, clutching his stomach and resting an arm on Brett's shoulder, while Brett simply stood there with his palm over his face. Brody looked over at the two men, feeling somewhat defeated as he reached out his hand, giving Ricky to Brett. Tyler looked down at the little man, reaching over into Brett's hand as he quickly closed it into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuude, I wanna hold him!\" Tyler wined as he still had tears in his eyes from laughter. Brett simply raised an eyebrow as he looked at Tyler's face, knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So you can crush him or something?\" Brett shot back, knowing Tyler all too well. Tyler simply crossed his arms in disappointment, still wanting to destroy the little man himself. Brett chucked at the man's disappointment as he felt a tiny squirm in his hand. Opening it up, he saw Ricky struggling to get to his feet as he looked up at the three giants in terror. \"Well well well. Look who's awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Look who's awake, bro!\" Brody said awkwardly as he tried to crowd in to look at the little man. Brett and Tyler simply turned and looked at him with straight faces. Taking the hint, Brody backed off and went to go sit at the kitchen table. Turning their attention back to Ricky, Tyler and Brett both smirked evilly at the pathetic tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know fellas.\" Brett started to say as he looked over at Tyler and Brody. \"If this bastard tried to use us to unknowingly kill our friend, why don't we have one of our friends unknowingly take this bastard out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky twitched as he looked up at Brett's face, hating the giant man more than anything right now. Tyler shook his head, obviously not feeling the same way as Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude. Us three caught this bastard, I say we take him out our ourselves.\" Tyler said as he pounded a fish into his hand, causing Ricky to wince in fear of the giant. Both Brett and Tyler looked up at Brody as he sat at the table. The two smiled as they felt bad for not including him before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you pick, Brod?\" Brett asked, wanting Brody to break the tie. Looking over at his friends, Brody scratched his chin for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, I kinda have to side with...\"        </span></div></div>",

Speaking up, Brody decided he'd be the one to ask. \"Luke? I thought you hated him, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may not always see eye to eye, but trust me.\" Brett said as he tossed Ricky up in the air slightly, catching him and closing his fist around the little man. \"The only person at this park I hate is this little pest right here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Brody both smiled to each other, happy to hear Brett really did have a sense of comradery for everyone at the park, Luke included. Brett clenched his fist a little as he watched the two exchange the smiles, however. \"He's still a moron though, you guys get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody smirked as he stood up, walking past Brett as he patted him on the shoulder. \"I'll go get them, bro. I'm not good at this evil mastermind crap anyway. So you two come up with  plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at Brett as they heard Brody shut the door behind him. Deep in thought, Brett bounced his fist up and down, feeling the tiny trapped man bounce with it. \"Well dude, any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it might be interesting to drop the little guy on the couch, and let Luke and Matt chill for a bit. We could give them something to eat too and kinda just watch as things unfold.\" Brett said as he opened his eyes. \"He could fall on the floor or even get sat on, I think it would be funny to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh I guess...\" Tyler said not really sure if he liked the idea of having Ricky roam free and leave it up to Luke and Matt. \"They are pretty destructive dudes, though I guess. I was kinda hoping we could give him a taste of his own medicine and feed him to one of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medicine...\" Brett said, getting an idea. \"We could stuff the tiny bastard in an empty pill. One of those dummies is bound to think it's just a vitamin or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that even work though, dude?\" Tyler said, trying to think of how swallowing a pill even works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the pill wouldn't break down in the stomach.\" Brett said as he thought about time released capsules. \"I'm no expert, but I think they break down in the small intestine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler frowned as he started to not like the sound of that. \"Wait so if he doesn't get digested, wouldn't he just come out the other end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Brett stuttered as his memories of basic biology were starting to fail him. \"I'm not sure. I guess if he didn't it would be kinda hilarious for one of the guys to shit him out though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be kinda funny, dude.\" Tyler said as he put a hand on his abdomen, trying to imagine a tiny guy surviving past his stomach somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way.\" Brett said as he weighed the options. \"I think it's better if we...\" </span></div></div>",

Although, to Josh it was like he was sky diving next to some sort of giant clothed skyscraper, to Ricky Josh seemed to be daintily falling past his face. With luck Josh landed on something soft... and blue... Ricky's shirt! He couldn't believe how far he'd fallen as he looked up to see Ricky's huge chest looming over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must've some how landed near his stomach!\" Josh noticed as he looked down at the folds of clothes he was standing on. Without hesitation Josh knew he had to hide from the dangerous giant. His first instinct was to slip between the buttons of the hunk's tight tee shirt and hide closer on his body. \"Worth a shot anyway.\" Josh said as he swiftly climbed inside the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of the shirt it was certainly darker and smelt badly of sweat. Ricky seemed to be wearing some sort of under shirt preventing his progress any further. \"There goes the hide in the belly button plan...\" Josh grimaced to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly with a jolt, Ricky's body started moving and Josh heard a terrifying voice roar from above. \"Where are you little bug? I won't hurt you... much...\" The giant said evilly. Josh lost his grip falling further from his position near the belly button and landing just above the man's crotch, saved by the tucked shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of this.\" Ricky thought as he unbuttoned his shirt. \"If he won't come out, I'll just give him no where to hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky finished stripping off his shirt revealing a pale white tank top underneath. Still looking for the tiny man crawling around on his body, he barely noticed a tiny speck fall from his crotch and slide down his leg near the floor. As the speck floated slowly down to the floor Ricky kept a close and angry eye on the little bug of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh grabbed on to whatever he could but the force of gravity was too strong and he was forced to slide down Ricky's leg down off of his shorts and on to his hairy legs. Managing to clutch a hair Josh let out a sigh of relief. \"Maybe he hasn't seen me this whole time.. I could still get away.\" Josh hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the giant man he could no longer see his face. It just seemed like it was way too far way and the rest of Ricky's huge body blocked out most of his view. Climbing down Ricky's leg, Josh turned and saw something that made him squeal. Dropping down he quickly avoided being swatted like a bug on the young man's firm legs. Falling once more Josh landed on something soft once again, what appeared to be the tongue of Ricky's shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Josh looked up to see a giant finger moving toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flick*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got em!\" Ricky said triumphantly as he flicked the little man off his shoe and on the floor. Ricky finally, sat himself down on the floor in front of little Josh. Looking down at him between his size 13 feet with an evil smirk forming on his face. \"Guess you really didn't wanna be eaten huh?\" He said taunting his little prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squished it is little guy.\" Ricky said looking at the unmoving little speck. \"Poor guy can't even run away...  </span></div></div>",

But don't forget... size matters.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky stood up looming over Josh's broken body staring down intently at the little speck. Moving his enormous black nike forward he hovered it over the terrified little man, giving him a good view of the treads he'd soon be a part of. \"Until a scrap off your sorry little body off that is, you little bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move, Ricky had almost certainly broken both of Josh's legs with a simple flick. lying there was all he could do now. Looking up at Ricky's monstrous form was likely one of the last things he'd ever see. Ears ringing Josh could barely make out what Ricky was saying to him, whatever taunts he had didn't mean much to Josh at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIZE MATTERS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the last words Josh heard as Ricky moved his enormous size 13 foot over him, blocking out all his vision under the black bottom of the shoe. Josh could barely make out bits of dirt in the treads of the shoe just before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky slid his foot back and fourth, just for good measure, before turning over his shoe expecting a glorious bloody smear. \"Pfff he was so small he didn't even leave a mark.\" Ricky said putting his foot back on the ground.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the floor where the speck formally was, he looked closely to see if there were any marks there either. \"Damn no guts or nothing...\" Ricky said upset he had to real reward for taking another human's life in such a brutal fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... better get going. Have to find a job somewhere else.\" He joked to himself laughing on his way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Josh, his only solace was that he died quickly and painlessly at the feet of the dejected interviewee.  </span></div></div>",

Both his legs broken from being violently flicked, Josh realized there was no chance of escape unless the sinister giant had a sudden feeling of mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S MAKE THIS LAST, SHALL WE.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words roared over Josh like a tornado. Tried as he might to protest, all he could do was wince in pain as he desperately tried to move. Looking over, panting Josh saw Ricky was slowly untying his shoe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets feel this little bitch squirm...\" Ricky thought to himself peeling off his size 13 nikes. Tossing the shoes aside he made extra sure they clapped loudly on the floor, so as to make his tiny victim jump. Looking down at the pathetic bug try and squirm away just made Ricky feel all the more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he made sure to roll his socks off very slowly, laying his feet right beside the the terrified little man. \"Hope he enjoys the show... it's gonna be his last.\" Ricky thought as he finally slid off the rest of socks. Positioning his feet at either side of Josh, hoping that his sweaty feet make the little man choke. Laughing out loud he retreated his feet and got ready to stand up... Not before laying his sweat drenched sock directly on top of his puny prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was starting to go dark as the sweaty feet smell overpowered Josh's olfactory senses. \"I c-can't... breath...\" Josh huffed, hoping his sadistic capture would just end this torture. Seemingly his wish was at least half granted as a wave of fresh air swept over him as Ricky moved his colossal feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's relief was short lived as darkness shrouded over him once more, but this time due to fowl smelling white fabric. \"His... sock...?\" Josh barely consciously recognized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard shifting noises, and had a terrible feeling come over him. Fighting back vomit, Josh tried to rest his body, trying his best not to move his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing at his full height, Ricky smirked down at his sock. \"Hope he's enjoying himself under there... why wouldn't he.\" He laughed again at his own internal banter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his toe, Ricky moved the sock from its position, revealing an unmoving pale little speck. Then slowly he moved his bare foot, inches off the ground above poor little Josh. Slowly, he lowered his sweaty foot, until he started to feel the coolness of the ground. Putting as little weight on the floor as possible, he figured the little man might still draw breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squirm then maybe I'll show mercy.\" He taunted as he put down his weight little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a fleshy eclipse of the word as the sweaty foot descended down on his tiny body. Putting up his hand Josh tried fruitlessly to push the smelly foot away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's legs were in excruciating pain as the foot came to a stop. His whole body was pinned to the ground, barely with enough space for him to breath. Then Ricky's cocky voice boomed out, muffled slightly by his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUIRM THEN MAYBE I'LL SHOW MERCY.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Josh's last hope. Wiggling as fiercely as he could despite the pain in his legs, Josh was prepared to do anything at the chance of living. The weight kept coming down as Josh tried to squirm harder and harder, then finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a extremely tiny bug, Ricky finally felt the little man's body give way. Resting his full weight on the spot finally he chuckled to himself. \"You call that squirming? I barely felt it.\" He said looking down at his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down on the ground, Ricky moved his foot closer to his face so he could examine it. \"Wheeeeew! That sticks! Glad I wasn't him!\" He said impressed with his own foot odor. Looking closely he did see a very small smear on the sole of his foot. Proud of himself, he slipped back on his socks and shoes. Not bothering to wipe the little man's body off his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its like a souvenir.\" He smirked. \"Of my visit to the infamous Shrink and Swim.\" He said laughing as he walked out of the room.               </span></div></div>",

Looks like he was trained in a lot of emergency first aid and CPR which is great.\" Josh looked at his list of skills still impressed by the resume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever, dude. You better hurry and meet the guy!\" Tyler rushed Josh, pushing him along toward the interviewing room. \"He's been waiting for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh ran along side Tyler making his way to the room. Josh simply turned to his friend who gave him a thumbs up, as Josh went through the door. Josh opened into the massive room, having to take it all in for a moment. Josh stood on a small balcony across from a massive chair where he saw his first take of this new giant, Chad. Josh approached the front of the balcony ready to address the man as he took in his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was what you'd expect from an ex-military type guy. Short buzzed brown hair and deep look brown eyes, even from Josh's distance. He wore a tight black shirt and long green cargo pants, shirt tucked into the the waist. He definitely had his fair share of handsome features, with a strong dependable looking face with light scruff and a chiseled looking jaw line. Josh drew his attention to the man's tight shirt which bulged with muscle, clearly he was very well trained in his time in the military. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chad?\" Josh spoke up as the huge man's eyes looked toward Josh immediately. \"Sorry I'm late, my name is Josh, I'll be conducting your interview.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, sir.\" Chad said formally. \"I think I was a little early anyway, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was immediately a little shocked by just how formal the man was. He wasn't sure how to handle it, but it was at least some what refreshing compared to the dude's and bro's he was used to being called by the rest of his staff. \"Early is good though! I appreciate the effort. Now then, what do you know about Shrink and Swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that it uses a shrink ray of sorts of make all the guests tiny, sir.\" Chad answered, clearly doing some research before just dropping off his application. \"I guessed my interviewer might have been tiny based off the little balcony you're standing on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, very observant.\" Josh complimented the man. \"That's a good skill when watching over guests. It could save a life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Chad received the compliment almost robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not need to be too formal, by the way.\" Josh tried to loosen the almost stiff man up a bit. \"We're very relaxed here. I almost prefer it when my employees refer to me informally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, sir... errr... umm...\" Chad looked at a loss for what to call Josh. Josh merely shrugged, not meaning for it to be a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll work on it.\" Josh simply said for now. \"Just speak comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll try.\" Chad smiled, trying to drop his seriousness a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Josh commented. \"Why don't you tell me a bit of your experience with first aid or CPR.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\" Chad shifted in his chair slightly as Josh watched his twist his tight torso sightly, exposing a strong set of abs through his tight shirt. Josh bit his lip as he focused back at Chad's face as he continued. \"I had to undergo basic medical training for the military. CPR was a part of it. Thankfully I never really had to use any of it aside from small stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear, but the knowledge is there.\" Josh tried to pay the massive man another complement, hoping to get him to be a little more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Chad looked at Josh closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that's part of how interviews work.\" Josh smiled professionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you choose to be small like that all the time?\" Chad asked bluntly. \"I mean it seems dangerous. Like I could crush you without even trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a little taken aback, not really sure what to say before Chad reared back and apologized. \"I'm sorry sir, that was way out of line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no.\" Josh tried to legitimize the question. \"I get asked things like that a lot. Being this size is just convenient for me, but convenience does come at a dangerous cost every once in awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd protect you, sir.\" Chad blushed very slightly for a moment. \"I just don't like seeing people get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it.\" Josh smiled, feeling like it was an awkward, yet genuinely sweet gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview went on for awhile long. Josh felt like he definitely got a good grasp of who Chad was. In the end Josh made a decision that...         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

You gotta hurry man he's waiting for you!\" Tyler said gesturing at the door to the interview room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the file Josh sighed. \"Why'd it have to be some giant meat head with no experience...\" He thought, hoping the  interview could just be over as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright wish me luck, Ty!\" Josh says turning toward the door and waving at his burly employee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need luck boss! Go get 'em!\" He replied, turning away and waving back as he headed out back to his post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened the door to the large room, looking out as far as he could as he walked forward. It was a squarish room with a chair and table at one end and a balcony at the other. Josh walked across the balcony to a small microphone that was used to communication without needing to yell at the top of lungs for the interviewee to hear him. Staring out over the balcony Josh got his first look at Scott. The mammoth of a 18 year old made the chair he was sitting in look like it belonged in a kindergarten classroom. Apart from that the gigantic teen wore a backwards baseball cap with his brown hair peeking out the front. His face looked out to the left, bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dress for success must've been something this kid's never heard of.\" Josh thought looking at the teen's attire. He wore a red \"stringer\" tank top which barely hid any of his muscular torso. Leading down to his shorts, which were just white basketball shorts, string untied with his underwear showing slightly around the top, the brand \"under armor\" was written across the black spandex front. Finally, looking down at the teen's feet, which he had stretched out in a relaxed fashion, he wore nothing but a pair of black sandals on his massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his appearance Josh always tried to treat everyone he met with respect. \"Sorry I'm late Scott. My name is Josh. I'm the owner of Shrink and Swim. I'll be interviewing you today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned his attention forward, looking where to voice came from. \"Uhh...\" He said in a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here on the balcony, its ok. Sometimes its a little shocking for people to see a shrunk person first hand.\" Josh added casually as the giant teen focused his attention at the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! No way!\" The giant man said, suddenly standing up and moving forward to look down at the tiny man on the balcony. \"Are all the people in the park so small?\" He asked looking down curiously at the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an idiot...\" Josh thought. \"Yes, that's the whole principal behind the park actually. Now if you'd take your seat we can start our interview.\" Josh said looking up nervously at the practically shirtless giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" He said gruffly as he stepped back and planted himself back into the small chair. \"I'm just not used to this whole deal...\" He said blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiling his head Josh questioned, \"Oh is this your first interview?\" The giant man sat up and nodded slowly. \"Well don't worry just be honest about yourself and everything will be fine.\" Josh assured the mountainous teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What made you want to apply to Shrink and Swim?\" Josh started off, figuring it was an easy question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually my girl friend filled out the application. She just told me it was for life guarding, which I figured I'd be good at.\" He said honestly. \"I had no idea the people in the park were so small though. Do I just scoop them out of the water with my hand or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nearly face palmed at the question. Obviously, he knew nothing about the park other than \"Be a lifeguard.\" \"Well actually Scott...\" Josh said politely. \"There's a shrink ray out front. Everyone, including staff get's shrunk when they go in. So while in the park its as if you're the same size normally compared other people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh I think I get it.\" Scott replied leaning forward. \"That's pretty cool as long as I don't have to stay shrunk all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when when the lifeguards are off duty they all usually go around front and grow back to normal size to wind down in the break room.\" Josh said reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do that then?\" Scott asked suddenly looking across the room at the tiny speck of man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually I don't have time, being the owner and operator. Besides, I find the experience to be enlightening.\" Josh stated to back himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool man. I mean I like being big, so I guess it can work both ways.\" He said chucking deeply. Josh looked down as he turned a little red at the comment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so!\" Josh said, shaking a little. \"Anyway let's continue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview went on for a few more minutes and Scott struggled to give good answers. His fundamental answers were fine, but anytime the question was remotely ambiguous he had to stop and think for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Scott, that's all the questions I have. Based off your performance I've come to the conclusion that...\"  <br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

Standing up, Scott walked over to the little balcony and knelt down, trying his best to be on the same level as his new boss. Josh was a little taken aback by the sudden approach however and leaped back a step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" The enormous teen said closing his eyes and bowing his head in front of an awe struck Josh. \"I thought for sure you were gonna turn me away! I really needed this job!\" He added happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was actually pleased with his decision. Sure the kid was a moron, but there was something... almost adorable about how dumb he was. \"It's great to hear he needed the job that badly too.\" Josh pondered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its no problem! No need to bow your head...\" he said as the teen opened back up his eyes, looking down at Josh. \"I see a lot of potential in you, Scott. We just need to work together to bring it out.\" Josh stated smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is your first job huh?\" Josh asked as the excited teen stood back up to his massive height. \"Yeah...\" Scott replied lifting up his muscled arm and scratching the back of his head. \"I bet Bri's gonna be pumped to find out I got it!\" He added happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bri must be his girlfriend.\" Josh thought quickly. \"Well in celebration, tell her she get's a free admission to the park tomorrow. She can watch you in action, assuming that is you can start that soon?\" Josh said smiling thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking way down past his chest, abs, all the way down near his crotch at the tiny man making him such a kind offer Scott smiled. \"You're the best, man! She'll love that! I can't wait to get home and tell her!\" He said turning to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa hold up there.\" Josh stopped the giant teen, forcing him to turn back around. \"Now that all this is settled, I want to give you a little tip.\" Josh said seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come dressed like THAT at any interviews you have in the future.\" Josh said as Scott looked down at his stringer tank. \"I thought I should show off my body, being a lifeguard position and all.\" he said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty much the only reason why I let it slide, buddy.\" Josh said crossing his arms. \"Also try not to wear hats, especially backwards at an interview. Also, two words. Dress pants. Or shorts I guess. At the very least pull up them shorts a bit before you come in.\" Josh said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep it in mind.\" Scott said a little embarrassed. \"Seriously, thank you for everything.\" He said moving toward the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa whoa whoa!\" Josh said, making the teen turn around a second time. \"You need a uniform, Mr. hasty. Take the door on your left when you walk out. That's the break room door. We can set you up with a uniform in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two left the room, Josh turned and went into the break room and looked around. The break room was designed with balconies, elevators, and conveyor belts to help shrunken people go about the otherwise spacious room. The rooms were in fact normal sized, with a kitchen, lounge, bathroom, and even a small work out room. Josh looked around the room and saw...</span></div></div>",

Noticing the little balconies similar to the one in the interview room he scanned them quickly with his hands on his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are boss!\" He said proudly as he search finally came to an end. \"This is gonna take some getting used to!\" He said laughing and scratching under his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyday certainly is an adventure!\" Josh said at the young jock. \"Anyway, doesn't seem anybody is on break right now, so I'll have to get your uniform for you.\" Josh said turning his attention to the little computer behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh won't it be a little small if you get, sir?\" Scott replied looking down at his impressively muscled frame. \"No offense but I'd probably lose it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Scott, Josh figured he'd have to explain this. \"Well actually I can use the computer here to have a new uniform your size brought in from storage. All I need is your size, big guy.\" Josh added unintentionally at the end as he turned back and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsed to the remark, Scott didn't think twice about it. \"Ohh wow dude that's cool. Technology sure is amazing!\" He said looking down at Josh. \"I guess I take like a XL by the way.\" He said, sliding off his stringer tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned even brighter red as the massive teen removed the small article of clothing. Sure he was practically shirtless already... but now there weren't any obstructions at all of Scott's well toned body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"XL coming up.\" Josh said, voice cracking slightly. The machine made a quick \"ding\" noise as a rack came out into the room with a crisp clean lifeguard's uniform. It wasn't anything special. Just your typical attire for the profession. A white tank top with the word \"Lifeguard\" across the front. Red board shorts with a cross on them. And last but not least, a red hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" The young behemoth bellowed. \"A new hat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words he quickly pulled off his current cap, showing off his short brown hair, a little messed up from being under a hat. Only to then replace it with the new red hat, making sure to turn it backwards for extra effect. Next, the young man pulled down his already sagging basketball shorts, revealing his sporty compression shorts underneath. Taking his new board shorts he pulled them up over his underwear making sure to tie it tight at the strings. \"Look boss! Pulled em up all the way just for you!\" He said with a cheery tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it, Scott!\" Josh said with a nod of approval. \"You look very professional! Make sure that tank top fits alright too for when you want to wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the top over his shoulder the mountainous teen laughed. \"It looks like it'll be fine! If not I can just cut it down to match this!\" He said raising up his stringer top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not!\" Josh added kindly, hoping the giant teen was really just kidding. The two locked eyes for a moment and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, I wouldn't do something to disrespect you. Not after how good you've been to me.\" Scott said humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I appreciate that... Scott.\" Josh said, a little lost for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my pleasure little bud.\" Scott replied, flashing his little boss a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Josh tried to refocus on his job. \"Anyway, tomorrow morning I need you to report in for basic training. We'll teach you basic lifeguard skills, then after that you'll be shown a brief video on CPR here in the break room. After that I'll give you a test, if you pass you'll be CPR certified and can start lifeguarding right away. If you fail, we'll have to go back over the tape and we'll work though it.\" Josh said reassuring the large teen, who's eyes widened at the word \"test\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend is welcome over whenever and I'll happily give her a tour of the park myself.\" Josh ended professionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott shook his head in understanding, stopping once more to thank his new boss before leaving. Still brimming with excitement over this fresh opportunity.   </span></div></div>",

Josh tried to imagine what kind of girl Bri must be and how proud she must be over her sweet yet massive boyfriend. Josh refocused as he saw the massive body of Scott come lumbering in through the front gate on time, but alone. Scott walked up to Josh with a smile as he looked down at Josh, dwarfing him even at the same scaled heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're tiny even in here!\" Scott laughed as he put out a hand to shake Josh's. \"But at least now I can properly thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he shook the giant man's hand. It was surreal seeing how tall he was at nearly a foot and a half taller than him. \"Like I told you, you seemed like a great guy. I have high expectations for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott took back his hand and smiled at the compliment. Josh looked around as he felt the need to address the question that was bugging him. \"So where's your girlfriend? I had it planned out to give her a tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... she said she'd be in later.\" Scott shifted his tone a little. \"Between you and me, she seemed a little off last night and this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...\" Josh tilted his head a little. \"Well either way! I have Tyler ready to train you over at the wave pool. It's just straight ahead follow the signs! He should be the only other guy stationed there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, boss.\" Scott smiled confidently. \"Heh. It's kinda neat having a boss for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh chuckled as Scott walked away. Josh noticed Scott's board shorts weren't on very tight as they sagged a bit showing a little of Scott's underwear. Josh shrugged it off as at least it was an improvement over it practically falling off his waist during the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt like he should wait by the entrance, helping out the admissions crew while he figured he'd wait for Bri to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by. Josh had skipped lunch and it was well into the early afternoon. No one ever came through admissions looking for a tour or speaking of a free admission of sorts. A little worried, Josh thanked the admissions crew as he left figuring it was best to go find Scott. Looking around, Josh figured by now they must be going over CPR in the break room. Heading that way, Josh reached the door from the tiny people's side and opened it. Looking out over the balcony sure enough Josh saw Tyler and Scott sitting at a table, Scott with a pen in his hand taking the certification test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was fast.\" Josh thought as he approached the edge of the balcony. Deciding to go right into the middle of things, Josh took one of the elevators designed for travel around the room for him over to the table. Once there, Josh silently made eye contact with Tyler who nodded with a satisfied grin at his tiny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost all set?\" Tyler asked Scott, who hadn't noticed Josh's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little stuck on this one...\" Scott puzzled over the last question. Tyler leaned in and looked at it briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it dude. It was like the first thing I taught you.\" Tyler offered the slight hint as Scott looked like he remembered and circled an answer. Tyler smiled, glad to see he was able to help Scott through the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating, Scott put down his pen and sat back. \"Man I'm so bad at these tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh walked directly onto the paper and looked down at some of the answers. \"Let's see how you did, Scott!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott jumped a little as he looked down and saw Josh in front of him on his test. \"Boss!? How long were you here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like three minutes.\" Tyler laughed, thinking Scott's jump was a little humorous. \"How'd he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just from a quick scan, looks like a pass to me.\" Josh quickly looked over some of the answers he had memorized. Scott put a hand on his chest, looking like he could breath easy now. Josh turned to the handsome teen however, feeling like he needed to deliver the bad news as well. \"Scott, your girlfriend never showed up. I'm not sure what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Can I go call her real quick?\" Scott asked politely. Josh agreed as the huge man got up, going into the locker room where he had stored his phone for the day. Josh looked up at Tyler and shrugged his shoulders. Hoping it wasn't serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd he do today?\" Josh asked Tyler as his huge friend took a deep breath and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man he's not very smart.\" Tyler admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's saying something coming from you.\" Josh teased the giant as Tyler shot him a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big talk coming from you, small fry.\" Tyler retorted, gently flicking Josh off his feet. Josh sat up and chuckled, very used to this kind of behavior from his best friend. \"He was fine. Sometimes it felt like talking to a brick wall. But seemingly most of what I taught him sunk in a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good I'm glad. He seems like a good kid.\" Josh smiled looking behind him toward the break room as Scott came back with his phone in his hand. \"Everything ok Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ignored my calls.\" Scott said slowly. \"Plus I have a text from our landlord saying to \"get that junk away from out front door.\" \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Josh looked at each other confused. Scott simply just stood there, looking like he was at a loss for words. \"Can-Can I just go see what that means? Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go with him?\" Tyler asked, not really waiting for permission to leave at all in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... this sounds weird.\" Josh puzzled for a moment. \"I'm going too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys don't have to.\" Scott said sheepishly. Both Tyler and Josh disagreed however as Tyler had already picked Josh up, holding him secure in his palm. \"Wait you're going like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's get going!\" Josh said as him and Tyler made their way out the door, Scott following after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief trip the trio had arrived at Scott's apartment. Sure enough outside the door was a bunch of men's clothes, video games and other various things Josh and Tyler guessed belonged to Scott. On top, was a note with Scott's name written across it. Picking it up, Scott read the note silently to himself, tears welling a little in his eyes and he crumpled it up, throwing it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She dumped me. Kicked me out. Even after I got a job like she wanted...\" Scott said softly to himself. \"I did everything for her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Josh looked at each other, clearly not knowing the details. \"Well if you both are on the lease for this apartment she can't just kick you out.\" Josh offered as a rebuttal. \"Plus you have a key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just her on the lease. It was apparently cheaper that way.\" Scott said almost robotically as he recalled that whole deal. Going up and trying to put the key in the door, it wouldn't turn the lock. \"She changed the lock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Tyler could only mutter. Wanting to say more, but he didn't want to upset Scott, he simply walked over and put a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey it's okay buddy. Josh and I are here for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned and pulled Tyler into a big hug, Josh getting caught in the middle as Tyler held up between the two men's bare stomachs. Tyler put his free arm around Scott and hugged back, feeling bad for the massive teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just moved here. You guys are the only people I know besides Bri.\" Scott admitted. \"So... I guess I'm just saying I'm glad I met you guys yesterday and today... for more than one reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott released Tyler as Josh gasped for air almost being crushed between the two men's sweaty abs as they both looked at Scott with sad expressions. Scott looked down at his stuff and kicked over a little trophy he had for sports in high school. \"I don't know where I'm gonna go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a spare room at my house.\" Josh offered instantly out of compassion to the massive man. \"You can stay with me till you get everything figured out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Scott looked down at Josh a few tears welling in his eyes again. \"You've already done so much for me... I don't know how I can ever repay you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me you'll work hard. That's payment enough.\" Josh winked as Scott knelt down, Tyler holding Josh at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could hug you but I'd be too afraid to squish you...\" Scott said, reaching at Josh with one finger cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can worry about that later, first let's get this stuff to my place!\" Josh exclaimed, glad he could help the giant teen in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed and Josh had informed the crew he wasn't going to be back today. The park closed as Josh was too busy to go back and regain his size, Josh figured it was fine spending the night at his house shrunk anyway. With all of Scott's stuff moved into the spare room, Josh sat atop his dining room table with Scott and Tyler seated with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this place is huge!\" Scott admired the huge house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we could have a ballin' party in here.\" Tyler smirked, thinking a party might cheer up Scott a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. yeah I guess if Scott wants to.\" Josh offered to Scott, feeling like his emotions should be the determining factor in any decision they make at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, sat back. Straight faced, he was still pretty choked up inside. Looking at Josh and Tyler Scott felt like... </span></div></div>",

Trapped, Josh could merely observe what Tyler had planned through listening to him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ty?\" Scott asked as he looked down at Tyler's hand. \"Is he ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First lesson. Don't worry about it.\" Tyler smiled at Scott. \"He's the size of a bug. You're giant compared to him. Don't ever let him boss you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's literally our boss, dude.\" Scott looked at Tyler confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the park, sure.\" Tyler waved his free hand like he was dismissing some small detail. \"But here he's your roommate. Your teeny tiny helpless roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But bro, he's letting me live here for free.\" Scott looked at Tyler's hand some more, tilting his head a little worried. \"I don't think I should be bossing him around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really bad at the whole 'being a giant' thing aren't you?\" Tyler shook his head a little disappointed the near 7-foot tall behemoth wasn't more into the idea of dominating a tiny person. \"Look, bud. I'm not saying to hurt him. But he loves getting bullied around a bit because of his size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does?\" Scott asked a bit surprised. \"I guess he did mention something about liking being small yesterday when we talked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See bro?\" Tyler winked at Scott, hoping to convince the teen. \"That was just him being shy. He'd be way into you being a cocky giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott pondered for a moment. It didn't really make much sense, but then again nothing in the past couple days had made any sense. Shrugging his shoulder, Scott decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean you ever make fun of anyone or horse around and stuff in high school?\" Tyler asked as Scott at there sort of blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, dude.\" Scott shook his head. \"I actually cracked down on a lot of bullies instead of doing any bullying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did they do?\" Tyler asked, kind of surprised a big time athletic jock like Scott never bullied anyone before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Push people into lockers. Called them nerds.\" Scott remembered a few instances. \"Made fun of dudes for being smaller than them. Then I'd show up behind them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must've shit their pants, bro!\" Tyler laughed as even he wouldn't want Scott showing up suddenly behind him, likely angry. \"So you're gonna be basically doing those things except it's all in fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things don't seem like they're in fun.\" Scott frowned, leaning back thinking of how awful the bullies were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me ask you this.\" Tyler looked at Scoot who peeked up in response. \"Are you Josh's friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.\" Scott answered with a slight blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're not bullying him. You're just messing with him!\" Tyler smiled with a matter of fact tone. \"Instead of pushing him into a locker, flick him off his feet. Instead of calling him a nerd, call him a bug! Tell him he's tiny then burp on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's ok with that?\" Scott once again asked, feeling like it might be too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! We're still his friends were just messing, bro!\" Tyler chuckled, thinking it was a bit odd Scott never experienced this sort of thing with male friends in the past. \"It's like telling your buddy he's a pussy then putting him in a headlock then laughing it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Bri took up so much of my time I never really had that.\" Scott looked down at the ground. Tyler removed his hand from covering Josh and walked over to Scott and put a hand on the big man's shoulder. Suddenly, Tyler put Scott in a headlock and wrestled him out of the chair and onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bro! Don't be such a pussy!\" Tyler laughed as Scott was easily able to over power Tyler and lift them off the ground. Smiling, Scott thought he finally understood as he turned Tyler around and put him in a headlock instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me turn that around almost too easily there little Ty.\" Scott laughed as he held Tyler into his chest before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever been called little before!\" Tyler laughed as he backed away from Scott. \"If I'm little what's he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what?\" Scott smirked as he looked down at Josh \"Oh, I thought that was just a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're getting it bro!\" Tyler went up to Scott and gave him a hearty pat on the back. \"So my man. Now that you've got the basics how about we try an advanced course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, like what, dude?\" Scott looked back at Tyler, dropping the arrogant tone almost instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking we'd have you...\"</span></div></div>",

He spoke so highly about his girl friend. I would have never guessed there was trouble at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classic nice guy was too nice deal I'd guess.\" Tyler scratched his chin. \"He said he gave her everything.

Not worth the effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree!\" Josh gave a short answer as Tyler rose an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you had a girlfriend?\" Tyler asked, having know Josh since the last stretch of college but never having him mention a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um...\" Josh felt like he couldn't lie to Tyler. \"Well I always get rejected. Never even went on a date. Then I got wrapped up in my research like you saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. Why would any girl turn down a cute guy like you?\" Tyler smirked as he leaned back, making Josh blush this time. \"Maybe Scott will ask you out once he learns how crazy girls are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Like how you realized how crazy girls are?\" Josh retorted slyly to Tyler who peered down at Josh before leaning over him and blowing a gust of air at him, causing him to topple over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder how Scott's doing?\" Tyler not to adeptly changed the subject as he heard the huge man settle down upstairs, seeming like he was done moving things around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check on him?\" Josh offered as a solution as he regained his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea!\" Tyler smirked as he reached down and plucked Josh off the table and held him in his hand. \"Well just have you do a little recon work! That way if he seems like he needs the space you can just back out without us bugging him!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess that's a good idea.\" Josh agreed as he was suddenly scooped up against his will. Tyler stood up as he held Josh close to his abdomen before as the huge man not so stealthily crept up the stairs going just outside Scott's room and setting Josh on the ground. Tyler gave Josh a thumbs up as he crept away back to the stairs, trying not to make it look like he was hanging around outside the room for long. Josh on the other hand, took a deep breath as he made his way under the crack in the door and into Scott's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around. There was already some amount of clothes on the ground, possibly clean, possibly dirty. A few boxes still had some of Scott's stuff peeking out of it as they were pressed up against the wall. Josh looked up as it wasn't hard to locate Scott. As Josh saw him up on the bed, seemingly he was...  </span></div></div>",

Josh quickly made his way across the floor looking for some way up to the bed. A sheet hung down to the floor as Josh could see Scott's foot hanging near it. Josh figured if he could at least scale the sheet and make it to Scott's foot, He could find a way up and into the bed. Following though with his plan, Josh could only suspect that it was his compassion for the young man that gave him the strength to make it to his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Josh wished his could cover his nose as he reached Scott's foot, trying to make his way to the hair on his ankle and up the leg. Relieved, Josh found himself on the back of his muscular tree trunk like legs as he stared across the landscape of Scott on the bed. He had changed out of his board shorts, wearing just his black spandex under armor underwear as it wrapped tightly around his magnificent butt as the man laid there, face in a pillow. \"I still can't really tell if he's asleep...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wished there was some way he could help the grieving young man, but for now he figured the only thing he could do was work his way up toward his face. But first there was a big obstacle as Josh soon found at the end of his leg, Scott's enormous bubble butt. Josh bit his lip as he decided the only sensible action was to make his way between his ass crack rather than trying to scale one of the massive cheeks.

Josh took a deep breath, feeling like if he's come this far he may as well go all the way. Going down Scott's neck, Josh made his way onto the bed and came right into plan view of Scott's vision. Josh looked at the huge teen's beautiful blue eyes but they seemed like they looked right past him. Josh frowned, it definitely seemed like Scott hand't noticed him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott?\" Josh asked, gingerly as the blue eyes went from looking past him, to staring right at him in sudden shock. Scott didn't have the energy to really move though as he continued to lay and look at Josh. \"Oh um I'm sorry I should have knocked or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Scott said softly, still not moving as Josh sat just inches away from his face. \"I feel bad you somehow came all this way to see me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to. I was worried about you.\" Josh admitted, feeling really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott gave a little smile. \"I just don't know why you'd go so far for someone you've only known a few days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because clearly you're a good person.\" Josh answered back. \"You said you gave everything to your girlfriend. It's passionate, and makes you a good person and a good boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear ran down Scott's eye for a moment. \"Not good enough, I guess. She was always really smart. I never knew why she stayed with a dummy like me.\" Scott started spilling his heart out. \"So I gave her everything I possibly could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet. That's not something to be sad about.\" Josh gave Scott a friendly smile. \"I wish I could ever find someone like that. She just didn't appreciate how hard you tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled again, this time a little wider. Josh blushed hard as he tried to keep the conversation going. \"Anyway, I just wanted to check on you. Tyler was really worried too, but he didn't want to barge in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I get it. So he sent you in quietly.\" Scott caught on surprisingly fast. \"Tyler's a really sweet dude too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you guys have in common.\" Josh blushed as they both were sweeter then people would think on the surface. \"But yeah... It's nice seeing you smile. We were worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, dude.\" Scott grinned. \"I'm okay. I just wanted to lay down alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Josh apologized as he stood up. \"Here I am ruining that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!\" Scott moved a hand to block Josh from leaving. \"I'm really glad you came. I have to say though, this whole time I've been talking you, I just can't stop thinking about how small you are. It's just different than talking to someone normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different in a good way?\" Josh asked as he sat back down as Scott retracted his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure. I just feel so big. Like if you were normal sized I'd feel weirder about showing a little emotion.\" Scott tired to explain. \"But also I just worrying I'm gonna like... breath too deep and choke on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't do that, silly!\" Josh laughed as Scott gave another toothy smile. \"But I guess I also like being this little makes it easier for me to talk to you too. Meeting you today at our normal heights was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't find the right word without describing how attractive Scott is and how much easier it is seeing him like this than at normal sizes. Scott heard Josh trail off and was curious however. \"Meeting me at normal hieght was what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just... you're so tall.\" Josh tried to play it off as Scott rose an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not even taller right now?\" Scott chuckled as he was literally a giant right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I guess I dunno. I'm more used to being tiny.\" Josh rubbed the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. I like being a giant compared to you. When I first met I'll admit I kind of liked you better like you are right now.\" Scott chuckled. \"Not that I don't like you at your normal size! You're so cute and short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott blushed as he bit his lip. \"Sorry! Uhh but yeah anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed, Scott was very cute when he flustered. \"Yeah, anyway. I'm glad you're looking a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a lot better. Thanks to you, Josh.\" Scott stopped. \"I mean boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah Josh is fine. Were friends and roommates now.\" Josh smiled as Scott relaxed a little. \"My giant roommate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah, dude!\" Scott smiled. \"You should be small like this all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Josh answered immediately without thinking. Scott smiled as he finally adjusted himself to laying on his side rather than on his stomach. Josh watched as he moved his massive body and settled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you didn't do that when I was on your back!\" Josh smiled jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you crawled on me?\" Scott rose an eyebrow. \"That must've taken you forever at your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that bad.\" Josh waved his hands. \"It was kind of fun actually! Like a big living landscape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna explore more?\" Scott asked casually. He truthfully wanted to just watch Josh crawl around on his massive body a little. \"I mean if you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I um...\" Josh wasn't sure how to react to the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay if you'd rather do something else. We could get Tyler in here and we could all relax.\" Scott asked, noticing Josh's sudden discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shifted a bit because he really did want to explore Scott's body, but if Tyler joined in he might have the chance to explore both men... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a moment and decided...</span></div></div>",

Josh watched, as Scott rolled now on his back, scooping Josh in the process and setting him now on his massive chest.

Scott continued to watched Josh as he started to walk around a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't feel you before, but now that I see you on me it kind of tickles!\" Scott chuckled a little, making his chest shake as Josh toppled over. Scott held his breath for a moment, as he tried to stay still so Josh could get back on his feet. \"Sorry, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay!\" Josh yelled up to the giant, now a great deal away from his face. Josh tired to see if he was heard, but he wasn't sure if Scott was listening that closely. Shrugging, Josh started me make his way to Scott's rippling abs, watching as the twitched a little as he walked across them occasionally touching them with his hands. \"Is he really that ticklish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Josh felt a gurgling rumble beneath his as he stood somewhere near Scott's stomach. Roaring and shaking with hunger, Josh felt like it was some sort of crazy earthquake. Scott watched as Josh fell to his hands from the tremor and moved his hand down as if he was going to try and catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude are you okay?\" Scott asked, as he saw Josh still laying on his abs. He was impressed a simple rumble of his stomach was enough to knock the man off his feet, but it did remind him just how tiny his new roommate and friend was. \"Sorry, I haven't eaten in awhile, I forgot I was hungry until you calmed me down, dude.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get you something to eat then!\" Josh yelled up at Scott who seemed to hear him this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in a bit.

Rubbing his neck for a second he decided to hold back any lecture he had for his head lifeguard as he knew he had more important things to worry about. \"Morning Ty... Good to see you're so full of energy...\" Josh said starting to smile eerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took a step back from his suddenly creepy boss. \"W-what's with the face little buddy?\" He asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just you have a newbie to train today. He's a real bright one so I hope you have a good time.\" Josh said happy he could put the bigger man in his place after that embarrassing noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slapped his hand on his chest and sighed. \"Oh good. That's all dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snickered to himself as he looked out and saw Scott walking toward them, with a young lady in a pink bikini holding on to his huge arm. \"Just in time Scott!\" Josh yelled out at the humongous man. \"I want you to meet Tyler. He's going to be instructing you in life guarding basics!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked up in front of Tyler and Josh and looked down at Tyler. \"Oh sweet, sup dude, I'm Scott.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's jaw dropped a little at the sight of such a huge man. \"I'm Tyler, good to meet you man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, looked down at his girlfriend. She had to be about 19 years old,  5'6\" and looked absolutely tiny compared Scott. She had long blonde hair and blue eyes and a lovely looking smile. She was thin, yet looked to be very well toned. She wore a very pretty pink bikini with little white frills on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Brianna.\" Scott said as he gave her a little nudge forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he looked at the attractive woman. \"Hello, I'm Josh. Scott was very excited about bringing you here! I was hoping maybe you'd accompany me on a small tour before we opened up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed a little looking down she replied softly, \"Thank you so much... this is all very kind of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned and looked at Tyler and Scott, \"You two work hard ok? Basic training shouldn't take too long. So I'll check back up on you guys in an hour and we can start CPR training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put his hand behind his head confused. \"I don't think it'll take that long... its just basics dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Scott then back to Tyler and smiled politely. \"You'll have a hour.\" Then turned away, motioning Brianna to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna quickly turned back to Scott as the huge man leaned over and gave his girlfriend a quick peck on the lips. Brianna turned away and went to follow Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started his tour, showing Brianna all the rides and pools. Walking by his office Josh proudly showed off the parks many awards. Impressed Brianna followed closely along side Josh as they talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh... I wanted to thank you so much for hiring my Scott.\" Brianna started off sweetly. \"He's a hard worker! Even if he seems uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" Josh said stopping and looking at the woman. \"I can tell he's going to be just fine here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help but worry a little though. I'm sorry for how he dressed yesterday. I was at class and well... he dressed himself.\" She said looking down a little embarrassed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine really. I've seen worse!\" Josh said smiling even though it wasn't entirely the truth. \"Where do you take classes?\" Josh asked curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just at the University here in town. You see Scott and I have been dating since high school and we moved here together.\" She said starting her story. \"But to afford living here I had to get a night job, and we had to fill out a bunch of applications for him to help pay for rent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head remembering just a few years ago doing the same while he was at school. \"This is his first job, correct?\" He asked forwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... he was always so into sports in high school that he never took the time to stop and have a job.\" She said looking down again. \"But he worked really hard in those sports and it payed off. He was captain for three different sports last year and well respected around the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped for a second, thinking about how athletes garnered \"respect\" in high school and he hated thinking Scott could have thrown his weight around forcefully. \"I remember some of the jocks getting me to respect them in high school, mostly through threatening to beat me up in the hall ways.\" He said looking down meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no its not what you think at all!\" She said looking seriously at Josh. \"Whenever someone tried to bully any of the smaller kids in the halls Scott would always go and stand up for them. He believed it didn't matter if you were a jock or a nerd, everyone deserved the same respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked Josh looked at Brianna and apologized. \"I'm so sorry! I had no idea he was so noble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. He might have not been as smart as a lot of the people he stood up for but he was so kind that everyone looked up to him as a leader of sorts.\"  She said looking back in the direction of the wave pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked back as well and realized how much time had gone by. \"You can enjoy the park for the rest of the day, feel free to ride any of the slides you'd like.\" He said happily. \"The park will be open soon, so make sure you get the rides you want quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much! I had no class today so you can bet I'll be enjoying your wonderful park to the fullest!\" She said starting to turn away from Josh. \"Promise me you'll look out for my Scott while he's here? He's already talked so much about you and how much he respects you too. So I know he'll be looking out for you.\" She said smiling and walking away to get a good spot in one of the lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Josh said smiling to himself as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the wave pool Josh saw Scott treading water swimming out to the back of the pool. Walking up next to Tyler he tapped his shoulder and greeted the tan hunk. \"How's he doing, Ty?\" Josh asked as they watched Scott reach the other end of the pool and start to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got crazy endurance, and he could save like three people at once... but trying to explain to him why you need to wait for people to go down a slide in intervals was one of the hardest things I've ever done, dude.\" Tyler said scratching his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, glad it wasn't too easy on him after all. Just then Scott emerged from the water, dripping wet. He rubbed his toned torso and shook off his arms as he walked up to the two men. \"How'd I do dudes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at his stopwatch and looked shocked at the time. \"Your time was incredible, dude! Nice lap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled as he looked down at Josh. \"I sure learned a lot boss! It's a lot to remember so maybe you can go over it with me again sometime if I forget something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled back, it wasn't normally something he'd do, but he remembered what he promised Brianna. \"That'd be fine Scott! We can go over whatever you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed as he grabbed a towel and started to wipe off his still dripping body. Josh turned and looked up at Tyler and addressed him. \"Could you bring him around out back and start having him watch the CPR video? I'll meet you guys there in a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded and motioned for Scott to follow him. Josh went around to his office to make sure Scott's paperwork was all set before heading to the break room. Finally satisfied with his work Josh decided to head over to the huge break room. Josh walked into the room to find...<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Josh decided to listen in as Tyler explained how to do chest compressions. He couldn't help but laugh a little quietly on the side as Tyler had to guide Scott's hands in the correct spot in the middle of the dummy's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like he'd seen enough Josh figured it was time to take one of the little elevators, designed to help him around the room, over to the kitchen table. As he rode over Josh heard as Tyler tried to tell Scott to do the compressions a little softer, since he was apparently shaking the whole table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally arrived at the table and stepped off the elevator as it zipped off. He started walking toward the dummy as he saw Scott was about to try more chest compressions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember dude, they have to be hard so they help circulate the heart, but you don't want to implode the person's chest either.\" Tyler said as Scott moved his hands into position above the dummy's chest. \"Remember how many you need to do in a minute?\" Tyler asked looked over at Scott as his eyes widened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm 60?\" Scott replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, remember it's 100. You have to almost do two compressions a second.\" Tyler said patting the huge man on his back. \"Alright go ahead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Scott started pressing down on the dummy's chest hard and swift and the table started to shake again. Josh started to lose his footing and fall toward the end of the table without having much time to react to the violent tremors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Josh fell off the side he managed to grab onto the edge of the table, barely clinging on. As the tremors continued Josh....</span></div></div>",

Wiping some sweat off his forehead Josh made his way toward Scott and Tyler as Tyler stepped forward next to the larger man to try and explain again how \"softer\" works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See dude, you're just shaking up the whole table, you'll break it along with all the dummy's ribs.\" Tyler said looking up at Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, I'm trying my best, but I don't know if I can go any softer than that.\" Scott said looking down at the dummy, hoping he never breaks someone's ribs when he gives them CPR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try practicing them slower and more deliberate for now so you can get the feel for doing it easier, Scott.\" Josh said as he walked up toward the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey boss! You saw me pressing too hard huh?\" Scott said looking down at his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, I nearly fell off the table with how much you shook the table!\" Josh said smiling at the gigantic man. \"Ty, you guys finished the video I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, we've just been practicing compressions for now. He got first steps pretty fast. Right dude?\" He said looking at Scott. \"What's the first thing you do when you suspect someone has a heart attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have someone call 911, give the person space, ask them if they're ok, and check for  breathing and a pulse.\" Scott said counting the steps on his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Scott!\" Josh said happily. He was actually surprised Scott got the memory portion down faster than the physical one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott blushed and rubbed the back of his neck. \"Thanks so much boss... Now I just gotta get this compression thing down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said let's practice slower for now.\" Josh said sitting down on the other side of the dummy and looking up at Scott from over the dummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued the practice as, slowly but surely, Scott got the hang of going a little softer and finally was able to do them fast enough to get enough compressions in a minute. Pleased, Josh turned to Tyler and asked him to grab the paper exam from one of the break room's storage closets. Retrieving the paper, Tyler set the test down in front of Scott after moving the dummy out of the way. Josh sat across from Scott near the top of the paper, and decided to observe Scott as he took the exam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nervously filled out the test, biting the pen he was given as he went along. Occasionally he'd look up nervously at Josh when he filled out an answer. Josh just tried to smile, hoping to relax the behemoth of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally done, Scott slowly turned the paper at his little boss. Tyler started to step forward to collect it but Josh stopped him. \"It's ok Ty, I got this. You can go make sure nobody's slacking off in the park ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at his little boss and gave a him a \"are you sure?\" kind of look as Josh nodded politely. \"You got it bud. Come grab me if you need me dude.\" He said as he started to leave the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood up and and started to walk across the test to the top of the page so he could read out everything from top to bottom. Knowing the questions by heart Josh merely had to look at the answers and add up the scores as he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty wasn't too hard on you was he?\" Josh asked looking up at Scott as the large man jumped thinking he was getting his grade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dude, he was great. He's really helpful and nice, glad I got to know someone here.\" Scott said stilling looking down at his paper, starting to sweat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Brianna told me you guys just moved here this semester, it'll be good to meet a few people around here and make new friends.\" Josh said smiling up at Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you guys are cool, maybe... we could chill sometime or something.\" Scott said turning away a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't bother you that I'm your boss?\" Josh said asking the huge man raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott moved his hands and started waving them in front of his chest. \"No! Yes? Uhhh...\" He tried to say nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only kidding Scott! You're a great guy I'd love to hang out with you sometime!\" Josh said happily at the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved Scott rested his hands and smiled. \"I was a little worried, sorry dude. Its just since moving here the only person I knew was Bri, and even she made some friends fast at her school. Not to mention she works nights... So usually I just work out and have nothing to do in the evenings until she comes home right before bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, thinking how interesting it'd be to hang out with Scott. He bet the giant man would be a hoot to watch tv or play video games with or even head out somewhere with and chill. Josh continued to look down at the paper though as the conversation went on, as Josh slowly added up the score it came out that Scott...</span></div></div>",

Josh knew well the passing score was a 60 and even then he liked for most of the guys to at least get above a 70 before certifying them. Josh looked up at Scott, who was anxiously fidgeting in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, you just barely failed... sorry to say that.\" Josh started as he looked up at Scott. Scott's expression changed fast and his face started to go a little pale as he swallowed hard. Josh figured it was about time to remind him that the test can be retaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget Scott, you can try again tomorrow.\" Josh said smiling at the gigantic man. Josh's words did little to brighten the young man up however as he continued to looking down with a disappointed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can help you study of course!\" Josh pipped up desperate to get Scott to cheer up. Scott looked down directly at Josh and a small smile came across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean it boss?\" He asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will!\" Josh said happily. \"You said you don't have anything to do after you work out and go home anyway right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right, would you come to my apartment after I work out then?\" Scott asked, still a little shaken by failing the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you live?\" Josh asked, standing up and move a bit forward to the massive teen. Josh tried to look up at his handsome face as it still hung a little low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott put a hand on his head on his head thinking for a second. \"I don't know my way around much yet, but it's like the west side of town. I have to take a bus. The gym is right around the corner from where I live though. It's a small gym named \"Pumping Iron\" if you know where that is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped to think for a second. He knew he lived on the other side of town, and he didn't want to wait around at the park for much longer than he'd have to just to wait for Scott to finish working out... Even then he didn't know Scott's exact address to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's on the other side of town from where I live...\" Josh started to say still in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just come to gym with me, then when I'm done working out we can just turn the corner and go to my apartment!\" Scott said, trying to come up with a solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned at the idea. The thought of sitting there in a gym for god knows how long while Scott worked out didn't really appeal to him. \"Think maybe you could just skip the gym tonight?\" Josh inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked down at his chest then turned and looked at his arms. \"Boss, I almost never skip a gym day! I guess if its that big a deal I could.\" He said scratching his head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt bad about the comment. I suppose it wasn't really that big of a deal, Josh was just making it into a big deal. \"It's fine, I'll wait at the gym with you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok cool dude.\" Scott said sitting up straighter. \"The only thing is they're not too keen on guests... So I'd need to keep you in my locker while I work out, then I'll grab you and we can head over to my apartment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Josh said confused. \"What do you mean \"keep me in your locker\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well dude, you'd have to stay small like you are now.\" Scott said plainly. \"A-as long as that fine with you?\" He added nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed. Now it really was a big deal. \"Is there any way I don't have to stay so small?\" Josh asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if I skipped my work out we could go right home...\" He said with a very sad tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed again.

Josh was glad to see Scott so happy, but he still wasn't particularly looking forward to spending who knows how long in a locker. Josh's expression must have given his thoughts away as Scott looked back down at the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry boss I won't take too long later. I promise! Besides we'll have a lot of studying to do!\" Scott added happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at the comment, glad to see that Scott wasn't planning on leaving him in the locker forever. Until then, he knew there was still work to be done today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, since you didn't pass the exam I want to put you under supervision of one of my other lifeguards for the rest of the day. You can learn a thing or two I'm sure.\" Josh said as Scott listened to his boss intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking probably Tyler, since you met him earlier.\" Josh said as he tried to remember where Tyler was stationed right now. \"He should be working the front post on the wave pool. So I want you to go there and tell him that he'll be supervising you for the rest of the day, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott shook his head and thanked his boss one more time before leaving out the back door. Josh took a deep breath. Knowing his day was far from over. He turned and left toward the park and figured he could get a little work done in his office until he left with Scott later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at his desk Josh looked over at the clock. Noticing he still had a few hours before closing he pulled out some paper work and started getting some of it done. As he sifted through some filed he heard a knock at his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Josh yelled at the door, barely looking away from his papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a bad time?\" A woman's voice chimed out across the room. Josh looked up to see it was Scott's girl friend, Brianna. Still wearing her pink bikini she appeared to be still a little wet from her day at the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry.\" Josh said as he set down his papers as he looked across the room at the attractive blonde. \"How was your day at the park Brianna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she walked across the room toward Josh's desk. \"It was wonderful! You really have an amazing place here. But that's not why I am here. I haven't seen Scott at all since this morning, I was just wondering how he did?\" The woman asked with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down for a second before he refocused his attention on Brianna's face. \"Practically, he did fantastic. As far and any written exercises go though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see...\" She said looking down. \"Did he fail something? Is he going to lose his job?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did fail a written exam but its not going to cost him his job so no worries!\" Josh said looking at the woman and smiling. \"I promised him to help him study for the retake tomorrow. So I'll be helping him out tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up with a bright smile. \"That's wonderful for you to do! He must be so happy you're going to study with him!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seemed like it!\" Josh said back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but if it's at our apartment I won't be there. I would have loved to make you some dinner or something for your trouble!\" She said suddenly with an earnest look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I heard you work nights. Don't worry about us! We'll figure something out.\" Josh said still smiling. He couldn't help but think what Scott normally does for food, but he imagined whatever Brianna makes would probably be better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to run home and get ready for work! If I have time I'll whip something up and put it in the fridge for you guys to have. Otherwise, I promise to make it up to some how!\" She said still looking determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have time don't worry about it! Just worry about getting to work!\" Josh said happily, hoping maybe she had time to make a little something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna turned and left, thanking Josh a few times as she made her way out. Josh sat back down at his desk and got back to his paper work. A few hours went by and it was starting to be closing time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did his usual sweep of the park as people left, and he locked up the area. Moving his way to the break room, he knew Scott would be waiting there for him. Josh opened the door to the huge room and saw the colossal teen standing out in the room before him. Calling out to him as loud as he could, Scott eventually noticed his tiny boss on the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go, boss?\" Scott asked the little man as he lowered his hand for him to climb on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh climbed up on the closest massive finger near him and shook his head, Scott, squinted as he could barely see his little boss's head move. Scott slowly inched Josh into the middle of his hand, and closed his palm gingerly around the little man. Josh squeaked in fear of being crushed as the masses of flesh seemed to be crashing all around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott kept his hand level as he left the building and made his way to the bus stop. Nobody dared ask the huge shirtless teen what he was clutching so carefully in his hand. Finally, the pair made it to the stop right in front of the gym. Scott made his way in, nodding to the entrance staff as he made his way toward the locker rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was mostly empty, aside from a few guys changing. Scott hurried toward his locker and undid the lock with his free hand. He opened it up and leaned down to let his boss go on a little shelf near the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slide out of the massive man's hand finally relieved to be free of that prison. He looked up at Scott, who's massive frame couldn't even be entirely seen from his vantage point. He watched as Scott quickly changed into a pair of old gym shorts and a tight white spandex shirt that he had sitting in the locker. Josh could help but blush as Scott stood up straight and he had a view of his magnificent abs barely concealed behind the tight shirt. Scott waved good bye and shut the locker closed, and with a click as the lock kept it secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down in the darkness. Looking around he couldn't see anything, all he could do was smell. The scent of metal and sweat over powered his senses as he covered his nose and laid down. All he could do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an hour or so the door started to open. Josh shaded his eyes as light poured in and he saw...      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Josh's eyes started to adjust to the new level of light he looked out into the world that opened before him. He saw mostly the white of Scott's tee shirt, but next to him there was another color, red. The red shirted giant started leaning down to look in the locker. Josh started stepping back as far as he could into the locker, afraid of why Scott brought a new giant to his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, dude! Scott wasn't lying!\" Josh heard the familiar tone speak softly into the locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler?\" Josh asked now finally seeing Tyler's huge face poke into the locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude! Scott said you were gonna help him study, then he told me he stashed you in his locker!\" Tyler said quietly to his tiny boss. \"He asked me if I wanted to come help out and hang out with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled for a second, it was good he'd have Tyler with him. He knew Tyler would look after him. But still now he had to deal with two giants for the rest of the evening instead of just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler retreated his head and stood up straight next to Scott's massive frame. \"I don't see why he had to stay shrunk though, dude.\" Tyler said looking up at Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well man you know how they are about guests...\" Scott said looking down at Tyler. \"Besides I thought it was easier this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More fun too!\" Tyler said smirking down at his little boss. \"The boss sure does love being little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed at the comment. He couldn't help but feel embarrassed that he's that obvious to literally everyone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway dude, wanna carry my bag for me? I just wanna make sure I carry Josh fine.\" Scott said handing his huge gym bag to Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing man.\" Tyler said grabbing the bag along with his own as Scott bent over and reached his hand slowly into the locker. He laid his hand down flat, like before Josh scaled the closest massive finger near him and he slide cautiously into the middle of the gigantic teen's palm. Scott slowly lifted his hand out of the locker and closed it gently around his little boss. With his free hand Scott redid the lock on his locker and turned to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness and sweat were the only company Josh had as he slipped and slid around in the sweat of Scott's hand as he could hear Scott's and Tyler's muffled voices as they moved. After only a few minutes Josh heard doors opening and closing, the sound of feet going up stairs, and finally light poured into Josh's eyes as Scott opened his palm. Looking around Josh realized he was in a small dining/living room with a table on one side of the room near the entrance to a kitchen, and on the other side of the room was a couch and television. Josh realized that Scott was lowering his hand down to the table, and Josh started to climb his way down off the giant hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna change out of this real quick, ok dude?\" Scott said looking down at his sweaty spandex shirt then down at his little boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too man!\" Tyler said already trying to pull off his red spandex shirt. \"Where's your bathroom dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked out of the room down a hallway and motioned to a room on his right, as he walked further down the hall to his bedroom. Tyler followed after him, clicking on the light as he went in. Josh sat down  on the wooden floor that was the table, taking in his surroundings a little more as he tried to wipe Scott's sweat off his arms and legs. After finally drying himself off a bit the door to the bathroom swung open as Tyler came sauntering out. He wore a pair of loose looking red gym shorts and a black pair of socks. He didn't bother putting on a shirt as he still seemed hot as his body glistened with sweat between is huge pecs all down on his sculpted 6 pack. He did however wear a red baseball cap backwards, showing off some of his longish brown hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler walked over to the table Josh was at and took a seat in front of Josh looming over him with a big smile. Josh blushed as he looked up at Tyler's magnificent body. He took his attention away from Tyler as he heard Scott's bedroom door open as Scott stepped out of the room. He was wearing a pair of white plaid shorts, loosely falling slightly off his hips. He was also wearing a pair of black socks, but he also had a white stringer tank top on, barely hiding his enormous sweaty torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude why even bother wearing a shirt?\" Tyler said to Scott as he walked out into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I figured it was better than nothing, I just didn't wanna be rude dude.\" Scott said unsure how to react.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude we don't care! We're around shirtless dudes all day anyway!\" Tyler said winking at his little boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott tossed off the string of a tee shirt as he walked past the table toward the kitchen. \"Yeah true, it's hot in here anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the colossal teen walked into the kitchen, in awe of his amazing physique as well as his gigantic stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey,\" Scott's voice came from the kitchen. \"Bri left a note, looks like she...\"    </span></div></div>",

Its all home made and it's really awesome!\" Scott said, wandering back out toward the table with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great dude!\" Tyler says as he gives his stomach a good slap. \"I'm starved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he watched Tyler smack his sweaty abs. He couldn't help but find the action to be both intimidating, but also very attractive. Snapping back to reality though he turned to Scott and spoke. \"That sounds great, Scott! We'll all have to thank Bri sometime for feeding us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott rubbed the back of his neck and blushed slightly. \"Well knowing her, she's just glad you guys are here to help me. Cooking for you guys was probably just her way of being grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, knowing that was the truth, but even so he was happy to help Scott regardless. \"Well I gotta throw it in the oven, Bri's instructions say to let it cook for like 20 minutes.\" Scott says as he walks back into the kitchen. Josh turned back to look at Tyler, who watched Scott walk back off into the kitchen. Suddenly, the huge man stood up and followed him through the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to sit down and look around the room. Unsure why Tyler left, he thought maybe he just went to help put it in the oven. Josh chuckled to himself, wondering if Tyler was worried that Scott didn't know how to work and oven. As Josh continued to imagine Scott scratching his head over how to turn on an oven, Tyler walked back into the room holding two glasses. One had some sort of neon blue liquid and the other appeared to be just water with a spoon in it. Tyler sat back down in front of Josh and set the cups down and took a drink from the blue liquid with a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was thirsty.\" Tyler says as he was curious to Josh's stares. Josh quickly looked away, embarrassed he was caught staring. Tyler laughed at the little man as Scott walked into the room with a drink of his own. Taking a seat at the other end of the table the ground shook a little as he planted his butt. Josh was glad he was sitting as the tremor easily would have knocked him off his feet. It really made Josh appreciate just how massive Scott was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we figured,\" Tyler started looking down at Josh. \"We could start studying while the food cooked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and Tyler thought I could use a little... encouragement.\" Scott said looking over at the glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at the glass, not sure if he liked the use of the word \"encouragement\". \"How so...? Josh asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled and took the spoon out of the water and quickly scooped up Josh before he could protest. He proceeded to lean the spoon over the water, holding it from tipping over into the glass. \"W-what's going on?\" Josh asked nervously as his surroundings changed so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought it would be fun if we played a game, dude. If Scott get's five questions wrong, you get to go for a swim!\" Tyler said as he slowly tipped the spoon closer to falling into the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned and looked at Scott who sort of just shrugged. \"Sorry dude, it was Tyler's idea. Maybe it'll help. I don't want you to get dunked dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I get a say in this?\" Josh said turning back to Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Tyler said simply. \"Alright let's get started!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler then started to question Scott, mostly easy questions which Scott knew the answers to. As a few minutes went by Tyler started to ask harder and harder questions. Scott started to slip up and gradually one by one get questions wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, one more question!\" Tyler announced. \"And remember! Get it wrong and our little friend goes for a swim!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed hard as he looked over the end of the spoon. All he saw was an ocean of water, with seemingly no bottom. He wasn't worried about swimming in it, it wasn't like he was a weak swimmer. Mostly he just didn't want to get wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Tyler said with a smile. \"How many compressions do you need to perform in a minute while doing CPR?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe his luck. This was the question that Tyler asked Scott earlier today! He got in wrong then, but surely he learned from his mistake and knew it now! Josh confidently looked over at Scott who had his eyes closed in thought. Finally, he opened his eyes and gave his answer. \"You need to do...\"</span></div></div>",

Josh looked up as he saw the handle of the spoon hanging out past the rim of the cup. As Josh swam over to the spoon to hold on to he listened to Tyler and Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why say 120 dude?\" Tyler asked as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I remember you saying something about two compressions per second or something.\" Scott responded looking over at the cup. \"Is Josh ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yeah, I said ALMOST two compressions per second. The right answer was 100 by the way, dude.\" Tyler looked down at the cup, seeing Josh make it to the spoon and latching on to it. \"He's fine, come on let's grab some food I'm starved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned away from the table and walked off into the kitchen.

Quietly he spoke to his tiny boss. \"Don't worry, I'll move you over to my side of the table so he won't mess with you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked back over to where his seat and drink was and placed Josh's cup next to his own. Josh watched as the massive man gave him a thumbs up. \"You can totally just climb out on your own right? Tyler would get all pissed if I just let you out. Good luck dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned and left to the kitchen, leaving Josh in the cup wishing he had just let him out. \"Nothing can be easy can it...\" Josh said as he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring he'd better start climbing, Josh pressed his hands against the semi-slick surface and some how managed to start climbing up. Taking his time he slowly made it up the massive utensil until he made it up all the way to the tip of the handle. Josh sat down at the top, trying to take in some deep breaths after all the work he just had to do. However, as he looked around it was an interesting view. He was much higher up than he was before so he could see the room a bit more clearly. Just massive pictures and posters on the walls, which easily could be miles and miles long compared to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking in the scenery, Josh finally looked down. Which was a bit of a mistake. The tip of the spoon was almost directly above Scott's drink. Josh wasn't sure what the drink in question was. It was dark and brown, almost milky looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A protein shake?\" Josh said aloud a little more curious. Either way Josh tried to scoot away from the edge of the spoon, not wanting to fall in the liquid regardless of what it was.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the other edge he saw he could slide his way down off the the spoon and land gently on the table.

Josh stumbled backwards near the edge of the spoon before falling backwards through the air. Josh screamed as he tried to turn himself around. With a splash, Josh finally landed. Swimming around in a murky goop he tried to find some air as he struggled about in the thick liquid. Finally breaking the surface, Josh looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell in his protein shake!\" Josh yelled as the thick milky goop started to pull him under. Josh struggled trying to stay at the surface, but the heavy liquid made the task very difficult. Hoping that Tyler and Scott would return soon, he flailed his arms around every chance he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler walked back into the room holding a plate full of mac and cheese. Setting the plate down on the table he already started digging in before Scott could even walk into the room. He did however look over and notice the glass Josh was in was moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Scott!\" Tyler yelled with a full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sauntered into the room with his own plate of mac and cheese and looked over at Tyler. \"What's up?\" He replied as he set down his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you moved Josh.\" Tyler said as he shoved another fork full of food in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Scott said as he swallowed his own food. \"Well you always pick on him. Thought I'd bring him over here so you'd leave him be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Tyler says again with a full mouth. \"He loves it when I pick on him! Just ask him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looks down at the glass, and carefully looks by the spoon. \"Uhh well he's not in the cup anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood up and walked over next to Tyler and looked at the glass. Picking it up he examined it closely. \"Well where did he go?\" He said looking at the bottom of the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him to climb out, I wasn't sure if he could actually do it or not though.\" Scott says as he starts looking around for Josh on the table. Tyler meanwhile shrugged, and lifted the glass to his lips and chugged the water down in a few gulps. \"Dude! What if Josh was still in there?\" Scott says looking surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he'd be joining some of the mac and cheese I just ate.\" Tyler says jokingly. \"Besides he wasn't in there so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still though...\" Scott says as he continues his search along the table. \"Where could he have gone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler briefly looked at the floor, \"Doubt he would have jumped down to the floor. Being that small he'd know that's a bad idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stands and thinks for a second before turning around to let his back face Scott. \"Dude, check out my ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what the hell?\" Scott says as he looks away. \"Why you shoving your ass at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he fell on one of our seats? We could have sat on him.\" Tyler says still looking away from Scott. \"Well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott put his hand on Tyler's ass and brushed it along the smooth surface of the red gym shorts. \"I don't see or feel anything dude. What about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stands up and turns around, Tyler checks his butt too for any tiny survivors but also to no avail. \"Nah dude, you're good too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler starts to look out into the room. He frowns as he looks down on the floor. \"Maybe he did end up on the floor dude. We should check.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sighs as he rubs his gut. He was hungry and wanted to get his protein. Looking down he grabs his shake and lifts it up to his enormous face. \"Alright, just let me chug my shake first dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead dude.\" Tyler says as he tip toes out past Scott, carefully looking before he takes any steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott continues to lift the shake slowly to his face, just as he opens his mouth though Tyler interrupts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude...\"   </span></div></div>",

Barely bale to stay afloat in the thick liquid Josh couldn't do much more than flail and splash around weakly as the murky sea started to tilt into the dark cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the glass tipped even faster, as Josh started to drop screaming into Scott's awaiting mouth. Helplessly, he was swept onto the gigantic tongue on his new employee as the torrent of protein shake started to drain down Scott's massive throat. Josh tried as hard as he could to swim against the current, but the liquid was just flowing too fast as he was transported to the back of the throat with ease. With one last ditch effort, Josh reached for the huge uvula as it swayed tauntingly above Josh's final drop. However it was just too high out of Josh's reach as it almost waved good bye to Josh as he was sloshed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mess of liquid Josh was forced to hold his breath as he followed the flow down Scott's esophagus. Unable to see anything in the pitch black darkness mixed with nothing but cold liquid All Josh could do was wait in terror as he was swiftly transported down with the drink. Just before succumbing to taking a breath, Josh felt a small amount of relief as he was finally deposited into the stomach. Falling unceremoniously with a splat, Josh found himself back in the same liquid he's been trapped in the whole time, however this time things were a little more dire as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreading the thick liquid Josh found a noodle of sorts he could float on as he took in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's absolutely enormous in here!\" Josh couldn't help but exclaim out loud. Josh knew Scott was massive, but he never would have expected his insides would be so ungodly huge! Josh continued to watch in awe as the walls of the massive stomach churned and contracted rhythmically every couple of seconds. As the stomach continued to shift about Josh snapped back to reality. \"I have to get out of here! Scott! Tyler! HELP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Glugglgluggglugg* Scott just finished draining the rest of his shake, as he set the empty cup down on the table and wiped his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There let's look for Josh now dude.\" Scott says with a smile, glad he got a chance to drink his shake.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked as he walked over next to Scott and gave his stomach a couple pats. \"Nice dude, that was pretty fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott rubbed the back of his neck, unsure how to react. \"Thanks dude. I feel a lot better now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet dude,\" Tyler says as he tip toes back into the room carefully looking at the floor. \"Now watch your step big fella.\" He adds playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled as he watched the floor carefully before taking any steps. The ground shook each time he laid a foot down much to Tyler's amusement. Scott blushed, hoping his foot steps wasn't going to scare off his tiny boss. The gigantic teen just wanted to find the little man as soon as possible so they could get back to studying, after all he wanted to pass that exam tomorrow to make Josh proud! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a few minutes, the pair returned to their seats. Looking down and disappointed Scott hoped his little boss would show himself soon. Scott lifted his fork and scooped up a fairly large amount of mac and cheese to shove in his mouth as his mind raced over where Josh could be hiding. He swallowed the food down, completely unaware that the food he just ate will find Josh in just a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find him dude.\" Tyler said looking over at his disheveled friend. \"Don't worry, I bet he's just messing with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled, hoping that Tyler was right. \"Yeah he's missing out on this awesome mac and cheese right now!\" He said shoving another bite in his mouth then proceeding to swallow the food once more. Putting a hand on his stomach he started to rub it and look around the room. \"Sooooo good! He's missing out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed at Scott's new found enthusiasm and decided to join in on the taunting. As the two continued to joke and taunt Josh little did they know the little man did in fact get to have some of that delicious meal, but unfortunately for him he also got to be a part of it.     </span></div></div>",

Setting the cup down he bent over and looked even closer to see his tiny boss nearly drowning in the thick liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude he's in here!\" Scott said pointing at his shake. Tyler shook his head and walked over next to the enormous teen and grabbed the spoon from out of the now empty glass of water and quickly scooped the terrified tiny man out of the protein shake. Setting the spoon down on the table, Tyler watched as his tiny boss struggled his way out of the mess and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saved your life boss!\" Tyler said staring down at his tiny friend with a satisfied grin on his face. Meanwhile, Scott looked away in embarrassment as he was the thing Tyler just saved Josh from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook off the gross liquid from his body and did his best to clean it off his face before looking at the pair of men who almost got him killed. Josh couldn't help but shake his head at Tyler's comment, knowing he was practically the reason he ended up in Scott's drink in the first place, but he knew there was no fighting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ty, I knew I could count on you guys to figure it out.\" Josh said smiling at the two of them. Scott still hung his head in shame. Upset he almost drank his new boss after all the kindness he's shown him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, it's my fault you ended up in there. I'm sorry.\" Scott said still looking away from Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the sad looking man, hoping he could convince him it wasn't actually his fault. \"Scott, you were just trying to help and get me away from that jerk, Tyler. I fell in by accident, so it's not your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reared back at the comment of calling him a jerk, much to Scott's amusement. Josh and Scott laughed as Tyler angrily stood there saying he should have just let Scott drink him after all. After finishing his fit, Tyler shuffled back to his seat and sat hard in his chair, shoveling a mass of mac and cheese in his mouth before swallowing the bite whole. Josh sighed as he watched the grown man pout, before he found a massive cheesy noodle placed next to him. Turning around he saw Scott, smiling and retracting his fork from where he just offered Josh some of his meal. Nodding in thanks, Josh turned to the noodle and gave the warm cheesy surface a huge bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished their food, the trio cleaned up the mess and made sure to put all the dishes away in the dishwasher. Josh laughed as Scott mentioned that Bri would make him sleep on the couch if she found out he left a mess for her to clean up. Josh watched as the two titans did all of the work, after all what help would a tiny man like Josh had been able to offer anyway? Finally, Josh watched as Tyler sulked back into the dining room and pulled out the chair before seating himself back the the table. Resting his shoulder on the back of the chair and leaning back a little, he stretched out his muscular frame before looking toward Josh, giving him a quick \"Sup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you're not a jerk.\" Josh said finally at the massive stud.  Tyler leaned forward looking a little more carefully at the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" He asked putting a hand behind his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... I like it when you pick on me?\" Josh said, remembering Tyler shouting about that moments after he started drowning in protein shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached across the table and pinched Josh carefully between his fingers before transporting him in front of his face. Josh found himself, bewildered as he was face to face with Tyler's smirking mouth before it suddenly opened, releasing a long and wet sounding burp. Josh quickly covered his nose and started waving his arms in front of him, helping little to none in the effort to disperse the onslaught of gas. Finished with his burp, Tyler lowered Josh onto his chest and released him on his right pec. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you do.\" Tyler said finally as he leaned back in his chair and watched his tiny boss gasp for air on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Scott re-entered the room as he hung up a phone. \"That was Bri, sounds like she's going to be spending the night at a friend's studying for a test she has tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so it's just us guys tonight, huh?\" Tyler said as he watched Josh start to stand up on his chest. Tyler quickly flexed and relaxed the muscle, causing Josh to tumble back over on his back, much to Tyler's amusement. \"So what's the plan big fella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott scratched his head, unaware Josh was busy struggling on Tyler's pec across the room. \"Well we could study some more, I guess.\" He said finally, coming over and taking a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can play some games.\" Tyler said looking down at Josh once more. Josh's head spun as he stood up and heard Tyler's words. Unsure if he liked his use of the word \"games\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of games, dude?\" Scott asked curiously, not really wanting to study more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled and replied. \"I like to call it the \"Bod-stacle\" course. We take our little friend here, and let him run an obstacle course... on our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed at the name, but was intrigued none the less. Looking over at Josh however, he could see the little man was less than amused. \"Maybe playing the game will cheer him up?\" Scott thought to himself as he made his choice...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How would this bod-stacle course work, dude?\" Scott asked curiously shifting forward in his chair. Josh face palmed as Tyler got a huge grin across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, dude!\" Tyler said leaning forward and causing Josh to tumble over slightly on his chest. \"We could hide some flag on our bodies for our little friend to find!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached down and caught Josh in his hand as he stood up. After placing Josh on the table, Tyler strode past him to stand next to Scott. Josh watched as Scott stood up and Tyler put his arm around him, turning him away from Josh. The two whispered to each other for a few minutes and Josh sighed as he could do little more than stare at their pair of perfect bubble butts. Sighing, Josh sat down and crossed his arms just in time for Scott to walk by back into the kitchen and flash Josh a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler walked back over in front of Josh, looming over him with his chiseled body with a goofy grin on his face. Josh started to sweat as the giant man continued to stare at him with \"that look\". Finally, Scott reappeared at the table with a pair of scissors, a red sheet of construction paper, and some tape. Tyler smirked as he gave Scott a nod. Scott began cutting out tiny squares, as small as he could make them in a little pile on the table. Meanwhile, Tyler walked way from the table, grabbing the empty glass of water on his way. Turning down the hall, the massive stud disappeared into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, what is he planning?\" Josh asked as quickly as he could to the giant man beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret, dude. Besides you'll see soon enough! It'll be fun!\" Scott said with a smile as he continued to cut out teeny tiny red squares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed to himself. He supposed there was no trouble in having a little fun after all. What was the worst that Tyler would have planned anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Tyler reemerged from the bathroom holding a full cup of water as well as some floss and a box of bandages. Still smiling, he set his supplies down on the table and looked over at Scott. \"I'm all set dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright man let's get you set up.\" Scott said as he set down the scissors and picked up as many little red squares as he could, as well as the tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\" Tyler said as he left the room to go back into the kitchen before quickly reappearing with a red plastic cup. \"No peeking!\" He said as he flipped the cup and trapped Josh underneath. Josh jumped as the cup came crashing down around him. He didn't even have time to react before he was trapped in this red prison! As far as his eyes could see all he see was the red plastic of the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, Scott removed the cup and allowed Josh to see once more. Without a word, Scott lowered his hand and motioned to Josh to climb aboard. Figuring he didn't have much of a choice, Josh scaled the massive hand and looked out into the room as Scott turned to take him away from the table. On the ground Josh looked in amazement to see Tyler laying there, his muscles glistened the the light wet from the water he got from the bathroom. Not only that be he had strings sticking out from under his arm pits as well as a string sticking out of his mouth. Across his chest there was a string taped down and between his pecs on the string Josh could already see a little red square. Finally, Josh could see turned over bandages with the sticky part facing up littered across Tyler enormous body. Scott leaned down and slid Josh off his hand, onto Tyler's wet abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude, he's got seven flags hidden away on his body! After you collect the first six he'll have to change positions for you to find the last one. If you get stuck to a band-aide or slip off the body you'll be penalized!\" Scott said as he looked down at Josh on Tyler's motionless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penalized?\" Josh asked nervously as he looked up at Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dude, you'll be fine. Ready? Go!\" Scott called out suddenly as Josh started to race forward already slipping a little on the wetness of Tyler's abs. Regaining his balance Josh trekked forward, making it to the first place he guessed a flag would be. Reaching Tyler's navel, Josh looked down into the dank looking cave as he saw something red hidden away at the bottom. Jumping down, Josh retrieved the flag and shook his head at the simplicity of the game so far. Although looking up, he realized now he had to climb out. Little by little however, the tiny man did manage to climb out of the massive jock's belly button, working his way to find the next flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a second, Josh remembered that there was a flag between Tyler's pecs like a trapeze. Also there were strings coming from both his arm pits as well as his mouth. Counting, Josh came to the number 5. There had to be a flag elsewhere that he could reach that he wasn't thinking of. Josh shook his head as he worked his way toward Tyler's mountainous pecs. Figuring he can worry about the 6th flag later. While lost in thought, Josh nearly slipped on a slick portion of Tyler's upper abdomen and nearly got stuck to one of the many giant bandages. Wiping the sweat from his brow he figured he should be a little more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking his way quickly to the chest Josh...            </span></div></div>",

With a deep breath, Josh grabbed a hold of the string and started to shimmy his way across to reach the flag. Easily grabbing it and shimmying his way back across, Josh dismounted the string with a proud look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! I was hoping he would've balanced his way across like a circus guy!\" Scott called as he watched Josh make his way off the string and looking toward one of Tyler's armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you he wouldn't, dude. Why would he?\" Tyler mumbled as he watched Josh scurry up neat his right armpit. With a smile, Tyler moved his hands to rest them behind his head and exposing his sweaty armpits for Josh to go in. \"Dunno if you wanna go in there, dude! You know I just worked out right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh covered his nose with a disgusted expression. The smell that suddenly poured out from Tyler's armpit seemed completely unbearable. Josh folded his arms and shook his head. Even though he clearly could see flag plastered to Tyler's sweaty hair, he flat out refused to make the trip into the sweaty mess of hair. \"I'm not going in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad, dude.\" Tyler said with an evil grin. \"We forgot to mention, if you don't get all the flags you have to spend the night somewhere on my body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rose and eyebrow, knowing Tyler this was something he'd absolutely impose upon him against his will. Looking up at Scott though, Josh couldn't believe the thoughtful young teen didn't speak up about this. \"Judging by how disgusted you are with my pits, guess that's where you'll spend the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried his best to stare at Scott, hoping the huge jock would come to his rescue. A few seconds passed and Josh gave in, he knew there was no saving him. Taking a step forward and plugging his nose as hard as he could, Josh entered Tyler's sweaty pit. Tyler laid his head back with a smirk as he felt the little man decide to continue the game. Eye's watering, Josh held his breath and tried to push aside the gigantic hairs. Easily out scaling him, they made it very difficult to get to the other side of the armpit despite it not looking like much of a trek. Finally, Josh had to breath in the noxious fumes by the time he reached the flag. With a chesty cough, Josh tried to make a beeline for it down the sweaty slope and out of the pit. Just as Josh made it outside, Tyler closed the sweaty prison behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Looks like he just made it!\" Scott called down to Tyler as Josh looked up with a shocked expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just made it? You were going to close me in there?!\" Josh yelled at Tyler angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were on a timer, dude.\" Tyler said pointing a finger up at Scott who Josh just noticed was holding a stop watch. Josh sighed, now knowing the other armpit would in fact be timed as well. Sitting down, Josh finally realized how tired he's actually gotten from all this running around. \"No breaks, bud!\" Tyler's voice boomed out loudly. \"Hurry up and go find another flag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood up, angrily. It was bad enough he was being forced into this and threatened with a sweaty prison if he lost, but now he can't even rest his feet? Sighing deeply once more Josh decided to just walk casually toward...   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly making his way up Tyler's shoulder and toward his neck, Josh tried to make the trip last a bit as he wanted to catch his breath at least a little. Figuring after all it didn't matter how fast or slow he traveled anyway since it all probably looked pretty minuscule and slow to the two giants observing him. Looking up at Scott as he moseyed up the side of Tyler's neck, he saw the man start to shift his legs slightly as he stood tall over Tyler looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's getting bored.\" Josh hoped to himself as he continued his calm walk, finally reaching Tyler's massive chin. Moving forward however, Josh reached Tyler's closed lips and looked over at a piece of floss hanging out the side. Putting his hands on his hips and sighing, Josh figured he'd get this show on the road. \"So how's <i>this</i> supposed to work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's lips curled into a smile as he opened his mouth up and letting his tongue out just before touching Josh with the behemoth muscle. Josh frowned as he looked from Tyler's cavernous mouth up to Scott, who looked like he just got jerked awake from the lack of excitement. Looking down to see where Josh was, Scott finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy dude, just climb down on the string and grab the flag!\" Scott said eagerly as he leaned down slightly to get a better view. Josh rose an eyebrow as he looked over at the string. It didn't seem safe, but at the same time he knew he didn't really have a choice as he approached the side of Tyler's mouth and had the string at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I at least get a harness or something?\" Josh asked hopefully as he peeked down into Tyler's seemingly endlessly dark mouth before turning his head back up to Scott who looked a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh we didn't plan for that... So I guess not?\" Scott said somewhat apologetically as Josh sighed once more as he grabbed a hold of the floss. Looping the string around his palms, Josh started to shimmy his way down into Tyler's mouth. Pressing his feet against the sticky surface of Tyler's tongue, Josh tried his best to slide down the wet surface as safely as possible. Continuing down the string as carefully as possible Josh noticed as the light in the cavern suddenly vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just closed his mouth, Tyler smiled as he looked up at Scott's shocked expression. \"Dude, what did you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply rose and lowered his eyebrows, not wanting to talk while he had his tiny friend shimmying his way down into his mouth. In truth he just wanted to torture his little buddy a bit but he figured he could write it off as \"making it more challenging\" later. Relaxing a little Tyler stretched out his legs and groaned slightly as he went back to keeping his head still. Not being able to really feel anything, he figured Josh was safe for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending deeper into the darkness, Josh kept his grip on the string tight until finally he felt his feet miss the rope and touch something else. Reaching down Josh tore a little square off of the bottom of the string and held it to his face happily. Glad to finally have the flag, Josh had an idea. He didn't come this far down only to get tired and fall. Taking the bottom of the string, Josh quickly tied it around his waist for safety. Just as he finished the knot, the whole cavern started to quake suddenly as Josh nearly dropped the flag in surprise. Regaining his hold, Josh looked up wondering what was going on outside of the dark abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Scott exclaimed as he stopped tapping his gigantic foot on the ground. Tyler shot him a look and tried to wave his hand to indicate it was alright. Trying to keep his head still though, Tyler knew it was probably hard enough on Josh in there, he didn't need any random quakes messing him up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Tyler laid still with his eyes closed when...             </span></div></div>",

Josh looked over at Tyler's face, his eye's closed and looking very peaceful. Meanwhile, Josh looked over to Scott who was staring down at a cell phone, looking completely bored. Tucking the flag away silently, Josh started to make his way away from Tyler's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't let me quit this game...\" Josh thought to himself as he slid down Tyler's neck. \"But I might be able to take advantage of their boredom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping his way carefully to Tyler's other, still open arm pit, Josh held his breath as he snuck his way carefully into the forest of stinky hairs. Easily, Josh worked his way through to the flag, retrieving it with much less danger than the other sweaty pit. Another flag behind him, Josh started to think where the final flag on this side of Tyler's body could be. Walking his way slowly over onto Tyler's left pec, Josh looked down the massive landscape of Tyler's nearly asleep body. He couldn't help but stop and stare in awe for awhile while he thought. Looking all the way down Tyler's hilly abs, to his red athletic shorts, to his bare feet. For Josh, the feet might as well have been several football fields away in length. However, with a little thought, Josh started to figure that's where the last flag would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stretched his legs for a second as he started to work his way down Tyler's round pec. Sliding his way down between Tyler's abs, Josh worked his way down to the naval, where his long journey all started earlier. Wiping a little sweat from his forehead, Josh made his way past the naval before looking backwards. Tyler's face wasn't visible anymore at this point, but Josh nearly jumped as he saw Scott, now knelt down, staring at him. Josh watched as Scott, put a finger on his lips to indicate not to talk, before he sat down as gently as he could. Josh nodded his head in understanding before Scott took his hand and pointed down to his foot, as well as turning his body slightly to point to his ass. Josh made a sour face, a little disappointed his suspicions were true, but none the lass made his way up and on Tyler's waistband to his shorts. Josh felt Scott watching as he trecked his way down the leg before looking up at Tyler's foot as it pointed straight up. On the tip of his right right toe, a small flag laid fixed there with tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a deep breath as he felt Scott silently rooting him on. Reaching up, Josh started his climb up Tyler's sweaty foot and...            </span></div></div>",

Small hairs made his progress a little tricky, but they were thankfully the only real obstacle for Josh to overcome. Hands slippery from the oily sweat, Josh tightened his grip on Tyler's skin as he started to reach the toe without any issue. On the tip of Tyler's big toe, Josh smiled as he wiped his hands together and reached down for the 6th red flag. Looking over at Scott, the huge teen smiled as he reached over his hand, extending out his pointer finger for Josh to climb on. Without delay, Josh scaled the finger, glad to be free of Tyler's stinky feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott pulled Josh in close to his face, and tried to speak quietly to the little man. \"Good job, boss!\" He whispered. \"Sorry I didn't help, I didn't want to help you cheat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head with a smile while he tucked away the flag. \"No it's ok. Tyler would've gotten pissed at us both if he found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you got to do those two flags without any of Ty's... plans.\" Scott said quietly as he looked down at Tyler, mouth hung open in sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, glad about not being timed in Tyler's other pit, and shuddered to think what he had planned at his feet. Shaking any thoughts about it, Josh was just glad that whatever it was, he was passed it. However, he was quickly reminded that there was still one flag to go and he knew exactly where it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we think we can flip him over without waking him?\" Scott asked as he started to reach down at the slightly smaller man. Josh shook his head, knowing that it wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you did, he'd think you helped me cheat.\" Josh replied with his hand on his chin. Sighing, Josh knew they'd have to wake him up. \"Put me down on his stomach. Then lay down next to him and pretend like you're just waking up too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nodded his head in understanding. Lowering his hand toward Tyler's bare stomach, he watched as Josh dropped off safely on his friend's solid abs. Carefully laying next to Tyler, he rested his head for a second, before leaning up slowly. Josh watched, impressed by Scott's acting ability as he ruffled his hair under his hat and yawning loudly. He looked to the side to see Tyler not react, however. Taking his hand and nudging Tyler's arm a little, he started to try and force him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude. Wake up!\" Scott said with a fake yawn. Tyler barely reacted to the words with little more than a sleepy snort from his nose. Scott sighed as he took his open palm and slapped it hard on Tyler's chest. With a loud clap, Josh felt Tyler's body shake as he woke up and leaned forward in a quick and violent fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Tyler yelled as he looked around the room and turned to see Scott. \"Oh. Uh.. what happened dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both fell asleep.\" Scott replied as he rubbed his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, wasn't Josh in my mouth?\" Tyler exclaimed as he started to pull up the string frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dude, you didn't swallow him did you?\" Scott responded as Josh watched with a giggle, still impressed at Scott's acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not on the string.\" Tyler panicked as he pulled out the end, noticing there was nothing there. \"Shit... what if he's in my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at his abdomen as he spoke the words, noticing the little man standing there with a smug look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that would just be terrible, Ty!\" Josh mocked as his huge friend made eye contract with him. Tyler rolled his eyes as he scooped up the little man, bringing him closer to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me, bud.\" Tyler threatened as he sat up and looked at Josh better. Josh simply shrugged his shoulders with confidence and pulled out the 6 flags, laying them on the palm of Tyler's hand. Tyler rose an eyebrow as he counted the tiny red squares. \"When did you get those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys were asleep for awhile, you know.\" Josh boasted, crossing his arms with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. Maaaaan that sucks.\" Tyler whined as he looked over at Scott, who shook his head in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he had some fun ideas planned for you, dude.\" Scott replied, pretending to be on Tyler's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's too bad, Guess there's only one left, huh?\" Josh smiled as he looked at Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Here, Scott take him for a sec.\" Tyler responded excitedly as he handed Josh off into Scott's hands. The two watched as Tyler flipped his body over, laying on his stomach. Looking to his side, he nodded to Scott who quickly lowered his hand and let Josh down in the middle of Tyler's muscular back. Immediately, Josh looked down toward Tyler's massive ass. Wearing red athletic shorts, Josh started to wonder how difficult this was going to be to find a red flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking his way down, Josh made his way to the waistband before climbing on top and looking around. Seemingly, no matter where he looked, Josh was having trouble finding the flag on top of Tyler's butt. Whether it was the red from his shorts or something else, Josh figured it was the latter. With a sigh, Josh started to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me it's under his shorts...\" Josh thought as he slipped his way down toward the leg holes of the shorts. Lifting up the slick fabric, Josh looked out into the darkness, making out nothing but a red roof, and Tyler's black spandex tightly bound to his ass. Taking a deep breath, Josh made his way up Tyler's leg, beneath his huge friend's shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping his way up Tyler's left glute, Josh struggled to breath as a mix of sweat and ass stench was all that could fill his lungs. Doing his best to carry on, he made it to the top of the round muscle, hoping his journey could just be over with a lucky guess. Feeling around on the slick spandex, Josh was disappointed to find nothing among the black material. Losing his grip, Josh started to slip and slide down the sweaty and slick spandex before coming to a halt directly in the middle of Tyler's ass cheeks. Coughing in disgust, the smell was even worse now that he stopped. Eyes tearing up, Josh couldn't stand it much longer in the smelly prison. Looking forward in the valley, Josh saw...         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Covering his nose, Josh practically leaped with joy as he saw the little red square sitting neatly in the crack he was stuck in. Grabbing the flag and tucking it away, Josh started to work his way free from his friend's ass. Climbing up between the two cheeks, Josh gradually made his way back to the waistband, peeking his head out and taking a deep breath of fresh air. Pulling himself out, he crawled along Tyler's back for a few feet, before getting back to his feet and waving in Scott's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that was fast!\" Scott beamed as he reached down, snatching up his tiny boss moments before Tyler flipped his body and sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww was it that obvious where it was?\" Tyler moaned as he crossed his arms in a pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where else would have been?\" Josh asked, sarcastically, hoping to push his friend's buttons a little now that he claimed victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, dude. I just thought you would've looked in more than one place!\" Tyler complained, giving Josh a slightly sour look. Josh simply shrugged as he pulled out the flag as proof. Setting it down and sitting down finally taking a break in Scott's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I win for beating you, Ty?\" Josh asked in a confident tone, hoping to get something out of this whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh no, dude. You just don't have to spend the night in my pits. Congrats!\" Tyler smirked in an annoying voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed his arms, looking down in disappointment. With a sigh, he knew he should have expected as much from his gigantic friend. Tyler looked down at his defeated boss, while he got a devious idea to perpetuate his control over his tiny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't be so glum, dude. You do win something else after all!\" Tyler chuckled as he smiled almost too happily at Josh. \"You get to do Scott's bod-stacle course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's head perked up as he heard Tyler finish his statement before he turned and looked at the tanned man. \"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head in agreement. \"Agreed, say what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Scott had his all planned out after you finished mine!\" Tyler smirked happily. Josh looked up at Scott, as the huge man started to scratch his head under his hat slightly. The look on his face was all Josh needed to see before the huge teen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad boss, what do you say?\" Scott asked, politely. Josh sighed, knowing he really couldn't say no to Scott. He's been so helpful to him so far, he figured he could at least humor him. Shrugging his shoulder, Josh gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiine.\" Josh mumbled as both Scott's and Tyler's faces lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget if you lose, you get the same punishment, except with Scott's body!\" Tyler replied with excitement. Josh shook his head, knowing Tyler would find some way to make this worse. Looking up at Scott's face, it was a little worrying that he didn't object to the idea. Hoping the huge teen was simply putting on an act for Tyler, Josh decided to drop it and give Scott the benefit of the doubt.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Josh shot back coldly. Scott frowned at Josh's lack of interest in the game, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can he actually win something this time?\" Scott asked, hoping to motivate the tiny man in his hand slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put a hand on his chin and rubbed it slightly for  few seconds, likely considering shooting down the idea. \"Fine, if you win we can go back to lame studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Josh looked at each other, shocked Tyler would actually propose any kind of compensation for Josh's efforts. Josh smiled, feeling slightly more motivated to give this new obstacle his best shot. \"Alright, I'll give it my all then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled as he walked Josh back over to the dining room table and placed him gently on the table. Taking the red plastic cup from earlier, he put it over Josh with a quick wink before lowering the cup and obstructing his view. Josh sat on the floor, crossing his legs with a sigh. \"Great, this again.\" He complained. \"At least it gives me a chance to relax.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes went by, and Josh yawned, starting to get bored himself after all this trouble that's gone on. Thankfully, light started to pour in over Josh's position as he saw Scott's abdomen peek through the bottom of the cup. As he revealed more of himself, Josh looked at the man in awe. Wearing a pair of huge shoulder and chest pads as well as a football helmet, Josh couldn't help but blush over the muscled man's football attire as he saw his hand come down to pick him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh so what's with the get up?\" Josh asked looked from Scott to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his old football gear, dude.\" Tyler responded with a raised eyebrow, like Josh didn't understand what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be a cool obstacle.\" Scott replied with a smile through his helmet's mask. Josh simply crossed his arms, wondering where this get up could possibly be going as far as the challenge goes. Carefully, Scott brought Josh out to the living room and laid down on the floor before sliding Josh out of his hands and onto his ripped abdomen. Josh looked across the massive landscape, all the way from Scott's massive abs up to his black pads covering his shoulders and chest. Josh swallowed as he looked up at Tyler, who loomed over the two men with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for Scott's challenge!\" Tyler announced with his arms up in the air with glee. \"Unlike the flag hunt, this challenge is a...\"     </span></div></div>",

Your goal is to find it and bring it back to your base without getting caught by him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head. It made way more sense now, even Scott's attire made sense. He could use the pads as a hiding place before making it back, not to mention the helmet is likely to obscure Scott's vision to prevent it from being too easy for him. Still, one question went unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my base, exactly?\" Josh asked as he looked up the expansive terrain of Scott's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? It's just his belly button, dude.\" Tyler responded with a smile, patting his own belly for added effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes as he looked out once more, ready to make his trek across Scott's body. Looking up at Tyler, he simply gave Josh a thumbs up. Figuring that was as good a signal as ever, Josh set out at a comfortable pace. Looking over his shoulder as he made his way, he noticed Tyler wasn't holding any stop watch or timer. Figuring he wasn't on any set time limit, Josh took it easy as he worked over Scott's first pair of abs, sliding down the huge muscle with ease before working his way up the new two pairs. It took a bit of time to work his way across Scott's abdomen before reaching his chest, in fact it made crossing Tyler's body seem like a breeze! But finally reaching the edge of the pads, Josh snuck his way under the dark cushion and started his search for the flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pads were incredibly sticky and smelly. Josh could only imagine how much use they must've gone through throughout all of Scott's practices and games in high school. Trying not to think about it as he was starting to get drenched in the sticky old sweat, Josh only tried to focus on pressing on through the ample darkness to find the flag. Scott's heartbeat was starting to grow ever closer till the vibrations of the huge muscle felt like it was directly below him. Figuring that must mean he's fairly close to the middle of Scott's massive chest, Josh started to feel around carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna go easy on him are you dude?\" Tyler asked quietly as he eyes Scott's face under his helmet suspiciously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude... of course not.\" Scott responded half heartedly. Just as the words escaped Scott's lips he felt a slight tickle start to squirm it's way out from under his chest pads. Looking down he saw his tiny boss, holding an ever smaller red square, peek his way out from under his pads. Biting his lip, Scott reached out his hand and...   </span></div></div>",

Due to the shock, Tyler's head bumped back and fourth quickly as it thudded back down on the floor to it's resting position. Out of reflex, Tyler swallowed hard and sat up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Tyler yelled to his side at Scott who reared back slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Scott replied as he rubbed the back of his neck nervously. Looking back to Tyler however, he noticed his friend start to reach for the string that was still poking out of his mouth. \"Everything ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swallowed something.\" Tyler said casually as he started to pull on the string and slowly reeling it in from the interior of his mouth. Scott's face went a little pale as he watched Tyler pull on the string, hoping he wasn't unintentionally the reason for his new boss to end up as part of Tyler's dinner. Relief spread across Scott's face however as Tyler pulled out the end of the string, tiny boss dangled at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good.\" Tyler said nonchalantly as he watched his tiny saliva covered friend sway back and fourth slightly in front of his face. \"I was worried I was gonna have to puke up a good meal!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh meanwhile held on to the string with both hands as he looked down awkwardly at the comment, hoping this little scare would cause Tyler to forget about the game. His luck wasn't that good however as Tyler's eyes narrowed slightly to look closer at Josh. \"So where's the flag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lip, Josh knew the answer all too well but still hoped there was some way out of this. \"You're worried about that after you almost ate me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't.\" Tyler said with a playful smile. \"So where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more Josh hoped he could change the subject, but in the end he figured Tyler's persistence would pay off. \"It's because of this irresponsible game that you almost ate me in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dropped it didn't you?\" Tyler responded as he ignored whatever Josh actually said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Josh murmured as he looked down in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I swallowed, huh?\" Tyler smirked as he watched Josh hang his head down lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh answered knowing what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I win!\" Tyler exclaimed excitedly as he threw his hands into the air, dragging Josh off with them on the string at high speeds. Bringing them back down his his face however, he stopped and watched his tiny friend readjust to the elevation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on!\" Josh replied as his head still spun painfully. \"How is my fault that you swallowed the stupid flag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took his free hand and placed it on his chin for a moment in thought. \"Now you actually have a point there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank y--\" Josh started to say as Tyler cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's mix of your's and Scott's faults.\" Tyler answered quickly as he looked over from Josh to Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Scott replied shocked as he put a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude. It's Josh's fault he dropped it and your fault I swallowed it.\" He said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes as he still hung there dangling in front of Tyler. \"That doesn't make any sen--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled then. You both lose!\" Tyler interrupted once more. Josh crossed his arms as he looked over at Scott who looked as confused as ever. \"Scott, tomorrow at work you're going to be my bitch. Josh you still get to spend the night with me... taped to my stomach instead though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, being taped to Tyler's stomach didn't seem nearly as bad as his sweaty pit. Looking over at Scott, he felt a little bad he got drug into this now too. Looking at his face he looked confused and a bit concerned. Feeling bad, Josh figured he might at least try to get Scott off the hook. \"Hey, Ty. Don't make him do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, you guys have to share in the misery of loss.\" Tyler replied as he dangled Josh back up in front of a toothy grin of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there anyway we can change your mind?\" Josh asked hopefully as he watched Tyler pick the three remaining flags off his body and tossing them aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you find a way to get that flag out of my gut!\" Tyler laughed happily as he gave his tanned abs a couple of pats. Josh shuttered at the thought. Sure it was possible, he was even already tied to a string, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to go through with that just for his and Scott's sake. Looking over at Scott he still looked a little off with a fairly blank look on his face. Unsure, Josh decided to...   </span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Tyler simply laughed at the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that sounds interesting!\" Tyler replied with an enthusiastic smile. Holding the string in front of his face though, he lowered it so Josh was just dangling at his abdomen. \"String's a little short though, we'll have to tie on another piece or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler handed Josh to Scott who took him with quite a bit of surprise while Tyler walked off into the bathroom. Dangling in front of Scott's chest, Josh looked up as Scott started to talk to him. \"You don't have to do this, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I made up my mind.\" Josh replied with a smile, knowing Scott really didn't want to be Tyler's bitch and not to mention him getting drug into this was partially his fault after all. Scott frowned while he looked down at his tiny boss as Tyler reappeared with the box of floss in hand. Pulling out a long strand, he measured it from mouth down past his stomach for a little slack. Cutting it off, Tyler retrieved Josh from Scott and tied the extra floss on the end in a knot. Finally, Tyler set Josh down holding him in the palm of his hand. Looking up at his massive and eager friend, Josh swallowed nervously as he was truly in awe over the size of the stud that he was agreeing to go inside of. Shaking off his nervousness, Josh took the moment to try and negotiate terms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would you say the stakes are a little higher in this game, Ty?\" Josh asked with a slight hint of fear in his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, wanna sweeten the deal?\" Tyler replied with a cocky smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can get the flag, you have to be Scott's bitch for a week and we get to do whatever I want for the rest of the night.\" Josh spoke as confidently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. If I win I want you to do whatever I want for a week.\" Tyler replied as he looked over at Scott. \"Scott you can get off easy this time, bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled with relief, glad he wasn't on the negative end of the bet anymore. Deciding he could relax, the massive teen grabbed a chair and pulled it over into the room, ready to watch these events unfold. Meanwhile, Tyler grabbed the red plastic cup they used earlier to blindfold Josh and strode into the kitchen with Josh to fill it with a little water. Satisfied with the amount, Tyler took a little sip as he walked back out into the living room with Scott. Holding the cup and looking down at Josh, Tyler was ready to start the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have 5 minutes from the time I swallow you, dude. After that I'm pulling you up.\" Tyler said as he motioned to Scott who pulled back out the stopwatch he used before. \"I ain't puking you up if you get stuck, so make sure that floss is tied really good around you, bud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at the knot he had on his waist and tightened it just to be sure, all the while wondering if Tyler was serious or not. Either  way, Josh knew there wasn't anyway for that to happen as he finished his knot, extra tight. Looking up at his handsome friend, Josh nodded. Quickly, Tyler lifted Josh up to his face, opening his massive mouth for him to enter once more. Taking a deep breath, Josh braced himself as Tyler tilted him into his cavernous mouth. Quickly closing it behind his little friend, Tyler took a large swig of his water and swallowed the gulp down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright start the timer.\" Tyler said with a smirk as he looked over at Scott. With a click, the clock started ticking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem pretty confident, dude.\" Scott said as he watched Tyler rub his chest pompously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure dude, that flag is probably nothing more than red pulp by now!\" Tyler bolstered confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott scratched his head. \"Dunno I guess it might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his breath as he rushed down the dark tube, Josh closed his eyes until finally he plummeted into an open cavern. Surfacing from the shallow pool and taking a deep breath, Josh immediately regretted the decision as he started to cough and choke on the fowl air. It took a moment for his eyes to make out his surrounding in the pitch black depths of the stomach but slowly he was able to make out dark shapes in the chamber. Mainly what he could make out was the rhythmic contractions and swaying of the walls of Tyler's stomach as it slowly churned what what was left of his meal earlier, making slight groaning and sloshing noises as it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes starting to sting, and skin starting to tingle, Josh instantly started moving from his position well aware of how dangerous of an environment his friend's stomach was. Splashing around, Josh began his search through the mounds of chewed up food and pools of liquid, desperately trying to find anything that felt remotely papery. Searching for what felt like a long time in the hellish pit, Josh...     </span></div></div>",

How fun it was winning the bet, and how fun it was going to be pushing Josh's limits, making him do all the things he <i>quite</i> couldn't get away with as bullying! He kept his tiny boss at mouth level, not even granting him a look. Sure, they were friends, but there was something about Josh being tiny... Well, it was obvious he loved being toyed with, and Tyler now had a great excuse to go wild. He smirked and let out a long belch right in Josh's face.<br>\r\n\"Say it, bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was slightly taken aback. He knew Tyler would get arrogant, but he had hoped he'd get a break after going in and out of his friend's stomach.<br>\r\n\"You won the bet,\" he sighed. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sat up and looked at Tyler. It felt strange seeing his boss not fight back. Surely that was normal between Josh and Tyler.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now what? I don't feel like playing another game. Besides I'm feeling tired.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fair,\" Tyler replied. \"Tiny pip should get some rest too, there's a rough week ahead for him.\"<br>\r\nHe sat heavily in the sofa and propped his left foot on his knee. He grabbed Josh and pressed him face first into his big toe, then used the string to tie him tight, making sure he couldn't move an inch. He threw a cushion onto one arm of the sofa and laid down, his foot propped up on the other arm, flexing his toes.<br>\r\n\"There goes Josh for the night! Hope you have a good one, dude. I'm talking to you, Scott, of course.\"<br>\r\nScott shrugged, bid both friends goodnight and went to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was pressed so deep into Tyler's worked-up flesh that he could barely breathe the male-scented air. His arms were tied hugging the giant digit, and he couldn't kick his legs. All he could do was to endure this position for the night. And he couldn't complain about it. He knew his friend well, and he knew he would make his life even worse if he tried to fight back. He rested his head into the plump flesh and tried to drift asleep.</span></div></div>",

Turning his body and reaching behind him, Josh reached for the string that would pull him up and out of this putrid cavern. Josh's stomach dropped as he found, much to his dismay, the string was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?!\" Josh scrambled as he ran his hands down into various liquids on the floor, burning his hands slightly in the process. Moving as quick as he can through the darkness, Josh looked everywhere hoping to find some trace of the string. Josh's head started to spin as everything in the depths of his friend's stomach started to look the same and the lack of breathable air was starting to make his head swim a little. Tearing around the enormous organ as quickly as he could, the only thing Josh could think about were Tyler's words about not puking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd never do that to me!\" Josh screeched as his legs started to burn more. Seemingly the water Tyler drank before was already being over taken by stomach acid. Looking around desperately, Josh knew he didn't have much time to find the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten seconds, dude.\" Scott said eagerly as he looked from Tyler's stomach up to his mouth, hand ready to pull the string up and out. \"5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer stopped and Tyler wasted no time as he started to pull up the string. trying not to tug too fast, both so he wouldn't choke and also out of some consideration for his tiny friend. Tyler tugged for what seemed like a few minutes until finally pulling it out. Scott and Tyler looked at the end of the string and saw...   </span></div></div>",

Dropping it to the floor he rested a hand on his tanned abs and sighed. \"I knew this would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were joking though, right?\" Scott asked cautiously, recalling what he told Josh moments before sending him down into his gut. \"About not puking him up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course I was.\" Tyler replied defensively. \"I only told him that so he'd be extra careful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I gotcha.\" Scott said shaking his head in understanding, feeling like he understood how Josh and Tyler worked a little better. Still he couldn't help but look down at Tyler's stomach in concern for his tiny boss. \"So you want me to grab a bucket or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...\" Tyler said with a devious smile. \"Maybe I'd leave him in there for a little while. Teach him a lesson about responsibility or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott scratched his head. He wasn't any kind of science expert, let alone anatomy, but he couldn't help but feel like it was a bad idea. \"Is that a good idea, dude? Won't he get like.. all digested or whatever?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled as he reached up to put a hand on Scott's shoulder. \"Dude, I drank a bunch of water, he'll be ok for for at least a little while. In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grabbed the cup of water he had and drained the rest of it in one gulp. \"See, he'll be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked down at Tyler with a little relief in his eyes. To Scott, Tyler seemed like a really smart guy, and he seemed to genuinely care about Josh. So he figured what Tyler was doing must have been for Josh's betterment. Still, he shifted a little uncomfortably the more he thought about Josh trapped inside Tyler's stomach. Looking at Scott's face, Tyler smiled knowing he was just worried about the little guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, if it'll make you feel better we can let him out now.\" Tyler said, caving in to Scott's sad look. Scott smiled, happy to know Tyler caught on to his distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little better Scott looked at Tyler and replied...  </span></div></div>",

Tyler took his hand off Scott's shoulder as he nodded approvingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't worry about him for now, we'll do something else to preoccupy ourselves, dude.\" Tyler said happily, winking and giving Scott a thumbs up. Looking around the room, Tyler started to brainstorm ideas to himself. While he thought about it, Tyler retreated to the kitchen and refilled his cup with a fresh supply of water before returning and stating the obvious. \"I'll tell you what we aren't doing. Studying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed as Tyler moved his hand up for a high five. With a triumphant slap, Scott couldn't agree more about skipping out on studying. After everything that's happened over the course of the evening, he totally forgot that's what they were all here for in the first place! Smiling wide from the awesome high five, Tyler walked past Scott and headed over to a TV he had in the living room. Looking on the ground he noticed an Xbox with two controllers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you game?\" Tyler asked excitedly as he picked up a controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we have the Wii tucked away somewhere too. Bri likes those Mario games. She refuses to play Madden with me though.\" Scott replied as he crossed his arms, disappointed as he thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'll play you in Madden. As long as you don't mind getting your ass kicked!\" Tyler taunted playfully as he backed his way down onto the couch and plopped down into the cushion. Scott smiled as he strode his way over to retrieve the other controller before seating himself next to Tyler with a massive thud. \"Easy dude! You're causing quakes again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott chuckled as he turned to see Tyler patting his stomach gently, hoping he didn't rough the waters too bad for his little boss down there. Tyler took a decent chug of his water as he watched Scott boot up the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh stream of water poured itself into Tyler gurgling belly. Letting himself get drenched in the water, Josh sighed with relief. It was the only bit of solace he's had in what felt like an extremely long time. He knew the bliss would be short lived, as Tyler's stomach certainly wasn't about to stop doing the only thing it knows what to do. Digest everything inside of it. Already he could start to feel the tingles come back to his skin, as well it was also becoming soft and tender to touch. Working his way around the exterior of the stomach, Josh tried desperately to stay away from the center of the lake of liquid, almost sure it would dissolve him quite quickly at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his hand to reach one of the constantly churning walls, Josh accidentally touched it briefly with his hand. The sticky mucus that lined the stomach quickly stuck to his hand as he desperately tried to pull it all away. Unfortunately, that's not all that was coming off the wall of the vicious organ. Acid seeped down the wall directly on Josh's arm as he pulled away. Tears in his eyes from immense pain, Josh felt like his arm had been almost completely severed from the horrid liquid. Everything started to go numb as he sloshed his way hopelessly to a different part of his friend's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he really left me down here...\" Josh cried, tears streaming down his face as a fresh stream of water started to flood it's way into the cavern. Unable to brace himself, the torrent carried him immediately to the center of the stomach, the very place he was hoping to avoid. With his one good arm Josh tried to keep afloat as somewhat diluted acid slowly started to eat away at the entire rest of his body. With one last breath, Josh submerged, quickly sinking to the very pit of Tyler's stomach. Finally, Tyler's stomach could fulfill it's purpose and digest anything or anyone dumb enough to go inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You're totally cheating!\" Tyler yelled after about an hour's worth of play. The game was certainly grueling, but in the end Scott was victorious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're just bad?\" Scott replied with a snarky tone. Tyler smiled as he started to set up another game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh a smart guy now all of a sudden?\" Tyler taunted playfully with the gigantic teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Scott replied, confused as ever. Tyler simply laughed as he started up another game, hoping for a little better luck in beating Scott this time. As the game loaded, Tyler unconsciously rubbed his stomach as he felt a small amount of gas surge it's way up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuurrrp!\" Tyler exhaled the watery sounding burp as he readied his hands on the controller. \"Alright! Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours and many games later Tyler finally won. Ecstatic over his first victory he couldn't help but jump out of his seat, throwing his arms up into the air with a loud \"Woooooo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed as he clapped for the happy man, glad he'd finally stopped moaning over him \"cheating\". \"Not bad dude, 1-7 in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah dude... we played 8 games?\" Tyler replied looking at the clock in shock. He had been here for hours at this point and it was already past midnight! \"Man! It's been hours! I gotta... get home dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stood up and pulled Tyler in for a friendly bro hug. He couldn't help but smile, glad he was able to make a friend in this new town after all. Helping Tyler grab his bag and seeing him out the door, he waved excitedly as Tyler said they should hang out and play Madden again sometime. Closing the door, Scott yawned as he made his way into his bedroom and got ready to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the apartment complex, Tyler beamed over having finally beat Scott. He might not be the smartest guy in the world, but he sure did play Madden like a real champ. Catching a late bus home, Tyler yawned with sleepiness as he dropped his bag on the floor at the entrance of his apartment. Getting ready for bed, Tyler went about his usual routine before entering his bedroom. Pulling off his shorts he slipped under his sheets wearing nothing but his spandex. Drifting quickly off to sleep, Tyler laid peacefully as he was unaware of what remained of his boss being processed in his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next morning, Tyler rolled out of bed and shuffled his way to the bathroom. Pulling down his compression shorts, he sat down on the toilet while he brushed his teeth and let the shower heat up. Finished with his business, he turned and flushed as he sleepily made his way into the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, Tyler sat on his couch for a second as he set his morning protein down on his coffee table. Stretching as he rubbed his empty belly, Tyler started to wonder how the day at the park will be today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to see Scott and... Josh...\" Tyler thought to himself before exclaiming out loud. \"Shit.\"                  </span></div></div>",

Looking around Josh remembered he never designed a way to get up off the floor from the kitchen, only from the lounge since he had a little seat raised slightly off the ground for watching the giant tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking under the table he slowly approached Scott's huge feet. they still seemed to be a little wet from the park so they glistened brightly as he made his approach. \"I could try and get their attention.

Josh watched as Tyler moved forward next to Scott, seeing the four feet next to each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collection of feet did make it a little hard to breath, though their foot smell wasn't as bad as it could be since they were barefoot for the whole morning already, though Josh wasn't too interested in taking it in for much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh jumped as the table started to shake once again. \"Right... they're pretty distracted... they might not even notice me if I try to get their attention...\" Josh thought as he was thinking going to the lounge might just be the safer option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waited for the tremors to stop once more and made his decision to...  </span></div></div>",

It might be tricky to signal Scott this way, but it's worth a try. After all, the new guy has to show that he can put his faith in him as an employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hits the base of the big toe. The skin twitches, but it's too small to be a reaction to him. Josh keeps his distance from the wall as he walks towards the gap between the big and second toe. The skin here would probably be thinner than where he tried earlier.

He has to be ready if Scott's foot reacts to the point where he turns his tiny boss into a bloody smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hits the gap between toes.

I'm not cut out for this interviewing shit. I know I did a shitty job answering your questions. So I'm willing to make you an offer, if it helps score me this job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested, Josh relaxed his footing a little. Looking up at the behemoth of a teen, he figured he'd bite. \"What kind of an offer are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting down even more, the over sized teenager tried his best to look at the tiny man as seriously as he could. \"Like I said, You like being small and I like being big... If there was anything you wanted to... do...\" He said ambiguously. \"I'd be willing to help you out. If you're interested that is, little guy.\" He added with a captivating tone as he winked at the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning red at the proposition Josh had to look down.

Scott let out a low rumbling laugh with a huge toothy smile, showing off his fantastic pearly whites as he did so. \"Huh, I hadn't even thought about how you could fit in my mouth, boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think then?\" Josh asked, curiously. Mostly hoping to detract Scott's brain from how odd it might be to have a tiny human in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott scratched his chin as he thought for a moment. \"I guess I mostly thought about you crawling around on my body, or on the floor or something. You know, loom over you like a giant from a movie or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we could do that too eventually, if you want.\" Josh blushed, thinking about seeing Scott towering over him in his full 6'11\" massive hieght. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time!\" Scott smiled. \"Besides, you said you wanted to go in my mouth. That sounds sweet, dude!\" Scott beamed before looking serious for a moment. \"Sorry. I mean, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok Scott.\" Josh reassured the enormous and polite teen. \"When you and I are alone like this... like having our giant and tiny time... you don't have to be polite. Actually I'd prefer if you acted more... giant-like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand.\" Scott answered with kind of a dumb confused look on his face. Scott's face contorted slightly, and Josh watched as he throat moved a little before the giant teen let a small yet deep burp out on Josh. \"Like less polite like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Josh answered as the strong smelling belch washed over him. \"Except don't ask me every time. Just do whatever comes natural like you just did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Scott answered excitedly as he quickly got into character by suddenly scooping Josh off his feet and into his hand. Scott lifted Josh up with him as he stood up to his full hieght, hovering Josh above his face as he stared down at it taking in every feature from his flawless jawline to his deep dreamy blue eyes. Josh watched as his massive mouth opened wide, tongue shooting out like a gigantic pink welcome mat as Scott started to tilt his hand and lower it to his impending maw. Josh lost his grip as he slid off the teens hand, falling for a moment before landing with a wet splat and seeing nothing but pink all around him. Looking around, he could see rows of perfect white teeth behind him, still wide open as Scott kept his mouth open. Turning and looking to his sides, Josh saw where the teens massive teeth ended before he could make out the pockets of his cheeks. Turning forward Josh saw in his mind the most majestic, yet terrifying sight he had ever witnessed, Scott's humongous throat. With each breath the huge teen took, Josh could see his throat move slightly as Scott's epiglottis covered and uncovered the path down his wind pipe. Josh couldn't help but be transfixed by Scott's uvula however, as it swung ever so slightly above the throat. It was easily the size of a building to the tiny explorer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stood there, mouth open as he stared off across the room. He really wasn't sure what he should be doing, as he didn't want to move too much and send his tiny boss hurdling across his mouth. Scott tried to think for a minute to himself... \"What can I do to be more giant-like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to just go with the first thought that comes to his mind, Scott closed his mouth. Scott wasn't entirely sure what the action did, but he went with it as he tried to come up with an idea to do next. Trying to feel the tiny speck of a man inside his mouth, Scott inadvertently started to swish the little man around his mouth, like a tiny piece of food. Realizing what he was doing, Scott stopping moving Josh around his mouth and opened it up very slightly to let in a little air. Scott took the moment to realize just how easy it was to do whatever he wanted to the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still my boss though.\" Scott thought to himself. \"So I have to be extra careful not to chew him or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott made it a conscious effort to locate his tiny boss in his mouth, around the left side of his tongue, near his teeth, before he shifted the man more into the middle. Thinking more like a giant, Scott thought the tiny man might enjoy it if he spoke more the part. Playfully, Scott thought of fun ways he wanted to taunt his minuscule boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you liked that, huh?\" Scott asked the little man in a somewhat bad acting arrogant tone. \"You probably wish I'd let you out. But I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking he was doing a good job of acting, Scott smiled to himself, little did he know the tiny man inside his mouth was face palming himself at how unnatural Scott sounded. Scott felt a little pressure build up in his stomach again as he decided to let loose another burp, this time keeping his mouth shut, keeping his boss inside to experience it fully. He smiled to himself as little bits of air escaped his mouth before he opened it back up, letting a little fresh air in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bet you loved that!\" Scott continued with his poor acting. Josh was having the time of his life, however despite Scott's poor taunting ability. \"I hope you don't end up slipping down my throat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott chuckled a little to himself, wondering what would happen if he really was to just swallow the tiny man. Barely passing any of his classes in high school, Scott got by being in all the applied classes as well as receiving help from numerous tutors as well as his intelligent girl friend. So thinking about what happened after you swallowed something escaped Scott's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it goes into your stomach.\" Scott thought to himself as he traced a finger from his throat down to his ripped abdomen. \"Then some stuff happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott puzzled to himself, never really thinking about the process from food to well... shit. \"Takes awhile.\" Scott continued to think silently as he tried to guess how many hours after he eats before he had to take a shit. \"If he'd wanna explore my mouth he'd probably like exploring my belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smirked thinking of the idea of surprising Josh, and how much he'd like it. He tried to think of a shooter game he played on xbox where part of the story took placed inside a giant worm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were fine once they got out.\" He thought again to himself. Scott kept his mouth closed before he decided he would...      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sure he'll love it and he's sure to be surprised!\" Scott thought to himself, feeling like this was a really good idea. Scott very gently tilted his head back, barely feeling the tiny man in his mouth slide ever so slowly toward the back of his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't know where that little speck went.\" Scott said aloud, full well feeling Josh dangle at the very edge of his throat. \"I sure hope I didn't swallow him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Scott took a gulp, barely trying to swallow Josh but still doing so with absolute ease. Feeling that his tiny boss had successfully been sucked down his throat, Scott smirked as he wondered how the trip was going for the teensy man. \"That was too easy. I bet he's having a blast though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a finger on his throat like he did before while imagining to swallow Josh, Scott tried his best to feel for the little guy. He swore he could feel a very faint squirming for a moment before the sensation was lost inside his chest. Scott patted his chest, looking down at it trying to picture Josh's descent into his enormous stomach. Finally, the huge teen rested a hand on his impressively sculptured abs, guessing that Josh must've made his way in there by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man if it my mouth was huge, I can't imagine how massive my stomach would be!\" Scott grinned to himself, feeling like he just gifted Josh with the trip of a lifetime. Once again, Scott belted a fairly large burp. He laughed as he pounded his stomach with a fist. \"Hey settle down in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as he was jostled and hurled around the massive organ. Finally, it settled down, leaving Josh to fully take in the terrifying surroundings. Having contracted now slightly from Scott's burp, his massive stomach resumed it's usual churning and mixing of it's contents. Seeping acid from the walls and groaning in deep damp sounding echoes. Josh could barely make out the huge teen's heart beat and breathing as if it sounded like miles and miles above him. In yet when Josh looked up he could only see darkness and the barely viable ceiling of Scott's wrinkly stomach. Josh thought Scott's mouth was huge, but this was a whole different story. What felt like a small stadium in the mouth suddenly turned into a expansive landscape. It was both breathtaking and horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do this?\" Josh shivered as he checked his feet carefully, lucky to see he wasn't flung in a puddle of acid or crushed under half digested food. Puzzled, Josh wasn't sure what was going to happen. He didn't know if he was going to live, or if this huge attractive idiot just swallowed him for the kicks. Looking up again as well as the massive walls of the stomach, Josh knew there was no way he could escape on his own. Plopping down on his butt with a slight squish, Josh merely gazed across the massive landscape. Having his eyes adjusted, Josh watched as everything would contract and move. Groans called out to Josh in the distance. Josh wanted to explore, feeling like he had nothing to lose, but at the same time he felt like one wrong step would send him hurtling into a lake of acid. Subjecting himself to observing, Josh decided to stay put and examine the digestive process of Scott's stomach from his safe location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty amazing in here though...\" Josh admitted, honestly have been curious about going down Scott's throat ever since he first slide into the teen's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Scott...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He could help but wonder how the tiny man must've been enjoying himself, but at the same time he felt like this was slightly less exciting for himself than when he was swishing Josh around in his mouth. \"Maybe it's time to bring him back up then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott clenched his abs hard, trying to think of the best way to bring his tiny boss up and out of his stomach. He knew he had to puke, but for the somewhat dim-witted teenager he wasn't sure how to accomplish that task. \"The only times I can remember puking were when coach would make us run laps <i>until</i> we puked.\" Scott thought to himself. The huge man simply shrugged and pulled out his phone. \"Better just google it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short internet search, Scott quickly learned about the gag reflex, jogging his poor memory of hearing about girls sticking their fingers down their throats in the bathroom to throw up and lose weight. Having not thought about that before, Scott looked at his fingers and frowned before shoving them as far back in his throat as he could. Gagging, Scott fought the urge to vomit instinctively before he realized again that was what he was trying to accomplish. Shoving his fingers in his throat again, Scott let his instincts go as he spewed out a healthy pool of vomit out on the tiny balcony he stood in front of. Wiping his mouth, Scott looked down at the chunks of food from his lunch before he saw a small squirming speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're out!\" Scott laughed as he swept aside some of his vomit to make a drier and clearer spot for Josh to regain his bearings. Scott scratched his head as Josh seemed to still be in a bit of a tizzy. \"Sorry if that was too much, dude. I kinda just went with what I thought a giant would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving shook off the rush of being thrown up Josh looked up at Scott's massive body up to his face. Josh wasn't sure if he was mad at the dumb jock, or if he truly did enjoy the experience. Josh sighed, knowing Scott meant no harm. On top of that, Josh really was in awe of the whole trip. \"It wasn't too much Scott, it was incredible!\" Josh replied wanting to encourage Scott to be more dominating and passionate as a giant. \"I really enjoyed it, it felt dangerous but at the same time I was confident in you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\" Scott questioned, as he wasn't confident in himself in that situation at all. Feeling a little big headed from Josh's words however, Scott smiled. \"I mean I had it under control. Plus, I guess I'm looking forward to doing more stuff with you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Josh beamed, glad to see Scott enjoyed it enough to willing want to keep it up. \"I'd be up for going on another trip like that whenever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed as he rubbed his stomach, feeling a little nauseous. \"Probably not right now, my stomach is feeling a little funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whenever you want then. You're the giant, so you're in charge!\" Josh smiled, trying to keep the humongous teen encouraged. Scott looked up and smirked, feeling really good about being huge and being in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a little later? Like after we're all done with work?\" Scott asked, still wanting to be polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. The break room will be empty so it can just be both of us till whenever we feel like.\" Josh smiled, now excited to get on with the day just so it can be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, little man!\" Scott gave Josh a thumbs up and a wink...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours had gone by as Josh tried to go about his day without thinking too much about the events that unfolded earlier. It was a fairly futile effort however, especially once Josh began training Scott, seeing him at his \"normal\" size of 6'11\" compared to his own puny 5'5\".Josh couldn't help but day dream, thinking of the massive teen as an even more massive giant. Regardless, time went by and soon Josh and Scott were the only two left in the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll meet you around in the break room, boss?\" Scott asked Josh, as Josh locked up his office, waiting in anticipation for the huge man to remember their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I nearly forgot!\" Josh lied, fighting the urge to blush as he looked at Scott, now wearing a lifeguard's uniform of red board shorts and a red hat. Scott slung a bag of his other clothes over his massive right shoulder as he smiled down at his short boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really bro? I was looking forward to it all day!\" Scott gleamed with an excited expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\" Josh smiled, happy to see Scott was so enthusiastic. \"Maybe I just got caught up in the training today, but now that it's all over I'm actually pretty excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott came up next to Josh and put a hand on the short man's shoulder. Josh looked up at Scott, looking up past his chest as he barely measured up to the tall teen's abs. Josh fought back the urge to blush, playing it cool as the dumb jock winked at him. \"It's cool seeing you like this as normal person, dude. But in a few minutes, I'll be your god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned away, leaving Josh's side without looking back. Josh stood dumb-founded as he watched Scott stride away, eyes shifting from his massive glutes bouncing, to his ripped and beautiful back. \"I wonder if he thought of some better lines?\" Josh wonder to himself. \"That sounded way less scripted and more confident...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more eager then before, Josh quickly made his way to the break room. Josh swung open the door, wanting nothing more than to be able to see Scott again in his full giant glory. As promised, Josh saw the attractive teen make his way into the room. Josh watched as Scott pulled down his pants, revealing his tight black compression shorts he saw earlier before pulling up the shorts he wore for the interview. Not bothering to tie the short like before, Scott let them sag a little, showing off his butt and exposing the under armor brand on the front once again. Finally the huge teen simply turned his new red lifeguard's hat backwards, rather than grabbing his other one from his back. Turning around, Scott saw Josh standing by the tiny door to the break room, figuring the little man must've just came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all sweaty, so I think we can forget about putting on my shirt.\" Scott said confidently as he didn't even address as as he started walking over to the tiny man. Josh simply stared in awe as the huge teen approached him slowly. His pecs bouncing in what almost seemed like slow motion before he was suddenly looming over Josh with tremendous ease. Josh looked from the exposed under wear, up the chiseled abs, past his monumental pecs, before looking at Scott's seemingly more confident looking face from before. \"I can tell you're in total amazement of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed as he tried to form any kinds of words. This was a completely new Scott to him after all. \"I-I uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... you don't have to say word little bug.\" Scott smirked, still looming over Josh as he flexed his biceps high up in the air. \"Just admire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" Josh said aloud, staring up at Scott's perfect body. He really must've been rehearsing in his head all day, because this was not what Josh was expecting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" Scott said in a sexy deep voice. \"Why don't we...\"     </span></div></div>",

Staring at Scott's mouth as it got closer to him, Josh knew exactly where this was going. Biting his lip in anticipation, Josh had been thinking about his trip within Scott all day, secretly hoping the sexy giant would want Josh to experience more. Scott stopped, bright white teeth smiling directly in front of Josh now as his warm breath started to wash over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this time I'll savor you a little longer though...\" Scott said softly in front of Josh as he inched his mouth in closer. Josh froze completely before Scott's lips pressed him to the floor, yelping slightly as he was crushed against the floor and Scott's soft lips before the massive teen slurped Josh into his mouth like a tiny piece of food. Standing back to his full hieght, Scott swished Josh around his mouth for a moment before walking away from the balcony and laying down on the couch in the break room, propping his head up so it was mostly flat with a slight incline toward his throat. \"Mmmm delicious...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled and squirmed as he tried to adjust himself to the new found darkness. Sticky saliva covered his body as he finally got his bearings straight in the now familiar looking cavern. Josh was in awe that he would experience exploring the hunky teen's mouth a second time in one day. Thanks to a slight incline, Josh found himself gradually being slid down, closer and closer to Scott's massive throat. Josh screamed as Scott's head suddenly leaned straight back, causing him to nearly free fall before landing with a sticky splat. Josh held onto the soft flesh for a moment, fearing he was going to be swallowed too son once again, before he noticed he was actually clinging to the jock's massive uvula. Just as suddenly as before, Scott's head leveled back out with Josh now clinging for dear life to Scott's dangling uvula as it swung gracefully above his dark throat. Josh swallowed, he was but a mere drop from being sucked down the huge esophagus once again. Holding on tight, it seemed like Scott was moving once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way into the bathroom, Scott flicked on a light and looked at his face in the mirror. Unsure where Josh had gone inside his gigantic mouth, Scott opened up wide, searching for the minuscule speck with the help of light pouring into his mouth. Lifting and lowering his tongue and pulling his cheeks, Scott looked and looked before his attention finally gravitated to a pale little speck on his uvula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you manage that?\" Scott asked, not really expecting a response. \"Dude, my dangly thing is so much bigger than you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott chuckled as he closed his mouth, reassured now knowing where the tiny many was located. Wanting to continue with his giant acting, Scott smirked as he decided to toy with Josh further. \"Massage it, bug. Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's voice bellowed out over Josh. It was very loud and commanding, it sent shivers down Josh's spine as he clung to the uvula unsure how he was supposed to even massage such an enormous piece of flesh. Letting go with one hand while still clinging tightly with his legs and other hand, Josh rubbed the sticky flesh nervously as he had little more than Scott's steady breathing to encourage his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a deep rumble gurgled from below. Noise was coming from deep withing Scott, bubbling up to his throat as Josh panicked, grabbing back onto the uvula with all his might. Seemingly Scott...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Putting a hand on his bare abs, Scott smiled, knowing now was the best time to tease and eat his tiny prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, tasting you is making my stomach upset.\" Scott moaned with a smirk. \"I haven't eaten all day, seems like my stomach wants you to be the first thing I've had in awhile...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n\"What?\" Josh tried to answer from all the way in the back of Scott's throat. He didn't realize the massive teen's stomach was completely empty. \"Scott, wait! Don---!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was cut short by the giant trying his best to dislodge Josh from his slippery uvula. It really didn't take that much effort before Josh toppled off, already in the back of Scott's throat, slipping down without Scott even starting to try and swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott!\" Josh yelled with a futile effort. It was no use however, the dumb giant had already committed to his actions with an extremely unnecessarily loud gulp. Josh screamed in fear, not wanting to be the only bit of meat inside a massive hungry stomach. Josh had no choice however as Scott's massive body just did what it was made to do and drug its meals down past his beating heart of his chest before making it to the massive sphincter leading to his stadium sized stomach. Josh barely had time to process what had happened before he was being deposited in the monumental organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott!\" Josh called out inside the organ. It was no use. He could never hear him from deep within his gut. Josh simply stayed still in fear, wondering what the massive stomach had in store for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott returned to his position on the couch, laying down and running a hand up and down his stomach. It rumbled again slightly to his touch, still hungry and demanding to be filled with food. He chuckled a little to himself wondering if Josh was even big enough to be considered food to his starving gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I just wanted to check in, you've been... gone... for... awhile...?\" Tyler started to trail off as he burst through the back door, full sized and walking in on seeing a massive stranger looming over a puked filled balcony. \"What the hell is going on?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned quickly not wanting whoever this was to get the wrong idea as he stood over the owner of the park as he was covered in puke. \"Dude, I can explain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Josh?\" Tyler asked quietly, a little anger starting to form in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right here!\" Scott pointed down at Josh in the midst of the vomit. \"He's fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't he be fine?\" Tyler asked, voice getting angrier still. Josh sighed, knowing the cat was out of the bag. He knew he couldn't lie to Tyler, he was his best friend after all, also he knew he couldn't throw Scott under the bus after he's seen just how good and innocent of a guy he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, calm down and just come over here.\" Josh asked Tyler politely as Tyler cautiously strode his way over, Scott moving out of the way as Tyler now stood in front of Josh, leaning down to hear his tiny friend better. Josh swallowed as he felt odd telling his best friend about this, but figured it was better to just get the truth out. \"Look, this is Scott. He was worried he wasn't going to get the job, and he caught on to me liking being small, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head, to him Josh enjoying the small size might as well have been common knowledge whether Josh knew he knew or not. Regardless, Josh continued, \"So he offered to play the part of a giant to indulge me... and I let my emotions get the best of me and I agreed. So one thing lead to another and Scott here ended up having to throw me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, he ate you?\" Tyler asked a little more puzzled than mad now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I asked to go in his mouth, then he ended up swallowing me.\" Josh answered as vague but honestly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...\" Tyler replied, looking a little angry again. \"I'm pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, come on. I asked him to do it!\" Josh tried to argue, not wanting Tyler to blow up over something he literally wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude.\" Tyler looked down at Josh. \"I'm pissed... because you never asked me to play a giant for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what?\" Josh tilted his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you've spent a lot of time around me shrunk, but dude.\" Tyler crossed his arms and pouted. \"I'd be an awesome giant god!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, why don't you hang out with us after work then?\" Scott asked Tyler, as he looked over at him, forgetting he was there for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You guys were gonna hang out after work too?\" Tyler replied, looking back down at Josh. \"Dude, now I'm really jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes. Tyler really was a stubborn bone head when he didn't get his way. \"Ty, I just never told you about these fantasies because I thought you'd think I was weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you joking?\" Tyler laughed. \"You're my best friend, I'd never think you were weird. Plus I've always wanted to act like an arrogant giant god to you, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to me?\" Josh rose an eyebrow in suspicion. Tyler looked away and blushed for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! In general. Being huge is awesome. Regardless of who the little squirt is.\" Tyler added arrogantly down at his friend with a smirk. Josh laughed a little, not sure how honest his huge friend was really being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that settles it. All three of us will hang out later after work.\" Josh announced, like it was a formal event. \"Besides, two giants are better than one, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right!\" Tyler belted as he turned to Scott. Tyler put out a hand, indicating for the massive teen to shake it. \"I'm Tyler, looking forward to being god with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same, bro. I'm Scott.\" Scott smiled as he shook Tyler's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from Josh, what the hell do you eat, bro?\" Tyler asked as he had to look up at Scott, as he was quite a bit taller and bigger than him. \"You're built like a tank, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, bro. I just eat a lot.\" Scott answered, not really ever putting much thought into it. \"Doctor says I'm still growing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you're only 19.\" Josh chimed in. \"I keep forgetting you're so young, especially seeing you side by side with Ty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody asked you, squirt.\" Tyler smirked as he leaned in close and blew a little air out his mouth, knocking Josh off his feet as Tyler chuckled. Sitting up, Josh blushed a little as he say Tyler back away and ignore him to go back to talking to Scott. Josh's mind raced, perplexed at how incredible it was that Tyler would just demean him like that before ignoring him completely. Josh sat in a daze as the two talked and laughed. He barely registered what they were saying as he couldn't help but stare back and fourth at the two massive hunks. All Josh knew was he couldn't wait for the day to be over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the park was finally being shut down. Scott did well his first day, learning some life guarding basics after he got put into uniform. Josh couldn't help but stare on an occasion, looking from his handsome face to his perfect abs, abs he had been surprised to be trapped behind earlier. As strange as it was to think about, Scott acted very normal and polite the whole day, Tyler on the other hand incessantly teased Josh any opportunity he had. Mind racing, Josh made his way to the tiny entrance to the break room, knowing full well that there were two massive hulking giants waiting for him on the other side. Taking a deep breath, knowing this was what he wanted, Josh opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out into the massive room, Josh took in all the sights, from the kitchen, to the door to a little gym, all the way to a couple of sofas by a huge TV. But the main attraction of the night, Josh finally caught a glimpse of. Still in their red board shorts, shirtless, and with red lifeguard caps on, Josh saw Scott and Tyler. Josh's stomach dropped as he saw Tyler look in his direction, locking eyes with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Scotty, would you look who's here!\" Tyler smirked as he saw Josh had actually showed up. \"We were just talking about how you might've gotten cold feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss!\" Scott said, ignoring Tyler and still being polite to his tiny boss. Tyler looked at Scott, laughing as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I told you. Right now, he ain't your boss.\" Tyler said as he looked mischievously at Josh. \"He's just a squirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed as he started to wonder what they had in store for him. Josh would soon find out as the two med strode their way over to him, looming far above him in both a terrifying, yet extremely awe inspiring view. Suddenly, Scott's hand came down, trying to grab Josh. Instinctively, Josh tried to avoid the hand before easily getting pinched between two of Scott's digits anyway. Josh dangled as he was lifted higher and higher before it seemed like he was hanging out of the door of jet plane. All the while, Josh looked around, Tyler and Scott's faces coming into view. Josh shivered, knowing the two must've been concocting some sort of plan all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh would soon find out they had plans for Josh involving...             </span></div></div>",

Looking at the first name, Josh started to read the description. The resume looked fairly professional with the name \"Brandon\" printed across the top. It says the man is 22 years old and that he has no experience with life guarding but it does say that he is CPR certified. He's 6'3\" with brown hair and blue eyes with a fairly athletic build. It also seems to list that he attended the same high school as Josh...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same high school as me? Seems like he was in my year... I sure hope it wasn't THAT Brandon.\" Josh thought thinking back to those not so good days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next resume looked fantastic. It was extremely easy to read and gave Josh all the information he needed without any unnecessary fluff. This man's name is Trevor, he's 20 years old and attends one of the local universities and he even listed that he's currently a pre-med student with first aid and CPR training. He's currently in his junior year and it seems like his grades so far have been incredible with a 3.8 GPA! Near the bottom he listed his physical build as athletic and that he is 6'4\" with blonde hair and blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this guy seems like a genius! Not to mention he keeps in shape too? We could use someone like that...\" Josh thought as he was very impressed with this resume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last resume looked a tad sloppy. The name across the top read \"Jon\" and it would seem he was 19 years old and also attended a different smaller university in the area from Trevor as a sophomore. Jon listed that he was once a lifeguard when he was 16 and isn't currently CPR certified but has been in the past. He also went on to list that he's his college's football team's quarter back, which even though the school was small seemed pretty impressive for someone in his second year! Lastly, he listed his physical appearance. He's 6'7\" and his build was written in as \"ripped\". Josh blinked and did a double take, in disbelief someone would use that word in a resume. Finally he read the man had short brown hair and light blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ripped huh?\" Josh chuckled to himself. \"He's lucky he has any experience that's all I have to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh flipped back to the first resume and handed them to Tyler and asked him which one he can expect. Flipping through the profiles Tyler came to the conclusion that it definitely was...    </span></div></div>",

Josh gulped, hoping still it wasn't THAT Brandon from high school, but regardless of how he felt he knew he had an interview to conduct. Tyler waved good by to his boss as Josh walked toward the tiny doorway which lead to the gigantic interviewing room. Opening the door Josh covered his eyes as the bight lights blinded him momentarily as he walked forward to a miniature microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's vision cleared as he saw who the man was, and it was in fact the Brandon he was hoping it wasn't. Josh sighed heavily as he looked at his old high school bully. He was dressed formally, with a button down white tee shirt tightly wrapped around his muscular frame. Josh could tell he still worked out a lot like in high school as he could see his stomach looked like it was slimmed out and even could make out the huge man's abs poking through the almost transparent shirt. Otherwise, he wore khaki pants and dress shoes and looked way more formal than Josh could ever have imagined. Josh took a deep breath, figuring it was now or never to address his old bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brandon I'll be the one conducting your interview.\" Josh said, not even introducing himself. Brandon squinted and leaned forward looking directly at where the little voice came from he could barely make out that there was a person addressing him. Josh shifted slightly as Brandon's eyes started to recognize Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? No way! I thought it was you when I heard this place got built!\" Brandon said with a smile on his face. \"How's my little buddy doing? Well, littler buddy now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um great?\" Josh said questioning Brandon's motives. He had never been so polite to Josh before in the past. Josh couldn't help but wonder if maybe the huge man changed or grew up since high school. \"How are things with you? Haven't seen you since...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High school, yeah.\" Brandon interrupted. \"I remember those days, we were in gym class with each other like every year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh cringed at the thought. Brandon used to make his life hell in gym. He distinctly remembers always being knocked over or tackled and always getting the excuse that \"It's all in good fun, shorty!\" Before being carted off the the nurses office on more than one occasion. Josh fumed for a second before trying to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah gym... Can't say I really miss those days.\" Josh said trying to remain somewhat aloof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon smirked at looked over at the tiny man. \"Yeah...\" he started to say...  </span></div></div>",

Didn't think you could get any smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was red with frustration and embarrassment. Here he thought maybe his old bully had grown up at all, but instead he stood in front of the same old jerk from before. Only this time Josh felt like he had some amount of power as an idea crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really shouldn't refer to the owner of this park and your potential boss a 'shrimp' \". Josh said seriously looking over at Brandon's attractive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon leaned back, stilling looking very relaxed over the whole situation. \"Come on man, I was just dicking around. Just like high school too dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed. Of course, that's always the excuse he expected. What else would he say? Admit that he was an asshole? Josh knew that's not how Brandon worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, I don't know if this is going to work.\" Josh said finally looking down at his feet. He knew what had to be done after all. There was no way he could hire an old bully like Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up quickly and put a hand behind Josh, completely blocking his escape. \"What was that, shrimp?\" Brandon said looking down at the tiny man with a plain looking expression. Josh looked around him as all he could see was the drop from the balcony in front of him and Brandon's hand behind him. Sighing, Josh was actually prepared for this type of situation and reached into his pocket to pull out a cell phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, don't make me call security. Just back away.\" Josh said trying to remain in command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon however didn't budge as his eyes focused on the even tiny speck that was the cellphone in Josh's hand. With his free hand, Brandon quickly flicked Josh, causing him to drop the phone as he slammed into Brandon's palm. Josh watched as the finger that just flicked him squashed the tiny phone in an instant into a pile of unidentifiable smolders. Brandon put his hand back down to his side and smiled at Josh, still pressed into his other palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was furious at the giant man. \"What? Didn't get your fill of bullying me in high school?\" Josh spat at the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon scooped Josh into his palm and pulled him off of the balcony and carried him back to the chair. Sitting down he held the tiny man up to about chest level and leaned back. \"What? Look at you. You make it too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe the way he was being treated. But at the same time he knew he should have expected this. Bullies will always just be bullies. \"Look Brandon, Just put me back and we can both just walk away from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up once more, this time he turned and dropped the tiny man on the chair in front of him. Just then he sat down on the floor and looked at the little man in the center of the seat. His ass easily took up the entirety of the surface, in yet the little man looked like nothing more than a gnat on the metal floor. Brandon rested one of his arms on the seat in front of Josh and laid his chin on his muscular arm, staring at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never liked you.\" Brandon said flatly. \"That's why I picked on you. I thought maybe you'd toughen up and become a man worth at least respecting. But you're just a tiny bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed hard at the comment. Was Brandon being honest with him? If so he thought of a plan, and he thought of it quick to try and get out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toughen me up then!\" Josh shouted at the giant. \"Maybe I am a little bitch, but maybe give me a chance to prove I can get tougher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, causing Josh to fall off his feet from the sudden flow of air. Quickly standing before Brandon could open his eyes, Josh waited for a response...      </span></div></div>",

The bully had to look over his pecs to see the speck on the chair. Josh panicked, Brandon\u2019s words and his current size were putting him on edge. \u201cBr-randon, what do you mean?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon smirked as he folded his biceps over his strong chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?

He couldn\u2019t escape from the chair due to the height and Brandon would probably just catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon\u2019s smirk widen before he bended over to get closer to Josh, causing the tiny to fall back. \u201cKill is a strong word. I\u2019m not killing a human, I\u2019m snuffing out a pest that would just annoy someone. Feel honored I\u2019ll be be the one to squash you out of existence.\u201d The giant said with a seductive tone as he stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this is goodbye, hoped you found some purpose with your life shrimp.

The brunette soon looked down at the chair, still he acted oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm since he\u2019s not here.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never in a million years did he think his old bully would be talking to him so kindly, but then even more so he never imagined he'd actually apologize for being a jerk to him a few years ago. Baffled, Josh didn't know how to respond to Brandon's sudden apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it's fine really, I just...\" Josh started to say before Brandon cut him off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's not fine. I had a lot of issues at home growing up and unfortunately for you, you were my outlet.\" Brandon said sitting back and crossing his arms over his enormous chest. \"I can understand if you hate me for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really hated you.\" Josh said while looking down at the floor trying not to remember high school too vividly. \"I just always wondered, why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed and looked down at his feet and shifted slightly in his chair. \"You were unlucky. I was just angry all the time and what better way than to let off some steam on a guy you know would never fight back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have talked about it.\" Josh said trying to defend his younger self. \"I would have been your friend if I knew you had those problems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shook his head still not making eye contact with Josh. \"I didn't work that way sadly. Again, I'm really sorry and it's fine if you hate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and shook his head this time. \"I don't hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked up at the tiny man a few feet from him and squinted to see the smile on the miniature man's face. Smiling back, Brandon grew a new appreciation for his old classmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too, if I knew more about you back then I wouldn't have been so cold to you all the time. I'm sure that just made me even more of a target?\" Josh stuttered as he looked directly at Brandon's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did! It used to piss me off so much that even after I gave you hell you never stood up for yourself other than that chilling stare you'd give me and how you'd try to ignore me. You don't have to apologize though, I deserved worse than what you gave me.\" Brandon said while scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and twiddled his thumbs a little. He still couldn't believe he was here making up with his old bully like this. Josh thought, maybe he'd be fun to have around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you find out about this job? I completely forgot to ask.\" Josh said, trying to get the actual interview going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it on Markus's facebook page that he was working here. I had no idea you were the owner, but I figured if Markus was here he might give me a little pull in getting the job.\" Brandon said with a goofy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just remembered, Markus was on the football team at his old high school much like Brandon. So it makes sense that the two would have been in some contact over the years. Markus was a year younger than Brandon and Josh and was year below them in school. Josh never really even spoke to Markus until by chance the 6'9\" African-American behemoth ended up applying for a job at his park. In the end Markus ended up becoming good friends with Josh as he worked diligently at the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you guys played football together right?\" Josh asked, already knowing the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And basketball!\" Brandon replied eagerly. \"So is he in the park right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked behind him. If memory served him well Markus was stationed at one of the rides in the park right now. \"Yeah I believe he should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sat up looking excited. \"Wow, I'd love to see him all tiny like you are right now. The dude is so huge I'd take a chance at seeing him smaller than me for a change!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed, unsure how serious Brandon was. Either way it was good to see Brandon was eager to learn about the park and to see Markus again. \"That being said, why don't we get you a uniform next door and maybe we could go in the park after and see Markus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's head tilted for a second. \"Wait does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head with a smile. \"Yeah, you're hired!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up and walked toward Josh with a huge smile on his face. Josh backed away trying to wave Brandon over to the door as his massive muscled abdomen quickly obstructed his view of the room. Apologizing again, Brandon backed away imagining it must have been terrifying to have a giant so quickly rush at you like that. Josh smiled as he watched Brandon make his way out the door. Leaving the room himself, Josh turned to the room next to the interviewer's room. The break room. Opening the door, Josh looked out into the massive room. It was very well accommodated for both tiny and giant workers. With conveyor belts and elevators leading to different parts of the room, Josh always found it to be very easy to navigate. As for the normal sized part of the room it had a kitchen, bathroom, a cushy lounge and tv, and even a small gym for the lifeguards to work out in if they so chose to. Looking out, Josh saw Brandon enter the room from his perch on the balcony. As Josh scanned the room again he noticed...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Josh looked over at the huge man, he was dark skinned and extremely tall. Brandon actually looked small compared to him, being an entire head's worth shorter. Looking at the muscular man, Josh figured he must have been on break for a little while. His well trained torso and red lifeguard shorts appeared to be dry. Josh even scanned up past his chest, which had an impressive tattoo etched across it in some sort of pointy looking design all the way spanning to his biceps on both sides. Finally, looking at his smiling face Josh couldn't help but stare for a second at his perfect white teeth, attractive scruff on his chin, and deep brown eyes. Naturally, Markus was wearing on of his many hats, as he saw him self as a bit of a collector of many different styles of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon grabbed the huge man's right hand the two of them pulled each other in for a sort of \"bro-hug\" before separating again. \"Dude I just got a job here!\" Brandon replied to his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itty-bitty Brandon got a job here?\" Markus mocked his shorter friend with a chuckle. He started petting Brandon on the top of his head to further prove his point as Brandon tried to shove the huge man aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it dude, how can you call me itty-bitty when you look at Josh.\" Brandon said pointing directly over to Josh who was surprised Brandon even noticed him. Josh felt a little taken aback by the comment, but tried to just set it aside and speak up but not before the two continued their much louder banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, he's your boss now. Don't talk about him like that, shrimp.\" Markus said defending Josh and putting Brandon in a headlock. Brandon struggled for a few seconds before slipping free and walking a bit toward Josh to compare himself to the minuscule man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm a shrimp I guess that makes him a flea.\" Brandon said somewhat coldly looking down at Josh, who was at about chest level for the massive man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, chill dude.\" Markus spoke sternly to the obviously flustered Brandon. Brandon simply shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all in good fun. We're cool now, Josh knows it.\" Brandon said staring directly at Markus. Meanwhile, Josh shivered at the phrase. It was the same excuse he always gave in high school, maybe Brandon hasn't changed as much as he initially thought. Shaking the idea from his head Josh was finally able to interject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Markus, do you think you could grab a uniform for Brandon?\" Josh asked the gigantic man politely. Markus gave Josh a playful salute and walked out the door to retrieve the uniform from a storehouse they had out back. Meanwhile, Brandon looked over at Josh and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for giving me this job, Josh. It really means a lot.\" Brandon said with much more politeness than when Markus was around. Josh was taken aback once again, now for totally different reasons. What was Brandon's deal? He was polite in the interview, suddenly a jerk just a minute ago, now suddenly polite again. Josh stood there speechless in thought while Markus reappeared with a new uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took your time lumbering back in here, you giant.\" Brandon quickly quipped to his massive friend. Makrus merely walked forward and shoved the clothes in Brandon's hands before crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is shrimpy starting today, boss?\" Markus asked looking past Brandon at his tiny boss. Josh simply nodded his head, unsure how Brandon was going to react to being called \"shrimpy\". Brandon simply snorted at the comment before marching off into the bathroom, wishing to change in privacy. Markus shook head head as Brandon walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good old Brandon, hasn't changed at all from high school.\" Markus said with a chuckle. Josh scratched his head thinking the complete opposite. He seemed totally different than he was in high school to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? He seems a lot better to me.\" Josh said questioning the massive man. Markus turned and looked down at Josh, his enormous pecs and part of his ripped abdomen now completely obstructing his view of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's as rude and hot headed as I ever remember.\" Markus said as he lifted his arm, flexing his massive bicep in the process to scratch under his hat. Josh crossed his arms looking down at the floor of the balcony. Sure he was being rude and hot headed... but only when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus suddenly turned, showing Josh his impressive back and walking away. \"I've gotta go back to my post. I'll probably see you two out there soon, boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded to himself. For the moment this was probably better for him anyway. He absolutely figured out, Brandon must act like he did in high school when he's around Markus. He's heard of people who do that before, but never thought he'd see it first hand like this. Just then the door to the bathroom opened and Brandon walked out wearing his new red lifeguard shorts. Josh was astonished at how great Brandon's body looked when he didn't have a shirt covering his torso. He always had a pretty huge chest, but Josh remembered him being much chubbier in high school, now however he sported a very attractive looking six pack as well as modest looking treasure trail. He certainly wasn't a lean muscle however, as on his belly it did look like his muscles were more thickly laid. Over all he looked like he had a well trained football player's body. The huge man looked around the room while holding his clothes before spotting Josh and walking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Markus leave?\" Brandon asked softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had to go back to his shift, actually.\" Josh answered back, glad to gave the polite Brandon back with him for now. Josh watched as Brandon dropped his clothes just below the balcony at the end of the room. \"We have little lockers in the gym if you want to store your stuff there for today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shook his head. \"No, that's ok. I don't want to take up any room in there till I'm more officially part of the crew.\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed silently to himself, he still couldn't believe how different someone could be just based off what people are around him. Either way, now it was time to decide how to approach training Brandon to be a lifeguard. Thankfully, the muscled behemoth already is CPR certified, so all he needs is training in the pools. Josh figured he could train him himself, but he always liked to have someone else help since it made the job a lot quicker and easier. He knew if he was going to pick anyone to help him however it would seem weird not to ask Markus. Josh sighed again deciding...           </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh swallowed hard, knowing what he was about to put himself through. At the very least he knew Markus has Brandon under control if anything should go wrong. Looking up at Brandon's handsome face Josh figured it was time to let him know what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'd like to train you today, Brandon.\" Josh started to say as Brandon hunched over a little to hear his new tiny boss better. \"I'll have Markus help too, of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dude!\" Brandon said excitedly almost blowing Josh over with his words in the process. \"It's great seeing Markus again, I swear he's gotten bigger since high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably has, honestly.\" Josh replied, regaining his balance. \"You look like you've been working out a lot since I've last seen you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up back to his full height, rubbing his solid abs in the process. \"I had to get rid of the spare tire, dude. Great to have the extra weight to throw around in football, but after that was done I decided looking good was more important.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, he really liked Brandon like this. Relaxed and polite was a nice change for the huge guy. However, he knew it was just a matter of time before he regressed to his old self once he's around Markus. \"Maybe the fact that this is work and he's being trained will help...\" Josh thought to himself hopefully. Quickly, Josh instructed Brandon to go around the front and enter the park, assuring him he'd meet him there by the entrance once he's been shrunk. Brandon made a bit of a sour face, showing his distaste for the whole shrinking part, but none the less obeyed and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the entrance Josh waited around for a minute before finally spotting a much smaller, yet still much bigger than him, Brandon. Josh waved to his old bully who nodded his head and walked over to his new boss. Brandon stuck out his right hand as he came up to Josh, to which Josh smiled and grabbed it. Brandon pulled Josh in quickly giving him a \"bro-hug\" much like what he did with Markus earlier. A little shocked Josh blushed a little as he was pulled into Brandon's muscular chest, but instinctively put his arm around Brandon's back in return. Brandon gently let Josh go and looked down at the shorter man with a friendly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid I'd hurt you earlier if I tried to shake your hand or something.\" Brandon said casually. \"I could have crushed you under my pinky if I wasn't careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed at the comment, however it made him sweat a little too since the thought of being crushed wasn't particularly amusing to him. Moving along, Josh had Brandon follow him to one of the near by wave pools. Noticing that it was in fact Markus stationed at the smaller pool Josh signaled the man to clear out the pool. Josh and Brandon watched as several guests started to file out of the pool, making their way to a different pool or ride in the park. Josh smiled awkwardly as Markus came walking over to him and Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, B.\" Markus said walking over to the shorter man and giving him a playful pat on the stomach. Brandon stood there with a smirk, not flinching at all to his giant friend next to him. Suddenly, Brandon burped directly up into his Markus face. Markus shoved the smaller man away while pinching his nose. \"Dude! That's nasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon smirked and shrugged his shoulders. \"Sorry dude, you must've loosened up some air down there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head as he watched the two. Back to rude Brandon it was, after all. \"Hey guys let's just get started with the training, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh, I bet if I burped at you while you're all tiny you'd go flying! That'd be hilarious!\" Brandon spouted with a less than friendly grin on his face. Markus sighed and simply grabbed Brandon by the shoulder and started to drag him into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, time to learn, you dunce.\" Markus said in an almost monotone voice. Josh watched with a bit of sweat running down his brow while trying to fake a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh observed for a while, watching as Brandon learned the ins and outs for saving a drowning person and when it's appropriate to blow you whistle to get people to quit goofing off. Brandon started to take in the rules quite well while Josh was mostly out of ear shot of the two. Finally, after swimming a few laps for an endurance test Brandon and Markus approached Josh, water dripping down their solid bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go?\" Josh asked, trying not to stare directly at the chiseled features of his employees. Markus nodded his head with a grin and Brandon stood there catching his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in good shape, if you want I can supervise him tomorrow and I think he'll be good to go.\" Markus said jovially. Josh nodded his head in agreement. He figured it would be a good test for Brandon to behave in front of guests while Markus is around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Markus cheered. \"Anyway, shorty here and I were talking and we wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head for a moment, curious. \"Sure, what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stepped forward, having now caught his breath. \"We wanted to see if you would hang out with us later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scratched his cheek and looked down at the ground. Somehow he didn't see this going well with how Brandon acts. \"I'm.. uh... not sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus pulled Brandon beside him and put his arm over his shoulder. \"Yo, come on. We're all old classmates. It'll be fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at Brandon's face as he started to huff over being forced next to Markus like that so suddenly. Taking a deep breath however Josh answered...      <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Brandon looked up at Markus, who let out a slight sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, getting this shrimp on the pay roll is probably more important anyway.\" Markus said as he squeezed Brandon in closer to him. Brandon quickly tried to struggle away from his larger friend and eventually pulled away from beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me getting money is more important!\" Brandon said with an arrogant smirk. \"Markus or I might've squashed you if you chilled with us anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the ground, a little distressed. He wasn't THAT small after all. But he shook it off, knowing Brandon didn't necessarily mean what he was saying right now. Looking up at Markus, Josh figured he could give the men an assignment for the rest of the day. \"Markus, could you just have Brandon shadow you until close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus shook his head in agreement. \"Yeah that way he'll learn a little first hand before I supervise him tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, glad to see at least Markus was always respectful of him, even when Brandon was around. He watched as the two muscled lifeguards walked over to the post by the wave pool and they started to allow people back into the pool. Josh looked once more at Brandon, who stood beside Markus with an actually serious look on his face, before turning away to head to his office and get working on getting Brandon into their records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at his clock in amazement. He couldn't believe how the hours could just fly by as they were just hitting closing time. Figuring he had the time, Josh got up out of his chair and made his way out of the office, hoping to catch Brandon and Markus in the break room before they leave. Feeling a little bad he turned down their invitation earlier, he thought at the very least he could see how Brandon did today and see if he learned the ropes well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door to the break room, Josh looked out to see the backs of both Brandon and Markus on the other side of the room. Josh smiled as he walked up right up to the edge of the balcony to call them over. Something caught his eye however, as Josh leaned over the edge of the balcony and saw Brandon's discarded clothes from earlier. Josh sighed as he wished the stubborn man would have just used a locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD THUD<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to lose his balance as Brandon turned around and started to walk over to his clothes. Hanging on as best he could Josh started to panic, hoping he wouldn't tumble off the balcony. As Brandon's footsteps pounded closer Josh...  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes, hoping there was someway someone would save him before he crashed on the floor below. Josh slowly opened his eyes. He stopped, seemingly unharmed. Looking around Josh could only see a dense tangle of dark fabric. It smelt slightly of deodorant and sweat and just as Josh realized where he was he toppled over as the cushion he was on was being picked up and moved. \"I'm in Brandon's clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fumbled as he was buried under Brandon's shirt, somewhere in the middle of the clothes. Hoping to find his way out and make contact, Josh started to work his way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, hurry up.\" Markus called to Brandon as he started to walk over with his clothes in hand. Brandon held the bundle of clothes tight to his chest so he wouldn't accidentally drop any as the two made their way out. Markus grinned as he and his old teammate made their way out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We going to your place, dude?\" Brandon asked as the pair made their way to a nearby bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just a short bus ride to the apartment. Yo, you sure you don't want to go to your place first?\" Markus asked, looked at Brandon's clothes still held in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, dude.\" Brandon said quickly, just honestly feeling too lazy to head to his new apartment first. The two sat on their spot on the bus for a few minutes, attracting a lot of wayward stares from several other bus goers with their impressive bodies, before eventually pulling in front of a new looking apartment complex only a short distance from the park. After getting off the bus, Markus lead Brandon to a near by building where his apartment was located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed as Markus opened the door to the smallish one bedroom apartment. \"I expected it to be bigger.\" Brandon joked as he nudged his friend in the stomach. \"Considering you're a giant and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel right at home then.\" Markus retaliated as he walked into a doorway leading to his room. Meanwhile Brandon, instinctively made his way to the couch, dropping his clothes on the floor in front of it in the process, between his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a lot of effort Josh saw light and made his way to the surface of the clothes. Looking straight up he was puzzled for a second before falling back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-legs!\" Josh stuttered as he looked around. \"And f-feet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't make out who's legs they were from his position, but if he had to guess, they would be Brandon's. To scared to move at the moment, Josh tried to figure out where the heck he was. The room was unfamiliar. In front of his he could see the edge of a couch, and behind him the legs of a coffee table. To the sides he could make out a few windows as well as a kitchen table and what looked like counter tops. With a few huge thuds, Josh cringed as he saw the entirety of Markus appear to his side, making his way out of a doorway. Josh looked up in awe. He was clad in just a pair of grey running shorts, with an orange stripe as well as a black flat rimmed hat on his head. Other than that his feet and torso were both bare, showing off his well trained muscles to Josh like some sort of god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you want a shirt or something?\" Markus asked as he lifted up a black tank top he was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good.\" Brandon said, looking down to admire his own body. \"You should cover up though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus threw the spare shirt back into his room with a smirk as he adjusted his hat on his head to the side better. \"You think you're better looking than me, shrimpy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nearly screamed as Brandon's legs moved over his position as the huge man stood up. Looking for only a second before he moved, Josh blushed as he stared up at Brandon's magnificent body all the way down from the floor. Unaware of the show he was giving, Brandon soon moved closer to Markus and stood beside him. Josh watched as both men were in full view was seemed like miles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See look dude, my pecs are bigger than yours.\" Brandon said cupping his chest. Markus laughed as he cupped his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude size doesn't mean everything. Mine might be a tiny bit smaller but they're even.\" Markus said with a dashing smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uneven my ass!\" Brandon retorted as he examined his chest a little closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of ass, mine's bigger than yours.\" Markus said turning slightly to show off his round bubble butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely! Besides my ass is even!\" Brandon snorted in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rested his chin on his fist. Amazed at what he was witnessing. \"Unbelievable. To think I tried to pass this up?\" Josh said to himself sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went on for awhile, comparing every muscle they could trying to prove who was better before laughing it off with each other with a playful bro-hug. Josh snapped back to reality as he saw the pair coming back over to the couch. Josh tried to move as best he could to get himself in a good position to be noticed once they sat back down.

Without warning, however, Josh found himself suddenly entrapped in darkness. Unable to see his hand in front of his face, Josh felt around his new prison, it was rough, almost skin like in fact. Confused, Josh poked around a little more before hearing the muffled voices of Brandon and Markus as his new prison started to elevate quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon raised his closed fist up to about his chest in height and looked down at it with a frown. Markus looked on, puzzled what his old teammate was holding. \"Yo, whatcha got, B?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked up with a disgusted look in response. \"Some bug crawling around in my clothes. Your floor is probably infested with them, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Or your clothes are, dude.\" Markus snipped back at his buddy, much to Brandon's dismay. Markus watched as Brandon started to clench his fist, readying to crush the puny insect out of existence. \"What you're just gonna crush it in your fist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stopped for a second. Still feeling the little creature squirm about in his hand. \"Well, it might have wings. I figured I'd just kill it like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus shook his head and clicked his tongue a little. \"That's boring. What you want me to go get you a newspaper too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed, not very fond of being mocked by his friend. \"Well what do you suggest we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus shook his head in frustration. \"Yo, I don't know! You used to be way more creative than this in high school. I remember one time at practice you swallowed a frog on a dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked down at his fist. He could swallow the pitiful bug. It was so small though, it wouldn't even put up a fight. Brandon looked up at his friend and grinned. \"Dude...\"      </span></div></div>",

Looking down in the mostly dark he could make out the opening to a vast, dark cave. Brandon's mouth. Squealing in fear, Josh tried to avert his attention elsewhere. He couldn't believe it. The muffled words he heard and hoped to be wrong were in fact the truth. Somehow he got mistake for a bug and was now dangling over his old bully's mouth, ready to be eaten in some idiotic bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no use!\" Josh cried with his eyes closed, not wanting to witness the cavern of horror that was sitting there gaping below him. The smell was already bad enough, a mixture of some amount of rotten smelling food and fresh gatorade wafted up from the seemingly bottomless pit of Brandon's throat. Hanging on desperately to some part of Brandon's hand, Josh knew he was only delaying the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh's hand started to finally slip, he...      </span></div></div>",

Laying for only a second, Josh realized Brandon's mouth was starting to level flat, however it was also starting to close. Getting up, Josh stumbled as quickly as he could toward the rapidly vanishing light, hoping somehow he could make a grand escape. Outside Brandon's almost shut mouth Josh caught a glimpse of Markus's body, just before the smelly cavern closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Josh wept as he was shut in total darkness. The smell from Brandon's throat started to waft up even worse now that it had no where to escape, Josh held back tears and gagged slightly as his old bully's breath enveloped him. Sloshing through Brandon's thick saliva, Josh was determined. He knew he only had once chance, and it was to keep moving forward, and hope that against all odds he could somehow position himself to safety before Brandon swallows him whole. Without delay, Josh pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo. What's the hold up, dude?\" Markus asked impatiently as he watched his friend close his mouth finally. Brandon simply smirked, not wanted to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that little guy was holding on pretty tight. Didn't wanna get eaten, dude.\" Markus chuckled as Brandon shrugged his shoulders arrogantly. \"You gonna swallow that thing or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon held up a finger, indicating Markus to give him a minute as his eyes wandered in concentration. Markus nodded, in understanding. \"Trying to feel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon slowly shook his head, continuing to search for the pitifully small creature in his mouth. A minute went by and Brandon was sick of trying to find the bug. With a tremendous gulp, Brandon simply tried to send the critter down no matter where it was in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't find it. Damn thing was way too little.\" Brandon scoffed as he looked at his buddy a little disappointed. \"Whatever, it's in here somewhere now.\" Brandon added as he rubbed his abs a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus laughed at his friend's disappointment. \"Yo, what did you expect, man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shrugged, \"I don't know, man.

Deciding it was his only way out, Josh started to scale the somewhat slick surface. Brandon's loud voice didn't make matters any easier as Josh struggled to make his way up, but somehow luck must have been on his side this whole time as he peeked over the top, getting a view of the outside world once more. Resting for a second, Josh looked out, seeing Markus's laughing face. Josh sobbed for a second to himself. After all he had no idea where to go with his climb now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, an potential answer began to rumble behind Josh. A faint gurgle erupted from Brandon's throat, growing larger in size until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUURRRP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as he found himself being flung through the air. Closing his eyes, Josh didn't dare look to see where he could possibly meet his end as he figured he'd eventually come crashing down on the floor with enormous force. Finally, Josh landed. The surface was hard, but not floor-hard. He couldn't really make out where he was for a second while he got his bearings straight. That is until he nearly crawled off a cliff. With a fearful leap, Josh jumped with his back against this somewhat soft \"wall\". Looking above him he saw what seemed like a ceiling that stops at the same point the cliff starts from here he was standing. To his sides he could see another end to this cliff followed by another landing in the distance. Suddenly, everything moved as he landing spot was most certainly mobile. Holding on tight Josh finally realized, it was skin. Not only that the dark coloration was certainly Markus's. Looking over the cliff Josh made out several features. Belly button, shorts, legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord, I'm in one of the ridges of his abs...\" Josh whispered to himself as he backed up into the wall once more. Josh heard Markus's distant voice far above him, his abs contracting slightly with each breath he took as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dude!\" Markus laughed as Brandon shook his head happily. \"That bug is toast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked out, being able to make out most of Brandon's body from his vantage point. The huge man arrogantly stroked his muscled stomach, proud of the burp he just let loose. Judging by what Markus said however, Josh smiled as he figured they must believe Brandon swallowed him. With a slight sigh of relief, Josh moved around hoping to find a way out of this new mess he was so unceremoniously launched into. Meanwhile...          </span></div></div>",

Tears flowing from his eyes, he held his position as long as he could before his mouth was sore. Letting go finally, Josh fell backwards. Tired and scared, he awaited his fall to land him in the sticky wetness of Brandon's tongue. After laying for a second he realized he was still in Brandon's hand and looked up at Brandon's disgruntled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, what's wrong?\" Markus questioned as he walked his way over next to Brandon to look down at the speck in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it bit me.\" Brandon said while not looking very closely at what he still assumed to be a bug. Closing his fist back around it he looked up at his friend. \"I don't know if I wanna eat it if it's gonna go munching on my insides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus laughed. \"Dude, that's what you're worried about? It's so small you wouldn't even feel it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever dude. I'm just gonna crush it with my hands.\" Brandon said as he set down the gatorade bottle on the coffee table. Markus huffed, thinking just crushing the pest was uncreative and boring. Brandon rolled his eyes at his enormous friend and tried to compromise. \"I'll lick up it's guts afterwards. Will that make you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus nodded his head with a toothy smile, much to Brandon's satisfaction. \"Giant baby.\" Brandon mocked the man as he opened up his hand to see the tired pest still resting in the same spot. Taking his other hand, Brandon brought it over hovering it ready to clap the little biting pest to smithereens. Markus peeked a little closer to look at the bug, smirking to himself that he convinced Brandon to eat bug guts afterwards. Brandon readied his hand to come down in a triumphant clap and...     </span></div></div>",

Brandon almost jumped in surprise, not expecting this sudden intervention at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, holy shit dude. What?\" Brandon panted as Markus looked closer down on Brandon's hand. Markus looked at Brandon's face with a scared look in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ain't no bug, dude.\" Markus said almost shaking. \"It's Josh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon moved his other hand immediately away from over the speck and looked closer. Sure enough Brandon squinted to see little arms and legs and a head. The makings of a person. On even closer inspection he swallowed upon making out Josh's features. Markus backed up as he let Brandon realize what almost happened. Brandon looked down at Josh, astonished. Finally, he spoke to the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... You bit me! What the hell man!\" Brandon spouted angrily at Josh's exhausted body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus blinked before going back over to Brandon and grabbing his hand before he did anything he'd regret. \"Yo, you almost at the man. Dude was just protecting himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only almost did it because you told me to!\" Brandon retorted, wanting to defend himself some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah only because you were just going to crush him! If I didn't tell you to eat him he'd be pulverized right now!\" Markus yelled back, not wanting to take the blame either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell is he even here? Why was he in my clothes?\" Brandon yelled hoping to garner answers from thin air. Markus meanwhile tried to calm down both himself and Brandon as he walked him over to the kitchen table. Grabbing a napkin Markus instructed Brandon to carefully slide Josh off onto the napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he alive?\" Brandon asked looking down closely at the unmoving man. Moving a finger down, Brandon went to poke the man before having his hand slapped away by Markus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He bit you didn't he? He's alive, probably unconscious or just exhausted. Leave him be for now.\" Markus ordered as Brandon stood back up to his full height and shrugged casually before walking away. Markus shook his head as he looked over at Josh, still motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened his eyes. Rubbing them slightly he couldn't figure out where he was or what could have happened. Looking down he only saw white, a napkin it would seem. Around him he noticed the familiar setting of the small apartment he was in. \"Guess it wasn't a dream.\" Josh frowned to himself as he tried to spot Brandon or Markus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo boss!\" Josh heard the familiar voice call from behind him. Turning he saw Brandon and Markus sitting at the table together, eating what looked like ramen noodles. Stumbling to his feet, Josh waved at the pair of men, to which Markus smiled, where as Brandon kept the same sour look as he sucked up a massive string of noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" Markus asked leaning forward to look at the tiny man. Josh rubbed the back of his neck as the huge man's face loomed in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine that was quite the fiasco though...\" Josh said, trying not to make too big of a deal out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon swallowed his food hard, and wiped his mouth before leaning forward as well. \"What were you doing in my clothes?\" He asked boisterously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rubbed his chin thinking back to earlier in the day. \"I came to the break room to see how you guys did today, and I sort of just lost my balance and fell right into them. I was lucky they were there or I could have been hurt pretty bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sat back, sour expression unchanging. \"Yeah I bet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt a bit of a sting behind the words. It was the truth after all, he didn't understand why Brandon had to be such a suspicious brat about it. Shaking the thought Josh figured it would be best to just ignore Brandon's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus shifted slightly in the awkward silent for a second before standing up. \"Yo, I gotta piss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the huge man stomped away into the near by bathroom, shutting the door behind him. Josh looked a little fearfully toward Brandon. The look on his face told Josh he was...         </span></div></div>",

Leaning forward, Brandon reached out and casually scooped the tiny man into his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" Josh asked nervously, shocked at his sudden relocation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just \"happened\" to fall in my clothes?\" Brandon asked, whispering scornfully into his hand. \"I don't believe that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth! Why in the world would I <i>want</i> to be in this situation?\" Josh asked, hoping to get through to the angry giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon chuckled. \"You were always so quiet in high school. No one could read you. What makes me want to believe you? This could be some weird fetish of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed. Sure he found shrinking to be exhilarating, but he never ever intended to put himself in danger no matter now \"neat\" shrinking was. \"That's ridiculous! Nobody would be dumb enough to hitch hike on a pile of clothes while being like a fourth of an inch tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon leaned back and scratched his stomach with his free hand. His face seemed to find it at least half believable, for the moment anyway. Looking up at the giant's face, Josh desperately wanted Brandon to believe him. He felt terrible that after all the strides they made today to get along could end this poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Brandon, I just want to go home. Trust me.\" Josh begged the smug looking man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that, the last bus left 5 minutes before you woke up...\" Brandon said slowing his words as he said them. \"That's convenient isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's jaw dropped. Brandon was legitimately accusing Josh of being passed out too long... on purpose? \"Yeah next time I slip into unconsciousness after almost being eaten I'll make sure I wake up in time to make the last bus.\" Josh snapped at the man angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and take that tone.\" Brandon replied, acting like he should be the one in control. \"Blame me all you want. Just like Markus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not blaming anyone, I just want you to believe me. It's not anyone's fault!\" Josh pleaded hoping it might ease Brandon's mood a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon thought quickly as he heard the sink water running in the other room, knowing Markus would reemerge any second. \"Well...\" He started...     </span></div></div>",

In the mean time, we're gonna play a little game called \"Make Markus the bad guy and Brandon the good guy\".\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked confused, his joy was short lived after all. \"What?\" Josh asked with a blink as he watched Brandon's face twist into a smile. In a flash, Josh found himself being dropped, before splashing into a hot liquid of sorts. Trying to find a responsible spot to float, Josh quickly spotted a pale looking floating object. Making his way to it, Josh latched on and looked around his hot new environment. \"I'm in a bowel of ramen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked down in Markus's bowl. After watching Josh swim pitifully toward a noodle, he figured his job was done. Leaning back, he decided to think over what Josh said to him. Looking to his side though he saw Markus walking over, wiping his wet hands on his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That took awhile.\" Brandon smirked at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Yo where's Josh at?\" Markus asked looking over at the napkin as he sat back down at his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon started to lift some ramen to his face as he replied. \"Said the light was bothering him, I think he crawled under the napkin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gotcha. Poor little guy.\" Markus said as he lifted up some noodles for himself. Brandon looked out of the corner of his eye trying to catch Josh's tiny form in the mess of noodles Markus was about to shovel into his gaping mouth. Noticing the tiny man managed to avoid the first bite, he went back to enjoying his own food, as well as determining whether to help the little man or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus finished slurping up his noodles before nearly swallowing the mouthful completely whole. With an audible gulp, Brandon watched as the huge man's adam's apple bobbed dramatically as his powerful throat muscles sent it's meal down to it's final destination. Brandon sat back in thought for a second. Even if the tiny guy was lying, did he really deserve to get pulled down into some guy's stomach like that? Pondering for a moment, Brandon looked over at Markus again who pulled another massive mouthful of noodles up out of his bowl. As the behemoth of a man started to lick his lips, Brandon noticed a tiny struggling speck, just in the middle of the mess of noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had to make up his mind fast... did that little guy really deserve this? Brandon thought to himself...         </span></div></div>",

Go get em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh approached the door to the interview room, grabbing the door knob and opened the door. Fresh air rushed out the door into Josh's face as the huge room opened up to him. Josh approached a balcony for him to stand on as he was still but a mere 1/4th of an inch tall compared to the massive interviewee across from him, seated at a chair at a hulking 6'4\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh walked to the edge of the balcony, he tried to take in this new massive giant's appearance. He wore a tight looking long sleeved  white collared shirt with khaki pants, tucked in with a brown belt. He had short spiky blonde hair and his deep blue eyes were slightly obstructed by a pair of thin looking glasses. Josh looked at his face, he was insanely handsome, but gave off a look like he really was extremely intelligent. He definitely made a really good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed his fear slightly as he moved forward to address the devilishly handsome giant. \"Trevor, right?\" Josh started. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, my name is Josh. I'll be interviewing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, that's sweet!\" Trevor spoke up, taking off his glasses and looking closer that Josh. \"I read about this place extensively, but I never would have thought I'd be interviewed by an actual tiny human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was shocked at how Trevor spoke. He simultaneously sounded very smart, but also very much like a typical frat bro. \"Oh good, I'm glad you heard about us first.\" Josh acknowledged Trevor's awareness. \"Well I just want to say I'm really impressed by your resume. But I'm curious why you wouldn't be applying to a hospital or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be honest with you dude, I already am.\" Trevor spoke again, feeling proper yet still informal. \"But I really need an escape a few days a week. Something to get me away from the books and internships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable. So you're under a lot of pressure?\" Josh asked, feeling like he was in a similar place when he was at college not long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude. It's a lot.\" Trevor frowned a little. \"Plus it's like... Everyone expects me to be some genius but I'd rather just be myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Josh felt like he was repeating himself. \"Well I don't think any of the guys here would have any expectations for you. Besides they're all very friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good.\" Trevor smiled, a little relieved. \"I'm always surrounded by uppity professors and know it all nerds. My only real escape was going to the gym. But dude... everyone there knows about my grade so all the cool dudes just look at me and laugh like I'm trying to prove something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you want my opinion.\" Josh looked at the handsome blonde. \"I think...\"             </span></div></div>",

Don't like telling someone so desperate that we don't need em.\" With that, he opens his minature door to the interview room to meet his potential new lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one word on that resume is not padded at all. Jon is built like a tank and to Josh, more mountain than man. He certainly is aloof though. He doesn't have the classiest wardrobe and from the look of his thin athletic shorts and running shoes, he must've stopped here after a long jog. His tank top and shorts are stretched over his muscular features. His pecs literally hold up the tank top and stretches it tight over his torso. From the looks of it too, he doesn't look bored. His head rocks back and forth, shaking the long wires of his earbuds leading to his walkman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh resumes his intended purpose as he gets on his miniature elevator to take him in the interviewer's seat. But when the door opens to the top, the doorway is blocked. Apparently Jon has used this seat as a footrest, blocking the way out for his potential boss. Josh sets up his microphone and tries a polite approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Jon...can you please move your feet please so we can start the interview?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no response. Poor Josh can't shout louder than Jon's music. He tries again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please move your feet so we can get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the rubber wall of the sole moves away from the elevator door. He must've had his earbuds pop out or something, but Josh bites his tongue. He looks far more attentive now, scanning the room behind his dark shades for the source of the voice. He has his audience now, relief returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Josh - the head of the Shrink and Swim. I am here to interview you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon yanks off his earbuds, still puzzled. \"Down here...\" Josh guides him so they make eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty small for a boss,\" Jon's perplexed look remains as he slides off his shades. \"Are you like an ant or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just a tiny guy who owns the Shrink and Swim,\" The interview begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brought you here?\"</span></div></div>",

Um.\" Josh fretted a second time. \"Well like I said, I usually just don't have the time. Plus I was running late. But I suppose more often than not I prefer to conduct the interviews like this. Hence why I had the room designed around it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you like being tiny?\" Jon pointed out casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Josh felt like he was backed into a corner.

It wasn't the best answer he could have expected, but it was a valid one none the less. \"How did you hear about this job and what do you know about the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw an ad at my school. Saw the pay was better than a campus job, plus I life guarded a few years ago.\" Jon answered. \"As for how much I know... where even is the park? Also I still don't understand why you're so small. You sure you aren't an ant, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... pretty sure.\" Josh answered, slightly annoyed. \"I guess I could've done a better job of explaining before though, I just assumed you knew about Shrink and Swim before you applied.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jon apologized in a fairly dull tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Basically the park is very small and the guests and everyone all shrink down to go inside the park. Then once inside you'll see how everything appears so huge and expansive, but in reality it's only taking up a er small area on the outside.\" Josh explained as quickly and simply as he could. \"It uses a high tech shrinking system I created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I guess maybe I did hear about this place. Like it was on the news or something.\" Jon answered. \"I thought it was like fake news or something though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you can see by me, it's not fake at all.\" Josh smiled, happy to blow a mind or two when the chance came up to show off his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to be small all the time though, do I?\" Jon asked, awkwardly, not really liking the idea of people being bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, the life guards have a special break room in the back they can go in and out of at normal size whenever they'd like.\" Josh explained, hoping to reassure the attractive teen. \"Oh also the break room has a small gym in it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, dude that's great!\" Jon beamed. \"I'd love working out on my breaks. Need to make those gains, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh mulled, feeling like Jon was far too comfortable thinking Josh had already decided to hire him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do I start, dude?\" Jon asked, eager to make money while still adding to his workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I hadn't really made a decision yet.\" Josh answered, hoping not to upset the 6'7\" adonis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Jon asked getting kind of an intense expression on his face now. \"I need an answer, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\" Josh felt uncomfortable looking at the attractive meat head's face as it went quickly from excited to dead serious in an instant. Josh had to make a choice deciding to....    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Also, I think you haven't checked the Skin Burner yet today right?\" Tyler said quickly to his short boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn...\" Josh thought. \"Ok, Tyler you're on break now right?\" He questioned the hunky lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding his head he understood what Josh was thinking. \"I should be able to cover him fine. Plus I love doing the Skin Burner! Girls always scream before they go down!\" He laughed to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I could count on you!\" Josh said, reaching up and putting a hand on the young man's shoulder. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked together back past the wave pool taking a left down a path to the speed slides. Quickly, they moved past the line of patient park goers as they made their way up the long wooden stair case to the top of the slide. Tyler was sure to giggle every time someone screamed on their way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, reaching the top Josh looked over at the lifeguard stationed at the front of the tube, Matt. The young man practically looked like a surfer dude. He was 22 years old and around 6'4\" with short blonde hair and blue eyes that were almost always covered by his dark sunglasses. He was quite lean, but his thin body showed off his solid abs and round pecs all the better. Like always, he sported a shark tooth necklace, letting the tooth itself rest careless between his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, boss! You finally got my message!\" Matt said as he just let a young boy slide down the vertical slope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry for the delay, Matt. Tyler's here to relieve you.\" Josh said watching as the impatient patrons at the top wanted to finally go down the slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people started staring at the one called \"Tyler\" with angry eyes. Wanting him to hurry up and swap places with the blonde. \"All yours, Ty.\" Josh said nudging his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Tyler said seeing that young boy made it to the bottom. \"You're good to go mam.\" He said to the mother waiting to meet her son at the bottom. The woman screamed in a shrill pitch as she dropped down the slide much to Tyler's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back down the stairs Matt turned to his boss. \"Yo Josh? I gotta ask you something man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping it could wait Josh replied, \"I still need to inspect the ride. Could I meet you in like 10 minutes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure dude, I'll wait for you in the break room.\" He said casually as he ran one of his hands through his hair.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what's up?\" Josh thought as the muscular man walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his inspection of the ride, Josh realized it had already been over 10 minutes. \"Uh oh, better just hurry over.\" Josh thought as he darted off to the entrance to the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, he looked out across the magnificent room. It was basically a normal looking break room with a kitchen, lounge, bathroom, and even a little work out room. The key difference was that from the park side there were balconies so that anybody coming in while shrunk will be able to maneuver the expansive rooms without fear of being crushed by someone full sized in the rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked out at the kitchen table and saw Matt sitting there, sipping at a blue sports drink. Walking up to a microphone designed to talk to someone across the room Josh spoke into it to get the surfer dude's attention. Hearing his boss's voice, the young man springs up and walks over to the balcony to better see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt squatted down to get a better view of the about knee high balcony. \"Yo dude, I was starting to think you forgot!\" He said setting his massive drink down on the balcony next to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shook as the massive bottle slammed to the ground. Ignoring the action though Josh addressed his employee. \"Yeah I'm sorry I just got held up inspecting the ride.\" He said scratching the back of his neck. \"What was it you needed to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through his shades at his tiny boss he said, \"I wanted to ask about... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

You already look fine, just put some normal clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that dude.

I mean you couldn't just use the mirror in the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head, \"No can do I already tried. I have something stuck good in my teeth way in back!\" He said opening his mouth and sticking his finger in. \"Then look at this blonde hair sticking out of my nose!\" He said trying to pull on a tiny hair barely sticking out of his nose. \"Dude I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed a second time. He couldn't believe he was actually debating helping him, but at this point it was too sad to see him struggle. \"Ok Matt, But I'm only doing one. Which do you care about more, teeth or nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shot up delighted that his little boss agreed to help him.

But please be careful while I'm in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big surfer guy beams with delight. \"Of course, of course! I'll breathe though my mouth! I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're in agreement.\" Josh steps forwards so Matt can lower his index finger for the little man to climb aboard. He almost falls off it as he gets carried closer and closer to the nostrils. He can definitely feel the gale-like gusts of air entering and leaving his lungs through them. \"Are you sure I can handle this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, man.\" Matt pulls back for a second. \"It's like pulling weeds, I think. Should be easy for your little hands, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Josh sighs. \"I'm ready. Take me in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lowers his finger in the gap between his nostrils and lips, letting Josh climb off it and resume the rest of the trip. \"Damn, I should've asked if he wanted both nostrils done...oh well...\" Josh thinks to himself. The left one looks closer to him and an easier ascent into it. Josh climbs inside Matt's nose to do some hair removal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe howling wind through the fleshy cave slows upon his entry. \"Matt must've remembered our deal...good...\" With no wind to face, Josh stands up again to start plucking nose hairs. The carpet almost goes up to his shoulders - this will be hard. Josh hesitates as he prepares his hands for the first plucking. He grabs one. Moisture from the cave makes the hair stalk hard to make a firm grip, so he wraps it a little around his forearm. This will give him some leverage. Josh inhales to find his strength and yanks with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERRRRRRRRRRRRR...OOOOOOOH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair pops out of the follicle. It was a stubborn one, but only one hair out of dozens Matt needs cleared out his nose for his date. So far he's been good at controlling his breath - a testament to a life as a lifeguard and surfer. But he has no control of the involentary actions of his body. The pulled hair must've set off some nerves, signalling his brain of the damage. The cave floor writhes in retaliation. As Josh moves to pluck another hair, he can feel his feet getting a little heavier. Matt's nose is doing what it does best to strange things inside it - glue it down with mucus. Josh pushes faster. \"If I don't speed up, I'm gonna become a human boogar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hair gets plucked. This time, Matt can't help himself with the reaction. Hurricane winds rush into the nostril cave, slamming against Josh. \"Dammit Matt! Breathe through your mouth! I'm still in here!\" The normal rhythm of Matt's respiration resumes, but now his tiny boss faces it with full force. He grabs hold on one more hair, but the cave has gotten wetter since he first entered it. He slides off this safety line and now ends up...</span></div></div>",

Nothing, dude.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, dude. Here's what I need you to do. You're small enough so you can go...\" He started to say when Josh interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooope! Nope. No. I am not, repeat not. Going in after it.\" Josh said starting to turn away from the giant blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dude! Wait!\" He said putting a head in front of Josh to stop him from leaving. \"Look you can wear a little harness from the park, and we can use some floss from the bathroom as a safety line to pull you and the whistle up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned back and looked at the giant man again. \"I said no!\" he said trying to climb over the surfer's gigantic hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his hand around Matt tried desperately from letting the little man squirm away. Finally, catching him in the palm of his hand he looked down at him with a sad looking frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's like all plastic and there's that little metal ball in it! What if it's stuck somewhere in me man!\" He said rubbing his abs. \"I'm freaking out, dude! Please help...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, looked up at Matt's panicked face and said...    </span></div></div>",

Looking proudly down at pile of papers he was glad to not have any real work for the next few days. Josh's stomach suddenly growled as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... I worked so late I skipped dinner...\" Josh thought as he was wondering what he wanted for food. \"I'll just grab something from the break room.\" Josh said to himself remembering he had some leftovers in a little section of the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to the door Josh opened the door to a booming noise of yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOH DUDE DID YOU SEE THAT?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right I forgot I told them they could use the room...\" Josh said covering his ears and looking out over the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lounge Josh saw four massive figures. One of which he knew was Matt and after close inspection he made a note of the other three. They were all lifeguards at his park, Luke, Blake, and Brett. Seemingly they must have just never changed their clothes as all the men were still shirtless and wearing only red board shorts and sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started his inspection from how they were seated. Luke was at the end of the couch on the far left, he was 23 years old and was 6'3\" with buzzed blonde hair and greenish eyes. He had a similar body type to Matt's except he was a little more thickly muscled than the thinner surfer dude. He also had a tattoo of a bird on his back, in the center between his shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, was Blake. He was 21 years old and was 6'7\" with  semi curly short black hair and brown eyes. He was very well built and had well defined muscles covering his body. He was a very helpful guy, but his biggest flaw was in fact his size. He was pretty clumsy and forgets his own strength a lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the man sitting on the end of the couch was Brett. He's 22 years old and apparently was in the same class as Matt as he remembered them both knowing each other when they both join his staff. He was 6'5\" with mid length shaggy brown hair and blue eyes. He was also a pretty similar build to Matt however he sculpted his body extremely well as he often showed off his 8 pack on his long abdomen. Brett also had a tattoo of some Japanese symbols on left pec. \"Courage\" and \"Strength\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he looked out into the kitchen and saw that so far the men had been mostly clean. There were a few open boxes of wings sitting on the kitchen table as well as some sports drinks and beers, but everything was fairly neatly organized. Finally, the smell wafted into Josh's nose from he wings. They smelt incredible... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked out at the giant men again, not wanting to disturb them. \"They're all so focused on the game I could just snag a bit of wings and head out...\" Josh said to himself. \"Or I could go to the counter and just grab some of my leftovers from the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to use the elevator to head to...      </span></div></div>",

As the door opens, he gives a satisfied glance at his surroundings. Nothing is blocking the doorway. Nothing has been spilled on the counter. Every beer can and sports drink bottle stands upright on makeshift napkin coasters. He smiles. \"They've done well,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the inspection is not his greatest concern. In the skyline of cans and bottles, he spots an enormous cardboard box. The lid is open only a crack, but it is enough for Josh to smell the wings inside it. His stomach roars with hunger. He checks the horizon for any of the four boys, but none can be seen. The game continues on the TV, as does their cheering. Josh makes a mad scramble to the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cardboard edge is higher than Josh, but he can just reach it if he jumps a little. Hungry and hopping, one hand hooks over the edge. The other follows and now, Josh levers himself up the cardboard wall and falls right inside the wing box. He lands on a soggy grease patch, but he doesn't care. A modest-sized fried chicken wing sits before him, ready for the little guy to take his first bite. Josh runs to it before wrapping his hands around a clump of breading on the skin. He tears it off and bites into it. It tastes as good as it smells. Too bad a lunch for him would be nothing more than the skin. \"If only I can haul this back to the fridge,\" Josh contemplates. \"This'll last me for weeks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the box shakes violently and Josh falls onto the solid wing for stability. But even the wing itself slides along its greasy pool, taking him along for the shuffle. The dark canopy of the box lid opens and a giant hand reaches inside. Josh dives for cover in the shadow of the breaded chicken as a large wing gets carried off into the sky. He peeks around the shadow of his wing to notice the giant face biting into the taken food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake!\" Josh says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's head turns to a nearby voice beyond the box. \"Hey man! Save some for the rest of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Brett,\" Blake responds with a full mouth and half-eaten chicken wing in hand. \"You wouldn't believe how hungry I am.\" He lowers the box into his lap, giving his unaware passenger a good view of his enormous muscled body. Josh can't see his eyes too well, but his chin and neck; though even those are obscured by the built giant's beefy pecs. He reaches inside for another wing...</span></div></div>",

Swearing he even heard Blake's massive gut groan in appreciation as his bite of food made it into the deep recess of his body, Josh figured it was best to hide from the hungry giant. Remembering he pulled some of the skin off the piece of chicken he was near, he decided to climb into the little hole. Hoping not t get scooped up in Blake's feeding frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Josh finished wedging himself in the chicken, he noticed the piece start to leave the safety of the ground. Josh turned in terror to see the wing being lifted rapidly out of the box, moving up and toward Blake's handsome face. Frozen in fear, Josh watched as Blake took an enormous bite right next to him, narrowing scooping him into the mess of food being chewed in the stud's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he had to do something, anything! But all he could do was watch as Blake swallowed the piece of meat and his mouth leaned in, taking another bite. Luckily, Josh somehow still hasn't been the target of Blake's ravenous mouth, but considering his location Josh knew it was only a matter of time before he officially becomes part of Blake's meal.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly looked around, trying to take in his surroundings. To his left he could see the edge of the sofa, which there was no way jumping that way would be anything but fatal. Below him he could see the open box of chicken, with food still littered about in the greasy container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just end up on another piece of chicken if I land in there!\" Josh thought as he panicked and looked to his right. He couldn't believe it, he saw Brett sitting there but that wasn't the unbelievable part. There was a healthy amount of sofa space between Brett and Blake where Josh thinks he might be able to land if he could just work up the courage to jump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped back to reality as he heard Blake swallow his piece of chicken down with a very audible gulp. Looking at the massive mouth before him, Josh saw it open wide giving him a horrific view of pieces of food spewn about in the saliva coated chamber.

Instead the muscle giant pulls another larger breaded wing and bites into it. The little man watches the short ordeal. It didn't take long for him to chew it down to the bone before throwing it aside - a meal that would last tiny Josh for a week or two just downed in only a minute. The lump descending Blake's neck chills him to the core. Chances are he would be the one in that lump, sent all expenses paid by Blake to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway from his view, Brett sounds annoyed. \"Don't hog em all, dude!\" Blake reaches for another wing, then recoils as a second hand from Josh's left-hand view descends towards him. He dives into the hole he made in the skin, the ordeal repeats. But this time, he feels his wing get lifted from the box. He stops hiding, holding onto the breaded skin for dear life as he gets a view of everything going on. He can see Brett, recognizing his pec tattoo for a brief second before only his face is visible. It's like his face is a new and frightening planet approaching the wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, but I'm a growing boy,\" Blake laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett wrinkles his lips. \"I think you've done enough growing...\" All the while his eyes make no contact with Josh. Now his mouth opens. Josh can see his tongue wet with saliva. Everything is drenched in it - his tongue, teeth, and even the back of his throat. He must be really hungry. But it now gets closer and closer to Josh. The jaws part and lips retract, ready for the first bite into his chicken wing without any awareness of his tiny boss on its greasy breaded surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh panics and finds an option. If he jumps, he might be able to abandon ship just before Brett could chew or swallow him. He readies to leap as Brett's mouth gets really close and jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Josh land?</span></div></div>",

Josh screamed as he fell from the tooth, straight down to the front of Brett's mouth. Somehow he manage to stay away from the tip of Brett's tongue as he slide down along the gums of Brett's bottom teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered despite the warmth the saliva coated cavern was providing, as the view was absolutely intense. The tiny park owner could see Brett's jaw moving up and down, crushing the pieces of chicken into smaller, more easily digestible pieces before pooling all of the mush together into the middle of his tongue. With an intense rush, all of the food was suddenly sucked back, down the throat with a deafening gulp. All Josh could see in the vast distance of the now empty cave was Brett's enormous uvula swaying back and fourth as it waved good bye to the food just sent down to Brett's hungry stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am definitely not safe...\" Josh stated the obvious in an attempt to make himself at least somewhat better. Just then Brett's mouth flooded with light as a fresh piece of chicken was being torn apart and sent to the edges of Brett's mouth to be chewed. Josh watched as second time as the chicken was chewed up equally as horrifically before being swallowed down by Brett's powerful throat. Josh couldn't believe his luck that he only ended up in the front of Brett's mouth. He easily could have been sent down in either of those globs of meat, and Brett would be none the wiser to his dire situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs minutes went by, Josh watched piece after piece of chicken get destroyed before being swallowed down by Brett. He knew he wasn't going to last much longer in here, both psychologically and physically. He had to come up with a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY YOU FINISHED THE LAST PIECE?\" Brett's voice boomed out over Josh like a hurricane. He had to cover his ears since the massive man's voice was so loud. That being said Josh almost leap for joy at the words he heard. This meant at the very least he didn't have to witness Brett devour any more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I could get out of here!\" Josh realized. Since Brett wasn't stuffing his face anymore, it gave him an opening to climb the gums and teeth and leap his way out of this foul cavern. Figuring it was his only chance, Josh looked at the slick surface of the gums and dug his hands in to establish some sort of grip and begin his climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes... </span></div></div>",

If they don't score, You give me ten bucks and you eat the bug!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a second Brett didn't really like the idea of eating a bug... however he also figured the chances of Luke's team scoring on their next play were pretty low...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on dude. Better get that money ready and scoop that bug in that cup for yourself.\" He said taunting his friend and shaking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Luke, flipped the cup over and brushed what he thought was a bug into the bottom. Brett walked over and looked in the cup. \"Its not gonna fly out is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a plate and putting it over the top and resting it on the counter Luke replied. \"No way it'll get out now, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men grabbed their drinks and Luke grabbed his wings and they walked over to the tv where Matt and Blake were still waiting. \"Dudes hurry up! What took you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just making a bet!\" Luke said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned his head to Brett and asked, \"About what dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett took a sip of his drink and shook his head. \"Luke caught a bug and he's gonna eat it and give me ten bucks when his team doesn't score on this play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude but if they do score he's gotta eat the little nasty and owes me the bucks!\" Luke said back as he tore a bit of meat off his wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four stopped to watch the tv as the game came back on.

He stood up and turned to Luke who had already run out to the kitchen and retrieved the cupped bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude!

His shrill screams went unheard among the loud cheering giants as he was eventually dumped into one of his employee's mouths. Only did he have one last glimpse at freedom as his prison opened up to show the faces of Blake, Matt, and Luke. As the teeth started to come down to a close, Josh gave all in energy in one call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRREEEEEEETTTTT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed trying desperately to over power the other three men's tremendous voices. Looking around Josh saw Brett's tongue move up and down nervously. With a glimmer of hope Josh thought Brett was hesitating in this ridiculous bet. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett's adam's apple bobbed very slightly as he swallowed down what he thought was just some pathetic little bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dude!\" Luke said giving his friend a nod of approval. \"Do you feel it squirming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett put a hand on his chest. He did in fact feel something... \"Yeah sorta. I think its stuck... almost feels like a little chip stuck in your throat... except it moves a little bit..\" He said giving his chest a few good whacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately holding on to a fold of skin Josh somehow caught himself from tumbling cleanly down the throat. Clinging for dear life Josh could feel his grip loosen as the tube started to whip back and fourth violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please! Brett you have to stop this!\" Josh cried out in horror. Suddenly Josh heard another gulp coming form above him as a river of some kind of liquid came rushing down the throat, dragging him down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrewing back on the top of his sports drink Brett felt his chest again. \"Yeah dude. It's gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three other men congratulated Brett for over coming such a feat as sarcastically as possible. Brett pushed away his friends and walked to the bathroom with his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning and looking at himself in the mirror he smirked to himself, flexing his vintage 8 pack. \"You're one sexy dude Brett.\" He said to himself arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another chug of his drink, he looked back down at his stomach and rubbed it. \"Eh, I guess that bug is lucky I ate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing in the mirror some more he gave his stomach a light pat. \"Gets to be part of these abs!\" He said laughing to himself and walking out of the bathroom to rejoin his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done looking at yourself in the mirror little Miss Brett?\" Luke taunted from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takes a lot to look as good as me, you can't really relate though can you, Luke?\" He said stepping in front of the other man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your face dude!\" He said punching Brett in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt yourself there.\" Brett said without flinching and retaking his seat. \"Uuuuurrrp! Oh 'scuse me.\" Brett said patting his stomach some more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Luke, needed that dude.\" He said smirking at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the four guys the rest of the night went on perfectly. Much to Brett's disappointment Luke's team did end up winning. After the two exchanged a few friendly punches Matt broke them up, reminding them that he promised Josh that the break room would be spotless tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning up their mess and wiping down all the tables the four men bid each other good night. Brett went about on his way home, still upset that his team lost and he was out ten bucks to Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still can't believe I had to eat that dumb bug...\" He said to himself walking into his apartment. That was the last he ever thought about the bug as he took a shower and brushed his teeth. It never even crossed his mind that he unknowingly did away with his tiny boss that night.       </span></div></div>",

He opened his mouth, making sure to keep his tongue flat and the bug concealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job dude! Do you feel it moving?\" Luke asked excitedly as Brett sat back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude its too small.\" He said nonchalantly as he put his hands behind his neck and stretched out his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, Josh held onto the bottom of Brett's tongue. Somehow he wasn't sure entirely what happened, but he was safely tucked under the muscle. Trying not to move, Josh thought maybe Brett really did think he swallowed him. \"Maybe he doesn't realize I'm here...\" Josh said to himself without moving an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on and Josh continued to nervously grip the tongue as he could hear and feel food and liquids passing just above him on its way down to Brett's hungry stomach. Every word Brett blurted was amplified to tremendous decibels, and as much as it made Josh flinch he didn't dare move at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he heard the guys talking about leaving. Hoping maybe this torture was over Josh looked forward to escaping from Brett's slimy smelly mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys we gotta make sure to clean up.\" Matt said as he started piling in paper plates and cups into the trash can. \"I promised Josh it'd be spotless tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men worked together diligently for a few minutes until the room was how they found it. Bidding each other good night the four split their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill curious about the bug he stored in his mouth all night on his way home, Brett readjusted the bug to the top of his tongue and opened his mouth a little to let in some air. \"Wonder if its still even alive.\" He thought while also still in shock he even cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the little bug start to squirm a little, he decided to just leave it alone. \"I'll take a look when I get home I guess.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's world suddenly flipped as he found himself now in the middle of Brett's tongue. Looking one way he saw the massive cave open very slightly, and letting in very little light. In the other direction Josh saw Brett's massive uvula sway casually over the massive throat. Josh moved a little more toward the front of the massive cavern and peeked cautiously outside. \"It's dark, must already be pretty late.\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried his best not to move for the rest of the ride. Hoping by some miracle Brett will just spit him out finally or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into his apartment Brett turned on the light and walked straight into bathroom.

Lifting him out of his mouth he brought the speck to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Josh?\" Brett asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wiping spit off his face Josh looked up at Brett's face. Ecstatic Josh couldn't be more happy to hear someone utter his name. \"Brett! You saved me!\" Josh called out to the giant man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Brett blew on the tiny man a little to help him dry off. After a few minutes Brett set Josh down on his kitchen table in a small napkin for him to dry off in. Sitting at the table Brett looked down at the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you weren't a bug! Luke's such a moron.\" Brett said arrogantly to his boss. \"See I knew so that's why I tried to keep you safe till I got home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes a little. He knew Brett had a pretty huge ego, this was probably just he way of dealing with the shock of finding his boss trapped in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I can always count on you, Brett!\" Josh said intentionally feeding his ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all in a day's work, boss!\" He said putting his hands behind his head and flexing his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed a little to himself at how absurd he sounded. However, really was grateful to the big arrogant man. \"Hey so speaking of work... I need you to drop me back off there so I can go home.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back forward Brett looked down at the little man and shook his head. \"No can do little dude. Blake locked up on our way out. I don't have the key plus man he lives on the other side of town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down disappointed, knowing now he'd have to spend the night like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his little boss look down Brett tried to quickly add, \"No worries dude! You can stay here with me tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was afraid of...\" Josh said under his breath as he looked up at Brett and smiled. \"Thanks a lot Brett I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back again Brett smirked, \"You know it boss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Josh dried off finally, Brett got Josh some long over due dinner. Happily eating something finally Josh watched as Brett went into his room to change into a pair of loose white athletic shorts, still not bothering to put a shirt over his godlike torso.

You're a good guy Brett, we should hang out more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as Luke isn't there.\" Brett scoffed thinking about how much of an idiot Luke is. \"But anyway, I was thinking since were chilling now, why don't we pass the time with a little game or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game? Did you have something in mind?\" Josh asked curiously, not really taking Brett to be the type to play games. No surprise to Josh as Brett shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I didn't really have an idea.\" Brett admitted. \"I just thought you might be bored just chilling here doing nothing. I just wanted to be an entertaining host, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whenever I'm small around Tyler he always comes up with silly games to play.\" Josh tried to think of ones that didn't involve humiliating himself too bad, but it was hard to come up with any considering that's most of what Tyler does when he's little. \"He usually just toys with me actually now that I think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can see that.\" Brett frowned in disappointment. \"Wish I could think of something though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the chiseled stud, his ego was definitely starting to fade as he struggled to come up with something \"fun\". Josh couldn't help but chuckle as it was kind of just cute to see him think. The more Josh stared at Brett's good looks and lean muscle however the more Josh kind of realized he wouldn't mind Brett toying with him the way Tyler does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know one of Tyler's classics is the tiny explorer.\" Josh offered finally, hiding his blushing face slightly as he definitely suggested it on purpose.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Where would you explore? My apartment isn't that big, but I guess it'd pretty big for you, dude.\" Bret looked around at his fairly neat apartment. Josh chuckled as Brett didn't quite understand the \"game\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he usually has me explore on him.\" Josh pointed it out. \"Though he usually does stuff like trap me in his arm pits or burp in my face and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you could explore inside my mouth!\" Brett smiled. \"I know you were just in there, but this is kind of different now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could.\" Josh replied sheepishly, having secretly become a bit of a fan of Brett's hot mouth. \"We could make it like an exhibition and tie a rope around me and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like going into a cave?\" Brett asked. \"That sounds cool. Man sometimes I forget how big I am compared to you. You could get lost inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha yeah...\" Josh stared up at Brett's long abdomen and ripped 8-pack. He couldn't help but feel like being lost inside that would be so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could explore my outside too, if you wanted.\" Brett flexed his abs a little as he ran a hand down them. \"I'm perfect inside or out, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wiped a little drool from his mouth and shook his head. The ego was back, and Brett was definitely not wrong about looking perfect. \"Well I think I want to explore...\"  </span></div></div>",

Taking it and fashioning it not only around his waist but over his shoulder's as well, Josh wanted to feel as secure as possible before making this exploration. All set, Josh listened as he could hear Brett brush his teeth before spitting into the sink and rising his mouth. Josh could help but smile a little, feeling like Brett would go through these lengths for him to explore his mouth in contrast to anything Tyler's ever done to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it'll smell nice in there...\" Josh said to himself as the godlike figure of Brett strode confidently out of the bathroom and made his way back over to the table. Josh watched as he picked a little between his teeth and looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ready, boss.\" Brett smiled casually as he sat back down at the table, abdomen and torso still fully visible to Josh as he leaned back a little bit. Brett's narrow eyes glanced over at the end of the string Josh had tied to himself and with a swift movement reached over and grabbed the end. He watched as he was able to slowly drag Josh away from here he was positioned, knocking him to the ground and being strung along until he finally pulled enough floss for Josh to dangle in the air. The string wasn't super long, as Brett held his arm above his head letting Josh dangle down just meeting his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Josh said staring right into Brett's handsome eyes as he dangled from the floss in his harness. Looking down, Josh felt a little dizzy, seeing nothing but Brett's body for what looked like mile and miles before reaching the fabric of his shorts in his lap. \"I feel so high up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only a few feet off the ground.\" Brett smiled and shrugged a little. \"It's kind of funny. Must look really high for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Brett sat back forward and stood up, still holding Josh in front of his face as he now let Josh dangle from his full height. Josh spun a little in the air, going from seeing nothing but Brett's face, to seeing out into Brett's massive apartment from Brett's point of view. \"This is what it's like seeing from my height, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill awestruck, Josh looked out mouth a gap without realizing Brett's mouth opening up behind him. Slowly Brett was able to position Josh just over his tongue as he let Josh drop without warning onto the soft and freshly cleaned surface. Josh yelped a little in surprise, so taken in from the view that he never realized he was being put in Brett's mouth. Brett drew his tongue back in his mouth, now with tiny Josh as it's willing passenger as Brett kept his mouth hung open as he made his way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took in a big wiff of the inside of Brett's mouth, and what was once reeking of chicken and various drinks, now smelt minty fresh. \"Wow it does smell nice in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw now looking outside Brett's open mouth, Brett's face in the reflection of a mirror. Mouth wide open and tongue hanging out slightly, Josh could clearly see all the detail in Brett's mouth from looking out the mouth or even by simply looking behind him. Getting to his feet, Josh kept his balance on the soft surface as he started to make his way around to brightly lit cavern. It was truly an interesting experience now seeing everything in such bright vivid detail as opposed to the chaotic darkness he was trapped in before. Josh felt drawn closer to the darkest part of Brett's perfect mouth though, the throat. Brett's uvula dripped a slight strand of saliva as Josh started to approach. Josh watched as the strand hung over breath's contracting throat with each breath he took before the strand slipped down past the edge of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... that's neat...\" Josh said out loud wishing he had his phone to record such subtle and interesting behaviors of the giant's body. Josh turned around looking of the mouth again, seeing Brett's eyes tracking Josh's movement using the floss as a guide to his position. Josh wanted to get closer to Brett's uvula, knowing that the floss would act as his safety line should something happen. Josh inched closer and closer as he started to make his way down the edge of the tongue ever so slightly, but alas, from Josh's meager hieght he didn't have the reach to even touch the massive hanging uvula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Brett's tongue lurched as Josh found himself being lurched upward. with a scream, Josh tried to grab onto something as he closed his eyes briefly before he looked around again. Astonished, Josh found himself latched onto the massive hanging uvula as he looked down seeing the dark drop of Brett's throat. Looking outside the mouth, Josh saw Brett giving him a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knew I wanted to touch it!\" Josh thought to himself, curious as to how Brett gathered his intentions from his minuscule reflection. Josh ran his hands up and down the fleshy surface, getting more than just a touch, Josh was getting a full on ride! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uvula swung back and fourth again, naturally just swaying with each of Brett's breaths as Josh continued to hold on and massage it a little. It was so very soft and tender to the touch, Josh felt like embracing it was almost like a big slimy pillow. Having had enough fun for the moment, Josh knew he'd have to let go eventually. Releasing his grip, Josh dropped off a fell a few feet before landing back on the very edge of Brett's throat.

With a slight gasp, Brett reflexively closed his mouth and swallowed. Taking a moment to realize what he did, Brett also realized he was no longer holding onto the floss. Quickly opening his mouth, Brett opened wide to see the last trail of the floss starting to get pulled deep into the back of his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in with a quick snatch, Brett tried to grab the very end of the floss with little luck. Already slick from his saliva, the floss easily slipped through his fingers and disappeared down his throat as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Brett hummed aloud in thought. He couldn't feel anything, ironically like he told his friends earlier when he pretended to swallow the \"bug\". Josh really was too small to barely feel even the faintest struggle. Brett rubbed his throat however, as he certainly did feel the string still mostly stuck in his throat. \"Well with any luck that's holding him in my esophagus and out of my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett simply stared in the mirror for a few moments, trying to think of what to do besides the obvious of throwing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeeeetttt!\" Josh screamed from inside the lean stud's throat. Unsure why he stopped going down, Josh could feel himself being pulled deeper into Brett's body, but very slowly. Josh clutched the floss like it was his only lifeline in the world, wondering if he stopped because Brett was holding on to the string. \"If that's the case why hasn't he pulled me out!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried not to panic, but this was definitely more than he bargained for when he said he wanted to explore \"inside\" Brett. Trying to take deep breaths despite the somewhat moist and thin air, Josh had to put his faith in Brett, knowing that if he saved him once, he would likely save him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett sighed, knowing he only had a few realistic options. On one hand, Brett figured he may was well chug a good amount of water, sending Josh all the way into his stomach but giving him the chance to easily regurgitate him after. On the other hand, Brett figured it might be possible to try and cough up the string enough to grab it and pull Josh out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man he owes me either way for saving his life twice...\" Brett smirked at his reflection, getting distracted momentarily by his own good looks. Brett sat there for a minute still caught in his own ego over how he heroically saved Josh once, and now how after Josh's mistake took it upon himself to once again rescue his tiny helpless boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're a hero Brett...\" Brett smiled to himself with a bright white grin. Straightening up and looking serious, Brett decided he was going to...  </span></div></div>",

Give a few good hacks into his fist, Brett already felt like he was making a little progress on the string as it seemed to be gradually making its way up his throat before he could see it popping out the back of his mouth once more. Smirking, Brett carefully reached in and grabbed the floss and tugged it slightly right up to his teeth before sticking in between two of his teeth. Opening his mouth once more, Brett could see the end of the string was still down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's anchored in now, at least. Might as well let him have some fun in there...\" Brett said quietly to himself, knowing Josh could likely hear him loud and clear inside his throat anyway. Making his way away from the mirror, Brett decided while Josh was entertaining himself, he could do the same as he went into his living room and sat at his couch, turning on the TV and propping up his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brett?\" Josh called out again, noticing he had been pulled up but not completely out of the huge stud's esophagus. Josh tried to feel a bit more calm, he heard Brett say something about him being anchored, so that was good news at least. \"It is getting pretty hard to breath in here though... and my skin feels all slimy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh tried to wipe some saliva off his arm, he felt himself slip a little out of the harness he made. Quickly trying to loop his arm back through, he found it had almost completely stuck to the main thread of floss. Josh tried not to panic, after all he still had the floss looped around his waist, Josh thought... as he slipped down now a little as it was more under his arms past his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit shit shit!\" Josh squirmed as Brett's body shifted a little more as he slipped even further, now falling completely out of his safety harness. Josh looked up and tried to reach for the floss as Brett's throat eagerly started to pull him down deeper and deeper now finally. Josh fought and squirmed hoping that he could somehow give Brett the message that he slipped out of the harness and was now on a terrifying trip into the stud's stomach. Josh fought with no avail as he found himself popping through the sphincter of Brett's stomach, being deposited into the huge reeking chamber. Josh took a breath in of the foul air, smelling like a mix of rotting meat and a tiny bit of mint scent that Brett must've swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brett!!!\" Josh screamed in desperation. Josh tried to move out of his current spot however, realizing quickly that survival was the most important thing he could do if he somehow expected Brett to save him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brett...</span></div></div>",

Giving it a tug, Brett pulled the whole thing from out of his throat and smirked as he brought it out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you were worried I'd...\" Brett started to say before seeing Josh was no longer on the end of the floss. \"Swallow you... Well I guess I had that one coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shook his head as he tossed the floss aside and stood up. Stretching his abdomen and resting a hand on his stomach, Brett simply held his hand there for a moment. \"I wonder if he did it on purpose?\" Brett wonder aloud before removing his hand an flexing his impressive 8 pack. \"Who could blame him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the bathroom, Brett looked at his reflection and shook his head with a smile. \"Well unfortunately for him... I can't be responsible for him getting himself killed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Brett stuck his fingers down his throat, gagging and coughing a little before finally spewing up chunks of food. A few minutes passed before Brett noticed a small wriggling speck trying to break free of the chaos. Brett quickly pinched up the little speck before rinsing him off and rinsing out his mouth a little. Brett spit in the sink before he turned his attention to Josh with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slipped out of the harness, huh boss?\" Brett smiled with a white grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I was so worried you weren't going to realize in time. I thought I was a goner in there...\" Josh looked directly at Brett's abs as he flicked his hair back and took a deep breath, flexing the abs Josh was just staring at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry boss. I'm here to keep saving you.\" Brett winked attractively at Josh, who started blushing a little as Brett carried him out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it, you're a hero Brett!\" Josh smiled up at Brett, knowing the giant had now saved him twice today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hero huh? I like that... A giant superhero.\" Brett smirked, imagining himself as giant spandex clad hero rescuing people and stopping criminals while occasionally causing some property damage due to his size. \"That would be really cool. Imagine if you were a criminal trying to escape from me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would probably be pretty hard.\" Josh tilted a little as he stared at Brett who was still in his imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was a giant superhero, I'd send all the criminals straight to 'Jail'.\" Brett laughed as he patted his stomach, indicating it was \"jail\".  \"The real jails wouldn't be nearly as over populated then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. I mean who could stop you?\" Josh played along, knowing it was best to just go with Brett's ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one.\" Brett said simply a smirk. \"Too bad it's just a fantasy. Your shrink ray doesn't make people into giants does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, no. Just tiny or normal sized.\" Josh answered, feeling like while it was possible to alter the code to make a person a giant, Brett would likely not be his safest test subject at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Well maybe we can play around with it one day...\" Brett continued to smirk down at Josh, wanting him to promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, we can try at least!\" Josh half assed his response, starting to sweat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Brett looked away. \"Hey Josh, wanna play a different game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure...?\" Josh answered a little hesitant with how Brett was acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got in my mind being a giant hero. Maybe we can make a tiny cardboard city from some empty boxes I have and have me save you... or you could play an escaping criminal if you wanted...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fun!\" Josh tried to smile, feeling like it genuinely did seem fun but was a little nervous if he played a criminal he'd end up in \"jail\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Brett continued to calmly smirk as he set Josh down on the table. Josh watched as Brett started grabbing empty cereal boxes, tin cans, cups, and straws and start setting them on the ground spacing them out and making them kind of resemble a city of sorts. Turning back to Josh once he finished, Josh watched as the still shirtless and attractive man strode his way out of the room and into his bedroom. Curious, Josh waited a few minutes before Brett reemerged wearing a tight spandex under armor superman shirt as well as a tight pair of spandex shorts in a nice matching red color. Josh stared in awe as the spandex barely hid any of Brett's amazing chiseled features, in fact it was as if the clothing enhanced Brett's already incredible features.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I don't have a cape. But you can call me Super Brett.\" Brett chuckled as he spun around showing his outfit off as Josh went from staring at Brett's amazing 8 pack to his tight perfect ass. Walking up to Josh Brett smirked as he could tell Josh was easily staring at him and very enthralled. \"So would you prefer being a citizen, or a criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head trying to focus. \"Oh I think I'd like to be the...\"</span></div></div>",

Opening he saw it was Matt, who lived just a few streets away. Matt was changed  into a pair of blue and white shorts, a pair of blue sandals, and was wearing a pink tank top, with his sunglasses hanging from the collar. On his back he had a small black pull string bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's up dude?\" Brett said blocking the view to his kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, my building was fumed for ants today and still kinda stinks. Can I spend the night here dude?\" He asked running a hand through his short blonde hair, now pointed up slightly with gel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure dude, looks like I got two spending the night now.\" He said walking into his apartment as Matt came in and shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone else is here?\" Matt asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett walked into the kitchen and looked down at the little napkin where Josh was still sitting. Josh stood up and waved awkwardly to Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Josh is here.\" Matt said looking down at the little man. \"Wait what. Why is Josh here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett looked over at his friend and rose one of his eyebrows. \"Remember that bug in that bet dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... you ate it... you aren't telling me that was Josh?\" Matt asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I didn't eat it, obviously. I figured out it was Josh and I kept him hidden from that idiot Luke till I got home.\" Brett said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you could have told me after we left.\" Matt said as he looked angrily over at his shirtless friend. \"I would have helped or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it'd be better to just keep it private dude. As much as Luke was an idiot, I don't wanna make him look even more stupid.\" Brett said thinking quickly on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat down at the table in front of his little boss. \"Yo Josh! We kept the room all clean just like you wanted!\" He said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard!\" Josh said trying to stay cheerful. \"Although I wish I could forget where I was when I heard it!\" Josh tried to add jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right dude you were probably still in Brett's gross mouth!\" Matt said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross?\" Brett said smiling to show his perfectly straight white teeth. \"I don't think so dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cause you have nice teeth doesn't mean the inside of your mouth is some perfect paradise too you know, dude.\" Matt said back looking at his narcissistic friend. \"Besides my teeth are just as nice as yours and you don't see me claiming to be some kind of god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh spoke as the two scowled at each other, \"Look either way I'm really thankful for what Brett did so it doesn't really matter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss who's mouth is nicer, mine or stupid Matt's?\" Brett said kneeling down at the table to look at the little man as he opened his mouth a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you Brett! He doesn't wanna look in your mouth anymore.\" Matt said hitting his friend on the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was relieved Matt settled the situation as Brett stood back up to hit his friend back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat around the table talking and joking casually for a little while longer. Starting to get late Brett stretched and yawned saying that it might be time for bed. The two giant men fashioned a small bed for Josh out of a few pieces of cardboard and some tape. They added a little cushioning and a blanket for added comfort as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt went over to the couch and set his alarm on his phone and set it on the end table at the head of the makeshift bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett let Josh get into the little bed they made for him and started to carry him into his room when Matt called out from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Why does Josh have to sleep with you!\" Matt protested. \"We guests should sleep together out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett turned and looked at his friend and put a hand on his hip. Shaking his head he replied. \"Because I saved his life of course. He's safer with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but dude, all the more reason for him to sleep out here with me. This gives you a break from watching him.\" Matt said back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we let Josh decide.\" Brett said looking down at him with his handsome face. \"Who do you wanna sleep with, the guy who saved your life, or that loser over there?\" He asked pointing at Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second. It was true Brett saved his life... but he also knew how unintentional it was. Looking at the two Josh decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

He's a real jackass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shut the door without responding to Matt. \"He's such a tool huh boss?\" Brett asked looking down at the little man as he set him on his night stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Matt,\" Josh started to say. \"He's a good guy, but you're a real life saver Brett.\" Josh added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smirked at the comment. He loved being told how great he was. He turned away from Josh and pulled off his shorts, revealing just a tight pair of black compression shorts concealing his bulge and perfectly rounded ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry boss, I don't mean to undress in front of you like this.\" Brett lied as he laid slowly down on his bed and faced Josh. \"I just like sleeping in my underwear is all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine Brett.\" Josh said blushing and looking over the cardboard to Brett's handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his side, Brett gave an intentional view of his entire front of his body to his puny boss. \"Hey boss?\" Brett started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it Brett?\" Josh asked nervously as he ran his attention back to Brett's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like being so small around me?\" Brett asked looking down at his body and rubbing his hand casually on his abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked away turning even more red now. Josh knew what Brett wanted to hear, but he was almost too nervous to say it because, as much as it would fuel Brett's ego, it would also make Josh die of embarrassment since it was the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its amazing being so small. Its really cool just because everything around me is so... uh... big...\" Josh tried to say ambiguously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Brett grabbed the little bed Josh was in and laid on his back. He took the bed and placed it just below his chest. Then Brett very slowly tipped the bed to one side, letting his little boss slide out on his body. Josh stood up quickly, looking around at his new surroundings. Directly in front of him stood two giant mountains with a huge canyon between them, in the other direction all he could see for what seemed like miles were perfectly lined hills and a perfect valley between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm Brett, why did you do that?\" Josh asked nervously as the ground under him shifted slightly with each beat of Brett's gigantic heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cool does it look boss?\" Brett's voice boomed from far above him. \"Does everything look... big enough?\" He said smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mountainous pecs in front of Josh suddenly dropped a little and stretched out as he could see Brett moving his hands behind his head. In the distance Josh could see Brett's massive biceps flexing casually, just below that were Brett's hairy armpits, now on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a look around boss, don't see as many landscapes as perfect as this I assure you.\" Brett said closing his eyes as he felt Josh's tiny feet start to move on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little apprehensive Josh did actually want to explore... he decided to go...   </span></div></div>",

He didn't want to admit it, but Brett was pretty much perfect. Complimenting him would only fuel Brett's infamous ego even further, but for some reason, Josh sort of liked that he was cocky. Usually, at work, Josh would often get tired of Brett's conceit, but now, when it was just the two of them, with Josh exploring his body, Josh could not help but inflate the giant's sense of self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your abs are so defined and huge, Brett! I feel like I am walking on stone!\" Josh exclaimed. Looking up at Brett's face, he watched the giant smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, boss? You're not even on my abs yet. Get closer, and tell me how awesome they are.\" Brett spoke without opening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picked up his pace and made his way to the middle of Brett's abdomen. When Josh said it felt like stone, he wasn't kidding. It literally felt like he was walking on stone hills. Obviously, Brett was flexing to show himself off, but it still amazed Josh just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Josh spoke to himself, \"This is so unreal!\" He bent down and laid his hands on the hard ab muscles of Brett. He could feel the heat radiate into his hands, and in the distance, he heard the familiar sounds of digestion happening just underneath. To think that he could have ended up on the other side of this living wall made Josh blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Brett took a deep breath, making the whole ground rise up and down. Josh tumbled around a bit before he fell into something deep and dark. Immediately, Josh felt around to get his bearings. He realized where he was.

Josh decided he wanted to give climbing one of the mountains a try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping as much skin or little bits of hair as he could Josh started to scale the wall of muscle. Brett continued to lay motionless as he could feel the little man start to climb up his left pec. Smirking to himself even more, it made Brett feel like a god compared to his miniature boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh only fell a once or twice before he got the hand of scaling the pec. After a solid 10 minutes Josh made it near the top, looking across the mound of flesh he saw he chose the left pec, as he recognized Brett's tattoo on it. Walking up to the nipple Josh pressed his hands on the sensitive skin, seeing if Brett would even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett smiled as he felt his boss touching his nipple. He opened his eyes and looked down at his pec. \"Nice climb boss. I didn't even need to help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down and blushed. He was actually proud of how high he climbed, but to Brett Josh barely had gone anywhere yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to see your face now, Brett!\" Josh tried to say to the huge man. \"I couldn't see it past your chest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett chucked a little, causing the ground to shake violently. Josh took a short tumble forward as he rolled down the other side of Brett's pec right into his awaiting armpit. Brett watched as the little man tumbled helplessly into the short hair of his armpit. Without moving Brett watched Josh stand up, brushing aside the stinky hairs from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShook up from his fall Josh tried to hold his nose as he realized where he ended up. The young stud's armpit smelt like a mixture of deodorant and sweat. Not wanting to spend much longer in here, Josh wanted to continue his journey upward toward Brett's beautiful face....    </span></div></div>",

Josh gripped the skin as tightly as he could, getting a lot of practice with it when he scaled Brett's pec just minutes ago. Walking across the throat now finally to the chin Josh cautiously went around Brett's adam's apple as it might bob down and send Josh back a ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett felt Josh just below his chin, still standing there on his throat. Brett tried to imagine what Josh must be seeing as he pictured his own strong chin as some sort of sheer cliff. Finally he felt the little man start to move up said cliff, slowly but surely grabbing what skin or hair he could off his jaw. After what seemed like awhile Brett opened his eyes back up to see the little man standing there at the end of his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked across Brett's face as he had his head laid flat on a pillow. Brett smirked again, causing his chin to shift slightly before he spoke. \"So why'd you climb up to my face, little one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, guessing Brett was getting used to having a tiny explorer on his body. Josh started walking across the chin toward Brett's mouth. Looking at his closed lips, Josh tried to re-imagine himself trapped just behind that handsome smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, working up the courage to answer the giant adonis Josh replied to the titan that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Brett started to sit up, catching his tiny boss in his hand as he shifted. He lowered his palm down toward his toned stomach as he looked down at the little man seriously. \"I'll let you in, but you have to admit to Matt tomorrow that my mouth is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the massive hunk and couldn't believe that was his request. \"That's fine with me Brett!\" Josh said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dude!\" Brett said rubbing his free hand on his perfect 8 pack. \"I knew I was the hottest outside, but now I'm the hottest on the inside too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed nervously at the comment. Watching Brett's hand rubs casually up and down his 8 pack Josh couldn't help but wonder how hot Brett was all the way that deep inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped back to reality as he realized he was being lifted slowly up past Brett's chest to his face. He winked at the little man as he opened his massive mouth, letting his tongue roll out like a welcome mat. Josh stepped forward cautiously stepping over the ridge of Brett's tongue as he made his way inside. Brett felt the little man make his way on and pulled his tongue back into his mouth as slowly closed Josh inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe the view. Brett's perfect white teeth behind him, and the expansive mouth laid out before him. He looked out as the tongue fell up and down with each of Brett's careful breaths. Josh felt drawn to the back of Brett's beautiful throat, looking dangerously over the gap at the massive uvula dancing gleefully, wanting to welcome Josh down the pit it hung over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of looking around Josh had his fill of looking at Brett's teeth and even slipped into his cheek for a few minutes. Brett played with the little man for awhile and brought him back into the center of his mouth, pressing his gently to the roof with his tongue. Finally, Brett's voice boomed over Josh... </span></div></div>",

Enthralled with the idea of going down deeper into Brett's body Josh couldn't help himself. He squirmed his way to the back of Brett's throat and yelled back. \"Do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a suddenly lunge, Josh found himself being pushed forward, then downwards. He barely caught a glimpse of Brett's uvula before the throat closed behind him, sending him down the Brett's eager stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was almost deafening to Josh as his surroundings shifted, the throat muscles moved up and down in a relaxing rhythmic pattern easing Josh downward on his journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Brett put a hand on his chest. He couldn't really feel the little man he just swallowed, and he figured that would be the case. All he knew was he wanted Josh in his stomach, imagining just how perfect the ride must be fore little man as it opens up to his immaculate belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back a little he moved his hand to his abs, rubbing them softly. He knew Josh wasn't going to get out alive, but it didn't bother him. He heard the little man's voice of approval to be eaten by him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't he...\" Brett thought to himself looking down at his sculpted torso. Brett laid back down on his bed, moving slowly so as not to shift his body too fast. Laying his head on his pillow he realized just how tired he was. Brett closed his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep, hand still on his stomach thinking of the little man who gave himself up for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh made his final stop into Brett's stomach. His eyes were already well adjusted to the darkness from being in Brett's mouth so he actually got to look around some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the walls slowly pushed in and extended out, folding and unfolding around certain edges. There were small groans and roaring noises that occasionally came from within the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than Josh, the stomach was mostly empty and as luck would have it, unaware that Josh was even there. As Josh walked around the whole room shifted slowly and what little contents were in the stomach shifted to the back wall. \"He must have laid down.\" Josh thought aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard Brett's heart beat start to slow down to a more relaxed state, and his breathing became much more unconscious. Figuring the giant must have fallen asleep Josh continued to looked around the fantastic stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really is beautiful inside and out...\" Josh thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Josh thought, maybe he could just fall asleep in here. No doubt he'd be dead by morning, but he'd then become part of Brett's godly body. On the other hand, Josh thought since Brett was asleep there was still a chance he could climb out and live to see another day... Josh decided....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Everything from Brett's handsome face, to his fantastic body, hell even his insides were wonderful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around and saw where some acid was starting to pool at the back of the stomach, moving closely Josh laid down near and and closed his eyes. He figured if he could just fall asleep Brett's body would take care of the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm air in the stomach circulated softly around Josh as he got more and more sleepy, eventually passing out to the gentle churning and gurgling of Brett's enormous stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Brett got up and looked over to the little bed him and Matt made. Seeing Josh wasn't there and remembering what happened. Smirking and looking down at his toned abs he gave them a good flex and chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dude, you'll always be safe being a part of me.\" He said happily at his stomach. Just then it growled angrily at him, demanding breakfast. Not one to delay Brett stood up and pulled on his shorts and walked out of his room to greet Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had half of his body falling off the couch with his mouth hanging open as he suddenly jolted awake at the sound of Brett's voice. Yawning he sat up and looked at his buddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning dude..\" He said rubbing his eyes. \"Josh up yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett stopped on his way to the kitchen trying to think up a good lie. \"I don't think he's awake. I forgot to check when I left my room.\" He continued walking into the kitchen desperate to get some food in his hungry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go check on him then...\" Matt said walking over to Brett's room. Brett stood in the kitchen, waiting for Matt to start yelling... \"Any second now...\" Brett thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Matt started yelling. \"Dude Josh is missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett walked calmly toward his room, stopping in the door way he already played out how to execute his lie. \"Maybe he fell out of bed, did you check the floor before you came stomping in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt jumped at the thought looking under his feet for a little smear mark. \"No dude I didn't! Oh god I hope I didn't crush the little guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look dude, just stay calm. Let's check the floor.\" Brett said getting on his knees, hoping to get this over fast so he could go eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two searched the room for a few minutes, turning over discarded shoes and socks. Matt even started to take the sheets off Brett's bed and shake them down much to Brett's displeasure. Sitting on the bed Matt started to stare at his feet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I did step on the poor little guy!\" He said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Brett went and sat next to his friend. He put his arm around him and gladly letting the man blame himself. \"Look dude, we looked our best. We can keep this between the two of us... that way nobody has to know you accidentally killed him.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at his friend, Matt looked almost sick, but happy to hear Brett say that. \"Thanks dude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up Brett started to walk back out to the kitchen. Glad that whole ordeal was over all the while trying to keep his cool. He couldn't help but feel proud of himself, not only for getting Matt to take the blame for his boss's death, but also for convincing his boss to so easily sacrifice himself to him. </span></div></div>",

I just feel bad because he is basically the only reason why I'm still alive.\" Josh said turning and looking at Matt as he started to pull a few clothes and his tooth brush out of his draw string bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'basically', dude?\" Matt said stopping as he put his deodorant on the ground. \"He did figure out it was you right away right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Matt and decided to speak honestly. \"Well when he finally pulled me out of his mouth... he looked and sounded surprised...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That douche...\" Matt said standing up and grabbing his toothbrush. \"I bet he had no idea dude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grabbed a some clothes and his tooth paste and started walking over to the bathroom. \"I'm just gonna change and brush up, man. Sit tight a second ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt left the room and went into the bathroom and shut the door. Thinking now about what Matt said... it is pretty lucky for Josh to be alive. He couldn't help but wonder why Brett kept him in he mouth for so long though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking some more Josh decided he'd ask Matt a few things when he came out of the bathroom. They were best friends after all so of anyone Matt might have the best guess. Just then the door to the bathroom opened back up and Matt stepped out wearing only a pair of red and black pajama bottoms. He walked back over to the couch and stuffed his other clothes and tooth brush into his bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up he grabbed the little bed Josh was in and laid down, setting the bed gently on his toned stomach. \"I can see ya a bit better here than back there like this, if that's ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine Matt.\" Josh said looking out over his bed up at Matt's impressive chest up to his face. \"I wanted to ask you a couple things about Brett...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it dude. I wanna hear what happened on his walk home up till he found you.\" Matt said resting his hands on either side of the little bed. \"I think he saved you by mistake dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do too...\" Josh said nervously. \"I'm glad he did, but I know he didn't mean to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you act like he did then?\" Matt asked raising an eyebrow at the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't wanna upset him...\" Josh said slinking down in his little bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you should've stood up for yourself, man. \" Matt said seriously. \"You'll just feed his stupid big ego.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd rather have a happy Brett with a huge ego than a mad Brett with a slightly smaller one...\" Josh said looking back up at Matt's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful dude, that ego's huge enough to crush both of us if it get's the chance.\" he said winking one of his steely blue eyes at his little boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed and peeked over at the clock.

Forget this loser Brett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at the idea. He was having a good time with Matt, it would probably be fun to do that sometime but he figured he should leave the offer open for now as he replied, \"Ask me again once I see the park again and get a nice hot shower after all this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed, causing the bed on his belly to shake a little. \"Sure thing little boss man!\" He said jokingly. \"I keep forgetting how exciting of a day you're been though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah being captured in a cup and used in some idiotic bet and needing to survive in another man's mouth for a few hours. Sure is exciting.\" Josh said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt moved one of his hands behind his head and rubbed his neck. \"Well it wasn't my mouth! And I wasn't part of the bet!\" He said trying to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad at you, Matt.\" Josh said realizing how bad he must have sounded. \"It's just I could think of a ton of different 'exciting' things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like getting that whistle out of my gut! Right boss?\" He said joking as he rubbed the bottom of his abdomen.

Like you said it'll find it's way out eventually! Besides its probably like all the way down here by now...\" He said as he poked just below his belly button with his index finger. \"It's long gone, dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the huge man pressed his finger into the tight skin of his abdomen. He tried for a second to picture how far along Matt's digestive tract the whistle might have traveled by now. Smiling he turned to Matt and just shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to talk for a while longer, making fun of Brett's ego, or about how great it'll be to get Josh home eventually included. As time went by Matt yawned and stretched one of his arms out as Josh watched closely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slowly moved his hand behind his head, leaving his armpit open the smell slowly wafted over to Josh. It really didn't smell that bad, it was a mixture of cologne and sweat, but just so much of each to smell really attractive. Sweating, Josh imagined if his clothes smelt that good, he glanced down at Matt's drawstring bag on the floor. Josh thought maybe he could convince the huge man to set the bed down there with the intent of night for exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt...\" Josh started, to grab the giant's attention. \"It's getting late, maybe we should go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked over at the clock and shook his head in agreement. He started to move Josh's bed over to the little end table next to the bed as Josh chimed in. \"Hey maybe I'd be safer on the floor next to your bag.

Thanks so much Matt...\" Josh said turning a little red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting re-situated back on the couch Matt laid on his side and looked down at the little man in the bed he just set down. \"I'm just glad everything turned out alright, dude. Try and get some sleep though boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shut off the lamp in the room and rolled onto his back, trying to find a comfortable position on the couch for a few minutes.

The dark shape was only a few feet from him, partially open from when Matt stuffed his clothes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got up out of his bed and crept quietly toward the bag's opening. Which for Josh at his size \"quiet\" was pretty easy to pull off. Finally, Josh reached the opening and climbed up over the thick fabric. Walking in just under the lip, the smell of Matt's body odor washed over him once more. Although, Josh couldn't see well he could make out some colors and guessed what things were based off how they felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little exploring Josh found his way on top of the pink tank top Matt was wearing. It smelled amazingly sweaty, yet with a hint of Matt's cologne. Josh took in great big wiffs as he found himself sinking into the fabric. Stumbling around in the fabric Josh started to lose his sense of direction. He was getting light headed from all the manly fumes that he forgot which way he came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh retraced some of his steps back to the middle of Matt's slightly balled up tank top. Josh sat down as he was starting to get really tired, both physically and mentally. \"I have to find my way out though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed the edges of the tank top once more and looked out for the opening for the bag.

Luke sighed as he stood up and reached into his pocket, pulling out his wallet. Looking through the brown leather he pulled out a wade of ones and started to count them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6...7...8...\" Luke said out loud as he started to file the bills one by one. \"Dude, I only got 8. I'll have to owe you another time.\" Luke said disappointed he couldn't even hold up his end of the deal. All the while Brett got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you just clean up for me tonight. Keep your measly 8 bucks, and I'll just head out when the game is over.\" Brett said, trying to act sympathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled at the idea, he'd much rather clean up Brett's mess than give him all the money in his wallet after all! \"Alright Brett you got a deal! Just keep your mess to a minimum dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Luke finished his words, Brett proceeded to chug the rest of his sports drink and drop the empty container on the ground. \"Oops, guess we'll clean that up later.

Shutting the door behind him he proceeded to flip off Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Luke said as Brett was out of ear shot. \"I thought the game would never end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head, \"Man I've never seen him act that bad before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke started to pick up empty cups and plates off the ground hoping he could just clean up as fast as possible after Brett ruined the rest of his night. \"Let's just get this over with...\" He said throwing a clump of napkins into the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three worked diligently to clean up the rest of the trash and tidy up the room for what seemed like forever before they noticed the little plastic cup with a plate on top...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake removed the plate and looked down into the cup. \"Hey guys, wasn't this that bug from that bet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke walked over and looked at the cup. \"Oh yeah I totally forgot about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grabbed the cup and handed it to Luke. Surprised Luke held the cup and looked down at the little speck still scurrying around at the bottom. \"Well you still gonna eat it dude? Brett's gone now and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke watched the little bug look like it was almost waving at him before he decided....</span></div></div>",

You gonna let it go?\" Matt asked feeling like he didn't want any gross bugs crawling around in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why not. Just to spite Brett.\" Luke replied with a sour tone as he walked the cup over to the counter and tipped the cup over and let the little speck slide out. \"I'll even let it go on the counter, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Gross!\" Matt looked as the speck hit the counter before Matt looked a little closer, seeing what he believed it to stand up on two legs. Matt quickly connected the dots as he snagged the cup from Luke and covered the speck up in case it ran from them in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys that was never a bug.\" Matt looked down at the turned over cup sweating. \"That was a tiny person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost guest maybe?\" Blake walked over next to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Luke looked at the cup excited. \"I never noticed, I wanna see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Matt held the cup in place. \"Whoever it is they probably wandered into here by mistake after we closed. They're probably scared they've been trapped and had four giant dudes talking about eating them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what can we do?\" Luke crossed his arms. \"Park's closed and the shrinking shit is all off until Josh unlocks it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just leave them here either.\" Blake put in his opinion. \"One of us should bring them home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be our only option, dude.\" Matt agreed as Luke had an excited twinkle in his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna do it! I want a little friend for the night!\" Luke practically jumped up and down excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one that caught them in the first place and tried using it in a dumb bet...\" Matt rose an eyebrow at Luke. \"If anything they might be the most afraid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I know they're a person clearly I'll be a little smarter!\" Luke grinned happily. Matt sighed as he looked at Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, you're probably the most responsible, why don't you take them?\" Matt asked as Blake shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna say the same for you, Matt.\" Blake answered plainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should we decide?\" Matt asked Blake as Luke felt left out. Blake shrugged again, really just unsure all together. \"Flip a coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Blake reached into his pocket to see if he had a coin. Pulling out a quarter, Blake balanced it on his fingers ready to flip it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads I'll take them, Tails you take them.\" Matt said to Blake who nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! Why am I not included?\" Luke pouted as Matt shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, dude. You got out voted, yo.\" Matt smirked as he looked back to Blake who flipped the coin.

Blake closed his hand, feeling that the little person had indeed fallen right into his palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably pretty confused...\" Matt frowned as he looked down at Blake's closed hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And scared.\" Blake commented also looking at his hand. \"It'll be fine though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in good hands!\" Matt smiled and patted Blake on the back. Luke meanwhile just continued to pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever, let's all get out of here!\" Luke carried garbage bags as they made their way out the door. All going their separate ways, the three men bid each other good night. Blake walked swiftly, making sure to keep his hand closed in case the little person were to get blow off in his quick pace. He just wanted to get home so he could hopefully explain to the little person he was trying to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally approaching his apartment, Blake unlocked the door as he made his way inside quietly. Flicking on a light, Blake made his way over to a coffee table he had by his sofa as he sat down and opened his hand, letting the little person slide out. Blake could clearly see the \"bug\" was in fact a tiny human with distinct human features. Sighing in relief, Blake sat back without looking at the person very closely.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood up, now unable to really make out the speck from anything else as he spoke. \"Hello. Sorry all that happened.\" Blake kept his words short as usual. \"I'm not kidnapping you. Just keeping you safe till tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stared up at Blake, knowing the huge man couldn't hear him even if he yelled from all the way down on the coffee table. Having got the gist of what happened, Josh was a little proud at how his men handled finding a \"lost guest\". Choosing to remain silent until either had to reveal himself or when Blake figured it out, Josh was more interested in just seeing how things play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded his head as he walked away from the coffee table and Josh watched as he rounded his way into a different room down a hall. A few minutes later, Blake reemerged wearing plaid sleeping pants and a loose black Nike tank top. He was also holding what looked like a wash cloth. Blake came over to the coffee table noticing the speck hadn't moved. Placing the wash cloth down and backing away, Blake looked down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To sleep on, if you want.\" Blake said quickly before he clapped his hands together like he just remembered something. Going into his kitchen, Blake found a half eaten protein bar and tore off a bit of it. Also he found an old water bottle and took the top off and filled it with water. Going back over to the coffee table, Blake set them down. \"Food and water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he silently made his way over to the food, wanting to show Blake he wasn't afraid. Blake took a deep breath as he saw the speck make it's way to the bar. Blake stood there, wanting to talk to the tiny person but knowing he was terrible with words. Going and sitting on the couch across from the table, Blake sprawled out on the long sofa as he watched the little person like an eagle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned to look at Blake as it seemed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young studs finished tossing the trash into the heap and said their good byes as they all went their separate ways. Matt and Blake were still proud Luke was going to go through with the bet as they slapped the young blonde on the back before leaving for their own homes.

But I'm gonna eat ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed to himself as he watched the bug squirm about. \"What's the matter, don't wanna get eaten?\" He taunted down to the pathetic creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" A voice called out barely audible to Luke's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stopped in his tracks as he squinted down at the bug. \"Woah did it just talk to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his head he wasn't sure if the booze went straight brain or not.

Squinting one more time at the little creature he believed to be a bug before tilting the cup toward his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as his whole world started to slide. He couldn't believe it, here he was slipping his way down into one of his employee's gaping mouths and there was nothing he could do about it. Try as he might, he wanted desperately to somehow cling to the side of the cup and avoid this whole situation. Alas the walls were much to slick and Josh could do little more than take in the dark cavern before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stared at everything from Luke's perfect rows of white teeth to a large strand of saliva dropping casually somewhere in the middle of the mouth. Mesmerized by the site Josh barely had any time to react before Luke's monstrous tongue came into the view at the end of the cup. Before Josh could even scream in protest he found himself free falling and coming to a landing with a splat on the wet tongue of his employee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just then that the smell finally hit Josh's nose like a train. The horrid stench of beer mixed with buffalo chicken sauce coupled with the sheer wetness of his surrounding made him want to vomit. Holding back his throw up, Josh merely gagged as he almost fell flat on his face as he gasped for breathable air. Much to his terror however he saw the gigantic cavern start to close behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke closed his mouth and leveled his head. Looking down in the cup he saw the bug was in fact gone. Which could only mean one thing, he was successful in pouring the poor creature into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't even feel it in there.\" Luke thought to himself as he swished a little saliva around his his mouth. \"Guess it's too small for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on his way home Luke took his time before ultimately finishing off the little insect. Walking briskly through the night he finally approached his apartment building. Slowly he pulls the keys out of his pocket and tries to find the correct one as he walks though the main entrance. Finally, he turns down the first hallway and reaches his apartment. Unlocking the door he opens it up and walks in, relieved to finally be home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, he stretched his arms over his head before snapping his jaw shut. \"Oh yeah almost forgot.\" He thought to himself before putting a hand on his chest and giving a very audible and exaggerated gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Well that's that!\" He said to himself as he walked to his bedroom. Yawning again he flopped unceremoniously onto his bed and buried his face into his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh squirmed and struggled as he slipped his away around the dark and squishy passages that he forced into. Somehow he couldn't believe he was still alive after being swished and slurped around in Luke's mouth, but now here he was passing through a sphincter to a fresh new chamber that would certainly be the last thing he'd ever see. That is if he could see. Everything was pitch black, and the only comfort he had while trying to get his bearing straight was sounds of groaning, gooping and what seemed to distant snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it...\" Josh realized as he slowly felt himself sink into what he guessed was half digested chicken wings. The spicy food made his skin tingle as well as it burnt his nostrils. However his knew this was nothing compared to what he was in for as Luke slept the night away casually digesting his previous meal like any other day. As the air started to grow thin Josh watched as he could barely make out the walls of his prison moving in and out, churning its contents so that it could be broken down and become part of Luke.      </span></div></div>",

Searching through his freezer, Luke grabbed a bottle of 101 proof rum and poured himself a shot. Downing it with a sour look on his face, Luke slapped his cheeks and shook his head as the alcohol burned down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!\" Luke exclaimed as he left his kitchen, still drunk and only getting drunker as the minutes go by. Stumbling over to the cup with the bug, Luke tipped it over and struggled to sit down at the table to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, bug!?\" Luke asked the speck loudly as Josh had to cover his ears. Looking closer, Luke squinted and could make out distinct features of this \"bug\" such as two arms and two legs. \"You look like a little person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Luke!\" Josh cried out. \"It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk!\" Luke blinked as he heard words from the speck, but was far to drunk to comprehend them. \"Wow, did you get lost from the park or something little fella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, it's me! Josh!\" Josh yelled to him again as Luke merely just blinked and gave a quick hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry little guy. I don't know what you're trying to say.\" Luke admitted to his own drunkenness. \"It's funny I almost ate you though! That would've been a rough time for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't bother answering. Luke was too far gone to even try speaking to. Luke started laughing a little as he sat back in his chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy.

Josh had no idea what the drunk giant had in mind for him tonight, but Josh figured it was best to just go along with whatever at this point to appease the tipsy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, brosky!\" Luke slurred. \"I've got an... uhhh.

Josh was relieved to see Luke didn't try to drunkenly grab him as he stumbled out of the room before emerging with the bottle of 101 as well as two shot glasses. Filling them up and splashing a little onto the table, Luke pushed one at Josh. Despite just being a shot glass, Josh couldn't ever hope to reach over the top without falling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers!\" Luke clicked his glass to Josh's as he downed his shot, barely tasting it this time as his taste buds were likely slightly numb from the alcohol. Luke looked down at Josh and the shot glass, noticing the tiny man hasn't even moved toward it. Setting his glass down and grabbing Josh's, Luke smiled at the tiny man. \"Don't worry I'll take yours if you don't want it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Luke swallowed the strong liquid down with a mighty gulp before slapping the cup down on the table.

Josh watched Luke as he continued to just stare at him, hand still resting firmly on his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what you'd even taste like?\" Luke asked aloud to Josh. Josh sort of just backed up a bit, not liking the look on Luke's face. \"Aw dude! I just realized, if I don't eat you I don't hold up my end of the bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's face went white. It was logic only a drunken idiot would come up with. Unfortunately for Josh, Luke was both very drunk and very much an idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. I'm gonna have to eat you, dude!\" Luke leaned forward a bit, acting like he was being forced to against his will. \"Aww I feel bad. We just met and became friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't do it you moron!\" Josh tried to hold his ground and look at Luke in his drunken glazed eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look at the bright side buddy!\" Luke smiled happily. \"I was gonna do it anyway, plus now I know you're human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that a bride side?\" Josh asked, not following Luke's logic at all. Luke reached out, drunk fingers curling around Josh as they scooped him into the massive hand, resting him in Luke's huge palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Luke said suddenly as he looked down at Josh seriously. \"That last shot made my belly all gurgly. When you're down there you should totally let me know what it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I do that if I was being digested!?\" Josh complained, wishing Luke had any capacity to think right now as he lifted him up to his gaping mouth. Josh covered his nose as it reeked of alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was cool of you to agree to this.\" Luke smiled as he held Josh in front of his mouth. \"I hate not following through on a bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't agree to this!\" Josh screamed as Luke finally dumped him into his mouth. Josh sloshed around as Luke giggled, seemingly having fun at the thought of a tiny person in his mouth. Stumbling into his bathroom, Luke looked in the mirror and opened his mouth, looking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man I can't see straight.\" Luke said to his reflection as he forgot what he was doing. Turning on the sink water and taking a sip from it, Luke swallowed the water down as he just remembered he had his tiny friend in his mouth. \"Oh yeah! Sorry bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke talked to his bare chest as he rubbed it a little as he got dizzy again. \"Have fun in there! Don't party too hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed as he stumbled back out to his table. \"I've got a party in my belly!\" Luke said out loud to nobody. Just then Luke burped again, this time feeling slightly nauseous. \"Ooof. Shit. I hope my little buddy calms down in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the burp and the sporadic stumbling, Josh had no idea what was going on. The stomach air was putrid as Josh was swished and sloshed around in a mess of half digested wings and bitter alcohol. Josh felt helpless as he couldn't believe that even after he was found, Luke was such a dummy that he convinced himself to eat Josh anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke!!\" Josh cried out hopelessly. He truly was helpless. Dizzy and now slightly intoxicated from just being in the alcohol filled stomach, Josh started to feel sick as Luke's body continued to swing and stumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Everything shifted violently as Josh heard a loud thud. Everything stopped for now as Josh wondered what had happened. Sure enough Josh would soon find out Luke... </span></div></div>",

Without warning, Luke clenched his stomach as he began heaving and puking to his side. After a few powerful surges of vomit, Luke couldn't bare consciousness for much longer as he passed out right on his floor. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Luke, a tiny wriggling speck panicked and swam it's way out of the foul stomach contents before washing up on dry ground of Luke's floor. Wiping off his face and body Josh looked next to him, seeing Luke's massive face, mouth hung open as traces of vomit and saliva hung out of the side of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least he turned his head...\" Josh tried to look on the bright side. Even though Luke did just try to kill him, Josh didn't want the silly man to end up drowning in his own vomit. \"Besides he didn't know what he was doing..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt kind of helpless now. He wished there was something he could do for the unconscious man as he laid flat on his stomach on the hard wood floor. But at his size all he could hope to do was watch over him and hope he didn't puke any more. Josh sighed as the smell of Luke's vomit was pretty unbearable. Deciding to move somewhere else while he waited for Luke to get up, Josh got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should I even go for him to notice me when he gets up?\" Josh asked himself, as he focused for now to just move a little ways away from the pool of vomit. Thinking for a minute, Josh thought the best thing to do was wait in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh figured one of the first things Luke's going to want to do when he comes to is to get some water. Believing that to be his best option, Josh walked away from the giant's massive body, keeping an eye on him as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything it doesn't smell like puke over here.\" Josh commented as he reached the door to the kitchen. Thankfully the way the room was set up, Josh still had a clean view of Luke should something terrible happen. Looking around the kitchen, Josh figured being on the floor would be no good. Josh sighed, hoping it wouldn't take him all night to find a way up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little luck however, Luke's untidiness would prove beneficial to Josh as he was able to reach a power cord hanging from a blender that sat on the counter. Like climbing a rope, Josh scaled all the way up the side of the counter in no time before wiping his brow of sweat and looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where's the best spot to contact him...\" Josh wondered aloud as he looked from the sink to random bits of left out food to finally a red solo cup near his faucet as it laid on it's side. Figuring it was perfect, Josh positioned himself in front of the cup as he looked inside. Clearly it was just empty, But Josh guessed it was most recently used for water, since it had no particular smell to it. Sitting now, Josh looked out of the kitchen, still seeing Luke face first on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's breathing...\" Josh tried to shine something positive on this. Leaning back on the lip of the cup, Josh laid back and shut his eyes. Hoping to get some sleep before Luke comes to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh awoke suddenly as he heard loud groans of pain coming from the living room. Still groggy, Josh didn't get up as he squinted and saw Luke starting to pick himself up off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" Luke rubbed his back in pain. Looking down on the ground, Luke looked at the drying puddle of vomit. \"Aww man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke wiped his face off as he walked out of the living room and into the bathroom. Closing the door Josh figured he must be cleaning himself off among other things. A few minutes later, Luke reemerged, chest and face a little wet looking from water as he cleaned a little. Holding a towel, Luke threw it on the floor over his vomit, clearly not wanting to deal with it at all right now. Josh watched as the sickly looking man pulled out his phone and dialed a number. A few seconds passed before he clearly got a voicemail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss, it's Luke. I've got a bit of a stomach bug or something. I threw up a ton. I don't think I'm gonna make it in today. Sorry.\" Luke spoke into the phone as Josh found it ironic he was leaving him a message to his phone he didn't have with him. Suddenly, Josh watched as Luke started walking into the kitchen, on his phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matty?\" Luke rubbed his face as he made his way in front of the sink, flipping the red solo cup up as he stood there, unknowingly sending Josh for a tumble down inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Luke?\" Josh heard Matt's voice from the other end of the phone as he shook his head, regaining his balance after being sent plummeting into the empty cup. Luke picked up the cup, holding it for a moment while he spoke to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened last night? I woke up in a pile of vomit on my living room floor...\" Luke rubbed his head in pain. Holding the cup under the faucet, Luke let a torrent of water in as Josh screamed as the rush of liquid sent him for a spin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro did you keep drinking when you got home?\" Matt laughed at him. \"Eating that bug might've made you sick too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug?\" Luke tried to remember as he took a sip of water, Josh somehow not getting sucked into the blonde man's mouth. \"Oh yeah yeah. I feel like I remember there was something weird about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, dude.\" Matt let it go, feeling like it probably wasn't important. \"So what, lemme guess. You called out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeaaah.\" Luke sighed as he took another sip, missing Josh a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably for the best, bro. Maybe I'll come see you after work.\" Matt said in a friendly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude, thanks.\" Luke smiled, happy Matt was such a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, anytime bud!\" Matt said happily. \"Oh and don't forget dude...\" </span></div></div>",

You always feel better after you drink a lot of water!\" Matt said, reminding Luke as the blonde man smiled as he held the cup up to his mouth. With a few swift gulps, Luke chugged down the entire cup of water, leaving not a trace of anything inside. Luke blew a wet weakish burp into the phone as Matt laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already on it, buddy!\" Luke smiled as he filled his cup back up with water again. Saying their good byes, Luke smirked as he hung up the phone and chugged down the entirety of the second cup of water. Luke paused as he could literally feel it running down into his body before collecting in an enormous pool in the pit of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof I better slow down a little...\" Luke rubbed his gut as he gave off another wet burp. Filling up his cup again Luke merely sipped it this time as he walked out of his kitchen and looked at the mess he made last night. \"Well... no work... so may as well clean up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike being drug down in a whirl pool Josh gurgled and spat as he tried to stay afloat as he was sucked down in what appeared to be a never ending torrent of water. Finally, Josh was deposited in what seemed like a bottomless pool in Luke's stomach, already full of water as the huge man had no sense of moderation. Josh splashed about, panicking because there was nothing for him to get on top of to avoid being digested. Figuring this was the end Josh floated there, but started to feel confused as to why Luke's stomach acid wasn't tearing him apart. Finally calming down and looking at the walls of Luke's stomach, they seemed much less active than when he was inside here last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's the nausea?\"  Josh guessed as well as the may cups of water were helping to dilute any acid in the stomach anyway. For now, Josh stayed floating. For some reason he was safe. But he shivered to think how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke cleaned the floor as quick as he could before he decided he needed to take a shower. Feeling slightly refreshed, Luke's stomach just still didn't feel like it wanted to settle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... What the hell did I do...\" Luke tried to remember what happened last night. \"I remember thinking that bug was talking to me? Or maybe I was already drunk then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's head hurt as he sat down, not wanting to think too hard about it right now. \"Maybe I should lay down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grabbed his cup of water and chugged down the rest before filling it up in his bathroom sink. Waltzing his way into his bedroom clad in just his boxers, Luke practically cried with joy as he laid down in his nice soft bed. It didn't take long for Luke to drift off to sleep. It was good news for the blonde hunk, but spelled trouble for his tiny boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke started to settle, so did his stomach. Still filled with water, the organ was busy trying to absorb most of it and rehydrate Luke's body. Unluckily for Josh it seemed to be taking awhile. Stewing in Luke's warm stomach, Josh felt like he was in a daze as it slowly emptied before it was ready to resume normal capacity. Hours went by as Luke slumbered and finally Josh was able to embrace his fate. Hungry and demanding any food, Luke's stomach seeped acid from it's walls and started to bubble and foam. Churning normally now, Josh was easily swept up in the muscular gut. Luke, none the wiser, felt like he was getting the best rest he's had in a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and Luke stretched awake. Looking at his phone he just realized Matt would be over soon. Getting out of bed and pulling on a pair of shorts, sure enough there was a knock at his door. Rushing over as he opened it up, Luke smiled as Matt really did come to visit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Matt shoved a bag of greasy fast food into Luke's hands. \"I know you like the greasy stuff for when you're hung over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matty, I should marry you.\" Luke opened the bag with his mouth watering. \"I haven't eaten all day. My stomach just started feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eat then, dude!\" Matt let himself in as he kicked off his sandals. Luke didn't need permission twice as he started gobbling up the food like a ravenous animal. \"The boss wasn't at work today either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Luke said with food in his mouth. \"It was weird he didn't answer his phone either this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it sucks. I never got to thank him for last night.\" Matt frowned as Luke swallowed down a massive glob of food. \"You're gonna get sick again if you eat that fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey.\" Luke smiled as he started to ease up a little on the food. \"Was he sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody knows. Tyler checked his house and he's not there either.\" Matt scratched his chin. \"It's like he vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should help look for him.\" Luke started to say. \"We could start by-- BUUUUUUUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed as Luke's own words were interrupted by the massive belch. \"Yo, I don't know how you burping is gonna help us find him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Luke patted his stomach absentmindedly. \"But still I wouldn't even know where to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same...\" Matt agreed as he watched Luke rub his stomach again, before trailing off into thought...</span></div></div>",

Luke smiled as he started to reach into a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro.\" Luke smirked as he found some Tylenol. \"Maybe I'll take a nap too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, bud.\" Matt replied. \"I'll see you after work, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude.\" Luke smiled. \"See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke set his phone down as he popped a couple of Tylenol out of the bottle and set them down on the counter next to the cup of water. Turning away, Luke started looking about his cabinets, trying to find some crackers or something. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Luke, Josh somehow washed onto the rim as Luke set the cup down on the counter and was trying to slip his way down the cup and onto the counter, away from the danger of being accidentally sipped up by the hung over blonde titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Josh looked at the massive pills sitting next to the cup. Standing up, Josh was actually a little taller than the pill as it laid on it's side, but as far as sheer size in length it still dwarfed the tiny man with ease. \"Still though... I stand out next to these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood between the two pills, figuring that if he stood taller than the pill at least he'd be seen by Luke. Josh looked over seeing Luke holding a a package of crackers, stuffing his face with a few of them as he waltzed back over. Luke looked down at the pills as he swallowed down a lump of crackers. Josh smiled as he looked up at the muscular god before him. Reaching his hand up, ready for Luke to see him, Josh found that Luke...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if the idea was ridiculous he figured it was at least hearing out. \"What's your idea Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt put his hands forward as if indicating his boss to sit down, \"Ok get this, we have a ride that a lifeguard WEARS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up the blonde hunk and blinked. \"Wears? So like they put it on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ok so, we open part of the park to come into a room where one of us lifeguards are full sized, wearing this ride. We can watch the guests and be a part of the attraction at the same time!\" Matt said flourishing down at his sculpted body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed his arms in thought. It would be difficult to build and might only fit certain heights of individuals but it wasn't impossible. Not to mention it would appeal to the whole shrunken theme of the park. Josh blushed for a moment as he imagined traveling down a clear tube pressed up against one of his lifeguard's body. \"That... is a very interesting idea Matt.\" Josh said finally. \"You said \"test\" before though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt got an excited look in his eyes as he turned around and went into a near by cabinet and pulled out what looked like a bunch of plastic tubes and some twine. The muscular man quickly wrapped parts of it around his body, under his arms, all the way down by his butt. Sitting down he made sure he wasn't squashing it under his butt as he lead it around front just under his crotch, leading into a glass of water he was holding between his legs. Finally he lifted his arms and looked at Josh. \"Boom!\" He said happily tilting his head at his boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked closer at the makeshift water slide. He noticed that it seemed to be mostly made up of clear plastic straws, tapped together when they came at ends. It didn't look particularly safe, never the less Josh smiled and applauded the young man's efforts. \"I love the idea Matt! We could mock together an idea using some building materials I use for the slides in the park like you have there, then we can try it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\" Matt started to say slowly. \"You don't wanna try it now? Its why I put it on, boss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, he didn't mean to hurt his feeling, it just didn't look safe. Looking closer, Josh easily saw holes between the straws he could slip out of and get hurt. However, looking up at Matt's face, looking sadder by the second it made Josh think maybe it was worth the risk for one little ride. Looking up at Matt Josh decided...       </span></div></div>",

This'll be so cool...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember this is a test run, big guy. If it works, we can start up the blueprints and build off the prototype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lowers his hand to the floor so Josh can climb onto his palm. \"Of course, boss! It'll be for science, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carries the little man in his palm to the very first straw. Looking down, Josh sees where the loops progress - under the arms, around his torso, and looping his left thigh before ending with a drop into the glass. \"We might need to lengthen that for the actual ride,\" he says to himself. It's a bit risky to build a Niagara Falls drop more than halfway down Matt's body. He turns back to the opening of the \"ride\" and asks \"You got some water for this right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it right here!\" Matt smiles has with his free hand, he holds a water bottle. \"I'll start pouring as soon as you go in, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, I'm going in right now.\" Even with the risks in mind, he puts his trust in Matt. Josh slides both legs into the mouth of the straw, gripping the lips. \"OK! I'm ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt made no hesitation as he tips the bottle for a pour. Josh gets blasted by the current. Much of the water however flows beneath the ride and rains on the lifeguard's skin. Josh sucks in some air for comfort, though he almost gags on the moisture, before he releases his grip. Then he lets the slide do the rest. The clear straw gives a nice flyby of Matt's body. \"Maybe a clear tube would substitute for the straws. It'd be a better view than the dark areas where the ride bends right now.\" Josh resumes his focus as the ride runs beneath Matt's armpit. The hair clumps over the top of the ride, like an upside-down jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride swings around along the surface of Matt's pecs, Josh sees the water ahead of him picking up speed. \"Uh oh...\" Josh can not see the water further down the ride, so the tape around one of the straw junctions has peeled. There's no way for him to stop in the middle of the test as he gets carried from the broken junction and sprayed against Matt's muscle valley - just beneath his pecs but above the ravine leading to his abs and navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt...</span></div></div>",

He knew the clear straws must be giving his little boss some awesome views of the giant world around him not to mention the exciting dips and turns followed by an epic dive down his body! Sitting still however he watched as the water he initially put into the tubes all finally started to trickle out at the end, although it didn't seem like very much got all the way through. Waiting for a second, Matt stands up and picks up the glass and smiles down into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that boss? Pretty epic right?\" Matt says as he looks down in the clear water, expecting to see his miniature boss treading water in there somewhere. \"Boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stares at the water for a few more second before he finally realizes Josh isn't in the glass. A little panicked, he sets down the glass and started to poke at the tubes, unsure if his tiny boss was trapped somewhere in the ride. Matt takes a deep breath and sits back down, leaning over to grab the straw at the bottom, detaching it from the other straws and his body to take a look inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh coughed and wheezed as he looked at his surroundings. He seemed to be in a hole of sorts, but last he knew he was speeding down just below Matt's chest toward his abs. Looking around he could see the outside world just beyond the dark cave he was stuck in, when it hit him. \"Oh god I'm trapped in his belly button...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around the cave, sure enough there were little blonde hairs and specks of dirty littering the surfer's naval. Thanks to the angle Matt was sitting at the walk out seemed a little too steep for Josh to take, not to mention it was soaking wet from the ride's runoff! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, when he notices I'm not in the glass, he's going to be looking for me.\" Josh said to himself, reassured that Matt would discover him trapped in his belly button before very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood up. He had taken apart his entire ride trying to find his little boss. Much to his disappointment over seeing his hard work torn to pieces, he was also very concerned for his boss since he didn't find him in any of the straws that made up the ride. Running his hands through his hair he thought about where Josh could have ended up. It seemed like the possibilities were endless. Since he had no idea where he fell out he could be in any number of places, somewhere on his body, on the chair, on the floor. Matt took a deep breath and started by turning around to look at the chair. Bending over to look carefully, he really hoped not to find his tiny boss he since he had just been sitting here this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved after scanning the chair, Matt determined he wasn't there at the very lest. Without moving his feet, he sat back down in the chair and twisted his body, looking around on the floor around him. He didn't want to rule out the possibility that Josh was on the floor somewhere, so He figured it would be best to stay put for now while he searched his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he lifted up his arm pits. Knowing the ride went under his hairy pits, he thought it was possible Josh fell out and got tangled in the hairs. Sighing as he couldn't get the best of views in his own pits he figured he'd move on as he looked carefully up and down his body. Casually, he stuck his finger into his belly button to see if he could feel anything in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, he decided that nothing was in there as he retreated his hand to look down by his crotch. The surfer was wearing a pair of compression shorts under his swimsuit as he looked carefully across the slick surface as he raised up the red lifeguard's shorts for a peek. Still nothing, Matt sat back with disappointment. he couldn't believe he lost his boss. But little did he know Josh was...  </span></div></div>",

Once outside, Matt knew there was no way Josh could have crawled his way out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just have to hope he landed somewhere safe...\" Matt said to himself as he lowered his sunglasses and looked around outside. The day was still young as Matt was glad to be off work for the time being. He was really hoping his special ride might become a reality, but with his tiny boss missing it might have to be put on hold. Leaving the park and heading toward his home, Matt figured he could stop and grab his surf board since surfing was always his go to for clearing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to his apartment, Matt made a quick stop in the bathroom to pee.

For some reason his arms were high above his head holding onto something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I... dangling?!\" Josh cried out as he finally realized what was going on as he looked down. Below him all he could see were the red of Matt's board shorts as the huge surfer walked along. Josh realized also that they were outside. Panicking, Josh tried desperately to pull himself up, but he simply didn't have the upper body strength. Weak and surprised, Josh lost his grip as he surely felt he would fall to his death. Trying to grab on to anything, Josh broke his fall slightly by sliding against Matt's body, but the movements of his legs sent Josh off in a different direction before Josh landed on something soft. Shaking his head as he realized that a miracle saved his life in the form of a discarded candy wrapper, Josh's good fortune was short lived as he saw Matt walk further and further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Matt! Come back!\" Josh screamed as the huge surfer seemed like hundreds of miles away before fading from his view. Terrified, Josh looked around, the hot bright sun beating down on him as he tried to figure out where he was. Josh looked around before he realized... </span></div></div>",

Holding on for dear life, Josh soared through the sky, though he closed his eyes terrified to look as the wrapped was whipped about in the gust of wind. Josh had no idea how he was able to hold on, but he attributed most of it to some residual stickiness from whatever candy was in the wrapper. Josh could feel the wrapper start to descend out of the air, opening his eyes, Josh saw as he started falling before landing with a soft crinkle on soft fleshy surface. Thanks to the angle, Josh slipped out of the wrapper, just as it was swatted away from whatever it landed on. Examining the surface, Josh could smell sweat and felt the familiar touch of skin beneath him. Scared to see his surroundings, Josh looked as a massive hand moved from swatting the wrapper back to the side of their body. Josh was in awe as he found himself on the abs on a massive sun tanner. Looking across the man's massive body, Josh could see as far as his mountainous pecs past the hills of his abs. Josh looked behind him, seeing the man was wearing a pair of red, grey and black striped swim shorts, tight to his tree trunk like legs as he seemed wet from a recent swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... I'm on some random guy...\" Josh commiserated as he somehow kept his footing even though he was shaking in fear. He was lucky he slipped out of the wrapper, as he watched it blow straight into the ocean.  Josh swallowed, terrified to think what it would have been like to be dumped into the ocean at his size. Turning back to the direction of the giant's face, Josh knew he'd have to tread carefully as he didn't want to be swatted by the giant before he reach his face in hope of contact. Swallowing his fear and squirming on the sweaty surface, Josh started to make his way across the hot sweaty abs...   </span></div></div>",

Josh panicked as he fell over in some sticky residue in the candy wrapper before turning back in terror seeing the giant stop right before squashing him and the wrapper under the boot. Reaching down, Josh saw as a huge man came into view. Shielding his eyes, Josh saw as the view of a handsome face, with sunglasses covering his eyes, and a police officer's hat came close as he reached down and grabbed the candy wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O'Brien, what are you doing?\" Josh heard as a second man approached as he was being lifted up level to the giant cop's chest. Plainly across the man's bugling chest, Josh could see the name \"Officer O'Brien\". Josh looked up and down the giant's body. In a tight officer's uniform Josh could see that this massive police officer probably never skips a gym day. Josh looked at the second man talking to O'Brien. Slightly taller, and even more muscular, Josh looked at the tanned god of a police officer. Wearing a similar uniform to O'Brien, Josh saw his name tag as well \"Officer Rodriguez\". Also wearing sunglasses and a hat, but this man's face was covered in a dark black scuff. Josh saw the man chewing on a tooth pick as he walked closer to O'Brien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you always picking up garbage, man?\" Rodriguez commented as he shoot his head looking at the wrapper his partner had picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I hate it when the kids litter around here.\" Josh heard the man say with a slight Irish accent. Josh felt the man moving as he started to move toward a garbage can. Panicking once again, Josh squirmed out of the wrapper and used his someone stickiness from the candy to lodge himself on the man's finger nail. Holding on tight, Josh watched as the  wrapper he was just on was just tossed into a dark pit of a garbage can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... that could have been me...\" Josh held on, relieved he somehow avoided that terrible fate. Josh's relief was short lived as he found himself coming in close contact all a sudden with the giant's chest, being wiped off the giant's hand as slipping into a chest pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Brien wiped his hand on his chest, unaware of the tiny life he had just saved and inadvertently slipped into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, dude. You wouldn't get shit all over your hands if you would just let someone else deal with it.\" Rodriguez shook his head as he chewed on his tooth pick. \"Seriously, Sean. It's gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya, it's fine Hector.\" Sean frowned at his partner. \"It's such a beautiful city, I just hate to see rubbish all over the ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, you do you, man. Let's just finish our patrol.\" Hector rolled his eyes from behind his sunglasses. Sean nodded his head as he went back to Hector's side as the walked down the board walk toward the beach more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ya in such a hurry for?\" Sean smiled at Hector as the two stopped on a pier, watching a few people run by on the beach below. \"Ya got a date or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I just wanted to see if I could get off work early. It's too nice out to be sweating our asses off in these uniforms.\" Hector tugged on his shirt a little trying to cool himself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya don't think the chief will let us go early, will he?\" Sean asked as the two continued their patrol. Hector shrugged as he spat on the ground as their made their way back to the patrol car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to sweat in the darkness of the giant's chest pocket. Able to hear their conversations, Josh felt fairly sped up on the situation he was in. \"Sean O'Brien and Hector Rodriguez.\" Josh said to himself. \"I'm in Sean's pocket. It sounds like they're going back to the police station. This could be good. Assuming they spot me, the police are bound to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to ride in the pocket, eyes adjusting to the darkness as he continued to listen in to the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This traffic is a load of shit, man.\" Josh heard Hector complaining, coming from Sean's left, seeming like he was the one driving. Suddenly Josh heard the sound of a police siren ring out from above the car, and the sound of the engine revving. Josh could feel the G-Forces push him against Sean's chest for a few minutes before the car came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the chief would have ya head if he knew you did that?\" Josh heard Sean say to his partner as he heard the engine turn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're not gonna tell him, are you?\" Hector asked as Josh heard the keys jingle before Hector put them in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! You're one of me mates.\" Sean answered back, feeling a bit taken aback. Josh could feel Sean's arm move before he heard the sound of what he assumed was the men fist bumping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man. That's why you're my partner!\" Hector answered as the two men got out of the car. Still riding along, Josh waited deep at the bottom of the giant's pocket awaiting the next piece of his adventure to unfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean and Hector made their way to the chief's office, trying to see if they can head out early. Turns out that the chief decides...              </span></div></div>",

Waiting for a second, Matt sat still as he carefully watched all the water start to slowly funnel out of the straw and down his body. Sighing, Matt started to slowly peel apart the ride from under his arms and going down his chest. Looking down his body, Matt reached a finger gingerly into his navel, quickly retrieving his tiny boss. Lifting him up to his giant face, Matt smiled as he rubbed the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it leaked a little, huh boss?\" Matt said as he watched Josh start to cough up a little water and wipe it from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah going to have to make a few little changes, but over all I think it's a fantastic ride! We need to do clear tubes, the view would be amazing for our guests!\" Josh exclaimed, as he finished drying off his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing?\" Matt said as his face turned a little red by the compliment. Looking down at his own body, Matt tried to imagine how it would look to circle himself from a tiny prospective. Giving up, he smiled as he looked down at his teeny boss on his finger tip once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh said a little leery. \"Either way, We can have the ride constructed right away! We'll also need a new room added to the side of the park leading into a spot where the person wearing the ride can easily access.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we just made an extension to the break room, that way when two of us are on duty we can just go from there to the new ride's room?\" Matt questioned as he stood up and walked Josh over to the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would work, by why do we need two people? Wasn't the point of the ride so that you can be the ride and be on duty?\" Josh asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt crossed his arms, covering his round pecs as he frowned. \"Well, dude. From the test run I think we learned that if something goes wrong we can't have the dude wearing the ride to be the one saving someone. We should be in pairs so one of us is there to keep the little peeps safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's mind wandered a little, imagining the new area being built and having two massive muscular giants there. One with tinies lining up to ride down the water slide all over him, and the other sitting there with his feet propped up blowing a whistle every once in a while when some tiny person started to run around. For a second, Josh wasn't sure if most guests will be terrified or in love with the new addition. Confident, Josh shook his head yes to Matt's suggestion knowing that some people are sure to be interested in this totally optional experience of Shrink and Swim.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day, Josh and Matt worked out getting the room expanded and getting in contact with a contractor. The ride itself took minutes to create, however the contractors took up the rest of the day making the new section for the park both safe for the little guests and spacious for the giant lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was finished, it had the new ride made with an easy to slip on fashion, a spot for the giant wearing the ride to sit with a pool down just under crotch level, and a wooden staircase built for tinies to wait in line at the top. Second the area had a small set of restrooms and a concession stand. Away a little from the balcony there was a second seat, a little cushier than the seat made for the ride, where the second supervisor giant would be stationed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood full sized in the room at closing time, admiring the rapid work done today. Smiling, Josh looked at the tiny balcony sitting even at Josh's small knee high height. Matt came through the door, still wearing nothing but his board shorts as he walked up to his little boss and put the shorter man in a headlock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooooooooo boss!\" Matt yelled as he pulled Josh into his chest. Josh could feel Matt's shark's tooth necklace start to dig into the back of his head while he gasped for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Matt! -top!\" Josh croaked trying to get the taller man to release him. Laughing, Matt removed his arm from around his boss's neck and watched as he started to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So boss, what are we calling this new ride anyway?\" Matt asked, putting a hand on Josh's shoulder, causing him to flinch. Rubbing his throat, Josh was a little surprised by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was your idea, I just figured you'd have a name.\" Josh said matter of factly. Matt smiled widely as he rested his arm down Josh's side and pulled him in closer to his still bare torso. Stretching out a hand as if to point at the horizon Matt simply stated, \"The Dude Flume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, placing his palm on his face over the name of the ride. It was oddly perfect for the ride however. \"Alright, The Dude Flume it is. Just so you know I'm having you operate the ride for most of the day tomorrow. It's the first day, so be sure you have your game face on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt saluted Josh as he put on a contorted looking face. \"Dude, I always have my game face on!\" He said excitedly. \"So who's working with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you want?\" Josh asked, not really wanting to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled again as he looked down at his boss and said...            </span></div></div>",

Satisfied with the decision, Josh and Matt made their way out of the little room, shutting the door to the dude flume as they left. Josh made his way home, glad to get a good nights sleep knowing tomorrow the small guests would be in Tyler's capable hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh woke early the next morning, excited to meet with Tyler and Matt as he made his way around to the break room first thing in the morning before opening the park. Still at his normal size of 5'5\" Josh was greeted by his two massive employees, easily dwarfing him even at his normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Josh!\" Tyler exclaimed brightly at his good friend. He walked over and grabbed Josh in for a tight hug, pressing Josh's face into his already bare chest as he was already in his uniform. Josh hugged the man back with a smile, always glad to greet his trusted friend every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem chipper this morning, Ty!\" Josh gleamed as Tyler let go of his small friend. \"Excited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm really glad you guys picked me for this, dude.\" Tyler winked. \"You can count on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled confidently up at Tyler before he looked around seeing Matt slumped in a chair at the kitchen table, looking like he was half asleep. Josh crept over to the sleepy blonde and got close to his ear... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT!\" Josh yelled, trying to scare the handsome surfer dude awake. Matt nearly fell out of his chair startled as he rubbed his eyes and yawned, looking at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not cool, boss.\" Matt yawned. \"You know I don't do well with mornings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that was hilarious!\" Tyler laughed, giving Josh a quick fist bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Matt, you're gonna have to wake up. It's your time to shine!' Josh smiled at him as he started to get out of the chair and attempt to slap himself a little awake. Josh nodded, glad to see Matt was waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready? We have to get Matt set up.\" Josh said with a smile hoping to get the ball rolling. Josh motioned for the two to follow him into the newly built room and he and Tyler helped get the ride on Matt and had him seated at the chair. Josh stopped to make sure everything was in order. Looking at the slide it started up by Matt's shoulder where the line of people would meet the start of the tube, then it travels down in a slow loop under Matt's armpits as it continues to circle Matt's body at a not so steep angle. Finally, it loops around Matt's back and drops slightly as it travels below his butt and under his crotch and ends in a newly built pool between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Josh admired as the water for the ride came on and flawlessly made it all the way to the pool without any leaks. Josh nodded to himself in approval as he started to leave the room, ready to go open the park. Tyler made his way over to the other side of the room, giving Matt a thumbs up as he sat at his post, waiting for guests to come in at any minute. Making his way into the front of the park, Josh shrunk down as he came into the entrance and opened the park for business. Excitedly, Josh started to work his way toward the new opening in the park, leading to The Dude Flume. Walking through the doorway, Josh pushed a turnstile so they could keep track of in and out guests as he walked into the gigantic room. Walking past the concession stand, Josh waved to the worker stationed there as they prepped their meals for the day. Moving forward, Josh saw what the real attraction was. Laughing, Josh saw as a giant sized Matt sat at his post with the nice clear tube around him, almost looking half asleep. Off to the side, Josh saw Tyler sitting at his post watching him from a distance since he first made his way into the section. Josh approached the railing waving and looking up at Tyler. Tyler leaned in a little closer, recognizing it was Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey buddy!\" Tyler smiled looking down at Josh from what seemed like hundreds of miles away. \"Couldn't wait to come in here and start micro managing, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real funny!\" Josh yelled up at Tyler as he went back to his post, undoubtedly laughing to himself over his play on words. Next, Josh walked up to Matt, looking at the half asleep giant. Sighing, Josh started to climb up the wooden stairs leading to Matt's shoulder. Making his way up quickly since nobody was here, Josh reached Matt's colossal broad shoulder in no time and yelled up to him.     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MATT WAKE UP!\" Josh screamed as loud as he could. Turning his face Matt looked over to see his first tiny guest, before his eyes widened embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss! I'm awake!\" Matt said as he looked at Josh with his deep blue eyes and a smile. Josh gave him a thumbs up and grabbed onto the top of the tube that was fastened to the wooden stairs. Pushing off, Josh rode down the ride for the first time since it was made. He gawked at the scenery as he passed below Matt's arm pits and made his way around his fantastic chest. As Josh rushed past Matt's hardened abs he knew the final drop was soon. With a good view from the clear tube it looked like he was about to drop straight down into the back of Matt's board shorts, but angled off down more at the last second. It was dark as Josh rode below Matt's sitting body before he finally came out at the end in the pool, looking back all he could see was Matt's massive legs on either side of him meeting his his crotch resting right above at the end of the tube. Satisfied, Josh made his way to the door as he passed a few cautious looking guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That new ride is a blast!\" Josh said to the group of people, trying to put them at ease. Josh turned at watched as the group of people made their way forward to now more alert and attentive looking Matt. Josh nodded as he left through the door to get some work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood up as people started poring into the newest second of the park. It was unreal how quickly the idea took off! Tyler stood a distance away from the railing as he watched people make their away around, exploring and checking out the \"views\". Meanwhile, Matt tried to stay awake and be attentive as he sat waiting for anyone to start to make their way onto the ride. However, he could help but notice most the the gusts had started to congregate around Tyler, rather than himself. People kept piling in more and more, sitting, standing, gazing at Tyler as he stood there, barely noticing the attention he was getting. Matt broke his gaze at Tyler's crowd for a moment when a guest finally came up to shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one so far?\" Matt thought to himself as it was just a little kid, going down the slide and being on his merry way. Meanwhile the crowd around Tyler seemed consistent, if not was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed as Matt let maybe a dozen or so guests down his slide before he saw Tyler waving over at him. \"Yo, Matty, you want to swap off so you can get a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure!\" Matt called back, noticing he ha nobody in the ride or climbing up at the moment anyway. Tyler made his way over as Matt took of the ride, helping Tyler to get in the tangle of tubes himself as a crowd of people watched with great anticipation. Finally secure, Tyler gave the ok for people to come aboard. A flood of tiny people immediately started their climb. Matt walked away, sullenly watching as Tyler let troves of people down in minutes, more people than he had in hours. Sitting down at the other station, Matt simply swallowed his pride for now, knowing he had a job to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was almost at an end and the Dude Flume part of the park had to be closed up. Tyler started to take off the ride with a smile as Matt came by to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome idea Matty! People loved it!\" Tyler smiled, smacking Matt on the shoulder. \"You're a genius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave a half hearted smile, feeling like people loved Tyler, not the ride. \"Thanks, man. Yeah you were pretty popular.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh came in through the back door, having closed up the park already to see the two men as they cleaned up. \"Hey great job guys! I heard that as the day one you guys got really popular!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\" Tyler smiled, unaware of Matt's slight brooding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great we'll plan for the same thing tomorrow then!\" Josh gleamed, happy to see the two men worked so well today. Josh and Tyler made their way out the back door meanwhile Matt...      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt's face grew pale as he looked at the crowd surrounding Tyler. It hadn't doubled, or even tripled. No, in fact it looked like it was at least ten times bigger than yesterday! News must've spread quickly of the handsome tanned giant, and people seemed to be pouring in to get a glance of the huge man. Matt sighed as he let another person down the ride. It wasn't like he wasn't without his own group of followers now as well, but seemingly in sheer muscular appeal Tyler had him out matched. Trying to ignore Tyler and focus on his job, Matt continued to let patrons down the slide, happy as he saw people coming up four maybe five times as he started to recognize some of the itty bitty people. Time went on and it was time for Matt's break and for Tyler to take over. As the two men switched, a crowd of tiny people flooded to the line to go all the way up Tyler. Matt frowned as he went to the life guard's station and sat at the chair. A few people stopped to glance at Matt, but none stayed around like they did with Tyler. Tyler meanwhile, started to love all the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey no pushing!\" Tyler winked at the eager groups of people. \"You'll all get turns if you all stop shoving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing at Tyler, Matt lowered his sunglasses, just wishing for Tyler's shift to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly for Tyler but dreadfully slow for Matt as the park was coming to a close soon. Matt stood up and looked at the still hundreds of wriggling little people desperately trying to get up the ride with Tyler again. Rolling his eyes, Matt looked over to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna just go to the bathroom, dude.\" Matt said, bored. \"Think you can clean up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro!\" Tyler replied excitedly as he saw Matt walk off. It wasn't much to clean up when they're all done, so he figured it was best to just let Matt's gloomy attitude walk off. As the last few minutes rolled around, Tyler had to stop people from getting on the ride as he started taking it off. Oddly enough, a massive group still stood and watched Tyler, despite him telling them the ride was closing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Park is closing up, folks!\" Tyler smiled down at the hundred or so people still sticking around. \"Time to go home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a tiny man climbed over the safety rail as Tyler barely saw the little guy before he started falling off the side. Instinctively like he would with Josh, Tyler caught the little guy in his hand before he could fall to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, sir?!\" Tyler held the little man up to his face. \"What in the world were you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me with you!\" The little man begged Tyler. A cheer from below also erupted seemingly in agreement with the little man's actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Tyler reared back a little in shock. \"I can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" The little man simply begged. as Tyler brought him back down to the crowd. As Tyler lowered his hand, throngs of tiny people tried grabbed on to the giant's hand as he was trying to let the one man off. Shaking them off, Tyler still remained in shock. He looked around, and thought for a moment. He always kind of wanted little people to play with aside from Josh. He was always so concerned about hurting his best friend he had to hold back many of is more \"dangerous\" ideas. Looking down at the group, Tyler wanted to bring them with him, but part of him didn't want to upset Josh should he happen to walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on one minute!\" Tyler commanded the group, as Tyler waked through the door in the back, connected to the break room. Tyler looked around the room, empty. Making his way into his locker, Tyler grabbed a draw string bag and an old Tupperware container he had from a lunch he brought. Scoping out the room again, Tyler was nervous about what he was about to do until he saw...     </span></div></div>",

He quietly made his way through the break room, back into the room with his awaiting crowd of little admirers. Tyler opened the door, and looked down, still seeing there was as massive group eagerly awaiting his return. He walked over to the group and removed the lid of his Tupperware, the smell of rice and chicken still prominent as he didn't really wash it the other day. Setting it down and leaning it to its side Tyler looked down the the group of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to go with me, get in this.\" Tyler commanded the crowd. Excitedly and pushing one another, the mass of people started climbing into the plastic container. Tyler stood there amazed as every single one crawled their way inside before he held the container in his hands once again. Putting the top on the container while leaving it slightly popped open for air, Tyler pulled the draw string bag off his back and set the container carefully inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm doing this!\" Tyler thought to himself, still nervous yet very excited. Putting the bag on his back Tyler left the room and made his way through the still empty break room before getting outside. Focused on getting home, Tyler nearly jumped as he heard someone call his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty! Hey! There you are!\" Josh saw Tyler leaving as Matt walked beside him. \"All cleaned up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah!\" Tyler stuttered. \"I was just going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well whatcha up to then?\" Josh asked with a friendly smile, wanting to hang out with his best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I dunno. I'm just really tired. It's been a long two days, dude.\" Tyler lied, feeling more awake than ever but with a nervous knot in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad! But you have been working hard!\" Josh nodded. \"Why not take tomorrow off? I'll have someone else pair with Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Tyler and Matt both said in unison. Tyler smiled, feeling like this worked out well in his favor, meanwhile Matt couldn't help but feel relieved that maybe more people would flock to him tomorrow over whoever else gets paired with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Matt maybe you want a day off too?\" Josh turned to Matt who shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine boss. Besides it's my ride. I should supervise whoever you pair with me.\" Matt responded, feeling like he was destined for the spotlight tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very professional of you Matt.\" Josh smiled. \"Well have a nice rest, ok Ty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Josh...\" Tyler sweat a little as he turned his back, feeling bad a little of the big secret he was hiding in his bag. Josh smiled as he watched Tyler walk off before making his way back into the park for some final closure. Upon checking the turnstiles counters for guests entering and exiting, Josh was a little shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"154?\" Josh pondered aloud as he looked at the number. It was typical that the number wasn't perfectly 0 all the time since kids jump the turnstile or people slide past them sometimes, but to have such a large number was a little odd. Deciding to check the park, Josh hoped he could find some guests had simply stuck around longer than they intended. As time went on however, Josh found the park had been empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the turnstile is just counting people twice sometimes...\" Josh reasoned to himself as he shut the facility down, leaving for the night feeling like that had to be the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving practically ran home, Tyler was sweating pretty bad, beads running down his bare chest as he still wore his lifeguard uniform of red board shorts and a red hat. Not even grabbing his shoes or socks, Tyler didn't even notice the warmth of the pavement under his bare feet. Getting to his apartment as soon as he could, Tyler made his way up to his unit on the top floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in a nice neighborhood. Josh had helped him pick it out, refusing to have his friend stay in some ratty place. Most of the people that stayed in the complex were younger beach goers mostly, so Tyler fit in well. Opening up the door to his place, Tyler looked out into the apartment. While the place looked clean from the outside, Tyler's apartment was it's own different ball park. Messy as always, Tyler had shorts, socks, tank tops, underwear, and shoes laying about everywhere. Boxes of empty take out and pizza lined up near his garbage, which overflowed with crumpled up bags and papers thrown at it like a basketball hoop. Tyler walked into his kitchen which was attached to the living room at the entry way and took the Tupperware container out of his bag and set it on the kitchen counter. Tyler shoved aside a box of pizza, half eaten from the day before as he set down the plastic container and opened it up. Taking the cover and tossing it in his sink as it was filled with at least a weeks worth of dishes, Tyler sighed as he remembered Josh insisting he got a place with a dishwasher, of which he often forgot to use. Shifting his focus back to the tiny people in the plastic container, Tyler looked down to see them regaining their balance and adjusting to the new smells and sights of Tyler's apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my pad, little bros and chicks.\" Tyler stretched his arms to his sides showing off his kitchen and living room to the tiny admirers. Tyler looked down at them, knowing he was going to have to do something, seeing as he was in control of whatever went on. His mind raced at the things he's always wanted to do as a giant but was too afraid of hurting Josh. Nodding his head with a smirk as he looked down at the people, Tyler decided he was going to be...   <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler took a quick breath before he got into the character he wanted to be for his game. Tipping over the container and letting the screaming mass of people flood out onto his counter, Tyler crossed his arms and looked down at the mass of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, peeps. Listen up.\" Tyler commanded as he saw all the little people look up at him. It was crazy, Tyler couldn't even hope to count how many speck like people agreed to come with him, but he had to guess it was over a hundred. \"From this day forward, you're all my roommates. I don't think I'll be able to get to know all of you, but you all should know me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled as he flexed his arms in a double bicep for his minuscule crowd. \"Name's Tyler. I hope you all know I don't watch my step. I eat fast and I eat a lot. And finally, if you're unhappy you're always welcome to crawl under my door. But good luck contacting any of my neighbors.\"  The crowd looked like a mix of scared, nervous, and excited as Tyler lowered his arms. Not wanting to intimidate them too badly Tyler bent down a little and smiled again. \"That being said, I'm a nice guy. I'll do my best to look out for all of you! Have a nice stay, dudes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned his back on the tinies as he made his way out into the living room and down a hall to his right into his bathroom. Still sweating and smelling like pool water, Tyler wanted a shower. Turing on the water and stripping his shorts and hat, Tyler wondered if the tiny people would spread out and explore, or stay put out of fear. Getting in the shower, Tyler shrugged. \"Wonder what it's gonna be like living with like a hundred roommates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished with his shower, Tyler grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his waist. Since he was used to living alone he'd normally walk out naked but he figured this was more considerate for his roomies. Opening the door, Tyler took a step before he swore he felt something squish under his bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Tyler looked under his foot, noticing two tiny red smears as well as seval tiny people scurrying away toward the wall. \"Shit guys, I told you it's hard to watch my step!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Tyler walked into his room, making sure not to step on any more antsy little explorers. \"Damn how'd they get off the counter and in front of the bathroom that quick?\" Tyler wondered as he wiped the bottom of his foot with his towel before grabbing a pair of shorts and underwear. Pulling over a body builder tank top, loose and showing off his sides, Tyler stood up now wearing red shorts, a white tank top and a red hat. Still barefoot, Tyler figured it was a descent warning to any other tinies on the floor to steer clear of his massive feet. Leaving his room and walking back to the kitchen, Tyler didn't look down at all to further make his point. Not noticing that he stomped anymore little people, Tyler looked at the counter where he had left the swarm of people. It was completely empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow for being so small they all sure moved fast.\" Tyler said aloud, feeling like wherever they had gone it was likely all their eyes were on his anyway. Shrugging, Tyler wanted to have a little fun. Pondering, he figured what better way than to...    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of the corner of Tyler's eye he saw a small movement scurry across the floor of his kitchen. Following the movement, Tyler stomped after it, slowly and deliberately. Clearly it was a single tiny person fleeing from Tyler's path, but unfortunately for the little speck, his path was to follow him. Running as quickly as he could from Tyler, it was clear the giant was gaining on him. Tripping and falling, the tiny man turned to see Tyler's massive foot slowly descending on top of him. Everything went dark for the little man before he realized he wasn't actually dead. Aside from the smell of Tyler's foot, somehow he hadn't been pulverized into nothing. The little man watched as Tyler shifted his foot, laughing at the terrified little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think I'd step on you too?\" Tyler chuckled loudly. \"Those other people were just an accident!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed some more as he spread two of his toes and pressed his foot to the ground, with the tiny man placed between the two toes.The little man simply froze in terror and awe as the two toes towered on either of his sides. Wiggling his toes and threatening to close them in Tyler could feel the little man's excitement just before he'd squish him right between them. Stopping again, however, Tyler didn't really have much interest in squashing anyone deliberately, not yet at least. Moving his foot completely away from the tiny man this time, Tyler knelt down, scooping the frozen little man off the ground and lifting him high up next to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, little guy?\" Tyler asked the tiny man with a cocky smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible! You could've offed me at any second!\" The man somehow blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no offense, little roomie. But what did you all think was gonna happen?\" Tyler chuckled playfully as he bent backward and sat on the ground from his kneeling position. Three or so tinies had crept up behind Tyler at that moment, just in time for the sexy giant to squash them all under his godly bubble butt. They were so insignificant however, Tyler hadn't even noticed as he continued to talk to the single little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, sir. Most of us came here expecting we wouldn't make it out...\" The little guy stuttered nervously, still in awe his god deemed him worthy of talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... so you're all throwing you lives away one way or another.\" Tyler rubbed his chin with his free hand. \"Also I ain't no \"sir\". I'm not your master. I'm your roommate. Think of me more of a bro, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man shifted uncomfortably. He wasn't expecting such an attractive titan to be both so clumsy and playful, yet so accommodating. \"O-Okay, ummm bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? It's not so hard!\" Tyler stood up, exposing three tiny red stains on the ground. Tyler looked over at a pair of shoes he wore to go running the other day and walked over to them. Reaching down and sticking the little man he had with him inside he flattened the shoe so the little guy would have a hard time escaping. \"Here! Have fun in here! That way I won't step on ya! But if you're still in there later when I need to use those shoes, you might be in some trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow deep in the shoe, Tyler didn't hear a response from the tiny man. Laughing at his own antics, Tyler turned away, seeing little specks scurry out of his path as he looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they're like bugs or something.\" Tyler thought to himself as they really did seem like they zipped around almost mindlessly. Making his way over to the his sofa, Tyler jumped on it like he normally would, landing in a laying position with a hard smack. Unluckily for a few tiny explorers the full force of Tyler's body landing on them proved to be too much. Broken and unmoving, they now laid somewhere between Tyler's butt and back as the huge stud turned on his TV. A few survivors found themselves being flung into the air in various directions. Some landing on the hard wood floor with broken limbs, another lucky enough to land somewhere on Tyler himself. Unaware of the mass destruction he just committed, Tyler simply stretched his body as he...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler stopped as he felt a buzzing come from inside his pocket. Pulling his phone out and looking down at the contact, he noticed it to be a friend he'd made outside of work playing pick up games of football with. \"Sup, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler conversed back and fourth with the friend \"Hunter\" for a few minutes before getting up suddenly, dragging the numerous number of tiny people clinging to his body with him. Going into his room and grabbing a pair of socks, Tyler slipped them on before going and grabbing the set of shoes he had just put the tiny man he spared inside. Forgetting entirely about the little guy and how he teased him earlier, Tyler slipped on the shoe and stomped it down to get his heel in. Meanwhile, atop Tyler's hat, struggling under his tank top, clinging to his shorts, and sliding off his leg hair to his ankle rested the few remaining tiny people unknowingly going to play a game of football with Tyler and his massive buddies. Tyler turned to his apartment, noticing a little scurrying as he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out for a bit! Keep the place tidy for me, roomies!\" Tyler yelled to the seemingly empty room, but also partially hoping that they would in fact try to work together to clean up some of his manly mess. Tyler smirked as he decided before he left to grab a water bottle. only filling it up with a splash of water, Tyler looked around as he spotted a tiny man peering at him from a corner on his counter. Easily, Tyler scooped the little guy up and dropped him in the bottle and looked at him from the other side of the plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky! You get to watch your roomie play some football with some buddies!\" Tyler said to the confused little man as he waded about in chest deep water. Tyler laughed as he thought the one little man was the only one coming with him, unaware of the many little hitch hikers he had on his body as he made his way out the door. Making his way outside, Tyler caught a glimpse of his friend Hunter as well as his other friend Tanner, whom also live in the same apartment complex as him, waiting for him to go play football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Tyler!\" Hunter called as Tyler looked at the lean young looking man. Hunter reminded Tyler a lot of Matt, they shared a very similar build and height of the more lean and ascetic dude. Hunter was a skater as apposed to a surfer however. With blonde hair under a backwards pink flat brimmed hat and dark eyebrows in contract to his hair as well as deep blue eyes and a very chill looking face, Hunter was definitely a skater bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore a pink tank top and a pair of grey sweatpants, despite the heat. Tattoos lined up and down his arms more so on his right side, making a somewhat of a sleeve going onto his shoulder and back. Finally, Tyler looked down at his black skate shoes, not very ideal for playing football. Despite being leaner, Hunter was fantastic at football. He could take a hit like a champ and has a cannon for an arm that nobody would expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Hunter. Yo! Tank you're joining us too?\" Tyler looked over and addressed what could only be described as a human tank. Tanner, or Tank as everyone called him was an absolute beast of a man. Standing well over Tyler and Hunter in height and out muscling likely both men combined, Tank was build more like a real body builder over both the more casual muscle builders. Though he lacked any real definition, he had mass and weight to compensate that out. With buzzed dark brown hair and a gruff looking face with brown eyes and light facial hair, Tank was intimidating to anyone who didn't know him. Wearing a red stringer tank top that said \"beast\" across the front as well as a pair of black shorts and football cleats, Tank looked like he was ready to play some serious football. The tank top didn't hide his body very well as Tyler could easily see both pecs popping out as massive as they were, covered in light brown hair all the way down to his flat stomach. Which he didn't have the vintage six pack as most of the dudes Tyler knew, he still had visible abs despite his abdomen being much more bulky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, figured I'd give this shit another try.\" Tank gave a response with a deep intimidation voice. Hunter and Tyler simply laughed as Hunter patted his enormous friend on the shoulder. In truth, Tank was terrible at football. He had butter fingers and could barely throw. But if anything he could level anyone on the field at any time as the biggest dude out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine, bro!\" Tyler reassured Tank as the gruff looking man gave a sweet looking smile. \"Just block for Hunter and me and you'll do work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men made their way to an open field near by, meeting up with several other young men, all looking to play a game of football. Tyler dropped off his water bottle as well as taking off his hat and dropped it off on the sideline, leaving both a little person he knew about as well as the one on his hat he wasn't aware of off to the side. Both tinies watched as Tyler, Hunter, and Tank ran off into the field to meet the others. To the little ones who knew about the people left on Tyler, watching the game of football may as well have been a slaughter. Tyler was tackled not to shortly into the game at the waist, easily decimating the poor tiny clinging to his shorts. From his ankle, another helpless tiny fell to the ground as they were easily trampled by the onslaught of men running over them. Holding on for dear life now in Tyler's belly button, the last little person to make it to the field also wouldn't make it out alive. Upon Tyler tackling one of his friends, the little person flew out, being crushed between the abdomens of the two giant men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting on the hat in horror, the little man looked over to see another person in the water bottle as the two made eye contact and looked to one another. Before he could even wave to the man on the hat in recognition, suddenly two men came crashing down on top of the hat. Tank had tackled another player out of bounds as the two landed on Tyler hat, snuffing out the last life that that was unknowingly brought to this field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hat!\" Tyler came over to the men, pulling his hat out from under Tank's massive ass. Wiping it off and popping it back into form, Tyler smiled as he moved his hat and the water bottle a little further away from the action. \"No worries it's all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't say the same for the guy Tank leveled, however, as he had trouble getting up. After a few minutes then man shook it off, and the players had decided that was probably enough for today. Tyler grabbed his hat, putting it back on his head and grabbing his water bottle as he met back up with Hunter and Tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Tank you gotta go easy, dude.\" Hunter laughed as he patted Tank on the back. The three dirt covered men laughed and talked on their way back to the apartment. Just as they reached the building, Hunter looked down at the water bottle Tyler had been carrying. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tyler. I've been meaning to ask.\" Hunter pointed at the bottle. \"What's up with the sip of water you brought and never drank, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at the bottle. Unsure if he should tell anyone about what he did, Tyler looked at Tank and Hunter and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Tyler handed the bottle to Hunter, who took it and looked down at it confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to keep this a secret, ok?\" Tyler told the two men as Hunter looked closer at the bottle, even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep what a secret?\" Tank asked, now also curiously looking at the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a tiny person in the bottle.\" Tyler partially whispered as both men looked even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up dude, we aren't stupid.\" Hunter laughed as Tank looked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, bro. Doesn't Tyler work at that water park where they shrink people. Look.\" Hunter squinted, barely making out the features of a tiny speck in the water to be a little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Hunter looked now closer at the bottle as he did in fact make out the form of what looked like a teeny tiny human. \"Oh shit bro! You didn't kidnap someone did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Tyler told truthfully. \"He begged me to bring him home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would he do that?\" Hunter asked, very skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's into giants?\" Tank offered as an explanation. Both Tyler and Hunter looked at Tank, a little quizzically. \"What? It's a thing. I've had people beg me to crush them or eat them if they were tiny on my fitness videos on Youtube before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean on that one video of you swallowing a goldfish on a dare?\" Hunter remembered now, being the one to have taken the video a year or so ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's the one...\" Tank rolled his eyes, trying not to think about all the cringy comments he received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so this little guy is one of <i>those</i> then?\" Hunter asked Tyler, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! He even wanted in the water bottle so I could drink him after the game!\" Tyler lied, just wanting to build off what they were talking about. \"But one of you should do it. I've got more upstairs anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More little people?\" Tank looked at Tyler, a little astonished. \"How many, like five or six?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. Like well over a hundred.\" Tyler scratched his head, still not really sure how many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, that's crazy. I thought people were only into giant women.\" Tank scratched his facial hair a little as Tyler and Hunter gave him another quizzical look. \"What? People send me messages about it. I do read them, bros.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no girls at this party!\" Tyler laughed. \"Why don't you guys come up to my place and meet them all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds dope, dude!\" Tank answered excitedly as he looked down at Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I like... shower first?\" Hunter asked, covered in dirt and sweat. Tank laughed as he was also pretty messy and agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure bros. I should do the same...\" Tyler agreed, despite just having took a shower when he first got home. \"One of you should drink that little guy though, for a nice energy boost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter handed the bottle to Tank almost instantly. \"Here, dude. Since you're the expert. Besides I don't know if I could stomach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like taking a tiny pill.\" Tank looked at the minuscule little man who may as well been the size of a grain of rice. Taking off the top and pressing the opening to his lips, Tank easily swigged all the water in one go, gulping it and the tiny man down almost instantly. \"Aww gross it was so warm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was out in the sun all that time, bro.\" Tyler laughed as he rose an eyebrow. \"How was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Tank shrugged as he put a finger on his throat, trying to feel the little guy. \"I don't feel him at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. He was real small.\" Hunter shrugged as he walked past the two men and made his way inside. \"I'm taking that shower. I'll see you guys up at Tyler's in like half an hour.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged at Tank who was rubbing his chest a little, clearly still curious about the whereabouts of the tiny man. Tyler gave Tank a gentle punch to his stomach and smiled. \"You made that little guy very happy I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but for how long?\" Tank asked, as he looked down at his stomach. \"I'd feel a little bad if he's you know... getting all stomach acided up in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Price he's gotta pay for wanting such a request.\" Tyler shrugged, hoping to get Tank more in the mood to do it again later. \"I'll see you soon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Tank smiled as he went past Tyler making his way to his own apartment to clean up. Tyler meanwhile, alone, took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was the first dude I let go not by accident...\" Tyler stood outside his door now. Making his way inside, Tyler avoided any more deliberate kills for now as he tried to clean up once again, waiting for Hunter and Tank to come by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough a half hour went by, Hunter and Tank were at his door. Tyler let the two men in and Tyler got the feeling that while Hunter seemed unfazed and still indifferent, Tank on the other hand seemed...</span></div></div>",

Hunter had already gone in, taking off a pair of sandals and sitting down at Tyler's sofa and propping up his feet. Tyler looked over at Tank, curious as to why he was being so shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong big guy? Can't fit through the door?\" Tyler mocked the huge man's size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm up for this, dudes.\" Tank admitted, still feeling a little bad about drinking that little guy early with such little thought or care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, bro.\" Hunter called out from the sofa as a few little people came out to investigate the new comers. \"See it's just like Tyler said, look at em all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few little people peeked from around Hunter's sandals, looking up at Tank with curiosity. Tyler noticed the little crowd forming and knelt down to the little people. \"I think these ones like you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They shouldn't!\" Tank looked down at them. \"I ate one of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the people looked nervous at the comment, others looked excited. Tyler smirked as he reached down to the group. \"One of you come forward, who ever likes this giant new comer the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people shoved their way to Tyler's hand but one made it before the others as Tyler lifted them up and held the person out to Tank. \"Here, take em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No dude.\" Tank refused as the little guy simply stared at him, in awe of the muscular god before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a bet with you. Take the little guy with you. If you can make friends with him and convince him he needs to go back to his normal life... then I'll do whatever you want.\" Tyler offered as an option as Tank waited for the other half. \"Otherwise, if he still wants to throw away his life or worship you or something, you have to come chill with us tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank reached his hand out, letting Tyler drop the little guy into his massive palm. Tank closed his hand around him as he looked at Tyler in the eye. \"Deal. I'll show this guy he doesn't want to end up like his buddy.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Hunter waved good bye as Tank made his way back to his apartment. Kicking off his own sandals Tank carried the little guy to his kitchen table, setting him down and looming over the little guy with tremendous hieght. The little guy practically drooled as he looked at the huge man. He now wore a white spandex tank top, much too tight for his massive frame as well as a pair of dark blue athletic shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little guy.\" Tank started out. \"My name is Tanner. But my friends call me Tank. So you can call me Tank if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man simply continued to stare in awe. Tank blinked a little as he tried addressing the man with a question. \"So what's your name, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank waited as the tiny man broke from his gaze. Turns out the little man... </span></div></div>",

Crush me! Eat me!

Pounding his fist on the table and making the little man jump with fear. \"Why are you so quick to throw your life away?! Answer me, bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving regained his balance and composure from the sudden quake, the little man looked up at Tank. \"I am a bug!

The little man fell screaming, landing hard on the wooden floor, likely breaking some amount of bones as Tank stood up and loomed over the disheveled tiny. Looking up at his god, the little man despite being in pain, reached up as he saw Tank's massive bare foot come down over him, almost in slow motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tank it may as well have been swift and quick. Planting his foot firmly on top of the tiny figure and scraping it across the floor, he sighed as he was starting to realize Tyler was right. Feeling significantly less bad about snuffing out this tiny man, Tank even felt less remorse for the one that suffered in his stomach. Sitting back down, Tank looked down at his phone wanting to see how much time even gone by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An hour...\" Tank said aloud disappointed. \"I lost my cool and gave in... in less than an hour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting his phone down.

Maybe I need a little cereal or something!\" Tyler spoke aloud to himself as he grabbed a box of cheerios and poured them into the bowl. Putting the box back up his cabinet, Tyler grabbed an empty glass and filled it with some tap water and set it next to the bowl. Wiping his brow, pretending to break a sweat Tyler spoke aloud once more. \"Shit it's so hot in here today! Why'd I even bother putting this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slowly started pulling his tank top off like he was stripping for an audience of gawking club goers as he held it in his hand, leaving the kitchen and throwing it down the hall toward his room. Going into his living room, Tyler decided to kill more time by opening a few of his windows. \"There! A little fresh air will cool it down in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the kitchen, Tyler saw little scurries of movement on the floor which he ignored as he made his way over to the kitchen counter. Seeing movement in both his water and in the cereal, Tyler couldn't help but chuckle at how fast these little people could move. Grabbing a spoon for his bowl of cereal and glass of water, he carried it out to a little dinner tray he had next to his sofa. Sitting down Tyler set his food down and looked into the cereal, already seeing a few people struggle with his movement. Tyler dunked his spoon into the cereal, deliberately scooping up a spot he saw with a tiny person in it. His mouth watered a little, deciding he had to eat at least one to send a message to the rest. Tyler could hear the screams of the little person as he shoved the spoon his mouth, then suddenly quiet. Not chewing, Tyler let the cereal soften in his mouth into mush as he swore he could slightly feel the tiny person struggle before he swallowed the food down. Tyler saw what looked like a little man struggle to the top of some cereal as Tyler quickly scooped him up inside a single cheerio and hold him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just see what happened to that other person?\" Tyler asked the little man as he screamed with Tyler's mouth opened, expecting he'd get eaten as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Don't eat me!\" The little guy begged as he tried to climb out from between the cheerio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you doing in my cereal?\" Tyler chuckled at the little man.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just exploring! Please!\" The little man begged Tyler. Tyler rolled his eyes. Even he wasn't THAT stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little friend is exploring too, right now.\" Tyler lowered the spoon down to his incredibly cut abs. \"They're down here somewhere in my stomach, say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man panicked, now on the edge of the spoon, looking like he was going to try and jump. Tyler tilted the spoon, causing him to crash into the cheerio back in the middle. Lifting it back up to his face, Tyler smirked at the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you can say hi to them in person.\" Tyler said arrogantly to the little man as he shoved the spoon in his mouth before quickly swallowing him down whole as well. Rubbing his chest lightly, Tyler grabbed his glass of water, seeing several tiny specks float around looking up at him. Shaking his head at how dumb the little people were, Tyler took a drink making sure to catch two or three little people in his swig before swallowing the liquid down. Tyler sighed as he set the cup down and leaned back, showing off his massive torso and ripped abdomen as he rubbed his stomach obnoxiously before burping loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all got five minutes, unless you wanna get up like them.\" Tyler smacked his stomach with a cocky smile. Tyler stood up and went toward his room, picking up his tank top on the way and tossing it on his bed. Tyler grabbed his phone and looked at the time, giving the little people five minutes as promised. Laying on his bed, Tyler rested his hand on his stomach, already forgetting about the puny five or so people he had stewing away inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had passed and Tyler sat up. The shift in his stomach causing him to burp obnoxiously again. Once again remembering he had those people inside him, Tyler smacked his stomach with a little chuckle. \"Man you guys are having fun in there, I bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up while still laughing a little at how easy it was to eat a bunch of dumb tiny people, Tyler walked back over to his dinner tray and looked down at his cereal and water.

Was his warning not good enough for the little people. Tyler rested his hand on his stomach, undoubtedly inched away from those five or so people stewing away in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You all want to end up in here?\" Tyler laughed as he slapped his stomach. \"Are you people serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of people squirmed excitedly as Tyler slapped his stomach. There was no other option for the little people, they wanted nothing more than to be consumed by their god. Tyler shook his head, he really didn't understand the mass of people's desires as he sat back down in front of the cereal and grabbed his spoon with a raised eyebrow. \"I mean if it's what you people want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scooped his spoon down into the cereal, not scooping one or two, but at least ten people in one scoop, Tyler was shocked as he didn't really get any cereal in the scoop as it was mainly occupied by little people. Tyler lifted the spoonful up into his mouth and opened it up wide, giving the massive group of people a view of a lifetime as he deposited them inside. Tyler perused his lips and he pulled the spoon out, empty. Knowing he had at least ten people wriggling around inside his mouth, Tyler tried not to think about it as he swallowed the \"food\" in his mouth, sending it wriggling and squirming down into his hungry stomach. Tyler set his spoon down into his cereal as more people climbed inside before Tyler could even scoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you people are desperate...\" Tyler chuckled as the struggles of tiny people faded behind his chest deep inside his massive stomach. Tyler burped again, not anything loud or obnoxious but still enough to make a point. Seemingly this just excited the tiny crowd even more excited. Forming to the top, tons of people sat above the cereal hoping to be the next in line to be eaten by their god. Tyler smirked, feeling like he was caring less and less about his tiny worshipers as they made it easier to sacrifice themselves to him. Tyler scooped again, getting only people this time as he his spoon was full of people, almost as many as there was then when he convinced the people into the Tupperware container. Tyler lifted the spoon to his mouth, chewing only slightly as he held the crowd in his mouth, Tyler swallowed as a vast majority went down whole as an unlucky few found themselves being crushed to mush as Tyler sat back satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuuuurp!\" Tyler ripped a massive burp as he sent at least ninety percent of people people he brought with him down into his gut. Looking over at his water, Tyler noticed there was more than a few specks floating around. Grabbing the water and chugging it all down, Tyler burped again, leaning back and setting down the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man.\" Tyler caressed his stomach. \"I can't believe I did that.\" Tyler looked down at his empty bowl and his empty cup. Seemingly almost all the little people he brought with him desperately wanted to be eaten by him. Tyler sat back, amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I almost feel bad...\" Tyler said aloud as he saw maybe one or two tiny people scurry across his floor. They were all gone, and Tyler ate them all. Burping again, Tyler rubbed his neck as he made his way to his bedroom. Laying down, he knew there wasn't anything he could do besides digest the mass of little people who so willingly gave themselves up to him. Laying down, Tyler rubbed his stomach pompously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was kinda awesome...\" Tyler smirked as he drifted off into sleep, forgetting about the hundred or so people screaming in pain in the acidic environment of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next day, Tyler yawned as he made his way into the bathroom, sitting on the toilet and playing on his phone as he went about his morning routine. Stretching as he left the bathroom, he couldn't believe he had the day off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, what do I do...\" Tyler wondered aloud as he didn't even see a tiny person scurry across the floor. \"Must've got them all throughout the night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if he rolled over them or swallowed them in his sleep, Tyler didn't care. All he knew is that they're all gone. Tyler grabbed a tank top and threw it on. He knew he needed to get a little taste of little people no mater what. Leaving his apartment and heading toward Shrink and Swim, Tyler knew he'd have to head toward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Making his way to Josh's office, Tyler looked around at the throngs of people at the park, still in disbelief that he had abducted hundreds of these very people the day prior and now they were long gone. It didn't really phase him though, they all wanted, and he was sure if these very people saw him as a giant right now, they'd want it too. But right now Tyler had one person in particular on his mind, Josh. Making his way to the office and opening the door, Tyler smirked as he saw his meek friend seated at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, bud!\" Tyler smiled as he made his way into the office Tyler made his way over to Josh's desk, ignoring the chair and choosing to loom over the desk as Josh looked up at him in bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a treat!\" Josh smiled at his friend, looking at the man clad in a red tank top, black basketball shorts, sunglasses hanging off his forehead on his backwards red hat. \"I didn't expect to see you here on your day off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was bored.\" Tyler smiled, picking something between his teeth, absentmindedly wondering if it was some tiny person's clothes or even a bone. \"Besides I wanted to see you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we see each other all the time, silly.\" Josh sat back in his chair with a smile as he couldn't help but admire his best friend. \"But I'm happy you're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be!\" Tyler flexed his arms. \"I wanted to ask you though. Let's hang out after you're off work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want we can right now. I'm caught up on all my work, park's on autopilot all day today anyway.\" Josh shrugged, honestly just a little excited to leave and go hang out with Tyler instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooord, bro.\" Tyler smiled as he sauntered back a few steps. \"Hey, you should meet me in the break room, we can hang out giant and tiny style like we did in the good old days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Yeah that would be cool.\" Josh thought back to the last time he was tiny with Tyler outside of work. \"It has been a while since we've done that outside work huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Tyler smiled. \"I promise I won't even make you do push ups this time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better!\" Josh called out to Tyler as he left the office with a bit of a devious smirk. Leaving the park and returning to his normal size, Tyler circled around the the break room, seeing not a single person in there was he made his way over to the balcony and awaited Josh's arrival. Tyler saw the little door open, and his still teeny tiny friend emerge from the door and walk up to the edge of the balcony, staring up at Tyler's muscle form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna scoop him up and swallow him...\" Tyler thought to himself, cant helping but to shake the idea that he was baiting his best friend into being eaten. Taking Josh into his hand and leaving to return with his friend to his apartment, Tyler thought about how he wanted to approach this. He didn't want to be forceful, it was his best friend after all, but he wanted nothing more than to have his tiny friend who started all these feelings to be a part of him deep in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler set Josh down on his table, having made little bits of small talk with the little man on the way, but by now Tyler had reached his decision. He knew if he wanted to pull this off he needed to...   </span></div></div>",

He knew what he had to do, he knew Josh admired his body and it was going to be as easy as seducing the little guy with his massive muscles. Standing in front of Josh, Tyler started to pull of his red tank top, deliberately doing it slowly as a bit of a show in front of his friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry dude, I'm just so hot. I have to take this off.\" Tyler tossed his tank top across the room and knelt down a little, getting close to Josh. \"Also sorry if I smell, dude. I didn't shower this morning. I probably reek of sweat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but turn a little red and stare, he never could quite get used to Tyler undressing in front of him like that. \"No no, it's fine, Ty. Besides I can barely tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, because I don't really feel like taking a shower yet.\" Tyler stretched a little in front of Josh, still staying as close to the tiny on the table as possible. \"Hey Josh, can I ask you a random question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, sure.\" Josh answered, mostly feeling transfixed by Tyler's magnificent body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of my muscles are you favorites? My abs? My pecs? What about my arms, or my ass?\" Tyler started flexing a little with his deliberately loaded question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm...\" Josh turned even more red, hiding his face now, as he couldn't believe he was being asked this question. \"I-I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked again, knowing he had Josh very flustered at this point. Leaning down even more, Tyler brought his face level with the table as he could see Josh covering his own tiny face. \"Hey, it's okay to look at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh uncovered his face, hearing Tyler's voice much closer now, and as he did his vision was now fully obstructed by Tyler's handsome face and gleaming white teeth as he smiled down at his tiny best friend. Just then, Josh answered on impulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your face the most. You have really nice brown eyes and beautiful features.\" Josh was embarrassed to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... good to know, bud. But I asked you for my favorite muscles.\" Tyler smirked, showing off more of his teeth. \"But if my face is your favorite, it has a few muscles on it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler opened his mouth and moved his tongue around, before closing it and smiling. \"You're a nerd, so you'd probably be able to tell me the tongue is one big muscle, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah I suppose it is.\" Josh shrunk back a bit, feeling a bit embarrassed as Tyler opened his mouth wide in front of him, considering he's always had fantasies about going in his friend's massive mouth. \"I guess maybe your mouth is my favorite part of your face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked, his teasing was going perfectly. He knew he'd have to dial it back a tiny bit though or it might not go exactly to plan. Getting off the floor and instead raising himself to obstruct Josh's view with his abs, Tyler flexed them in Josh's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you don't like my abs, dude.\" Tyler continued to flex and press them closer to Josh. \"After all that's where my mouth goes down to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess technically, it goes to your stomach. Your abs are just covering your abdomen.\" Josh clarified, as he looked up at Tyler who was looking down at him with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd. Just a tiny little nerd.\" Tyler said slowly and seductively. Just then, Tyler's stomach gave off a fairly long and audible growl. He couldn't help but to smirk as it was perfect timing by his own body. Rubbing his hand up and down his abs, Tyler looked down at Josh. \"My stomach must've heard you talking about it, bro. It says nerds are only good for protein, not for telling the difference between it and my abs.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um...\" Josh really didn't know what to say to that. He's never really seen Tyler act like this, but it was hitting every one of his fantasies he's ever had for his massive friend before. \"I don't even think I'd be worth much protein really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still being a nerd huh?\" Tyler patted his stomach now. \"One more nerdy remark and I might just have to give my stomach what it wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your stomach can't talk, it's an organ.\" Josh instinctively clarified as he found himself being easily scooped up into Tyler's hand now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as you wanting to meet my stomach, to find out if it can or can't, bro.\" Tyler lifted Josh up close to his face. Tyler smirked as he held Josh up close to his lips. \"Admit it, you want to go in my mouth. You want me to swallow you, little nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's mouth opened up, as Josh was given the choice now to walk his way in. Against his better judgement, Josh was drawn in as he felt compelled to enter his hot best friend's mouth and let himself be eaten by the stud. Tyler felt Josh start to enter his mouth, as he retracted his tongue, pulling Josh inside and chuckling as he he felt Josh slide around a bit in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could never fool me, dude. I've always known.\" Tyler taunted Josh sliding him to the middle of his mouth, covering part of his mouth as he let out a tremendous burp, making sure to keep Josh from flying out. Tyler thoroughly enjoy burping on his tiny friend, having everything go exactly how he wanted it today. Tyler took his time, feeling Josh slip and fall on his tongue a few times, but he desperately wanted to swallow his little friend. Just then Tyler's stomach gurgled loudly once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that dude? My stomach is getting impatient.\" Tyler taunted Josh once again. Tyler knew it was time. Leaning his head back, and feeling Josh slip to the back of his mouth, Tyler swallowed with a small gulp. Feeling his friend vanish out of his mouth, Tyler put a finger on his throat, feeling the tiniest struggles inside. Burping again as he still felt Josh in his throat, Tyler continued to feel as Josh traveled slowly down, before the feeling vanished past his chest, into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my mouth to my abs, right nerd?\" Tyler taunted his abs, giving them an exaggerated pat and rub as he burped once again, obnoxiously loud this time. Tyler leaned against a wall, still feeling his stomach, so satisfied with his latest victim. Especially since this one was so very special to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that was so worth it.\" Tyler smugly smirked, looking down at his perfect body. Tyler let out a deep breath as he pushed himself off the wall and yawned, looking down at his phone as he walked into the bathroom. Accidentally stumbling across a picture of him and Josh together, Tyler holding Josh off the ground in a headlock, as his friend looked to be both struggling in pain but also so happy. Tyler put a hand on his stomach thinking about Josh inside him and thought...          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dude! Put Luke with me!\" Matt said with a goofy grin. Josh shook his head and agreed. Luke was a great lifeguard. Kind of a goofball, Luke is 23 years old and is 6'3\" with buzzed blonde hair and greenish eyes. He has a similar body type to Matt's except he is a little more thickly muscled than the thinner surfer dude. He also has a tattoo of a bird on his back, in the center between his shoulder blades. Josh sighed as Matt walked away excited to be stationed with Luke. He knew those two got along, probably because Matt needs Luke's childlike energy to keep him going through the day sometimes. For now though, Josh yawned as he closed the door to The Dude Flume behind him. Heading home, Josh was ready for a good night's sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next morning, Josh was ready and raring go to the park and get the new part set up. Making it to Shrink and Swim Josh entered the break room around the back to see Matt and Luke ready for their first assignments as giant lifeguards. Luke bounded forward, ready to make a good impression on the tiny people coming to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo boss! Matt and I are stoked to supervise the new ride!\" Luke said with a huge smile on his face while Matt slugged behind him, looking kind of tired. Josh laughed, knowing Matt wasn't much of a morning person whereas Luke was more of anytime kind of guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning boss.\" Matt yawned as he came over and leaned on Luke's shoulder. Josh sighed as the short haired blonde started to rub his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready? We have to get Matt set up.\" Josh said with a smile hoping to get the ball rolling. Josh motioned for the two to follow him into the newly built room and he and Luke helped get the ride on Matt and had him seated at the chair. Josh stopped to make sure everything was in order. Looking at the slide it started up by Matt's shoulder where the line of people would meet the start of the tube, then it travels down in a slow loop under Matt's armpits as it continues to circle Matt's body at a not so steep angle. Finally, it loops around Matt's back and drops slightly as it travels below his butt and under his crotch and ends in a newly built pool between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Josh admired as the water for the ride came on and flawlessly made it all the way to the pool without any leaks. Josh nodded to himself in approval as he started to leave the room, ready to go open the park. Luke made his way to his post, sitting in the chair he looked at Matt and made a few goofy faces at his friend as Josh left the room. Making his way into the front of the park, Josh shrunk down as he came into the entrance and opened the park for business. Excitedly, Josh started to work his way toward the new opening in the park, leading to The Dude Flume. Walking through the doorway, Josh pushed a turnstile so they could keep track of in and out guests as he walked into the gigantic room. Walking past the concession stand, Josh waved to the worker stationed there as they prepped their meals for the day. Moving forward, Josh saw what the real attraction was. Laughing, Josh saw as a giant sized Matt sat at his post with the nice clear tube around him, almost looking half asleep. Off to the side he saw Luke sitting at his station, watching him from a distance. Josh moved to the balcony to get Luke's attention and waved. Coming right up to the balcony Luke looked down at the tiny man and squinted before finally recognizing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey boss. Thought you were our first guest! I was going to tell you to stay away from the railing!\" Luke said with a jovial smile. Josh stared up at the huge muscled man. He could barely see past his solid abs and massive pecs, but he knew his handsome face was hiding somewhere way up above his sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Luke!\" Josh called up to the giant, unsure if the man even heard him. Regardless, Luke turned and wandered back to his post, looking ever alert. Next, Josh walked up to Matt, looking at the half asleep giant. Sighing, Josh started to climb up the wooden stairs leading to Matt's shoulder. Making his way up quickly since nobody was here, Josh reached Matt's colossal broad shoulder in no time and yelled up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT WAKE UP!\" Josh screamed as loud as he could. Turning his face Matt looked over to see his first tiny guest, before his eyes widened embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss! I'm awake!\" Matt said as he looked at Josh with his deep blue eyes and a smile. Josh gave him a thumbs up and grabbed onto the top of the tube that was fastened to the wooden stairs. Pushing off, Josh rode down the ride for the first time since it was made. He gawked at the scenery as he passed below Matt's arm pits and made his way around his fantastic chest. As Josh rushed past Matt's hardened abs he knew the final drop was soon. With a good view from the clear tube it looked like he was about to drop straight down into the back of Matt's board shorts, but angled off down more at the last second. It was dark as Josh rode below Matt's sitting body before he finally came out at the end in the pool, looking back all he could see was Matt's massive legs on either side of him meeting his his crotch resting right above at the end of the tube. Satisfied, Josh made his way to the door as he passed a few cautious looking guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That new ride is a blast!\" Josh said to the group of people, trying to put them at ease. Josh turned at watched as the group of people made their way forward to now more alert and attentive looking Matt. Josh nodded as he left through the door to get some work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke yawned as he stretched his legs out a little. Looking out into the ever growing crowd of tiny people he couldn't help but imagine what everything must look like to them. Thinking it would be funny, Luke stood up and walked toward the balcony, lowering his sunglasses over his eyes and putting his whistle in his mouth. Scanning the crowd carefully, he noticed a tiny boy running around. Tweeting his whistle slightly he pointed to the boy. He immediately calmed down, slowly walking at his mother's side. Many of the guests went back to their business, but a few people stopped and continued to gawk at the giant adonis looming over them. One man walked up right to the edge of the balcony and stared directly up at Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful around the balcony, sir.\" Luke said to the minuscule man. He didn't seem satisfied by the answer however as he started jumping up and down. Getting down as low as he can, Luke lowered his ear to the tiny man. Listening to the little man for a second Luke bit his lip as the tiny man laid a wade of miniature bills on the ground. Picking them up Luke lifted a finger, indicating to him to give him a minute. The man sat patiently as Luke walked over to Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" Luke whispered as best he could in Matt's ear. \"This guy just gave me 100$ if I eat him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good to go, sir.\" Matt said to the gentleman waiting to go down. Turning to Luke he tried his best to keep his voice down as he whispered back. \"Dude! That's sweet, if he's for real sneak him into the break room and do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, man I knew you'd be cool with it!\" Luke said excited. \"Let's keep this our thing, yo?\" He added happily. The two men bumped fists quickly as Luke made his way over to the little man once more. As discreetly as giant in a room full of tiny people could, Luke offered the tiny man a ride on his finger as he lifted him up quickly and walked his way into the break room. Finally in private, Luke looked at the tiny man seriously under his dark sunglasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure you wanna do this, little guy?\" Luke said looking at the bug sized man. Luke watched as he shook his head excitedly and started hopping in place. Smirking, Luke lifted the tiny guy to his face and opened his gargantuan mouth, dropping the man inside. Closing his mouth, he stopped for a second as he felt the little man try and stand up inside. Luke gave a toothy smile as he leaned his head back slightly, feeling the little guy inch closer and closer to his throat. With a simple gulp, Luke felt the tiny man disappear from his mouth now struggling feebly in his throat. Tracing the tiny guy's voyage all the way down, Luke rested his hand on his ripped six pack and rubbed the muscles happily. Feeling nothing anymore, Luke made his way back into the room to resume his post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, dude. That was sweet.\" Luke said nodding to Matt as he walked back into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky...\" Matt said as Luke sauntered his way back to his seat. Suddenly the next woman in line spoke up as she looked up at Matt's handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd pay to let you eat me rather than your friend.\" She blushed as she reached into a water proof wallet. Matt's eyes widened as the woman held out the cash. \"I heard when he whispered to you before, I think you're better looking so I'd want you to do it.\" The woman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luuuuuuuke!\" Matt whispered loudly as Luke came over holding another tiny person. \"This chick wants... me... to... why are you holding that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him?\" Luke said looking down at the eager man. \"He wants me to sit on him. Gave me 50 bucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... we could start a secret business.\" Matt exclaimed with a happy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on many people requested things from being eaten, to being stepped on, to being sat on, to even being dropped down the front of one of the guys shorts. Luke listened as their next costumer had different tastes. This man wanted...                     </span></div></div>",

All the while the Dude Flume resumes its typical water park thrill-seekers while holding his head steady. Luke approaches him from the shoulder without customers and leans towards his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this new guy is gonna pay us 2000 bucks,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he want?\" Matt tries to be discrete as he lets another customer down the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bro...he wants to be eaten, but by someone who doesn't know he's eating him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that rules us out,\" Matt frowns. \"Won't be the same if one of us swallows him then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's really excited about it. He's got his phone with him and he wants to do selfies inside a guy's mouth and stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds awesome, dude,\" Matt lets the next customer through. \"Hope it can be pulled off. Don't want anyone to know about this that's for sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke winks. \"Dude, don't worry. I got a plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs secretive as last time, Luke signals the rich customer to approach his palm. The little guy steps onto it and Luke wraps his fingers around him, trying his best not to show him. Then he discretely sneaks him out of the new attraction room and into the break room. There's one stroke of luck. On the kitchen table he sees a large box of nachos - probably one of the lifeguards bought to share with the others at his expense. For Luke, it's bait to fulfill the tiny man's wish. He asks for his cell number, knowing that he has to work rather than raise suspicion and watch. He sets his ear close to the tiny customer. Repeating the number in his head, Luke drops him into the nacho cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grabs his phone from the break room and smuggles it to the new attraction room.

Then man pulled out a huge sum of money, leaving on the ground for Luke to retrieve before turning away and leaving the new section of the park. Walking over to Matt, Luke watched as he carefully pinched a person between his fingers as his buddy stuck the little person into his armpit. Next, he motioned for the next person to ride down the slide, as they were impatiently waiting for the person in front of them to get their cheap thrills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo you gotta hear what this next guy wants.\" Luke said leaning down beside Matt. Matt moved his head to better listen to Luke's whispers as his giant friend continued. \"First off he's paying us 2000 bucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Matt sputtered as he heard the number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, he even paid up front. He wants us to take him after the park closes and just humiliate the shit out of him. Taunting, belittling, insulting. The whole 9 yards dude.\" Luke stated as he continued to be as quiet as possible. \"Then he wants us to fight over who get's to eat him up. He made sure to let me know he wants whoever it is to keep taunting him on his way down. Yo, also he said that once he shows up, that's it. No amount of begging, screaming or trying to run away should stop us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For that much money the little guy is gonna get his fill that's for sure.\" Matt said as he plucked the tiny man out from inside his his armpit, setting him down at the entrance of the slide. Luke watched as the delirious man stumbled down the slide, disappearing down the tube. \"So this guy is meeting us here right at closing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he said he'll be right up against the balcony where I was standing earlier.\" Luke replied looking back at his buddy's face. Matt shook his head and gave his friend a thumbs up as Luke walked back to his post. Figuring there wasn't much time till the park closed, he turned away a group of tinies ready to throw their money at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry folks, almost closing time!\" Luke said sitting in his seat and rubbing his chest. The group of littles started to march away, slightly disappointed they didn't get their fantasies filled today. Luke didn't care though, looking in his pocket he saw wades and wades of tiny bills that he and Luke planned on hiding in a spot in the break room later to grab. Leaning back, he figured there wasn't much else to do today than wait for the rich tiny man to come back and get his fill of Matt and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the clock in his office. He sighed seeing it was just a few minutes till closing. Figuring it would be best to check on Matt and Luke, since he hasn't all day, Josh got up to leave his office. Making his way to the new area of the park Josh slowed his steps for a second as he watched as another man about his height and older than him stood there by the turnstile, looking nervous. The man turned away from the entrance to the new section of the park, looking pale. Josh scratched his head, wondering if the guy must have forgotten something. Shaking it off, Josh went through the turnstile and headed into the now mostly empty area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out, Josh saw Luke helping Matt get out of the new ride as the two carefully lowered it to the side of the room for storage. Proud of his two employees for being so diligent in their work, Josh started to walk over to the edge of the balcony and waved to the pair of giant men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke spotted the tiny man waving in his direction. Squinting slightly he started to walk toward him leaning down to the little guy and calling to Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt!\" He called as Matt set down the slide and looked over to him. \"Look! It's...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

I had completely forgotten! He's already here in the park?\" Josh asked his head lifeguard hurriedly. Tyler shook his head, while looking down at his short boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, I need you to come with me, as head lifeguard I want you at my side when I speak with him!\" Josh said, already walking toward the entrance motioning Tyler to come with him. Tyler was shocked to hear his boss wanted him at his side, but shook his head quickly and walked up beside Josh. Walking quickly Josh tried to brief Tyler with anything Mr. Morebucks might ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and remember most importantly look him in the eye when you shake his hand and I introduce you, so you'll have to ditch the sunglasses for now. That'll give him a good impression of you. Otherwise don't worry, I'll be doing most of the talking anyway.\" Josh assured the bulky man at his side. Tyler just nodded his head nervously and pocketed his shades. Josh suddenly stopped and Tyler halted, turning toward him. Josh looked seriously up at Tyler, directly into his eyes. \"I wouldn't want any other person at my side. You're gonna do great!\" Josh smiled warmly at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident, Tyler smiled back and the two continued their walk toward the entrance to meet the savvy investor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Morebucks, sir?\" Josh said to a middle aged man of about 43. He recognized him from newspapers and articles on the internet. Besides he was the only person at the park wearing a suit. \"Good to meet you sir. My name is Josh, I'm the owner and operator of Shrink and Swim.\" Josh said extending out his hand to the taller man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a little intimated by the man, obviously well built, and taller, probably about 6'2\" he felt small compared to the rich investor. Next, Josh motioned to his right, \"This is my head lifeguard and right hand man, Tyler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler extended out his hand, this time it was Mr. More bucks who was intimated as the ripped man looked more like a bodyguard not a lifeguard. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Morebucks.\" Tyler greeted professionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is mine to both of you.\" Mr. Morebucks greeted back pleasantly. He motioned two his left and a young woman stepped forward. She had long blonde hair and was a little shorter than Mr. Morebucks, not to mention she was quite an attractive woman. \"She must be a model!\" Josh thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my wife, Rebecca.\" The young woman extended her hand first to Tyler who blushed, shaking the woman's hand back gingerly, as she turned away from Tyler she faced Josh and said, \"This is a fantastic park you have here, Josh. Its wonderful to meet you.\" She added softly as she extended her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm humbled by your complement, madam.\" Josh said eloquently, as he shook the woman's hand. Rebecca smiled as she backed to her husband's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that the formalities are aside, we can talk business.\" Mr. Morebucks said, hoping to move this along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir. Please come with us back to my office and we can have a seat.\" The four walked down the path as Josh gave a small tour along the way, naming all the slides on the way, and noting how there's never been an accident. Making sure to point out the \"Safest park\" award on a wall of medals just outside his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the four sat down, and Josh pulled out many sheets of papers. Expense reports, employee records, and even some marketing ads. All the while Tyler looked over his boss's shoulder making sure to keep his back straight and keep his expression serious. It didn't suit him but he knew he had to put on his best act for Josh's sake. As Mr. Morebucks and Josh went over the expense report, Josh was listing numbers to the rich investor that made the man gasp. \"There's no way that's all it costs to run this place! That's incredible!\" The middle aged man said with his mouth a gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers for Tyler went in one ear and out the other, however Mr. and Mrs. Morebucks looked over at Tyler with shocked expressions, \"Can you believe this? I had no idea your boss managed this!\" Mr. Morebucks said at the confused lifeguard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Tyler started as he looked down at his side to Josh's face. Josh just turned his head and smiled. \"He's a genius, that's all there is to it!\" Tyler finally said making Josh blush ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right he is! It's decided. I'm going to invest in this park. With a brilliant owner, and capable staff, there's no reason not to!\" Mr. Morebucks said dramatically as his wife turned and smiled at him. \"Oh hon...\" She added cutely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Josh said excitedly. \"If that's the case we can start talking about expanding the park right away! We can take on more staff and manage more entrances and double our guest count in a matter of a few days!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Construction can be that swift?\" Mr. Morebucks questioned with a surprised look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based off the size of the park, its basically like putting pieces of a toy together. It can be done in just a few days with only a few workers.\" Josh stated professionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Mr. Morebucks replied, taking out his checkbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. and Mrs. Morebucks left the park, excited in their new investment. Josh turned to Tyler and hugged him. \"This is the happiest day of my life!\" Josh said practically sobbing into Tyler's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler hoisted his boss up, slinging him over his shoulder. \"I'm h-happy I could be here for it...\" He said choking back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening before everyone headed out, Josh went into the break room from the park to tell, his now gigantic staff, that the park is being invested in and they're going to start expansion effective tomorrow and that in two days the park will be back and running with new rides. Cheers came from the huge lifeguards as Josh delivered this great news.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting everyone will be getting a raise made the crowd of massive lifeguards all the more excited. \"20% across the board for everyone!\" Josh yelled into the microphone so his staff could hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as the crowd of lifeguards started to leave the room Josh got a chance to wind down and relax. Now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

The past 5 hours it's been interview after interview as Josh brought on tons of new staff to prepare for the expansion. \"Sure is a lot less interesting doing it at normal size though.\" Josh almost pouted to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his clipboard he counted up all the positions he needed to fill. \"Let's see entrance staff is done... Concessions are done... Mechanics... Security... All  set!\" Filing through the interviews he has left he saw he only needed a few more lifeguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're making 10 new rides... hired about 5 lifeguards today... so 10 more tomorrow should be safe.\" He said putting his clip board to rest on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up he decided to have a look around front and make sure construction was going smoothly. There were three workers, 2 burly young men placing the pieces gingerly into the park, and one older looking man sitting at a table piecing the rides together. Josh turned to their supervisor, a woman in her early twenties, wearing a white hard hat looking down at a clip board and blueprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" Josh started as the woman looked up. \"Oh sorry didn't see you sir. I meant to introduce myself sooner. I'm Alexis.\" She said sternly as she reached out a gloved hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it formally Josh looked at the woman's face. She wore a bit of makeup, but he could tell she was a very serious looking woman, albeit a very attractive one too. Josh blushed slightly as he spoke, \"Y-yes well, I've been rather busy myself. So the fault is all mine for not speaking to you sooner.\" He added chuckling nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its quite alright, sir.\" She said pressing the clip board softly against her breasts. \"Anyway, sir, you can see progress is being made quiet smoothly.\" She said gesturing over to the miniature park. \"We should be done tomorrow ahead of schedule\" She added with a slight smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard by the smile, it made Alexis' face turn from serious to very pretty. Looking directly at the park instead Josh quietly replied, \"T-that's great news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis walked over to the older worker as he just finished carefully piecing together a new water slide. Carefully picking it up she cupped it in her hands and walked it over to Josh. \"This is one of the new rides you designed, sir.\" She said holding the ride with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It has quiet an elegant design...\" She said looking down at it with a twinkle in her eye. \"Is it to your liking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the ride easily held in the young woman's hands it really put into prospective for Josh how tiny the park is. Happy with how the ride was constructed Josh nodded and smiled at Alexis. Flashing another smile, Alexis turned away to give the ride to one of the other workers as they pieced the park together. Josh blushed again as she turned away. \"What a pretty smile...\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went on to observe the construction for awhile as he awkwardly conversed with Alexis about the vision he had for the expansion of the park, when eventually...          </span></div></div>",

But why a water park?\" She asked blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Josh had never really thought about that before. \"I guess its always really hot here? So a water park seemed like a good ide-AH!\" Josh was interrupted as he was suddenly pulled into a headlock and pressed between a pair of sweaty pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis quickly turned to see what happened as she saw a huge shirtless man wearing only a pair of red and black basketball shorts with a cord sticking out the pocket up to his ear phones as well as a pair of white running shoes. Confused she jumped back wondering why her employer was suddenly snatched up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guesssss whooo bosss!\" Came the familiar tone from above Josh as he held the man to his chest with his left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme go you big buffoon!\" Josh choked as Tyler's sweat started to run through his hair, drenching the back of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the smaller man tightly to his chest Tyler simply said, \"Mmm... nah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the confused woman Tyler addresses his boss again. \"Yo Josh, introduce me to your lady friend here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer struggling as Josh accepted he could simply hang there against Tyler's massive chest he figured he'd comply. \"Alexis, this is Tyler. One of my lifeguards. Tyler this is Alexis. She's overseeing the expansion of the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEAD lifeguard!\" Tyler added proudly as he extended out his sweaty hand to Alexis, still holding his boss captive. Reaching out to shake back Alexis couldn't help but smile at Josh's dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two seem close.\" She said still smiling at Josh as he kicked his legs around a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" Tyler said happily. \"Josh is my little buddy. I had to run by and see how things were going, I figured he needed a break since he's probably been working nonstop all day!\" He said, as he rubbed Josh's head holding him even closer like a little rag doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But here I find Josh schmoozing it up with some lady friend!\" Giving him a thumbs up in the process with his free hand. \"Good job tiger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started blushing, although it could have just been from the lack of oxygen or the heat Tyler's body was giving off. Either way Josh was none too pleased about the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three talked for some more time, all the while Tyler wouldn't release his smaller friend from his grasp. Finally, after a while the workers had to start packing up and go. Alexis waved laughing at Tyler as he still refused to let Josh go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finally departed Tyler released Josh from his death grip. Gasping Josh leaned over, \"Oh god I thought I was never getting free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww little buddy, I just wanted to hold you close to my heart the whole time!\" He said rubbing Josh's head as he walked over to the half open park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I've never seen it opened up like this before!\" He said peering down at all the little walkways and rides. \"Look! Its your adorable little office!\" He said pointing in wanting to poke the tiny building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't break it!\" He said hurrying over to his muscular friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't gonna, don't worry boss.\" Tyler said straightening his back and turning back to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way boss.\" He said eyeing his short buddy. \"That Alexis chick was totally into you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, looking down at the ground. \"Yeah right, she was laughing the whole time because of you torturing me. She was definitely into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you're super smart. She's probably way more into that than a dummy like me.\" Tyler said leaning down to look at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you're a lot better looking than I am, women are way more into looks!\" Josh snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped and blushed at each other's compliments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably won't know anyway.\" Josh said breaking the silence. \"She's part of a larger company, which means she'll be moving when the project is over anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well!\" Tyler said, putting his arm around Josh, almost pressing his face into his still sweaty pit. \"Say la vee!\" He said happily forcing Josh to walk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its C'est la vie, dummy.\" Josh said, pressing his palm to his face as the two walked each other home.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Glad to be finished with all of the tedious interviews and have dozens of new employees on hand soon. Turning around the other side of the building Josh peeked around the corner, spotting Alexis. Josh swallowed hard as he recalled his encounter with formal, yet elegant woman yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stalking Alexis, eh boss?\" A voice came from directly above Josh as he jumped backwards with fright, right into the perpetrators chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler... you scared the shit out of me!\" Josh scowled at his larger friend as he leap back to his original position. Looking at Tyler, Josh noticed he was significantly less sweat drenched today. He wore a red and black spandex shirt, tightly showing off his impressive physique. He was also sporting black running shorts as well as red running shoes. Looking back up at Tyler's smirking face Josh finally added, \"What are you doing here again anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy little buddy. I was just checking up on you.\" Tyler said winking and putting an arm around the little man. \"Besides I wanted to watch when you finally asked Alexis out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh immediately turned bright red. Tyler knew as well as Josh that Alexis wasn't going to be around long, however the thought did cross Josh's mind more than once to at least ask the attractive woman out to dinner as thanks for her hard work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I was debating doing that yes, but only as friends and to thank her for her hard work.\" Josh stuttered trying to convince himself he could do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head and started to move forward. \"This is for your own good boss.\" He said as he picked Josh up with ease. Josh squirmed and flailed before being unceremoniously tossed out on the lawn toward the front of the building with a rather loud thud. Josh's world spun for a moment as he tried to lift himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?!\" A voice called out to him as Josh saw a figuring running to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I-\" Josh stopped his thought as he looked up to Alexis's face as she extended a hand down to help him up. \"I-I mean... No I'm fine... I just uh... tripped.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis laughed as she helped pull Josh up off the ground. Josh stood up and brushed himself off. As he looked up however, his eyes met with Alexis's. Josh quickly looked in another direction and tried to strike up a conversation. \"Oh so it looks like construction is going well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis turned and looked over at the park as she saw two of her workers starting to reattached the glass box. \"Actually... it's finished, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, in truth he didn't even look at the park. \"Oh well even better I guess! It'll be great to see everything from the inside soon too I'm sure!\" He tried to go along nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it will! But unfortunately, it's going to be time to head out soon. Lots more projects to work on!\" She tried to add cheerfully. Josh rubbed the back of his head at the cuteness in her tone. He couldn't believe how comfortable the woman seemed to feel around him after just knowing him for a day. Josh knew this was his chance. He had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, can I ask you something?\" Josh said as he felt his heart beat out of his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" She said happily turning to Josh once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be interested in...\" Josh's heart started to beat faster and faster. \"I-in going out to dinner with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis looked at Josh, with genuine surprise in her eyes. Slowly she put a finger on her lips, touching the soft skin lightly as she looked off in thought. \"That's very sweet of you Josh but,\" Suddenly Josh's world shattered as he heard the word \"but\" and quickly his heart started to sink. \"But I have to leave soon. My flight is actually just in a few hours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to compose himself Josh forced a smile on his face. \"Oh I didn't realize you were going to be leaving so soon! I'm sorry I put you on the spot like that!\" Josh tried his hardest to sound sincere while struggling to keep his smile up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know work, right? Busy busy!\" She added trying to be a little funny. \"Besides... I kinda just assumed well... what with you and Tyler...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assumed what?\" Josh asked, genuinely confused as to what Tyler had anything to do with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind about that.\" She said with a smile as she looked over at her workers who just finished packing. \"It looks like we're heading out. We don't want to miss our flight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Josh said starting to feel a little depressed. \"It was nice working with you Alexis.\" Josh said hoping to end the relationship professionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, remember my company if you ever need any more additions will ya?\" She added with a playful wink before turning away to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as she got in the company's truck and drive away. Sadly, Josh turned toward his park and walked up to the tiny enclosement. Looking directly down at it, Josh tried to reflect at what just happened to him. Josh barely noticed as a huge muscular arm rested itself around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough buddy.\" Tyler said, standing next to his little friend trying to console him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's wrong with me?\" Josh said looking at himself in a faint reflection coming from the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dude. I'd date you.\" Tyler said smiling at the disheveled man. \"Women are just confusing sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped to think for a second. He was still confused at what happened. What did Tyler have to do with him getting rejected? \"Yeah she was confusing. Something about you and me. I bet it's just because she's into you.\" He said looking slightly up at the handsome man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's face twisted into a frown. \"Wait I must've not heard that part. Did she reject you because of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put his hands in his pockets, frowning in just as much confusion as Tyler. \"I have no idea. Maybe?\" Josh said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a bitch.\" Tyler said under his breath. Tyler took his arm off from around Josh. \"I'm sorry dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled for the first time for real since being rejected. \"For what? Being better looking than me? Don't worry about it Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned and looked down at Josh, now with a fairly goofy smile. \"Dude, go on a date with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the muscle man confused once more. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Go on a date with me.\" Tyler said leaning down and winking at Josh. All the while Josh just sort of stared at Tyler and blinked. \"Whaaat? I'm waaaay hotter than Alexis anyway! My boobs are just as big too!\" He said cupping his huge pecs in his hands and bouncing them up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\" Josh started to say before Tyler interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't reject me bro! I'm putting my heart on the table for you here!\" He said smiling at Josh while trying to tug on Josh's heart strings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine you big goof!\" Josh said happily, much to Tyler's excitement. \"What did you have in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought we could...\"     </span></div></div>",

Do go on.\" Josh said now crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude, I just uh...\" Tyler said now rubbing the back of his neck. \"It would just be more fun for you and me that way. More exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Josh said not shifting his stance an inch while he continued to give Tyler a piercing glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine and you're kinda really...\" Tyler started to say before uttering one last word under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda what?\" Josh said relaxing his posture finally to look at Tyler a little less demandingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really cute when you're small.\" Tyler said finally blushing and looking at the ground. \"I feel like you big protector sometimes and it makes me feel cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed from the compliment, but tried to to quickly shake it off. \"Y-you're like my big protector even when I'm not shrunk though!\" Josh said inching closer to Tyler and looking up at his blushing face. \"But if you think it would be more fun to go on a date with me when I'm tiny I'd be fine with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled as he reached out an arm and pulled Josh into his chest in a tight hug. Josh struggled for a second before he realized the was no way out of his huge friend's grip. Trying to relax Josh simply patted Tyler on his massive back as he continued to clutch Josh in his beefy chest. \"Thanks dude! We're gonna have a good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tyler released Josh and laughed as he watched his small boss catch his breath. \"So when do we wanna do this?\" Josh asked, actually getting excited over the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the park opens back up tomorrow and we have the rest of today still...\" Tyler said looking over at the shrinking machine right outside the newly renovated park. \"We could go tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at Tyler up and down. \"You're gonna take me on a date wearing that?\" Josh said sarcastically as he looked at Tyler's red and black spandex shirt and black running shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaat? Dude I look sporty!\" Tyler said flexing his right bicep. \"Besides we won't go anywhere too fancy. Gotta go somewhere casual on our first date, right boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed. Tyler was always a very hard guy to say no to after all. \"Alright we'll go tonight... and you can wear THAT if you have to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled and gave his boss a thumbs up as he started to figure out the last couple details of this date. \"So boss.\" He started as he re-positioned himself next to Josh and put an arm around him. \"I have some options for you. I thought maybe we could do a simple dinner and a movie or we could grab some food at the pier amusement park and go on some of the rides together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second. Both options sounded fun. Josh had never been to the pier with anyone before and the rides were pretty fantastic, although at a shrunken size it could be dangerous if Tyler wasn't careful. On the other hand dinner and movie sounded safer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I wanna...\" Josh started to say as he got cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go shrink first, then meet me around back and give me your answer then?\" Tyler said as he started to lead Josh over to the entrance to Shrink and Swim.  Josh shook his head. Figuring it could save some time and he could think about it more on the way over, Josh hopped into the shrinking machine and operated the controls to have him shrunk and sent into the park. Once inside Josh looked around at his newly renovated park. The entrance wasn't all that different, a few extra booths and more room for people to go in and out, but on his way to the break room he passed several new rides of his own design. Smiling proudly at his own engineering skills Josh turned his way into the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door Josh looked out over the balcony and soon saw almost nothing but the red of Tyler's shirt coupled with the bulging muscle concealed beneath it. The man he was small compared to before now stood in front of him a literal giant. However, knowing he was in good hands Josh happily walked forward to greet his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm here!\" Josh shouted up at his muscular employee. Tyler looked down at his miniaturized boss smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude see, you're just so dang cute when you're small!\" Tyler said still smiling. \"I could just eat you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes. He never knew Tyler found him so adorable small before. After all he was pretty small compared to him normal sized too! \"I wonder if he thinks I'm cute then too...\" Josh thought to himself as Tyler lowered his hand. Tyler raised the little man to his face before finally asking,\"So boss, what did you decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put a hand on his chin and weighed his options before deciding that they should go to...      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wanna go to the Pier.\" Josh said with a smile as he looked at Tyler's enormous brown eyes. \"I think it would be neat to go on the rides together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled, truth was he was really looking forward to the rides too not to mention the park was famous for their delicious hot dogs and fried dough that he really wanted to have! \"Great boss! Now we just need to come up with a good way to keep you with me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lowered Josh down to his shoulder and watched as the tiny man struggled to stay on the semi-slick surface of the spandex shirt. Coming up with an idea quickly however, Josh had Tyler lower him back down to the balcony. Tyler watched as Josh left back into the park for a few minutes before reappearing with some sort of rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a spare bungee cord for one of the rides!\" Josh said as Tyler's hand lowered down to collect him once more. As Josh watched himself being transported back to Tyler's shoulder once more, he tied the cord firmly around his torso and hips. Finally, back on Tyler's shoulder Josh was able to weave the tiny cord right through a small hole in the spandex and tie it securely to the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at what Josh was doing and slowly walked into the bathroom to get a better view using the mirror. Josh gave the huge man a thumbs up and Tyler started to shift his shoulder in as many different directions as he could in an attempt to send the tiny man off. Luckily the cord was secured well enough that Josh was able to stand his ground efficiently, much to both men's delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're all good, dude!\" Tyler said happily as he looked at his tiny friend in the mirror. Josh nodded in agreement, although he wasn't sure if Tyler could see his head motion or not. Regardless, Tyler started to head out from the bathroom and back into the break room. As the door opened to the outside, Josh had to shield his eyes from the now extremely bright sunlight. Looking around Josh realized this must be how it feels to see things from Tyler's prospective. Everything seems so impossibly far away, in yet from his new height Josh could see up and over all kinds of hedges and posts that he'd never seen before. As Tyler walked along the boardwalk leading to the pier Josh couldn't help but look out into the ocean. The waves sparkled softly with the salty mist from water, thanks to the bright sun reflecting right on the deep blue surface. Occasionally, Josh's view was interrupted by a passing by giant or two. From massive muscled surfer guys, to bikini clad women Josh certainly had his fill of gigantic beach goers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to relax as he felt Tyler looking down at him, making sure he was ok. Josh turned a glance back up at his massive friend and smiled. Tyler quickly looked away and blushed sightly as he realized Josh was looking directly at his face. Trying to look serious, Tyler continued his march down the boardwalk, determined to get there with Josh perfectly safe. Chuckling to himself over Tyler's goofy looking serious face, Josh turned away at looked back out over the beach as a young looking woman walked by, checking out Tyler on the way forward as well as turning around to check him out from behind. Josh shook his head as the woman went out of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tyler.\" Josh called up to his giant date while they were out of ear shot of other people. \"That girl was eye banging you real good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed out loud, causing Josh to lose his footing slightly and grab onto the bungee cord. \"She can look all she wants, but I'm yours for tonight, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but grin stupidly at the comment. He'd kill to be checked out like Tyler was just now, but somehow just knowing Tyler was here for me him made it not seem nearly as bad as he'd normally feel. Josh took a deep breath as he held onto the bungee cord and tried to sit down on the slick red surface of Tyler's shirt. Looking forward he could clearly see they were nearly at the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up in awe as he could see the Ferris wheel and even a small roller coaster looking high above and away from him as he and Tyler made their way to the ticket booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One please.\" Tyler said to the receptionist as he handed them money in exchange for a ticket. Tyler winked at Josh quickly as he stuffed his wallet back into the pocket of his athletic shorts. Tyler strode his way through the crowd, occasionally looking down at his shoulder at his tiny boss making sure nothing went wrong. After a minute of searching, Tyler found an unoccupied bench a little way away from the crowd and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty tricky we only had to pay for one of us huh boss?\" Tyler said as he turned his head to look down at tiny Josh on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me! Make sure you let me know how much I owe you. I don't want you paying for me, especially since it's a pity date...\" Josh added a little gloomily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler snapped his head forward and tried to look serious again. \"It's not a pity date. You're a great guy and you deserve a good time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down, embarrassed that he jumped to conclusions. \"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to assume.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked back down at Josh again and smiled. \"Don't worry buddy. We're gonna have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked back up and smiled at Tyler. The bliss however was short lived as a pair of nervous looking girls shuffled their way forward toward Tyler. Raising an eyebrow Tyler looked at the girls and blankly asked, \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls turned bright red and cowered behind her friend and simultaneously tried to inch her forward as well. The girl in the front decided to finally speak up. \"H-hi... My friend here thinks you're super hot. Can you give her your number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's face got a little red with anger. Here he was on a supposed date with Tyler, and suddenly girls are walking up and asking for his number? Before Josh could get any more pissed off however Tyler spoke up, \"No. I'm here on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's anger quickly washed away at Tyler's words. He really was here for him. The two girls however, weren't about to take no for answer as she spoke up again. \"Well what if it doesn't work out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd know better than you.\" Tyler said blankly as he looked away from the girls. Josh watched as the two girls turned away disappointed. He couldn't help but stick his tongue out at them as they started to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerk!\" The one girl called out as her and her friend created some distance and disappeared into the crowd. Tyler laughed at the half-ass'd insult as he looked back down to Josh with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have cared if you gave them your number.\" Josh lied as he looked back at Tyler and faking a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude. What am I going to have to do to prove that I'm here with you?\" Tyler said still smiling warmly at Josh. Josh couldn't help but look down once again in embarrassment. Tyler was trying to show him a good time after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I'm sorry. Again.\" Josh said looking up at Tyler woefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize.\" Tyler said as he rested his hand on his stomach. Suddenly a loud groan erupted from his stomach as he rubbed the slick surface of his shirt covering it. \"Man I'm hungry what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was Josh wasn't that hungry, but given the roar from Tyler's gut he seemed starved. \"Sure I could go for some food.\" Josh said with a smile as he braced himself for Tyler standing. Josh watched as Tyler worked his way through the crowd once more to a concession stand. Many people walked by with plates of delicious looking food, which made Tyler all the more antsy to be next in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tyler managed to acquire an order of two hot dogs with chili sauce and ketchup and an order of fried dough smothered with powdered sugar. Last but not least, Tyler got himself a bottle of coke and started to work his way out of the crowd once more to find a table. Luckily, for the pair they found a nice empty picnic table away from most people where Tyler set down his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Tyler reached down to one of his hot dogs and tore off a bit of the skin and placed it on his shoulder next to Josh. \"You'll be safer to eat up here. Just let me know if you want more, ok dude?\" Tyler said as Josh grabbed the tiny morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down at the food, Josh quickly tore through the tiny piece of food. Tyler definitely underestimated how small Josh was, or at least how much he could eat. Josh peeked over the edge of Tyler shoulder to see him digging in to the food below. The tantalizing aroma was intense as Josh felt drawn to the food, wanting to just swim in the sea of powdered sugar, or take a bite from the hot dog himself. Josh however, looked at his torso and waist as he was reminded that he was literally tied to Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he'd notice me if I untied myself and grabbed a bite.\" Josh thought as he saw Tyler's arm lead straight down toward the plates of food. Josh looked over at Tyler's face, absentmindedly chewing away on a piece of food before swallowing hard. Josh winced as Tyler's adams apple bobbed, sending the food down to his massive stomach. \"Then again maybe I should just ask him for more food...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short decision process Josh decided...             </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh rubbed the back of his head awkwardly as he tried to keep a conversation flowing with Alexis. Looking to his side he saw someone else approaching however. She was a tall young looking woman with long blonde hair. Josh stifled for a moment until he realized who she was. Excusing himself, Josh left the construction site and worked his way over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Morebucks! This is a surprise! How are you and your husband?\" Josh asked politely as he went to shake the attractive woman's hand. Smiling she looked around the construction site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Josh, You can call me Rebecca.\" She said with a friendly smile to which Josh nodded in approval. \"Freddy wanted to see the progress, but he had to fly out this morning for business. I was planning on staying in town for a few days however, so I thought I'd drop by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well as you can see everything is going very smoothly! Thanks to you and your husband the park is nearly doubling in size!\" Josh said with an enthusiastic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful to hear!\" She said tiling his head slightly as she looked at a few new rides and tubes being placed within the park. \"But there was another reason why I wanted to stop and talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at her, a little worried. Hoping there wasn't a problem Josh simply smiled and responded, \"Sure, anything you need to talk about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side and holding her hands, Rebecca looked at the ground. \"It's about my son actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at her confused. If she had a son he couldn't imagine him being very old. Josh tried to keep smiling however, hoping he didn't have to get involved with some little kid somehow. Rebecca however, kept staring at the ground and continued her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband and I were high school sweethearts. We actually got married when we were only 19. As his business started to take off, it was about the time our son was born.\" Rebecca continued as Josh tried to comprehend the story. \"That was 21 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the woman dumbstruck. She was the same age as Mr. Morebucks? He couldn't believe this woman was in her 40s, let alone has a son in his 20s! Shaking his head Josh tried to keep focused as Rebecca finished her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were lucky, my husband started work in real estate back when the housing market crashed. Somehow we made it through and built up a company. We knew what it was like to have nothing. But not our Clifford.\" She said, looking as if she was going to cry. Turning her head to look at Josh she tried to hold back her tears while she continued. \"He goes to school around here. We even have an estate where he stays while he's at school. He's a freshmen at one of the universities...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put a hand on his chin for a second while she said that. \"A freshmen? Did he start late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca simply shook her head as she looked back down at the ground. \"No. He's been a freshmen for 3 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes widened. He couldn't believe a school would keep someone like that for so long. Figuring the family must have a good amount of influence however, Josh figured it was best not to pry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has no motivation. He doesn't understand the value of a dollar. He thinks he can just get by in life with good looks and his father's money.\" She said with a shaky voice, obviously very distressed about it. \"But then we met you! We were so impressed by your staff. All very handsome young men, but all so very motivated and respectful of you. A few of your employees remind me of Clifford, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he rubbed his neck. Sure some of the guys were slackers, but he knew they all respected him on some level. Rebecca smiled as she looked at Josh's red face as she continued. \"Freddy and I were hoping since the park was being expanded, maybe you could hire him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the woman, shocked at the request. \"Oh, yeah it's true we are hiring a lot of new staff. Does your son need the job? Especially if school is a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca simply shook her head. \"We both agree a job would good for him. Even if he doesn't need the money, he needs to learn to work. Not only that but he needs to learn to respect others. Finally, he struggles in school because he wastes all his free time. If he had an actual schedule we think he might try just hard enough to pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. He wasn't exactly ecstatic about getting some guy with no experience or motivation to start working at his park, but his hands were a little tied. \"I'll do whatever I can to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca practically leap forward as she grabbed Josh's hands, thanking him. Josh smiled, but he knew there was sure to be rough times ahead. \"Thank you so much! Oh, I have to have you meet him as soon as possible! He went skim boarding on the beach nearby while I was out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was caught off guard when suddenly he found himself being drug off by Rebecca to the boardwalk, making their way to one of the nearby beaches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Josh made their way to the beach and the pair looked out across the sandy surface for a few seconds before Rebecca pointed out a guy in the distance, skim boarding along the water. Rebecca waved and called out his name embarrassingly loud as the man noticed and shook his head as he grabbed his board and walked over. Josh watched as Clifford came into a view, much to Josh's awe. The man looked to be taller than his father by a slight amount. Josh guessed he must've been at least 6'4\". He has dirty blonde short hair and rich looking hazel eyes. His body looked extremely well trained, as it was covered in lean strong looking muscles. His dirty blonde hair even peeked up from his shorts in a short treasure trail. Looking at his face however, Josh couldn't believe how good looking he was. He has strong looking features and a cut jawline. Josh swallowed nervously as he realized what Rebecca meant by \"Getting by in life with good looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled as her attractive son brushed a little water out of his hair as he made his way over to them. \"Clifford, honey, I'd like you to meet someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClifford's face suddenly turned to a scowl as he looked at his mother. \"Don't call me Clifford, mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! He hates being called by his full name. He like's being called Cliff because it sounds tougher, right hun?\" Rebecca said, acting like a quintessential embarrassing parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff simply turned his head and crossed his arms. \"Tsk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, hun. I want you to meet Josh. He's the owner of the park your father just invested in.\" Rebecca said happily as she ignored her son's attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff looked over at Josh and raised an eyebrow. \"I think of heard of that place. Shrunk and Swim or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink and Swim, but yeah close enough.\" Josh tried to say politely at the handsome man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Cliff said flatly as he lowered his arms off his impressive chest. \"Why am I meeting you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at her son seriously for a second while she prepared to drop the bomb on him. \"Because honey. You're going to be working there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff turned his back on his mother and walked away. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh simply blinked as the huge man walked off, not even giving his own mother the time of day. Rebecca simply sighed as her son stormed off. \"I knew he'd do that. But don't worry. We are going to have a good talk when we get home. I'll have Freddy call you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca excused herself, thanking Josh once more as they finally parted ways. Walking back to the park, Josh shook his head. \"Geez that guy seemed awful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried this guy might actually end up at his park against his will, Josh couldn't help but cringe at the thought. Back at the park, Josh saw that the construction crew had already packed up for the day. Noticing that the park was in fact closed up, Josh thought it might be an opportune moment to get inside and looked at the park, as well as sneak into his office. Heading to the shrinking machine out front, Josh shrunk himself down and entered the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Josh noticed the park looked in pretty good shape. Everything that was supposed to be in place was there, and even some of the new rides looked to be nearly operational. Smiling at the swiftness of the work, Josh made his way into his office to sit back and file a few papers while the day was still young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours went by and Josh sat back in his chair. It really was a full day after all, and he was glad to get some work done even though he didn't expect to be able to. Josh's bliss was short lived however as his phone in his pocket started to buzz. Pulling it out and looking at the lit screen, Josh saw Mr. Morebucks's name come up on the caller id. Swallowing nervously, Josh answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Josh.\" Josh answered as he heard the familiar gruff sounding voice reply to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, it's Freddy. Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My wife told me you met Clifford.\" Mr. Morebucks replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Morebucks! Yeah, we talked for awhile and she told me all about Cliff. Does this mean you ended up talking to him?\" Josh asked nervous to know the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a great family talk over skype, believe me.\" Mr. Morebucks said sarcastically. \"But yes, in the end I convinced him that he has to get a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned as he thought about the unruly rich boy coming to work at his park, bug figuring it was the right thing to do, Josh replied with a happy tone. \"That's great! Hopefully I can work with him and he can learn about the working world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm counting on you.\" Mr. Morebucks said seriously much to Josh's excitement. \"But one thing I need you to do is give me periodic updates, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Josh said simply, unsure why he needed to keep tabs on his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, by the way I told him to head over...\"            </span></div></div>",

Good luck with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Morebucks hung up the phone quickly without another word, leaving Josh speechless that Cliff was likely just outside. Standing up hastily from his comfy chair, Josh realized he wouldn't have time to go all the way out front, then all the way out back. Sighing, he turned out the light to his office, knowing he'd have to meet the spoiled man while being little more than a speck to him. Turning the corner to quickly enter the interviewing room, Josh flicked on the light just as he saw the huge man open the door to the little room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was impressed by what he saw. Based off his attitude earlier he was fully expecting disrespectful rich boy to show up in a tank top of something. But Looking up and down at him, Josh was pleasantly surprised. He wore a slick looking expensive black suit with a white collared shirt and black silk tie. His hair was styled and gelled to the side, looking like an actual young professional. Josh watched as the man moved across the room, taking a seat on the chair in middle of the room. Moving forward, Josh started to speak to him using a specialized microphone for the purpose of conducting interviews while he's at his reduced size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff, it's great you could make it on such short notice.\" Josh said professionally, trying to advert form the truth that he was actually lucky Josh was still even in the building. Cliff simply looked around, trying to locate the source of the voice. \"I'm up here. Sorry I had to meet you like this. I was busy with paperwork in the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff leaned forward as he squinted, looking directly at Josh in his shrunken state. \"You weren't this small when I met you earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head, expecting to have to explain this as usual. \"Well you see, the premise of shrink and swim is that everyone in the park is shrunk. The park is actually packed in a very small area, but because the people are so small it seems like a normal sized park to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Cliff said flatly as he leaned back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get on with the interview, Josh figured it would be best to make it as normal as possible even though he was already basically forced into hiring the guy. \"You cleaned up nicely from when I saw you earlier. You look very professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said with a bored tone. \"Or maid told me I'd never get hired if I looked like a bum. So she dressed me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh winced at the comment. It must be nice to have someone dress you up so you don't look like scum. Josh wondered if the man even knew how important it really was as he continued to talk, \"Either way, you look good. Anyway, I'd like to know more about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff shifted in his seat slightly, looking uncomfortable. \"I figured my mom probably told you plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I know is you prefer being called Cliff.\" Josh lied as he tried to get the man to at least talk about himself.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There would be a problem if you didn't know that, little fella.\" Cliff said in a very serious tone. \"I don't know, man. I'm in college. My parents travel a lot. I like sports. I like to party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh listened as Cliff continued to list irrelevant facts about himself until he finally finished. Satisfied with the giant so far, he figured it was time to test Cliff a little. \"What do you hope to gain through getting this job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Cliff said scratching his chin. \"What do you mean by gain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean like, through working here, how do you expect to grow as a person?\" Josh said, trying to spell it out a little more cleanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm 21. I think I'm done growing.\" He replied ignorantly as he raised an eyebrow to the tiny man. \"You could probably do with a little growing though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. There was no way this guy was that out of touch with the world... \"I mean like grow on the inside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff put a hand on his abdomen and looked down at himself. \"Pretty sure I'm done growing in there too. This is a weird question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there, mouth a gap at Cliff's stupidity. \"Different question then. What good do you think this job will do for you, if you're hired.\" Josh said, asking the same question a third time in different words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it would get my dad off my ass.\" He said staring up at the ceiling, bored out of his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to be getting somewhere, Josh pipped up, \"That would be good! Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... not really.\" Cliff said still staring up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...\" Josh mumbled, astonished by the man's lack of interest. \"I guess finally, are you willing to learn the skills you need to be a lifeguard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\" He replied dryly as he looked forward at Josh. Leaning forward, he looked directly at Josh's tiny form with a slight shred of interest in the tiny man. Speaking up Cliff said...     </span></div></div>",

Josh started to back away to the door, but unfortunately for him, Cliff was faster. Josh helplessly fumbled around as the handsome man simply snatched him up and help him easily in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had a tiny person before. I think I'll keep you.\" Cliff said with a slight smile as he looked down at Josh. Josh looked up at the behemoth astonished by what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me back down right now! I'll call your father!\" Josh threatened as he reached into his pocket to retrieve his cell phone. Cliff simply raised his eyebrow and started to smirk at the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better put that away unless you wanna end up a smear, little guy.\" Cliff said confidently as he raised his free hand above his other, ready to clap his hands together at any given notice. Josh slowly took his hand out of his pocket, leaving the phone inside and raising both his hands in submission. Cliff smiled, looking like he was enjoying himself for the first time since he's gotten here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to give me that tiny phone by the way. You're going to need it to tell my dad how awesome I'm doing while you're living with me.\" He spoke sternly as he watched Josh pull his phone out and set it down carefully in Cliff's enormous palm. Josh figured he had to bide his time and try to figure a way out of this. For now he figured it was best to just play along to Cliff's childish games. Josh stood there helplessly as Cliff picked him up with his free hand and transferred him into his shirt pocket. Dropping the tiny man inside, Cliff patted his chest gently as he felt the little man move slightly against his massive pec. Closing his hand around the tiny cell phone, he walked toward the exit to the room and walked outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the car he came in, the driver started the engine and came out to open the door for him. \"On your way home, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff merely nodded at the driver as he closed the door for him as he got in, and went back around to operate the fancy vehicle. Riding home, Cliff couldn't help but actually feel excited about taking the tiny man. Life was so boring all the time anyway, he was just glad he could get something new. Still gripping the little phone in his hand as well, he watched as the driver pulled past the gates leading to his family's estate. The driver came back around, opening the door for Cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I was informed that your mother flew out shortly after you left. Sounded like it was important.\" The driver said as Cliff got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures.\" Cliff spat angrily as he turned back to the driver. \"I'm in for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir.\" The driver said as he retrieved the keys to the car and hung them on a rack in the huge garage. Making his way past the Morebucks's many cars, the diver eventually made it to his own, a smaller looking slightly beat up Honda. \"Good night, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff didn't respond as the driver backed out and left the grounds, tapping in a key code to the gate as he left and closing the gate. Cliff walked out of the garage and hit a button to close to door as he looked at his family's estate. To him it wasn't much, but to anyone else the huge building would be considered a mansion. With the help gone for the evening, Cliff smirked as he knew he had the house to himself. Walking up to the front door, he opened the massive oak door and let himself inside.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him, Cliff turned on several lights and walked through the huge empty house. The entry way was a huge room with a chandelier hanging in the middle above the first and second floor, with twin curved stair cases leading to the upstairs. Yawning, Cliff took the flight on the right, heading to the east wing of the house where the bedrooms were. Making it to his spacious room, he carefully laid the tiny phone he held in his hand down on his wooden boutique. Taking off his expensive jacket and tie, he simply threw them on the floor without a care. Pulling down his pants and slipping off his shoes, the handsome man looked at himself in the mirror as he ruffled his hair, messing the gel right out. Looking down past his tight black compression shorts, he reached down and pulled off his sweaty silk socks, making a face as his smelly feet were exposed to his nose. Rearing back up, he finally reached into his pocket on his chest, pulled a terrified tiny man out finally from his cologne smelling prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered nervously as Cliff set him down carefully on his boutique, opposite the side form where his phone was located. He swallowed as he watched the handsome man watch him closely as he quickly unbuttoned and pulled off his white collared shirt. Beneath he wore a tight looking white tank top, which he also decided to ditch. Clad in only his tight underwear, Josh couldn't help but marvel at the magnificent man as he stood before him. Josh watched as he casually stroked his muscled body up and down, clearly looking at himself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it feel like?\" Cliff said, not looking away from his own reflection. \"To be in the presence of a god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked away. Disgusted at himself for even ogling the man for even a second. Suddenly a hand slammed down beside him, making him jump in fear. \"I asked you a question, pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sneered at the word \"pet\" for a moment while he worked up some sort of response. \"It's incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that's not so hard.\" Cliff said putting a hand on his jaw line and turning his face with a smile. \"Grab your phone, tell my father how great of an interview it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked across the wooden surface as he saw he phone sitting on the other side. He looked at Cliff for a second while he pulled a pair of shorts and a tank top out of a dresser and start to put them on. Walking over to his phone, Josh sighed as he couldn't believe he was being held captive by this spoiled brat. Having made his way to his phone Josh looked up to see Cliff putting a baseball cap on his head, backwards. The gorgeous man puckered his lips as he examined his reflection, trying to get his hair to stick out under the cap perfectly. Josh rolled his eyes as he grabbed his phone, blown away by how much of a douche Cliff looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Josh found Cliff's thumb hovering directly above his position. Josh shook as he looked up at the massive digit as it threatened to crush him at any second. \"Make it good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed as he picked up the phone and pulled Mr. Morebucks's number off his recent list. Hitting the number, Josh listened to it ring a few times before it came to the answering machine. Taking a deep breath Josh waited for the beep and recorded his message. \"Hi, Mr. Morebucks. It's Josh. I just wanted to let you know Cliff did fantastic in his interview today, and I look forward to seeing him working in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hung up the phone and set it back down on the floor, looking at Cliff's finger as it moved away from it's crushing position. \"Good job my little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scoffed, looking away from the attractive hunk in front of him. Cliff simply looked down at Josh, smiling more than he had in a long time. \"We're going to play a little game. I'm going to leave my room and you hide. Then I'm going to try to find you. If I find you too fast though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked as the huge man stopped short on his next words. He simple looked down at Josh with an arrogant smile and nodded his head up and down. Josh shivered, wondering what the consequences could possibly be. As Cliff started to leave the room he...               </span></div></div>",

Waiting for a second for the phone to ring, Josh impatiently tapped his foot on the wooden surface of the boutique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What up my man!\" Tyler's voice blurted out from the other end of the phone as Josh's heart leap for joy that his best friend was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TYLER I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THIS CRAZY RICH DUDE YOU HAVE TO SAVE ME!\" Josh screamed through the phone much fast and louder than he intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah... slow down. What?\" Tyler's voice said confused on the other side of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. Tyler. Long story short, I'm shrunk and I've been kidnapped by a rich dude who wants to keep me as a pet.\" Josh said nervously, yet much more coherently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a joke?\" Tyler asked, suspicious of Josh's motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking! Ty, I don't know what this guy plans to do with me. You have to help me!\" Josh pleaded to his friend, nearly stamping his feet in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll call the police.\" Tyler said nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that will work. They're literally the richest family in this town.\" Josh said wondering how dumb it would sound to have someone call the police on the Morebucks of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, then what do I do?\" Tyler asked nervous about his friend's welfare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Uhh he left the front door unlocked I think... I think there's a gate around his house though.\" Josh fiddled as he tried to remember what he heard as he was trapped in the man's shirt pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great dude. Lemme just break into some rich kid's house.\" Tyler spat back sarcastically. \"I don't even know where this house is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do a search for the name \"Morebucks\" I bet their address will pop up.\" Josh said, answering the question simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You really want me to break into his house?!\" Tyler yelled back as Josh fidgeted nervously looking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got kidnapped! If anything happens we just installed security cameras in the interviewing room anyway! We can prove he kidnapped me!\" Josh yelled back at Tyler hoping to get his friend to get a move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell didn't you lead with that?!\" Tyler yelled slamming his phone and hanging up. Josh looked down at his phone, seeing the call ended. Sighing, he hoped that meant Tyler had some sort of plan to save him. Slipping his phone back in his pocket, he figured in the meantime the device might be useful. Just as Josh started to look down at the floor below, he heard Cliff's voice from the other side of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got 10 more seconds, little guy!\" He called out through the door in an almost playful tone. Josh started to sweat as he looked around the room, hoping he could find a place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9...8...7...\" Cliff's voice called out as Josh took a leap off faith off the boutique. Landing on the floor he looked around quickly from Cliff's clothes on the floor to the bed across the room. \"6...5...4...3...2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned around and without a second thought, dove under a thin passageway under the enormous wooden boutique. \"1... ready or not here I come...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard the door open from his dark hiding spot. The passage way was much too thin for Cliff to slid his hand under, so Josh figured it must be a decent spot to conceal himself from the child-like man. Looking out under the crack, Josh saw a massive foot stomp down in front of his hiding place. Hearing Cliff pick up his clothes, he spoke as he searched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if you hid in here! Smells like me... bet you were drawn to it.\" The arrogant man said as he rifled though his discarded clothes. Dropping the clothes back to the ground, Josh heard the man huff for a second. seeing his walk way, Josh was glad to see he went off to check a different location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff went on to continue searching in many different spots, taunting his little pet as he went along. Disappointed after not finding Josh for too long, the huge man decided to leave the room. Shutting the door behind him, Josh sighed in relief over not being found. Weighing his options, he wasn't sure whether to stay put until Tyler arrives, or make himself visible to Cliff to be vulnerable. Laying on the floor Josh pondered as he decided to...        </span></div></div>",

It wasn't the best response, but he was happy to see it was better than nothing. \"You're welcome, the park doesn't open for a few days still. Maybe we could use that time to train you. As long as it doesn't conflict with your school schedule of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff gritted his teeth at the word \"School\" before looking back to Josh. \"I'm done with classes around the time I got here today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked a little surprised at what he heard. Based off what Rebecca told him, Cliff seemed like the type to skip all his classes, not to mention he was out skim boarding just earlier. Scratching his head, he couldn't begin to imagine what Mr. Morebucks could have threatened Cliff with to make him come here and go to his classes. Shaking the thought, Josh simply smiled and answered back, \"Alright, that's perfect. You can meet me here tomorrow after your classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Josh exchanged phone numbers with the young stud and watched as he stood up. Cliff turned his back quickly and merely muttered, \"Great.\" Before opening the door and leaving Josh's sight. Josh sighed deeply as the huge man left the room. Glad to see he was out of his hair if even for a day. Turning to leave back into the park, Josh was exhausted and ready to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day went by all too quickly for Josh. Waving good bye once again to Alexis and the construction crew, Josh figured it was safe to renter the park once more in an attempt to catch up on some work while he had the peace and quiet. Sitting down at his desk, Josh sighed as he figured there was plenty of time to get a bit of work done before Cliff would arrive. Smiling as he looked down at his phone, he figured this would be a task better handled with a little help. Searching through his recent text messages, Josh located Tyler's name. Tapping out a message to his friend, he knew the reliable man would be the best suited for the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Josh did in fact receive a message. However it was not from Tyler. The name read, Cliff and Josh quickly opened the message to see what he wanted right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey im here.\" The message read flatly as Josh jumped out of his chair. Running around to the door to the break room, Josh opened the door to the expansive room built for tinies and giants to traverse with ease. Looking out past the massive kitchen table to the entry way, Josh clearly could see Cliff's massive form entering the room. The man wore a loose white tank top, with some sort of brand logo on it Josh had never seen before, as well as a pair of comfy looking athletic shorts. On his head he wore a red baseball cap, backward with his hair sticking out slightly in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Josh did not expect to see Cliff here so early. Waving out from the balcony, Josh tried desperately to get Cliff's attention. Squinting, Cliff noticed the minuscule man and walked over his position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you always gonna be tiny when I see you?\" Cliff asked, with a bored expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, trying to reassure the giant stud. \"It's just been really bad timing both times is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I guess it's kind of interesting though.\" Cliff replied rudely as he crossed arms and peered down at the tiny person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating, Josh hoped for a reply from Tyler soon. \"Ok well since we don't have access to a pool today, why don't we go over CPR?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's CPR?\" Cliff asked blankly as he continued to stare down at the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stands for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\" Josh replied professionally. Cliff however, continued to blink, confused. \"You know? That thing people do when they press on another person's chest when they have a heart attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff merely frowned and shook his head, still unsure what to think. Josh stared at the man, dumbfounded. \"You've never heard of CPR?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff closed one eye and stuck out his tongue. Looking like he was in thought for a second. \"Maybe I saw it in a movie once? I don't know, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh almost inadvertently face-palmed but held the action as not to look like he was insulting the young man. \"Well we're going to learn it today, you may need the skill to save someone's life, you know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save someone's...life?\" He repeated slowly as he looked down at Josh confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's what lifeguards do. You guard people's lives.\" Josh said plainly to the dumb jock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a bodyguard?\" He replied looking like he was on to something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of!\" Josh smiled, glad to see he at least had some concept of guarding another person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's a heart attack?\" Cliff asked, leaning down and looking somewhat interested. \"Sounds weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head, blinking quickly in a silent but blind frustration. Suddenly the phone in his pocket made a buzzing noise as Josh raised a finger up as he checked the message. Looking down at Tyler's reply, Josh read...    <br>\r\n <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

All of his gigantic employees filled excitedly out of the room, happy to have 2 days off and come back to a glorious raise. All except one that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over at his tiny boss and smiled. Walking over to the balcony with is tank top slung over his shoulder he bends down to congratulate his boss once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you pulled it off, dude!\" He said scratching the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it, Ty. There's no way I could've done it if it wasn't for you standing by my side the whole time.

I just want you to know I consider you one of my closest friends...\" Josh added cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already knew that dude!

I was wondering maybe we could spend them together. You know you could stay at my place, and we hang out during they day and stuff?\" Tyler asked now with his chin resting on his arm, looking at his little friend for a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" Josh said excitedly. Spending more time with Tyler would be awesome, Josh wondered what Tyler had in mind for what to do....\"Lemme just go around front and I'll meet you back here!\" Josh added excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually...\" Tyler stopped his little boss. \"I was wondering, wouldn't it be cool if you spent those two days with me... like you are now?\" He mentioned pointing at his tiny quarter inch tall boss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you mean, shrunk?\" Josh asked, as Tyler started to nod his head. \"Do you think that's... safe?\" Josh asked cautiously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm the best lifeguard there is!\" He said leaning back, flexing both of his biceps. \"I'll guard your life better than anyone ever could!\" He added trying to assure his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there for a second and decided...</span></div></div>",

Last time I checked out your apartment it was no better than your old dorm room!\" Josh chuckled remembering back to the first time he even met Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair, my place is kind of a mess right now.\" Tyler smiled as he rubbed the back of his neck. \"That reminds me we haven't hung out like <i>this</i> since you stayed at my dorm that one time, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lowered his hand, allowing his tiny friend to climb aboard as he whizzed his hand up toward his chest. Shaking his head from the quick change in elevation, Josh smiled, thinking about the time a few years ago. \"Yeah I remember. It was the first time I was ever shrunk. It was terrifying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think it was very terrifying, dude.\" Tyler winked as he turned to head toward the door. Josh simply rolled his eyes, knowing his friend's snarky tone all too well. Making his way out into the parking lot, Tyler made his way to the sidewalk and started the short walk to Josh's home. Being only a few blocks away from the park, Tyler knew exactly how to get there as Josh sat in Tyler's hand, taking in the gigantic surroundings of his neighborhood. Walking up to the front door, Tyler pulled on the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's locked, ding dong.\" Josh called up to Tyler, crossing his arms and shaking his head. Tyler smirked as he reached for the door bell, pressing and holding the button in and causing an extremely loud ring to Josh's tiny ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding dong!\" Tyler yelled as he released the button, looking down at his tiny friend covering his ears in slight pain. \"So how do we get in genius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a key under my door mat.\" Josh winced as he lowered his hands from his ears as Tyler bent down slowly to grab the key. Putting it into the lock and turning the door open. Tyler looked into his friend's familiar home as he made his way into the entry way and closed the door behind him. Knowing his way into the dining room, Tyler set Josh down on the table and sat at the chair in front of him. Looking up at his gigantic friend's muscled frame, Josh blushed as Tyler still only wore his red lifeguard shorts, hat and sun glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna run to your place and grab some clothes or something?\" Josh asked, figuring he'd need them if he was going to be staying here for two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a bit yeah.\" Tyler smiled as he took off his sunglasses and set them beside Josh. \"I still can't believe you live here in this huge place by yourself, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned as he crossed his arms. \"I've offered like fifty times since I got the place for you to move in with me, you know that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna mooch off you, dude...\" Tyler sighed as he rested his elbows on the table, causing a small quake and making Josh tumble over. Tyler chuckled as he watched his tiny friend get back to his feet before he continued. \"Besides you're such a neat freak, I'd drive you crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you always say, and I always tell you it doesn't matter to me.\" Josh shook his head in frustration. Tyler smiled as reached out a finger and gently flicked Josh over on his back. Knowing his friend was just playing, Josh sighed as he laid on his back for a moment while Tyler chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I'd drive you crazy one way or another, dude.\" Tyler grinned as Josh sat up to look at his handsome friend. Josh shook his head in disagreement, knowing in his heart that after everything the two of them had been through he couldn't possibly ever be legitimately annoyed by the goofy behemoth. Josh looked up as Tyler stood up, rubbing his chest a little as he stretched out his back and arms. Puzzled for a moment, Josh looked at Tyler as he addressed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo dude...\" Tyler started to say...        </span></div></div>",

Josh thought for a second as he realized he left his own phone back at the park, a mistake he made all too often when in a rush to leave work. Either way, Josh's head perked up at the name. Bobby was his roommate his final semester in college. He, Tyler, and Josh all became an unlikely trio of friends after the events of that semester. Josh thought back to the first time he met the young football star before looking back to Tyler to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't heard from him in a little while actually, also I left my phone at the park. Why, what's up?\" Josh asked as Tyler swiped his phone open to look at the message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in town, dude. He said he wanted to visit us and see how things are going.\" Tyler said, raising an eyebrow as he looked at his miniaturized friend. \"What should I tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him my address.\" Josh replied confidently. Sure he figured it might be weird seeing his old friend shrunken like this after a few years, but Bobby had seen Josh shrunken before, so it shouldn't come off as too much of a shock. \"He's gonna think I make a hobby of this shrinking thing after these couple years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed, knowing it really wasn't too far from the truth, as he finished tapping out a response to Bobby. Putting away his phone Tyler looked down at Josh with a goofy, excited smile. Josh sighed, knowing exactly what the smile meant. \"You're excited to see him too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been what, two years, dude?\" Tyler responded as he shook his head. \"Too long, dude. I haven't heard from him in awhile either. I was worried something was up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head. He hadn't thought about that actually. Bobby was always a pretty driven guy. He was the star quarterback for the football team at Josh's old college. By now Josh figured, thanks to the new coaching staff at the school, Bobby must've finished school and gotten scouted for the NFL. Josh smiled to himself, hoping it was something positive like that, that caused a sudden lull in communication between the three of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little time passed, Josh and Tyler looked up as they heard a car pull in front of the house. Josh looked off into the distance, seemingly hundreds of miles away, as Tyler opened the door and saw Bobby getting out of a...      </span></div></div>",

That alone reminded Josh just how big his old roommate was. Smiling, Josh looked at Bobby in the distance as he slung a huge gym bag over his shoulder before closing the taxi door behind him. Wearing a white sleeveless spandex shirt and a pair of black athletic shorts, as well as his signature backwards baseball cap, Josh watched as his friend made his way up to his open front door, greeted by Tyler. Looking closer as Tyler and Bobby stopped to exchange a friendly hug, Josh's attention shifted to Bobby's foot. To Josh's surprise, he wore a split and boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby! Dude! It's so good to see you! Yo, did you get taller since we last saw you?\" Tyler asked as Josh looked at the two men side by side. Just imagined Bobby must've grown a bit, as he was only barely taller than Tyler before, but now clearly had some hieght over the already tall Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, dude! Unless you got shorter!\" Bobby joked as he looked into Josh's house, mouth a gap a little. \"Speaking of short, where's our little genius?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he knew Tyler was ready to jump on a line like that. Sure enough, he watched as Tyler turned around and smiled as he lead Bobby into the dining room. \"Little is an understatement right now, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, dude?\" Bobby said as he entered the dining room, setting his bag down and looking around. \"Where is he, this is his house right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply crossed his arms and stared directly at Josh on the table, before Bobby looked at the table himself, noticing a tiny waving speak. Bobby blinked for a second before he dropped down and put his hands on the table to look closer. \"Josh? Dude, I almost forgot about your whole shrink ray thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed and rubbed the back of his head. \"Yeah well it's not much of a portable ray anymore unfortunately. I'm kind of stuck like this for a few days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen? I mean not like it's the end of the world or anything. Just seems kind of random is all.\" Bobby replied, taking a seat and looking at his tiny friend with his dreamy almost white blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was Tyler's idea, since the park is being remodeled. We thought it'd be fun for a few days.\" Josh replied, turning a little red as Bobby smiled and shook his head at Josh's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are hilarious.\" Bobby simply said, looking at Josh and turning to look at Tyler, who also took a seat at the table. Tyler chuckled as Josh sat there and rolled his eyes. Sighing, Josh figured it was probably as best a time as possible to ask about Bobby's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was curious. You have a split on your foot. What happened?\" Josh asked as Bobby's face turned from amused to a little pissed off looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The end of my football career is what happened.\" Bobby replied, much to Tyler's and Josh's surprise. \"That's why I kind of lost touch with you guys for awhile. After I got hurt all of the scouts stopped looking at me. I got so upset I stopped going to class. So I dropped out a week ago. People are probably graduating soon actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler crossed his arms and looked down with a sour look and Josh stood up and started to walk toward his giant friend with concern. \"I'm so sorry Bobby. But we're here for you, you know that. You could've told us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dude. I just wasn't in a good place.\" Bobby replied looking at the tiny speck of a man make his way toward him. Bobby smiled as his tiny friend stopped only about a foot away from where his abdomen met the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your mom taking this alright?\" Josh asked, remembering that his mother lived alone, working as a waitress. Bobby crossed his arms and looked down at Josh, frowning slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know.\" Bobby said flatly as Josh bit his lip, feeling like he was doing a bad job of asking Bobby questions. \"It's why I came to you guys. Well you specifically, little buddy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head, remembering what Bobby said two years ago. \"If the NFL didn't work out, you wanted to work for me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby nodded his head and closed his eyes. Josh simply smiled as he looked way up at Bobby, his face seeming like it was miles away past his ripped torso. \"I told you I'd take you in a heartbeat, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled as he finally lowered his body, scrunching down so he could look at Josh closer, almost eye to eye. \"Thanks buddy. I think it's finally time I'd take you up on that, if you'll have me of course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll take you! I need more staff since we're expanding the park anyway. It works out perfect.\" Josh said happily as Bobby gave a weak smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it dude.\" Bobby said, as he sat back up with his back straight. \"Guess now all I need to do is a find a place to live.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a spare bedroom.\" Josh said casually as he glanced over at Tyler who's head perked up. \"I've been telling that knuckle head he should just move in ever since I bought the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled widely as his eyes looked like they'd almost glisten with tears. \"Dude... I'd hug you right now, but I don't want to crush you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed, knowing it was just a playful joke as he looked over at Tyler, who finally chimed in...              </span></div></div>",

Turning his attention back up at Bobby's massive form, Josh decided to change the subject. \"So how's your foot, Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled and smirked, looking down at his foot and wiggling his massive toes slightly. \"Fine now. It's not completely healed up yet, but I can take this stupid boot off by tomorrow according to the doctor. Too bad it's too late though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't meant to put a damper on our conversation.\" Josh said, feeling guilty about making Bobby upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright dude. Shit happens for a reason. I'm glad I'm here now with you guys!\" Bobby said happily as he looked at his two friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, and since we're all here together we should do something!\" Tyler said enthusiastically as he stood up suddenly. \"I mean Josh has this awesome house, there's so much room for shit to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah true, dude.\" Bobby replied, leaning and looking out a window looking out to the back yard. Noticing a pool and large patio with a grill and plenty of lounge chairs as well as the setting sun, Bobby looked back around in the spacious dining room, which lead to the kitchen as well as a sliding door to the patio. \"Have you guys had dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and I'm starved, dude!\" Tyler said loudly, looking at Josh. Bobby laughed. It was pretty typical, he knew Tyler was pretty much always hungry after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a sweet looking patio and pool, dude. Why don't we cook out and chill by the pool. It's a pretty hot night anyway.\" Bobby asked Josh, trying to offer a simple solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I've been in a pool all day!\" Tyler said patting his swim shorts before crossing his arms. \"We should just stay in an order a pizza or something. Josh has a huge ass TV too! We could chill and watch something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked down at Josh, seeing the little man cross his arms and lower his head in thought. \"It's your house dude. I'll do whatever you want us to do.\" Bobby said with a smile. Suddenly, a loud gurgle erupted from Bobby's stomach, still only about a foot away from Josh, causing the little man to jump with fear from the loud noise as Bobby laughed and put a hand on his stomach and rubbed it casually. \"Though I am pretty hungry. Maybe speed up the decision, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry too!\" Tyler piped in rubbing his bare abs with a frown. Josh simply looked over at his his huge friend and rolled his eyes.

I'm just kinda sick of being in my swim shorts by now.\" Tyler admitted as he rubbed the back of his head under his hat. \"I'll stay for food though, and maybe chill for a bit. Besides I'll be back tomorrow away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair, dude.\" Bobby replied, standing up and towering over Josh with ease. Josh stared up at Bobby as he stretched out his abdomen well beyond his vision at the point. Bobby was so tall normally that his legs were all Josh could really see in his field of vision. Suddenly, Bobby's huge hand started to lower in front of Josh. Looking up, Josh could see Bobby's face leaning forward in the distance with a trusting smile. Josh got onto Bobby's hand as quickly as he could, he started to recall Bobby holding him once before two years ago. Now in his roommate's hand once again, Josh stumbled slightly as Bobby rose Josh to about waist hieght. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is giving me deja vu.\" Josh said as he looked up at Bobby's clearly defined body through his tight white shirt. Tyler shook his head and laughed as he came and stood next to Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about all that dude, it's just making me think of when Bobby held you two years ago!\" Tyler replied with a dumb smile, as Josh shook his head, full well knowing Tyler didn't know what deja vu was. Bobby simply laughed at the two, seeing Tyler's look of confusion as well as Josh shaking his head. He couldn't help but smile, glad to be with his two friends again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to leave the dining room, the three men made their way toward sliding door leading to the backyard. Now out on the patio, Josh shielded his eyes as he looked out at the setting sun. It was getting pretty late after all. Josh winced as he found himself being carried over to the patio table right by the pool. Bobby let Josh down on the table's surface. Josh turned around and watched as Bobby turned, showing off his enormous bubble butt as he walked slowly over to the grill, opening it and examining it. Josh couldn't help but stare at the giant's ass for a second before turning to see Tyler come out onto patio as well, holding a plate full of hot dogs and burgers among other toppings and condiments, as well as a bag of buns.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this dude, you just chill!\" Tyler said to Bobby as he left the top of the grill open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure dude?\" Bobby asked as he backed away from the grill and stood next to Tyler as he turning on the gas and clicked the igniter. Bobby shrugged as Tyler shoo'd him away from the grill, making his way over to the table where he left Josh, grabbing the buns and condiments in the process and setting them with a slight quake on the table. Josh looked up at the mound of food in shock, unable to believe how Tyler knew exactly where to find all of his food in his kitchen. Scratching his head, he did figure Tyler knew his way around his house well after all, especially the kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Bobby stretched his arms and looked around. \"Gonna go fro a swim, Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I can't with this dumb boot on.\" Bobby replied tapping his foot. \"Maybe tomorrow, but for now I think I'm just gonna lay down. It was kind of a long way getting here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head, figuring that might be the case. Josh watched as Bobby drug one of the lounge chairs a little closer to the group and sat down on the cushion before taking off his hat and pulling off his tight shirt. As Bobby put his hat back on, Josh couldn't help but stare at Bobby's amazing body. He was a muscular guy for sure two year ago, but it was nothing like he was now. His huge chest bounced dramatically as he adjusted his hat and lowered his arms. His abs seemed almost unreal in the way they were build and cut deep. Josh couldn't help but stare at his friend, having it been a long while since he say Bobby without a shirt. Much like a few years ago, Bobby still had light patches of fuzzy blonde hair on his chest and little on his abs around his belly button. Josh almost jumped as Bobby got back up and walked over to the table to sling his shirt over a chair, looking down at Josh who tried to avert his attention for his attractive friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look bored up here by yourself, wanna come chill with me?\" Bobby offered as Josh looked back up at the muscled giant, still blushing like crazy. Thankful for his tiny size to hide his red face, Josh tried to muster a response to the colossal hunk...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"S-sure, Bobby!\" Josh squeaked, still blushing at the very idea of laying down with Bobby. Ignoring Josh's awkwardness, Bobby simply lowered his hand and smiled once more as he watched Josh climb aboard before making his way over to the lounge chair and lowering his body down on the cushion. Josh lost his foot as Bobby gently let him slide off his hand and on to the the soft blonde hairs of his massive right pec. Bobby lowered his arms to his side as he looked at Josh try to get comfortable on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if it's kinda awkward for you dude.\" Bobby apologized, not really thinking about how how weird it must be for Josh to be on his chest until now. Josh waved his arms, knowing he's been through way worse with Tyler before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Tyler does this exact thing to me all the time.\" Josh said, trying to make Bobby feel a little more comfortable.. Bobby chuckled slightly, causing Josh to topple off his feet in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like something he'd do.\" Bobby laughed as Tyler turned his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's something I'd do?\" Tyler asked, looking at Bobby as he flipped a burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled again, figuring that Bobby couldn't hear Josh's voice all the way over by the grill. \"He was just saying putting him on my chest like this is something you'd do all the time, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he rolled a hot dog on it's side. \"Yeah, I do that kind of shit to him like every day, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled as he moved his arms behind his head, causing his pec to flex a little and pushing Josh slightly to the side. \"That's good then, so you're probably used to this kind of thing. It's all new to me though dude. So it's kind of neat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still always pretty neat for me too.\" Josh smiled as he finally sat down, looking past the rest of Bobby's chest up to his handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed having you as roommate, by the way.\" Bobby said suddenly, as Josh tilted his head in surprise. \"I never had a roommate last with me for more than a couple months after you left, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Josh asked, curiously. \"You're like, one of the easiest guys to get along with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff...\" Bobby scoffed. \"Tell that to the like six dudes I went through.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what happened?\" Josh asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the first guy was terrified of me. He was a nerdy dude like you actually. I tried to be friendly, but he was convinced I was going to hurt him like all the time.\" Bobby said, looking away as he started to go deep in thought. \"I went through a few guys like him before I left our dorm to go to a more athletics focused dorm. I roomed with a buddy of mine from the football team. But, I came back one night to find him in bed with my ex-girl. So yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh,\" Josh sighed. \"Guess you don't really know someone till you live with them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Bobby responded, feeling a little bad. \"But with you, I never had a problem. I really missed having you around, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled widely before he heard Tyler make a loud gagging noise over by the grill. \"Man, you two!\" Tyler groaned loudly. \"I can barely think over the sound of you dudes making out over there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous much?\" Bobby smirked as he turned his head over at Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like, I'm gonna puke dude!\" Tyler joked as he made a gagging noise again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you do it on your own food, not mine!\" Bobby chuckled as he looked back at Josh with a smile. He watched carefully as Josh moved slightly on his chest, before he smirked and laughed a little. \"It's crazy dude, I can't even feel you on my chest at all right now, even with you moving a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's your chest hair?\" Josh offered as an explanation, pushing aside some of the huge blonde fuzz from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, dude.\" Bobby responded as he watched Josh. \"So does Ty shrink you this often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned his head and rose his spatula into the air. \"He volunteers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight...\" Bobby smiled at Tyler. \"I know you, dude. You probably pressure him into it, then he does it because he doesn't want to say no and disappoint you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned back to the grill, flipping a burger and pretending to ignore what Bobby said, even though he hit the nail on the head. Josh couldn't help but laugh, glad to see Bobby had Tyler read better than anyone else he knew. Bobby looked back and Josh and smirked at the little man as well, however. \"Still you said being tiny is pretty neat. Do you like being so tiny, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed instantly, not realizing just how well Bobby knew Tyler, but himself as well. Looking up at Bobby's piercing eyes, Josh responded by saying...        </span></div></div>",

Bobby chuckled and smiled at the answer as Tyler looked over in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd he say?\" Tyler asked, still too far away to hear Josh's tiny voice. Bobby smirked as he looked over at Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he likes being tiny, dude.\" Bobby replied, much to Josh's continued embarrassment. Tyler started to laugh as he piled the finished burgers and hot dogs onto the place and started to bring it over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I knew it!\" Tyler continued to laugh as he set the plate down. Josh lowered his head in shame, as Bobby looked at Josh and felt a little bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't making fun of you, dude.\" Bobby assured Josh. \"I think it's cool that you're so small, so if you like it then it works out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I mean, I always have fun having you be tiny too, dude.\" Tyler joined in, feeling bad that Josh practically died of embarrassment. \"Besides it's like your life's work, you should enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picked up his head, feeling a little better after his friend's reassured his shrinking habit. \"Thanks guys, Guess it was just a little weird to admit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby reached for Josh, scooping him off his chest and onto his hand as he sat up, ready to grab some food for himself as he saw Tyler already grabbing some buns and burgers himself. Josh looked up at Bobby's huge chest, still amazed that's where he was just resting moments ago as Bobby looked down at him with a grin. \"Now that we know you like being shrunk so much though, means we're gonna start messing with you more, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he took a bite of his burger. \"Dude, I already do that constantly already anyway. Welcome to the club!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed as he grabbed a paper plate. Pulling a chunk off a burger and hot dog as well as tossing in a few toppings and condiments, Bobby slid Josh off his hand onto the plate. Sitting down at the patio table, Bobby took the plate and put it on the ground between his feet. \"There, now he can eat and have a fun view!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed a huge chunk of food as he shook his head a little. \"I dunno dude. Maybe you're just too new to messing with him. I would've probably stepped in his food and made him eat it from between my toes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross dude!\" Bobby said, taking a bite of his food finally. \"That seems more mean than just toying with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler finished his burger and already started taking a bite out of another as he shrugged casually. \"You'll get there one day too, dude. Once you get used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby frowned, still feeling like it would have been a little mean. Regardless, he turned his attention back to his food, barely remembering that he even placed Josh down between his feet in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat on the paper plate, feeling confused. Obviously he listened to Bobby's explanation for dropping him down here, but it still felt fairly sudden. Josh sighed, as he looked from side to side. On either edge of the plate sat Bobby's enormous feet, One sitting in a black shoe, coupled with a black sock, the other mostly exposed in the medical boot, only wearing a black sock. Bobby's massive feet truly were a spectacle to behold, however Josh really wasn't sure what he should do. \"Does he expect me to explore... or did he think I'd just sit here and eat while looking at his feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked from the meager pile of food on the plate, to Bobby's massive socked foot. Josh shrugged, deciding that he should...      </span></div></div>",

Smiling, he decided not to push it, since Josh was clearly embarrassed about it. \"That's fair dude. Must be a little intimidating being so small. But still, if you did enjoy it I wouldn't judge you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Josh sighed, knowing Bobby was on to him. Deciding not to worry about it, however, Josh watched as Tyler carried a plate of cooked food over to the table, setting down and reaching for a bun and making a burger for himself right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd he say, dude?\" Tyler asked, curious how Josh responded to the question while he was busy putting all the food on the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just said it's intimidating.\" Bobby lied, figuring it was better than calling Josh out. \"I have to imagine it must be freaky being that small, so I can't blame him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby reached for Josh on his chest, carefully scooping him into his hand and bringing him over to the table. Grabbing a plate with his free hand, Bobby set it near him and let Josh slide off his hand into the center. Josh stared up at the muscled titan as he tore off a few pieces of food and set it on the plate next to Josh. \"There, dude.\" Bobby said as he added a few tiny condiments. \"Giving you a whole burger might be a little overwhelming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head, unsure if Bobby was messing with him, or if he genuinely believed that he was afraid of giant things. Meanwhile, Tyler chuckled from the other side of the table. \"Please, dude. I've stuck him on whole burgers, pieces of pizza, steaks, cakes. All kinds of foods, dude. He's used to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby took a big bite out of his burger, swallowing it down while barely chewing it out of hunger. \"Seems like it would be overwhelming. I mean he's so small. Food must look gigantic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess it does. Those burgers look like huge buildings laying on their sides!\" Josh said, pointing out the burgers still laying on the plate. Bobby took another bite of his burger, actually chewing it a little before swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and here we are, looking like a couple of giants eating buildings in front of you, dude.\" Bobby said looking at his burger for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's like Tyler said, I'm used to it by now.\" Josh shrugged, feeling like Bobby was over thinking it as he grabbed a bit of meat for himself. \"Besides from your prospective it must feel kinda cool being like a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, dude!\" Tyler piped up, munching on a second burger with gusto. \"I'll eat all the buildings right in front of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he looked over at Tyler, tearing though the burgers. Josh shrugged his shoulders. Feeling like thanks to Tyler he really was used to interacting with giants. Bobby chuckled a little as he shoved the rest of his burger in his mouth, chewing it and swallowing it down with a sigh. Reaching for another burger, Bobby stopped for a second, trying to imagine a huge building turned on it side as he placed it between the buns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it is pretty neat being a giant, dude. If these were buildings, they'd be pretty easy to eat.\" Bobby said, taking a bite of his second burger. \"But I guess tiny people inside would be even easier to accidentally eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he took a bite out of his burger and swallowed it down whole. \"Accidentally? That's where all the protein would come from, bruh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! True, dude!\" Bobby laughed as he held his burger in hand and waved it toward Josh. \"Hop on, buddy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh broke a little bit of a sweat, happy to see Bobby was feeling more comfortable, but also a little freaked out by the joke. Josh smiled nervously as he tried to play along. \"You wouldn't even notice me on there if I did!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby took another bite as he looked down at the burger with a chuckle. Chewing a little extra Bobby swallowed and looked down at Josh. \"You'd be lucky if I chewed you up, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he pulled a sesame seed off his bun and looked at it on his finger. Noticing how small the seed was, Tyler guessed it was barely any smaller than Josh. \"You'd save him a terrifying trip that's for sure, dude. But let's be real.\" Tyler said as he set the seed on his tongue and swallowed it down with an exaggerated gulp. \"He's so puny, he'd go down whole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shifted awkwardly, wanting to chime in on the conversation and steer it in a different direction as the two men laughed casually. Before he could get a word in Bobby was already returning Tyler with a comment of his own. \"So true, dude. Bet you wouldn't even feel him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed again as Josh finally got a word in. \"Can we talk about something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby and Tyler looked at Josh and blinked a little before chuckling at each other. \"We're just joking, dude.\" Bobby replied. \"It's not like either of us are gonna eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude. Not unless you really piss us off!\" Tyler said with a goofy smile, much to Josh's continued discomfort. Tyler offered Bobby a high five, to which Bobby followed up with an enormous clap. Josh shook his head as the two giants laughed as they finished their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by Bobby and Tyler continued to eat their meals, teasing Josh every now and then. As the two colossal hunks started to get full, the sun was starting to fully set at that point. Cleaning up the table and deciding to move inside, Josh found himself in his kitchen, watching the two muscled men clean up and put things away. Josh watched as Tyler brushed off his hands and started to walk toward Josh's position. Seemingly, Tyler was...          </span></div></div>",

Josh looked up at Tyler's massive muscled body from his abs all the way past his huge chest to his face. Josh bit his lip as Tyler didn't even look at him as he placed a hand on his stomach and paused for a second before releasing a tremendously loud burp. Josh covered his nose as Tyler blew it down at Josh, causing the little man to wince at the foul smell as well as get knocked slightly off his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Ty!\" Josh complained, waving his hands and trying to dissipate the smell with little to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making room for you, dude!\" Tyler taunted, patting his stomach for added effect. \"Especially if you talk to me like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, dude.\" Bobby smiled as he walked over to Tyler's side. \"You're gonna freak him out again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not freaked out!\" Josh retaliated angrily. \"Besides weren't you leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! So unfriendly!\" Tyler said arrogantly. \"Makes me hungry. Besides, I think now I'll spend the night thanks to that little comment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes, figuring it was probably his plan to stay all along anyway. Bobby on the other hand grabbed Tyler from the side in excitement and pulled him in for a tight side hug. \"Really, bro? That's awesome! What about your clothes though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged as he looked down at his swim trunks. \"I'd steal something from Josh, but even his normal sized clothes could never fit me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some spare clothes in my bag.\" Bobby said, letting go of Tyler and going out into the dining room where he left the bag and unzipping it. \"Might be a little big for you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, dude. I'll just take shorts if you have an extra pair!\" Tyler said, pulling down his swim shorts and showing the pair of black spandex he was wearing. Bobby tossed Tyler a pair of blue shorts, and Josh watched as Tyler pulled them up over his ass. They were slightly too large as Josh watched them start to sag, barely concealing half of Tyler's impressive set of glutes in the process. Josh quickly looked away, worried Tyler would catch him staring at his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need a shirt, dude?\" Bobby asked as he pulled his tight white tank top from before over his body, struggling slightly to pull the shirt past his mountainous pecs. Tyler patted the shorts he was wearing as he tossed his swim shorts across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude. I'm good. This is way more comfy.\" Tyler replied happily. Bobby simply shrugged as he readjusted his hat, having now put back on his shirt. Tyler yawned as he walked around Josh's kitchen, pulling up a few drawers and looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Josh asked, feeling slightly annoyed by Tyler rummaging through all his stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snacks!\" Tyler simply said as he peered over at Josh with a smirk. \"Not unless you're offering yourself up, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes, feeling like the joke has gotten a little stale. Regardless, he couldn't believe Tyler was already hungry again. \"You just ate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Tyler replied, locating a bag of gummy bears. \"You made me hungry again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he watched Tyler grab a bowl from the cabinet and bring it over to the kitchen table and set it next to him. Josh jumped slightly as Tyler tore open the bag and dumped the gummy bears into it like a massive flood. Josh looked at the edge of the bowl, unable to really see inside at all. Meanwhile, Tyler grabbed a gummy bear out of the bowl and set it next to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby check it out.\" Tyler said, as Bobby came over to look. \"Even the gummy bear is a giant compared to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the yellow bear beside him, impressed at the size. While Tyler wasn't necessarily correct, the sugary creature did tower over Josh considerably. He had to guess it was easily over three times his size. Josh reached forward to touch the gummy bear before it was quickly snatched up by Tyler who turned it over in his hand before popping it in his mouth. Sucking on it for a second, Josh watched as Tyler deliberately looked at him before swallowing the little candy down whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too easy, and it's huge compared to you!\" Tyler chuckled as Josh shook his head and crossed his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That joke isn't even funny anymore.\" Josh said with confidence as both Tyler and Bobby looked at each other, noticing how much less shaken Josh was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone is confident!\" Bobby said with a sly tone as he reached into the bowl and grabbed a red gummy bear. Josh tilted his head slightly in confusion, before Bobby slowly lowered the bear on top of him. Josh squirmed and screamed as he was pressed into the ground and also the soft squeamishness of the bear. Josh saw the ground leaving as he was lifted off and away. Trying to move his body, he realized he couldn't. He was stuck to the bottom of the gummy bear. Looking down again, Josh saw the bowl of bears below him as he was suddenly dropped in with the rest of the candy, trapped to the bottom of the red bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What color was he stuck to again, bro?\" Bobby asked, obviously acting dumb as he just dropped the red bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno man. I wasn't paying attention.\" Tyler also lied as he saw the whole thing happen. \"Guess we'll just have to eat em all till we find him, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled, knowing he was being messed with. Thinking about how much of asses the two of them were being, Josh tried his best to break free of the sticky bear. Josh winced slightly as a few bears were plucked out of the bowl around him. Barely noticing any delay in the time it took them to grab the bear, till the moment he heard a swallow, Josh figured the two weren't exactly looking very hard before they ate the candies. Pulling with all his might, Josh found himself...      </span></div></div>",

Mashing the bear in half with a single chew, Tyler swallowed as he reached down for another bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Josh screamed as he was forced down the throat.

Josh could do little more that scream to no avail as he was sucked down deeper and deeper within Tyler before a horrendous squelching noise keyed his entrance to his friend's stomach. Being deposited in the organ with a wet splat, Josh took in a breath of the foul air as it smelled like a mixture of candy and half digested meat. Josh looked around, finding what looked like a large chunk of burger Tyler must've swallowed in his impatience to chew earlier. Taking refuge on it, Josh squinted as he tried to make out anything else in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I have anything to thank, it's that Tyler doesn't chew his food very well...\" Josh tried to look at the bright side, both with the burger he was on as well as the lazy attempt at chewing Tyler did with the gummy bear. \"I'd probably be dead if he did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held his knees to his chest as he heard another splatting noise, seemingly more gummy bears had just joined Josh in Tyler's stomach. Josh shook his head, feeling stupid about the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's still chowing down than that means he's got no idea he ate me.\" Josh tried to conclude. Josh sighed, feeling hopeless. \"What can I even do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off his depression, Josh tried to hold a little hope in his friends. \"Once they eat the whole bowl, they'll have to realize one of them accidentally ate me! And the two of them eat so fast it's probably only a matter of minutes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh lifted his head, confident now that his friends will find him. That being that though, Josh then heard a wet and elongated belch roar from above as some of the air was forced out of Tyler's stomach. Woozy, Josh shook his head and took a deep breath, trying to ignore the foul quality of the air down here as he was just thankful there was any left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up guys...\" Josh plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Niiiice rip dude.\" Bobby complimented Tyler as the man stood there smirking and pompously rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro.\" Tyler gave Bobby a fist bump. \"Josh better watch out or he could end up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rubbed his stomach again as he grabbed another gummy bear and tossed it in his mouth.  \"He's such a little shrimp he wouldn't last long.\" Tyler laughed as he swallowed down a few more bears. \"He's lucky I'm looking for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, bro.\" Bobby chuckled as he grabbed a handful of non-red bears and shoveled them into his mouth. \"He'd be fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men laughed and joked at Josh's expense a few minutes longer until there was but one gummy bear left in the bowl. A single red bear, face down at the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be the one, Ty.\" Bobby smirked as he pointed down at the bear. Tyler laughed as he looked down at the pathetic bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just eat it for good measure.\" Tyler chuckled as he looked down at the bear as if it was miles and miles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed, knowing Tyler was only joking but he could be convincing at times. \"Maybe we just leave it? Let him chill for a bit before we rescue him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looking down at the bear...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

He's probably all pissy.\" Tyler laughed as he started to walk away. \"Let's let him chill out and remember who the bosses are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed, enjoying the irony that Josh was technically their boss. Shrugging, Bobby figured he wasn't at work yet so he could be the boss of Josh if he wanted for the time being. \"Damn right, dude. Size matters!\" Bobby stood over the last gummy bear and flexed both his biceps and did a pretend spitting noise down at the bear. Walking away arrogantly, Bobby looked to Tyler and shook his head. \"Bugs, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, bro.\" Tyler shook his head, now looking at the bowl from a distance. \"They have to learn to respect what's bigger than them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men laughed, knowing that Josh in the bowl right now must be fuming like crazy at their brash behavior, but there wasn't a damn thing he could do to stop them. As the two made their way into the living room, feeling proud about themselves, little did they know how much danger Josh was really in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" Josh called out meekly into the vast acidic chamber. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had finished eating. In fact, based off his movement, Josh would guess he waked somewhere and sat down. \"Ty, this isn't funny! Please let me out!\" Josh yelled as he looked down to see his legs were turning sort of red and felt very tender to the touch.  \"I-I'm being digested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to panic now. Realizing Tyler's body had been breaking him down this whole time he was trying to remain calm. Unable to be calm anymore, Josh finally noticed how much pain he was in when he started to move. Caught off guard, he free fell off the burger he thought was protecting him, down into the foamy liquidy goop in the bottom of Tyler's stomach. Josh would have screamed if he could, but the pain was too much. Tyler's stomach had fully relaxed at this point, happy churning and digesting it's meal.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rubbed his stomach and burped again as the noise woke Bobby up from a seated nap. Tyler rose an eyebrow at looked at Bobby. \"You tired, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhh...\" Bobby yawned almost nodding back off again. \"It was a long ride. I'm beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making me tired, dude.\" Tyler yawned just now as well. \"Why don't you break in your new bed? I'll sleep in Josh's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, not like he's using it, right?\" Bobby tiredly chuckled. \"He's got a comfy gummy bear to sleep on anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True true, dude.\" Tyler chuckled as he stood up and glanced over at the bowl. \"I bet he's gonna smell just like a red gummy bear tomorrow, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, then he's really gonna have to watch out.\" Bobby laughed as he stood up and started to walk toward the stairs up to the bedrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm yeah. I'll want him in my belly for sure!\" Tyler licked his lips and rubbed his stomach as the two men laughed a little more making their way upstairs. Bidding each other goodnight, Tyler yawned as he simply flopped into Josh's bed. Feeling his stomach gurgle a little, Tyler gave another rub as he turned over to lay on his back. Forgetting about Josh being stuck in the bowl downstairs, Tyler drifted off to sleep. Unaware for the moment that he and Bobby would have no luck finding Josh in the morning.     </span></div></div>",

Looking over to Bobby, he simply shrugged and put out his hand, indicating to him to take the last bear for himself. Bobby smiled as he reached down into the bowl, pushing aside the red bears and grabbing the green one while looking at Tyler. Casually, the enormous man didn't even look twice at the food at he popped the little bear in his mouth and quickly swallowed it whole. Completely unaware of the horror he just committed on his tiny friend, Bobby was none the wiser as he put his hands behind his hands behind his head with a smirk as he looked down at the nearly empty bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm kinda full.\" Bobby said directly down at the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too, dude.\" Tyler replied as he rubbed his stomach pompously. \"Guess we'll have to find Josh later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair laughed as they walked away from the bowl, believing to abandon Josh to the confines of the sweet prison as they made their way over to the living room.

Bobby's stomach started to moan with pleasure as it realized Bobby was finally done eating and it could begin doing it's job of digesting everything inside of it. Josh frowned, feeling hopeless as the churning started getting faster and he knew his time was running out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, everything started to shift. Feeling like he was being flung forward, Josh screamed as all the partially digested mush in Bobby's gut started to shift dramatically, sending Josh sliding into a dangerous wall of the viscous organ. Josh braced himself as he hit the wall, worried that he was going to be showered immediately in fresh gastric juices. Accepting his fate, Josh closed his eyes and reached out his hands... to find the slip through some sort of hole. Josh opened his eyes and blinked. Looking through the dark Josh could barely see the hole open and close, contracting slightly to his touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the sphincter that leads into the stomach?!\" Josh nearly yelled as he started to push himself though it. Sliding his way through Josh quickly realized he was in fact back in the very bottom of Bobby's esophagus. \"Oh thank god it wasn't to the small intestine...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverjoyed in his luck, Josh took a new lease on his life and hoped against all odds he could somehow traverse the long tube while it was seemingly laying flat. Josh pushed forward, fighting against Bobby's natural peristalsis trying to force him back down into the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find the remote yet, dude?\" Bobby asked as he laid flat on his stomach, feeling bored and practically falling asleep as Tyler tore around the room. Laying his face facing off the sofa, Bobby blinked as he watched Tyler open random drawers as he looked around. \"Just turn it on manually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude!\" Tyler retorted as he closed the drawers. \"Then how am I supposed flip around the channels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby rolled his eyes with a smile. Tyler was as stubborn as ever, but he knew these were the types of things he missed about his friend. Closing his eyes, Bobby laid still for a moment before he felt and odd tickle in his throat. Keeping motionless, Bobby tried to feel what it was. He opened his eyes and frowned, feeling like something was almost crawling around in his throat. Just then, Bobby...                     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Leery about what the noise was, Josh only hoped it wasn't Bobby's stomach noticing a small part of it's meal was trying to escape. Knowing that an organ really didn't have a mind of it's own, Josh shook his head and tried to focus on pressing forward. With leaving Bobby's dangerous body being his number one concern, Josh continued his journey as he crawled forward desperately fighting against Bobby's esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby moved his hand under his stomach, grabbing it slightly as he felt a little pressure start to well up. Forgetting briefly about the funny feeling in throat, Bobby's attention was instead shifted toward his stomach. Facing forward and lifting his head slightly, Bobby pointed his face down at the cushion as he finally released a massive burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuuuurp!\" Bobby belted down onto the cushion with great force. Sitting up, Bobby rubbed his gut a little as well as his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, dude?\" Tyler asked as he watched Bobby rub his throat. \"That was a nice rip at least, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dude.\" Bobby smirked. \"I dunno just felt funny, like something was stuck in my throat. I feel a lot better now though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head in confusion. One second he was stuck in the pitch black darkness of Bobby's throat, but now suddenly he found himself dripping wet on the soft surface of his couch. Josh took a second to get his bearings straight but it didn't take him long to look to his side and notice the towering colossus that was Bobby sitting next to him. Josh stared at his friend's face as it seemed like it was hundreds of miles away, but after squinting and looking hard, Josh determined Bobby wasn't making any effort to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God he has no idea I'm right down here next to him!\" Josh said to himself knowing that Bobby would never hear him from this distance. Josh watched as the huge man yawned tremendously as he looked across the room at Tyler. He saw his other shirtless friend as he appeared to be incredibly far away, at least for the tiny man. He was hunched over a basket, seemingly looking for something as Bobby sat by watching and growing bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's fine we don't have to watch TV.\" Bobby's voice boomed out from far above. Josh looked across to Tyler to see him stand back up straight and turn his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's got such a sweet TV, dude!\" Tyler responded as he started looking under a different chair for the remote. Bobby smiled and rolled his eyes again. Feeling a little bored, Bobby was debating lying his head back down after his long day. He was pretty beat after all, so he started to turn his body and face Josh. After a few seconds...        </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yawning a second time, Bobby felt pretty tired. With a turn of his head he faced back down at the couch where he was laying just a few minutes ago. Lowering his head to lay it down, Bobby froze as he saw movement and what appeared to be some sort of tiny speak trying to get his attention. With a squint, Bobby looked closer before realizing just what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh?\" Bobby asked as he looked down at the tiny man. He reached his hand down and scooped him up before looking closer. \"It is you, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler came over to the couch, looking confused. \"You seeing things over here, dude?\" Tyler asked, scratching his head. \"You know he's still in the bowl over there right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby lifted his hand to Tyler to give him a better view and Tyler looked down at his tiny friend with a raised eyebrow. \"The hell? How'd you get all the way over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you guys found me!\" Josh started saying. \"I didn't think either of you would ever spot me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really walk make it all the way in here from the kitchen?\" Bobby asked with a disbelieving look. \"Seems like a bad idea for you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!\" Josh replied, waving his arms. \"I wouldn't do something like. It's not like I came over here on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get over here then?\" Tyler asked, keeping his eyebrow raised suspiciously as took a seat next to Bobby on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... after you guys stuck me to that gummy bear I sort of fell off it and on to a different one.\" Josh started his story as Bobby looked over at Tyler. \"I know you guys were avoiding eating the red ones but I kinda ended up on one that was a different color...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah dude.\" Bobby said shocked. \"Did one of us almost actually eat you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not almost.\" Josh said looking up at Bobby. \"You actually did Bobby. I don't know what happened completely but I was able to crawl back up your throat most of the way then I think you burped me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked even more surprised while Tyler shook his head and crossed his arms laughing a little. Josh looked at Tyler with a slightly annoyed face as the huge man spoke up. \"I see what you did here, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Josh asked, confused at what Tyler meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been teasing you all night about eating you, so you went ahead and got yourself \"accidentally\" eaten to try and make us feel bad.\" Tyler said with a cocky smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh dropped his head in disbelief. \"I was terrified the whole time! I thought I was going to die! You think I did that on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please dude, you crawled up his throat? Obviously you had all that planned out.\" Tyler said waving his hand. Josh put a hand to his forehead in frustration. He knew that arguing with Tyler would be pointless once he's made up his mind like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess you caught me.\" Josh lied, just wanting to end to argument. Bobby looked a little relieved as Tyler shook his head knowing that he won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a lot better then, dude.\" Bobby smiled down at Josh. \"Next time you try and do something like that though maybe pick something a little less dangerous though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude. If you wanted one of us to eat you it would be a lot easier to get you back out if we knew you were there!\" Tyler laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to be eaten! That's just dumb.\" Josh said angrily, unable to keep up the lie for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is, dude.\" Tyler responded matter of factually. \"But you're a smart guy with a sense of adventure. You knew you could crawl out like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, letting his slight ego get the better of him. \"I guess I was pretty smart to think of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure, dude.\" Bobby smiled enthusiastically. \"Good thing I laid down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Josh shit back immediately, thinking quickly on his feet. \"I figured you would since you had such a long tiring day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! That's good thinking, bud.\" Bobby said, rubbing his eyes with his free hand as he yawned a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, told you he was smart. What would you have done if he didn't lay down though, dude?\" Tyler asked looking at Josh with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess climbing out would be impossible. I dunno, I would have tried to make him puke?\" Josh responded not feeling as confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? You're so small.\" Bobby asked looking at Josh in comparison to his own massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh I guess I'd try and irritate the walls of your stomach till you threw up?\" Josh said not so confidently. Meanwhile, Josh looked at Tyler who simply looked excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you could make me puke?\" Tyler asked while staring at Josh intently. Josh bit his lip, really not liking where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've had enough adventure for today, Ty.\" Josh said quickly, hoping to draw Tyler off any unwanted ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you don't think you could do it?\" Tyler answered with a cocky smirk, obviously trying to bait Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably could! I just don't want to right now.\" Josh said putting his foot down. Tyler merely shook his head and made a \"tsk\" nose with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't do it.\" Tyler smiled arrogantly as he looked at Bobby who shook his head in agreement. Josh started to feel a little pissed that Tyler was egging him on like this this. Looking right at Tyler Josh answered back...          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Tyler made his way over next to Bobby and sat on the couch and looked down at Josh in Bobby's hand with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude. You're way too small. I wouldn't even feel you let alone get sick from you.\" Tyler chuckled with amusement as Bobby looked down at Josh, nodding in agreement. Josh shook his head in frustration. At this point he was throwing logic out the window, but he really was getting fed up with the two of them belittling him for the past couple hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I can do it!\" Josh spat back at Tyler's handsome, arrogant face. \"Let's do this.\" Josh finished as he started making his way to the edge of Bobby's palm, tripping slightly as he stomped in anger. Tyler rose an eyebrow and laughed as he plucked Josh off Bobby's hand and held him now casually in his own. Tyler stood up, watching as Josh lost his balance slightly as he stretched to his full massive hieght. Holding Josh all the way down by his waist, Tyler looked down at Josh as he gave him a truly intimidating view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, would you look at the tough guy here?\" Tyler laughed as he pointed down to his palm and turned to Bobby. Bobby stretched out on the couch and chuckled, putting his hands behind his head as he enjoyed the show he knew his two friends were bound to put on. Josh merely ground his foot into Tyler's palm as he clenched his own fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? I'm ready!\" Josh yelled, feeling foolish, yet not wanting to back down from Tyler. Shifting his attention from Bobby back all the way down at his palm, Tyler lifted his hand up toward his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say? You're too small to hear sometime, dude.\" Tyler smirked as he brought Josh right up in his face. Josh sighed as he had to quickly adjust to the new elevation before he regained his composure and stared Tyler in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this. I'm waiting.\" Josh said, trying to calm down a little. Tyler smiled and rose his eyebrow again as he looked at his minuscule friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, dude. If you're that eager. But why don't we make a little wager while were at it?\" Tyler winked at Josh, who crossed his arms. \"If you can get me to throw you up, what do you wanna win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I win I want you assholes to stop treating me like a toy tonight! It's getting on my nerves.\" Josh replied defiantly. Tyler nodded his head quickly before he opened his mouth wide. Josh nearly screamed as he was quickly finding himself sliding off Tyler's hand before falling straight onto the monstrous tongue below. Josh landed and started slipping out of control toward Tyler's massive uvula as it hung gracefully over his gaping throat. \"Wait wait! What if you win!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler closed his mouth as he chuckled deeply, barely feeling Josh's tiny body squirm around on his tongue. \"Oh that easy dude. If you can't get me to puke...\" Tyler started to say before tilting his head back and sending his friend all the way to the back of his throat before making a loud, exaggerated swallow. \"You're stuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby's head perked up slightly as he heard Tyler finish his statement. He watched as he had a pair of fingers on his chest, casually rubbing them about as he tried to feel for Josh going down his throat. \"Bro, you're not serious, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply shook his head \"no\" and put a finger on his lips to shush Bobby. \"Oh no, dead serious. He was so confident that he could do it, so I don't see the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled as he barely caught the tail end of Tyler's words. \"You're stuck.\" Definitely stuck out as Josh found himself being pulled down Tyler's powerful throat, the rest of his giant friend's words just sounded like a gargled mess as he was sent screaming downward. As Tyler's body continued to slide Josh down, he began regretting challenging Tyler like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I'm so stupid!\" Josh yelled out loud. \"Why did I do this to myself? I just dodged a bullet with Bobby too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh squirmed in disgust as Tyler's body made all kinds of gurgling and squelching noises, just before he came to a stop at what he assumed to be the sphincter leading to his friend's gigantic stomach. Josh found himself being pushed through the sphincter as Tyler's body eagerly added what it assumed to be more food to Tyler's hungry stomach. Josh free fell for a few second before he came to to a splat in a horrid mix of sugar, meat and soda. Choking on the foul air, Josh flailed his arms about, trying to get the disgusting mix of half digested food off of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even see his hand in front of his face, Josh struggled fruitlessly to find anything solid in the massive dark prison, let alone a wall to irritate. Sloshing his way through waist deep sludge, Josh struggled just to find anything to take refuge on away from the potentially dangerous liquid. Already feeling dizzy from the foul air and burning sensation on his legs, Josh was relieved to pull himself on a half chewed hunk of meat before he shook his legs off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was I thinking...\" Josh said aloud as his eyes started to adjust. He watched the walls of Tyler's stomach churn and contract as it mixed the contents in a leisurely fashion. Even if he wanted to make his way to one of the walls, Josh guessed he had to be in the very center of the organ. The walls seemed like they were miles away for the poor tiny speck of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood still, hand on his stomach. He smiled, expecting to feel nothing. He looked at Bobby as he took his hand off his rippling abs and shrugged. \"Geez dude, this is crazy! I don't feel anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nuts dude. He was so confident!\" Bobby replied with a grin, chuckling slightly at Tyler's sarcastic tone. \"So what are you gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put his hands on his hips in thought. Throwing Josh up was an option, but he also felt like he had a bet to win. \"I dunno dude, I guess I'll...\"              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

So he loses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled as he shifted on the couch, watching Tyler from the side as he laid there, now on his stomach like he was earlier when Josh crawled his way out of his own body. Bobby closed his eyes as his sleepiness was catching up to him. After all it was just deja vu at this point to have Josh do the same thing, just with Tyler instead of himself. Tyler looked over after not long, seeing Bobby's eyes closed and having him likely already drift off to sleep. He chuckled, knowing his friend had a rough time lately, it made him glad to see him here and relaxed under Josh's roof. Regardless, Tyler stretched slightly, laying flat and still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's body finally stopped shifting, as Josh struggled to relocate his position. Having his eyes fully adjusted to the darkness, Josh saw exactly how Tyler's body was now laying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what's going on...\" Josh said aloud as he made his way to the sphincter he just came through to enter this terrifying chamber in the first place. Josh reached his hand into the slimy hole. He made a face as he pushed his way through the sphincter, still unable to believe this was the second time he was doing this today. Disgusted with all the nastiness covering him, Josh pressed on, working against Tyler's esophagus as he attempted part two of his grand escapes for today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler yawned as he started to get bored. Waiting patiently for the tickle in his throat that Bobby claimed to have, Tyler laid still hoping to feel the same. He even started to clench his abs, feeling pressure build up like crazy as he wanted nothing more than to let out one of his tremendous signature burps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hold it in though till I feel him...\" Tyler thought to himself, figuring that he could propel his friend out much like Bobby did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to pass by as Tyler...   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Slowly he started to ignore the sensation in his gut, as well as forgetting to feel for any movement in his throat. It wasn't long before his breath started to slow down and the massive titan was out like a light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's body felt like it slowed down around Josh. Having no idea what was happening in the outside world, Josh simply pressed on, completely unaware of how much progress he's even made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God it just feels like it goes on forever!\" Josh sobbed at the seemingly endless dark moving tunnel. With no light at the end of the tunnel to guide him, Josh only hoped he was actually making progress and not that Tyler's esophagus was simply slowly drifting him back down to the massive stomach below. To his surprise though, Josh found he reached an end. Practically leaping with joy, Josh pushed his way through Tyler's throat and reentered the mouth finally after his long journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tyler's face angled down, it actually proved fruitful to Josh as he simply slid down Tyler's slimy tongue to the front of his friend's mouth. However, once Josh reached Tyler's rows of white teeth, he noticed that his lips were sealed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey asshole! Open up!\" Josh yelled as he kicked one of Tyler's teeth to little effect. The massive molar easily dwarfed him, and Josh doubted very much that Tyler felt any kind of feedback. With no reaction from Tyler what so ever, Josh tilted his head as he could hear his friend's rhythmic breathing, in and out from above from his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler?!\" Josh yelled once again. With still no response, Josh sighed. \"Either he's ignoring me, or he fell asleep...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring it was the latter, Josh knew he position was anything but safe. He was just one unconscious swallow away from being sent back down into the massive lifeguard's stomach. Figuring his best option was to just force his way through Tyler's lips, Josh positioned himself past the teeth. Preparing to push through the lips. Josh reached his hands into the tight seal and shoved his head in first, hoping with all his might he may just squeeze right through. With a gasp of fresh air, Josh poked through, with a smile and looked down to see the fabric of one of his arm chairs that Tyler had his face pressed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Josh founded everything start to move. Holding on to Tyler's lip for dear life, Josh found himself slowly slipping down into Tyler's mouth as he enormous friend has just rolled over in his sleep, now on his back. With half of his body outside and the other still dangling inside, Josh pulled with all his strength. Desperate to escape and be done with this situation he stupidly put himself in. Josh pulled himself as hard as he could and...           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't' make things any easier for the minuscule man, but at this point Josh was just glad to finally be in relative safety.

Josh shook his head as he saw Bobby barely fitting on the sofa with his hand hanging off the side all the way down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they both just fell asleep like that...\" Josh thought, although not completely surprised, more so disappointed that they weren't more concerned with his safety. Josh sighed as there more or less wasn't much he could really do about it. For now, Josh just tried to focus on making his way off of Tyler's face and find a more suitable place to be found once his bumbling friends wake up from their naps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's attention quickly turned to the floor where Bobby's hand was touching.

Thankfully, it was not a long trek for the tired tiny. Josh hoisted himself down into Tyler's ear using his friend's brown shaggy hair. It was actually fairly easy as he made his way inside, foot getting stuck for a moment on some ear wax but Josh actually found the spot to be roomy, if not a little smelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, this works for now.\" Josh thought to himself as he leaned back, waiting for the two men to rouse from their sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed, and Tyler started to stir a little as he opened his eyes and stretched his limbs. He looked around quickly as he tried to remember what happened before he passed out. Seeing Bobby laying on the couch, Tyler tried to wake his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Bobby!\" Tyler called out to his friend on the couch. Bobby yawned and opened his eyes, taking a minute to register where he was as he looked over at Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Ty.\" Bobby yawned with a sleepy tone. \"Man I did not meant to fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I, dude.\" Tyler responded casually. \"I have no idea how long we were out for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait dude. Tell me you fell asleep after you got Josh out, right?\" Bobby asked, suddenly remembering the game they were playing with their tiny friend before he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude.\" Tyler answered, crossing his arms over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so... you don't think he's still in your stomach then, dude?\" Bobby asked, sitting up and looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if he was I can't imagine there's much left of him in there.\" Tyler responded, looking down at his chiseled abs with a sigh. \"But let's just make that our worst case scenario for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, dude?\" Bobby asked, confused by Tyler's wording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I've thought about this before. If I ever woke up not knowing where he was then the worst case is that he's dead. But in all other cases he's got to be somewhere, we just have to find him.\" Tyler tried to explain as Bobby merely blinked at him. \"I'm saying right now in this case he could have made it out while I was sleeping, so we should give him that chance in case he did, rather than just assuming he's dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shifted slightly as he listened to Tyler talk. This was surprisingly well thought out for the usually thick headed friend of his after all. Curious how things continue to unfold, Josh decided to stay silent and still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just in case. Josh, if you didn't make it out. I'm sorry dude. You're my best friend and I didn't meant to fall asleep. But hey, look on the bright side, maybe you became part of this...\" Tyler said as he flexed his arms in mid elegy. \"Also, if it's any consolation, you were also delicious, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby couldn't help but chuckle slightly at the ending and Josh merely rolled his eyes and had to fight any urge to say anything at Tyler's stupid speech before the huge man continued to speak. \"But if you did make it out, dude. You've got to help us out here. Try and get to a spot where we can find ya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes a second time as heard Tyler start to get out of the chair. Comfortable in his position in Tyler's ear, he knew he was in no danger of falling out, short of Tyler sticking his finger inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, dude! What if he's on the ground!\" Bobby said as he watched Tyler pound his feet onto the ground without much thought. Tyler rubbed the back of his head with a smile and laughed a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Yeah... Josh! I hope you weren't right there! I'll watch my step now though!\" Tyler said down to his feet with an apologetic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I'd be so screwed with this dunce trying to find me.\" Josh thought to himself as he continued to listen to Tyler's struggles play out. Noticing Tyler's movement again, Josh listened in, trying to figure out what was happening next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler walked to the kitchen and returned quickly to the living room with a number of napkins in his hand. Carefully looking at the ground, Tyler started to place them in several different spots apart from each other. Bobby simply sat and watched Tyler, looking puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those for?\" Bobby finally asked as Tyler finished placing them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a spot Josh can go to for us to see him.\" Tyler responded as he made his way back to his chair, sitting down and putting his hands behind his head. \"Now we just have to wait for him for show himself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually pretty smart.\" Josh thought to himself as he heard Bobby agree with him. Josh shrugged. This was kind of amusing, however he felt like he didn't want to make Tyler worry too much. Josh thought for a moment before deciding to...               </span></div></div>",

I just heard Josh talking to me.\" Tyler responded, still confused. Josh sighed at Tyler's stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I'm in your ear, genius.\" Josh answered to Tyler as his huge friend chuckled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha... my bad dude.\" Tyler responded as he put a hand next to his ear and tilted his head slightly, letting his tiny friend fall out into the safety of his palm. Tyler smiled in relief as he saw Josh unharmed in his hand once more. \"I'm glad you made it out, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, also it was nice... the things you said when you thought I was gone.\" Josh said, blushing a little as he recalled Tyler's words of them being best friends and how sorry he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time dude! After all you really were delicious!\" Tyler answered with a smile on his face. Josh rolled his eyes, as he should have expected such a response from his massive friend. \"Anyway dude, I can't believe you clawed your way out while I was asleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, that shits impressive.\" Bobby chimed in with a smile, also glad to see Josh was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys but...\" Josh started to say, wanting to down play this whole deal a little before they got too worked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, you could make an extreme sport out of this!\" Tyler said with an excited glimmer in his eye as he looked over at Bobby. Josh tried to interrupt as Bobby sat up with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude! That would be so hardcore!\" Bobby responded to Tyler with enthusiasm. Josh desperately wanted to interject before Tyler started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardcore is Josh's middle name!\" Tyler said proudly as he looked down at his little buddy. \"Right dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh squirmed in Tyler's hand as he ego was being stoked so effectively. Josh looked up at Tyler in the face and replied...    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah you bet it is!\" Josh replied without thinking. It was rare for Tyler to really stroke his ego like this, so Josh's response just slipped out to his two friends. Josh immediately regret his words but the look on both Bobby and Tyler's faces pretty much already sealed the deal. Josh swallowed hard as he awaited the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my little buddy!\" Tyler winked at Josh with enthusiasm. \"We should come up with your next grand venture!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, knowing now there wouldn't be any way to talk Tyler out of it, but at the very least it might be able to delay him. \"Well what about tomorrow? I mean... I'm pretty beat. I didn't exactly get a nice nap like you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby yawned at the statement as he looked at the clock. \"Yeah, I didn't nearly get enough sleep. Besides it's like 3am, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we waiting for? It's already tomorrow!\" Tyler said with a goofy grin much to both Josh's and Bobby's unhappiness. \"Kidding, dudes. Yeah I guess we can go to bed...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was relieved that at the very least he could take a nice deserved rest. Without delay, Josh guided the two men up stairs and into the spare bedroom. Bobby yawned goodnight as he quickly disappeared into the room and shut the door as Tyler and Josh made their way to his bedroom. Tyler set Josh on on his night stand and allowed him to get comfortable. Josh looked over at Tyler as he settled into his own bed. It felt a little weird seeing his room so huge, let alone someone else getting cozy in his own bed. But at the moment, Josh hardly cared as he was just glad to be on solid ground for a change, ready to pass out and hoping tomorrow would be better than today was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally started to open his eyes as he was getting adjusted to the light streaming though his bedroom window. Rolling on his back in a slight cramp, Josh sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked out into his room. Josh was shocked at what he saw though. Tyler was standing there with his back to Josh and just dropped a wet looking towel from his waist. Josh blushed as he stared out at Tyler's massive bare ass, before his friend pulled up his tight pair of black spandex, as well as the same shorts Bobby lent him yesterday. Tyler turned and looked to see Josh had sat up, just as Josh tried to look away and play off himself just waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning dude!\" Tyler said with a smile as he walked over to the night stand and knelt down. \"Sorry, I thought you were asleep, I didn't mean to give you a show!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's o-ok.\" Josh responded, still a little flustered. \"I only caught a glimpse of your butt anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I take it back then. I don't apologize.\" Tyler said with a wink. \"In that case, you're welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes at the comment. He wasn't even awake for five minutes and already he was dealing with Tyler's antics. \"Anyway, dude. Bobby and I already got up and took showers. I think he's down stairs making some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler got up without giving Josh a chance to speak as he turned and brought over a little bottle cap filled with water. \"Here, got you this dude. Figured you could take a little bath in peace while I go see how Bobby's doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the edge of the bottle cap, seeing the water was even a tiny bit soapy, as well as being warm. Before Josh could turn to thank Tyler and his surprising thoughtfulness, he had already disappeared through the door with a quick wave. Josh got into the little make shift bath, glad to be able to finally clean himself after far too many adventures yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually really nice...\" Josh said to himself as he finished up, both in respect to Tyler's actions as well as the bath itself. Josh even noticed a tiny piece of paper towel tucked under the bottle cap that Tyler left. Using it to dry himself off, Josh truly felt refreshed, finally. Josh looked up as he heard the door knob start to turn and saw both Tyler and Bobby make their way into the room, holding a small plate and a second bottle cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, he's all finished!\" Bobby said with a grin as he made his way over to Josh's bed, sitting down next to the night stand and dropping off a small plate of food as well as a bottle cap full of what appeared to be orange juice. Josh looked from Bobby, who was wearing a tight black tank top as well as a pair of black basketball shorts and a red hat, over to the plate of food, which had a round cut up piece of pancake on it. Josh looked at the food, intentionally made small for him, in yet was more than he could ever eat in one sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Josh said to Bobby before looking at Tyler with a smile. \"Both of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no biggie, dude!\" Tyler said as he put his arms behind his head and stretching his bare torso. Josh started to dig in to the pancake but froze after Tyler spoke again. \"After all, we have such awesome plans for today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to ignore Tyler's words as he focused on eating. But sadly for the tiny man, Bobby answered for him, not allowing the subject to be dropped so easily. \"Yeah dude, we came up with a few ideas for your new extreme sport!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, we call it Stomach Spelunking.\" Tyler added before Bobby shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Gut Busting better, dude.\" Bobby said in retort, as Josh continued to ignore them. \"Either way, dude. I came up with the idea that you try and escape from some who has no idea that they even ate you in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already did that.\" Josh said looking right at Bobby. \"With you in fact. So maybe we should just do something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that's what I thought at first too, dude.\" Bobby said waving his hand. \"But what if it was someone who didn't even know you were tiny? Like if we got one of the dudes from the park to chill with us and he didn't even know you were with us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" Josh said, looking to Tyler for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I had a better idea.\" Tyler gleamed as he noticed Josh looking to him instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say climb out of someone who's sleeping then I'll say the same thing I just said to Bobby, to you.\" Josh interrupted Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro. I had a different idea!\" Tyler said with excitement. \"I was thinking of making it into a game! I was thinking one of us could swallow something, then you have to not only retrieve it but also escape! Like a treasure hunt, followed by a daring escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I feel like it removes the whole extreme sport part out of it like that though, dude.\" Bobby said to Tyler's explanation. \"That just sounds more like a challenge or adventure to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you dude, Stomach Spelunking is more like an adventure than an extreme sport.\" Tyler laughed back at Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude. Gut Busting is about the thrill of taking different courses and trials for the good of the sport. Not about item retrieval.\" Bobby tilted his head while crossing his arms. Looking over at Josh, Bobby gave him a look, that Josh knew meant he was going to have to pick a side. \"What do you think Josh? It's about the sport and changing the course up, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, it's about having fun with it and making up new rules, right?\" Tyler said, looking at Josh for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stuffed a piece of pancake in his mouth. Not wanting to respond. Finally, after a deep sigh, he knew they would force him into it no matter what. In the end Josh decided to side with...       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

The idea did come up as a sport after all.\" Josh said, while looking at Bobby hoping that siding with him would cause Tyler to get bored with the whole thing a little faster.  Tyler shrugged his shouldered and chuckled at Josh's optimistic look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, dude. We decided you'd be the tie breaker. So I won't complain.\" Tyler said with a smirk, likely just more interested in toying Josh more than anything else. Josh shuddered slightly at Tyler's look, like he was being eye'd at with devious eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we both agreed not to put up a fight, dude! But I'm still glad you agreed with me instead.\" Bobby winked at Josh as the tiny man sweat a little from what he's in store for. \"I guess now we just have to figure out who we're gonna get over here to join us, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems kind of silly that they would come to my house and not expect me to be here, though. Right?\" Josh asked, apprehensively, hoping the road block would just get the two to forget about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy, dude. We'll just tell them that you're out and had us watch the house. Besides Bobby technically lives here now anyway.\" Tyler said, casually, putting a stop to Josh's hopes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah or we could just go to your place, Ty?\" Bobby asked as Tyler's eye's widened slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahhhhh let's not do that, dude.\" Tyler stalled by waving his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not dude?\" Bobby asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably an unrecognizable pigsty.\" Josh said quickly while crossing his arms. Tyler merely rubbed the back of his head with a chuckle in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have to go home and actually get a change of clothes. Why don't you guys get comfortable and I'll be back in a little bit.\" Tyler replied finally, changing the subject. Josh and Bobby watched as Tyler left the room and the three made their way down into the living room. Without wasting any time, Tyler waved as he went out the door, sure to return for further antics soon. Josh sat in Bobby's palm as he sat at the dining room table before his gigantic friend let him down on the table. Looking up at Bobby's massive muscular frame, Josh realized this was the first time he's even been alone with Bobby while shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like your pancake, dude?\" Bobby asked, not sure what to talk about with his minuscule friend at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was delicious!\" Josh replied with a smile. \"It was very filling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I must've had like six myself, dude!\" Bobby smiled as he rubbed his abs through his tight shirt. \"Getting kinda hungry again already though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed at the statement. I was kind of surreal knowing he was actually trapped on the other side of Bobby's massive abs just yesterday. \"Well I guess you have a fast metabolism then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed as he took his hand off his stomach. \"Can't be too fast if you somehow escaped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh simply laughed awkwardly at Bobby's joke. Bobby on the other hand, felt very comfortable talking about it as he continued. \"Your blood must be pumping for your next challenge, huh bro?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that.\" Josh replied, feeling like his blood was certainly pumping in fear and not excitement like Bobby imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound very confident, bro.\" Bobby asked, looking down at Josh's forlorn look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you could say I'm just scared something could go wrong.\" Josh answered, trying to get Bobby to stop this nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude. You have nothing to worry about.\" Bobby said with a smile. \"You're such a bad ass you did it twice. You can do it again. Besides, Ty and I will watch your back, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Josh simply said with a smile, both trusting his two friends with his life, but also always having a bit of doubt in the back of his mind. Josh looked up as he heard Bobby's phone buzz. Pulling it out he looked at the message and conveyed it to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ty. He said he's on his way and he texted a few of the guys.\" Bobby said, scrolling the message down more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who'd he invite?\" Josh asked, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says he asked...\"       </span></div></div>",

Bobby simply looked down at Josh and tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh so what are they like?\" Bobby asked, as Josh remembered he had never met the two before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um. Well they're both blonde. Matt's a tiny bit shorter than Tyler, and Luke is just a hair shorter than Matt. But otherwise they're both total goofs like Tyler.\" Josh replied as Bobby nodded his head, looking like he was curious for more details. \"Um well... Matt's a surfer. He's a little leaner than you or Tyler. As for Luke, I know he's more into heavy lifting than Matt. He's probably closer to yours and Tyler's builds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we'd all get along, bro.\" Bobby smiled. \"Especially if they're real hard heads like Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's certainly more Luke than Matt. Matt's a goof, as much as Luke is, but he's much more level headed!\" Josh responded, thinking about how the two men always seem to work well together because of their similar, yet different personalities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't wait to meet em, dude.\" Bobby winked as he moved his hand behind Josh, much to Josh's surprise. \"But we've got to get you hidden before they get here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't have much choice as Bobby easily scooped him up in his hand and brought him all the way up to his hat. Bobby raised his hand to the top of his hat and rested Josh right at the very tip on top. Holding on to the top, Josh looked around the room from his new massively tall perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I've never seen this room from so high up before!\" Josh thought, as Bobby stood up to his full hieght. \"Guess I know what it's like to be as tall as Bobby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby turned to look and see the front door start to open, and sure enough Tyler had made his way back leading the two men he had yet to meet. Looking at Tyler, Bobby was glad to see that he finally changed into some real clothes. Wearing a grey tank top and black shorts, as well as kicking of his red shoes to reveal a pair of black socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\" Tyler said as he walked up to Bobby. \"Dude, this is Luke...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked to see the shorter of the two blondes walk forward to grab his hand and pull in for a bro hug. He had buzzed blonde hair and greenish eyes. Bobby smiled as Josh's description of him held true, as he wore a tight white tee shirt showing off his obviously thicker muscles underneath. Even his legs were very well trained as Bobby saw he was wearing a pair of loose green running shorts, with his legs sticking out like tree trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, dude!\"  Luke said as he finished his hug. \"It's good meeting you! I didn't know the boss had a roomie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we used to room in college too actually.\" Bobby responded with a smile. Next Bobby saw as Matt moved forward, grabbing Bobby by the hand much like Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue again to his description, Matt was taller than Luke, but slightly shorter than Tyler. He wore a tight pink tank top as well as a pair of white shorts shorts and a brown fabric belt hanging off his side. He had short spiked hair and piercing blue eyes that Bobby couldn't help but stare at for a moment. Bobby's attention shifted focus to his build, which he certainly was leaner as Josh said, but his defined features still showed through the tight shirt with ease. Hung around his neck, Bobby saw a shark tooth necklace, and on his head he wore a pair of sunglasses propped on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, dude!\" Matt said as he finished his hug as well. \"I'm Matt, it's cool meeting friends of the boss like you, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's my boss now too, so I guess I better get used to calling him that!\" Bobby replied with a smile. \"But he's out right now. Said you all could chill here though, bros!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Ty was telling us, dude!\" Luke said, kicking off his own shoes and walking into the place with a smile. \"This is awesome dude, I don't think we've ever been invited over like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, that means we have to try not to trash the place, Luke!\" Matt said as he followed Luke in, grabbing his friend from the side. \"Otherwise he won't ever invite us back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, dude. The boss loves us!\" Luke laughed as he grabbed Matt back and started to push his friend around. Bobby simply stared at the two as Tyler came to his side and put a hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're always like this, dude.\" Tyler said with a grin as he looked at Bobby who had a smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kind of bros!\" Bobby laughed, enthusiastically. \"You guys hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always!\" Luke and Matt replied in unison as Luke had Matt in a headlock. Bobby smiled as he walked into the kitchen and started to take a look around. Opening up Josh's cabinets, Bobby found a pack of spaghetti as well as a jar of sauce with pre-made meatballs. Josh watched from atop Bobby's hat as his friend located a large enough pot to start to boil water in. After setting it on the stove, Bobby walked back out into the living room as he saw Matt lounging on the sofa, Tyler in an arm chair, and Luke on the ground doing sit ups. The three men had the tv on, however it seemed like they were too preoccupied with each other to actually watch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, do you have to do sit ups now?\" Matt asked as he looked down at Luke on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, just trying to burn off some energy.\" Luke responded between breaths. Bobby laughed as the three turned to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making spaghetti if that's cool with you dudes?\" Bobby asked as Luke spang up from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome I love spaghetti! Do you need help, dude?\" Luke asked, wanting something to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro, I'm all good.\" Bobby looked at Tyler and the two exchanged glances quickly. \"Why don't you guys throw a football around outside or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he got up. \"You think Josh has a football?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha well I've got one in my bag upstairs, Ty.\" Bobby answered, forgetting how little into sports Josh was. Tyler nodded as he went upstairs and went to grab the football, while Bobby watched Matt get out of the couch and stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we have to do something to keep Luke entertained.\" Matt smirked at Luke who agreed at first before getting a sour look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean, dude?\" Luke laughed back, getting ready to grab Matt into another headlock. Bobby chuckled at the two goofy blondes as Tyler came down the stairs, spinning a football in hand before throwing directly at Luke's back. Josh watched in horror as the ball bounced off Luke's back and landed dangerously near his tv stand. Luke turned and grabbed the football, ready to chuck it back at Tyler before Matt grabbed his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for outside, dude. You're gonna break something.\" Matt said, much to Josh's relief. Luke simply shrugged as he held on to the ball, and Josh watched as the three huge men made their way out the back door. Josh and Bobby made their way back into the kitchen, and Bobby reached up for his little friend on his head, now that the coast was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man they're a couple of characters, huh?\" Bobby laughed as he set Josh down on the kitchen counter and poured the spaghetti into the boiling water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like having two extra Tylers stomp their way around my house...\" Josh sighed as he watched Bobby dump the sauce into a smaller pan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Matt seems like he's got his head on straight.\" Bobby laughed as he grabbed a spoon and stirred the sauce and meatballs a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't let him fool you.\" Josh crossed his arms with a smile, knowing exactly the antics Matt was capable of. \"He's just always a little groggy and slow in the mornings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gotcha dude.\" Bobby nodded in understanding. \"Not everyone's a morning person I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah then there's Luke. He's got enough energy to power an entire country.\" Josh chuckled as he doesn't think he's ever really seen Luke \"tired\" before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Luke seems like a dude I could party with. I'm sure Matt would be too once he get's going.\" Bobby laughed as he stirred the spaghetti as it was almost finished. \"But speaking of the two of them. Which one do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Want?\" Josh asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know dude. Gotta pick your course to figure out who's food I put you in.\" Bobby winked as he turned off the burner and got ready to strain the spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Josh responded as he completely forgot why Matt and Luke even came over. Josh sighed, knowing he was going to have to choose or Bobby would just pick for him. Deciding on his own fate Josh went with...                    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh thought for a moment. He supposed if he had to pick, Matt was likelier the safer option since he was still fairly groggy this morning. \"I guess I'll go with Matt then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt? Huh I would've thought you would've gone for Luke. THAT would've been exciting.\" Bobby chuckled as he grabbed a couple of plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Matt is taller, so I thought it'd be harder to get out?\" Josh lied, hoping to feign interest so Bobby would just agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's a good point.\" Bobby said as he left the spaghetti in Josh's sink in a colander and the sauce on the stove as he turned to go to the back door and get the guys. \"Yo, dudes! Foods ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby came back into the kitchen and immediately went over to Josh's position and scooped his little friend up. Josh squirmed slightly in the darkness of Bobby's hand as he heard three pairs of feet come pounding into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome I'm starving!\" Luke yelled with excitement as he entered the kitchen, shirt missing and torso covered in sweat. Tyler came bustling in behind Luke, also missing his shirt with sweat dripping down his face and torso. Bobby watched as the two quickly grabbed plates of food and stormed off to the living room to eat and watch tv. Matt yawned as he took his time, grabbing a plate and plopping some spaghetti and sauce on neatly as he smiled at Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for making food, dude.\" Matt said casually. \"Does the boss have any soda? I feel like I need a little caffeine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude.\" Bobby said as he opened the fridge with his free and and watched as Matt grabbed a soda. Bobby also noticed a container of parmesan cheese and grabbed it with the hand Josh was in, pinning Josh against the container near the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some parm for your spaghetti, dude?\" Bobby asked nonchalantly as he popped off the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, dude. Thanks.\" Matt grinned as he held out his plate while taking a sip of his soda. Bobby carefully loosened his hand, allowing Josh to get lodged free. Bobby even watched as he saw Josh fall from his hand amidst the sprinkles of cheese directly on top of the warm red sauce on Matt's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh coughed as he choked on pieces of cheese just before he squirmed in pain at the hot tomato sauce on his skin. \"Oh god it's so hot!\" Josh squirmed as he really started to notice the steam coming off the sauce he was partially cover in. Josh almost screamed as the plate started to move at high speeds as he looked up to see Matt's face looking forward as he carried his plate of food off to be eaten. Josh found his journey come to a stop as Matt set the plate down on the dining room table as well as the can of soda next to it. Josh looked around, not seeing anyone else in the dining room. \"Where's Tyler and Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\" Luke's voice called from the next room over. \"Dude, just eat in here with us and watch some tv!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude. I don't wanna make a mess.\" Matt called back as he sat at the table and looked out into the living room from his seat. \"Besides I can sort of see the tv from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself!\" Luke called back as he sat there laughing with Tyler at what they were watching. Matt simply shook his head with a chuckle as Bobby sat down across from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sit with you, bro.\" Bobby said with a friendly tone as his eyes shifted from Matt's face down to his place, barely making out the spot where Josh struggled in the hot mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dude!\" Matt smiled back as he picked up his fork and started to mix his spaghetti, sending Josh into a spiral within the food and making Bobby lose his position completely. Bobby swallowed a little as he realized he had no idea where Josh was in Matt's meal. Bobby shifted his focus back to Matt as he continued to speak. \"So how long have you and the boss known each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just since college, we were roommates.\" Bobby said as he watched Matt twirl some spaghetti on his fork and shove it in his mouth, barely chewing as he swallowed most of it down whole. Bobby wondered if Josh was in that bite, but tried to focus on talking to Matt for now. \"I actually just moved in with him here since yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice, dude.\" Matt said as he swallowed another mouthful of food. \"That's really cool of him. He's a good guy always helping people out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he is.\" Bobby responded, distracted as he looked at Matt's newest forkful of food. Bobby could just barely make out tiny bits of movement as he could see Josh trapped on an outer most twirl of spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked down at his fork himself, curious what Bobby was looking at and...                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt shoved the food directly in his mouth without a second thought. Bobby smiled a little to himself, glad Matt was just looking at his food and that Josh didn't get discovered somehow. Returning his attention back to his own food, Bobby was glad to know his job was done for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Josh screamed as Matt's teeth came crashing down dangerously close to his position. Josh squirmed and struggled as he flopped helplessly in the mess of half chewed food. Josh winced as Matt's teeth came crashing down once again, making the tiny man fear for his life, just wanting nothing more than the huge surfer hunk to stop chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's stomach dropped as he got his wish. Matt had stopped chewing, but if only to seal the food in his mouth before swallowing the contents down to his own stomach. Josh called out in terror as he was force-ably sucked down Matt's throat with a resounding gulp. The terrified tiny opened his eyes as he found himself traveling down the esophagus, a sight he's grown way too familiar with at this point. As was routine at this point, Josh waited for the lump of food to finally come to a stop before the sphincter leading to Matt's stomach opened up, accepting the next portion of the blonde hunk's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh landed in the spacious organ and took a deep breath of the sour air inside. Oddly enough the stench wasn't terribly unbearable, like Bobby or Tyler's guts. Josh still pinched his nose regardless as it was far from pleasant as it mostly reeked of tomato sauce and what Josh assumed to be coffee. Josh sat in place in the food he entered in, as it seemed like Matt's stomach wasn't in any huge rush to get going and digest it's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually feel safe for a change...\" Josh noted awkwardly, just before the sphincter right above him opened up, releasing a fresh pile of spaghetti on top of him. Josh shook his head, as he knew he could never be comfortable for long before he worked his way out of the pile and to a different section of Matt's stomach before he was buried alive under the rest of the giant's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby quickly devoured his meal as he watched Matt more or less taking his time, yawning as he took a sip of his soda. Figuring it was getting close to time to try and entice Matt to lay down, Bobby had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Matt.\" Bobby asked as Matt stopped with a mouthful of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmyeah?\" Matt asked with the food still in my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna chill and catch some rays outside after you're finished eating?\" Bobby asked motioning toward the back door. \"Josh has some nice lounge chairs. Plus it seemed pretty nice out today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Matt smiled after swallowing his food. \"I seriously can't keep up with Luke this morning, dude. He woke me up at like 5am wanting to go for a run and he hasn't stopped since.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hear you dude. I dunno where Ty gets all his energy too.\" Bobby laughed. \"But yeah I think laying down would do you some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt twirled up the last bit of spaghetti on his plate and put it in his mouth, swallowing it down quickly as he stood up and grabbed his soda. \"I'm good to go dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, bro.\" Bobby said with a smile as he grabbed his and Matt's plates and brought them into the kitchen. Matt followed Bobby for a second, chugging the rest of his soda and setting than can down beside the sink. The two men made their way to the back door, heading out into the bright sunlight. Looking to the pool side, Bobby and Matt made their way over to a pair of lounge chairs. Sitting down beside one another, the two men pulled off their tank tops to get some sun as they laid down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's with all you three and these beach ball pecs.\" Matt smirked at Bobby as he looked down at his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't that big! Are they?\" Bobby asked, cupping them in hand. \"Besides dude, you're a lot bigger than I thought you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked down at his own chest. It was certainly sizable, as he made his pecs bounce slightly in response. But the cool surfer dude simply lowered his sunglasses over his eyes and rubbed his defined features. \"I'm more about ascetics than size, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby shrugged as he went and laid down on his stomach, looking over at Matt to see what he'd do. As if he was mimicking Bobby, Matt laid on his stomach and sighed as he closed his eyes, enjoying laying down in the warm sun after a good meal. Bobby breathed in deep, glad everything was going according to plan so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shoved his way though piles of unchewed noodles as well as half chewed bits of meatball as he made his way around the now familiar cavern. Pressing forward like he was used to doing by this point, Josh found his way to the sphincter and pushed his way through once more. Josh sighed, as he really was getting good at finding his way to the sphincter and he was so accustom to the rhythmic motions of an esophagus, that he found his progress to actually being going quite smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his pace was quite swift when suddenly...            </span></div></div>",

What's going on?\" Josh screamed as he tried desperately to hold on to the smooth muscle of Matt's esophagus. Josh swore he could have seen the opening of Matt's throat but now it faded further and further away as he rapidly lost his position. \"No! I was right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, no!\" Matt yelled as Luke jumped on top of him, pulling his phone out of his pocket before starting to drag Matt toward the pool. Matt looked to Bobby for help, but would seem the massive man had quickly fallen asleep. Matt looked up as he saw Tyler's tremendous form in front of him, smirking as he grabbed Matt by the arms and helped pull him into the pool. With a splash, Matt resurfaced from the water with a bit of an annoyed look on his face. Tyler and Luke laughed as the watched Matt pull himself out of the water, shorts dripping wet and his hair flat without gel. Matt gave the two a look as he grabbed his phone and shirt off the ground and made his way around the front of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going Matty?\" Luke called with a laugh as Matt stomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surfing! I'm done with you today, dude!\" Matt replied angrily, wanting nothing more than to just grab his board and relax on the waves. Tyler and Luke stood side by side, watching Matt walk off into the distance before turning and looking at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo hoo! I got all wet!\" Tyler mocked Matt to Luke with a childish tone. The two laughed as the looked over at Bobby, who was out cold. \"Think we could pick him up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah he's a tank, dude.\" Luke laughed looking at Bobby's truly massive form. \"Besides he could actually fight back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True dude. Best to let him chill then I guess.\" Tyler shrugged as the two made their way inside, grabbing the football again and tossing it around while they let Bobby sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where even am I?!\" Josh yelled into the darkness as Matt's body was flopped and flipped around in so many directions before finally resting, that it made Josh's head spin. The contents of Matt's stomach started to break down, becoming more fluid as it made Josh's skin itch. Having no idea what happened, Josh just hoped Bobby and Tyler were on the case of getting Matt to lay down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can get up there...\" Josh said to himself as Matt's stomach churned and swung slightly with every foot step he took. The top of Matt's stomach just seemed impossibly far away. Josh tried to find a safe place to stay while he hoped his friends would remedy the situation, but no matter where he looked Matt's stomach just seemed flooded in acidic soda as well as a mixture of gastric juices starting to tear apart the food inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itching on Josh's skin started to turn to pain, as it was starting to be too much to bear. Josh could barely see anymore as his vision faded. Coughing on the stale air and feeling like his whole body was slowly being dissolved, Josh collapsed into the depths of the massive organ. Matt's stomach churned and groaned, happily going about it's business, unaware of the tiny life slowly being digested within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt finally reached the beach, surf board under his arm as he got out into the water and sat on his board. Taking in a deep breath of the salty ocean air, Matt felt relaxed, glad to be away from Luke and his nonstop activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a little bad for ditching Bobby though.\" Matt thought to himself as he stared out into the ocean. Matt closed his eyes and shrugged as he waited for the waves to pick up a little. \"Maybe I'll go back later once I've had some time to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge wave started to come up, as Matt paddled along side it. Riding it with ease, he ran his hand into the water with a smile. As he continued to relax at the beach, Matt was truly none wiser to the horror that went on for his tiny boss just on the other side of his abs. Sitting back down on his board waiting for another wave, none of that mattered to the handsome surfer as he awaited the next good ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the beach, Matt retrieved his phone to see he had several missed calls and over ten text messages from Tyler and Luke combined. Matt scoffed as he shut his phone off and found a beach chair to lay on. Laying down once again, Matt sighed in peace as he could go back to what he was doing before, uninterrupted.              </span></div></div>",

Bobby rose an eyebrow as he looked over at Matt's slightly discomforted face before the handsome blonde let out a long burp. Matt laughed as he looked over at Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno why, felt like I burped something up, dude.\" Matt laughed as Bobby sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\" Bobby asked directly as Matt lifted his sunglasses, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Matt replied looking down slightly in front of him on the chair where he face was resting, expecting to find a gross speck of food. Matt squinted as he saw whatever came out of his mouth start to move. \"It's a bug!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lurched back slightly, having a general distaste for bugs, let alone them coming out of his mouth. Matt, got ready to swat it off the chair before Bobby stopped him. \"Wait dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Matt practically yelled as Bobby grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closer, dude.\" Bobby said, pointing at the moving speck. Matt squinted as he looked a little closer at the moving creature before two and two clicked in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" Matt asked as he looked even closer. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved at Matt, as Bobby stood by and smiled. Matt simply shook his head, ready to ask the obvious question. \"How in the world did I just burp you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you ate me, Matt.\" Josh responded, feeling proud about yet another successful escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Matt responded, voice cracking a little bit from his utter shock. \"But I thought you were out today? Also you're tiny! What's going on, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at Bobby, feeling like poor confused Matt deserved some sort of explanation. Bobby nodded, allowing Josh to do the explaining. Josh looked at Matt's blue eyes as he told him everything, from how this whole \"sport\" started by accident, to his two near brushes with death, and finally how they wanted to up the ante yet again. Matt stared and blinked at Josh's story as he finally finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was your go to next person for this sport you've been doing?\" Matt asked a little confused still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was you or Luke and I picked you.\" Josh said, hoping Matt wasn't mad at this was all done without his permission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... that's awesome!\" Matt said with an excited smile. \"You definitely picked right choosing me over Luke by the way. His guts probably smell like shit, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed in relief, glad that Matt wasn't upset about being in the dark up till now. Matt looked up at Bobby with a grin. \"You set him up getting eaten by me, huh dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro. I wasn't sure if you were gonna get him in the spaghetti at first.\" Bobby chuckled as he sat down on the lounge chair as Matt scooped his tiny boss into his hand and sat up, trying to be a little more comfortable than laying on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy dude. I can't believe you've done this three times now!\" Matt said, impressed as he looked down at Josh crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I guess I'm getting pretty good at it now.\" Josh said with some true confidence. Matt looked over to Bobby with a look of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you think he's up for round four then?\" Matt asked Bobby who put on a smile at Matt's enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round four?\" Josh asked, some of his confidence draining from him suddenly. Matt looked back down at Josh with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure dude. I was round three, Luke is round four!\" Matt chuckled, as he stood up, holding Josh at about belly button level. Josh started up past Matt's chest to his face which turned and nodded to Bobby. \"How should we do this, Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we could sneak him in some food like we did with you, dude.\" Bobby offered as an idea. \"But I guess he did just eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just drop Josh in a drink, maybe?\" Matt suggested. \"Or I guess we could just straight up bring him up to speed and see if he has any dumb ideas. It is Luke after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to take your word for that, dude.\" Bobby chuckled, still not knowing Luke very well. \"But I guess it's up to Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked down at Josh in his hand, raising him up to about chest level to talk to him better. \"What do you say dude? Should we drop you in his drink or just tell him what's up and see what he thinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh puzzled for a moment, knowing they were going to make him choose no matter what since their minds were made up. Weighing his options, Josh decided that they should...                 </span></div></div>",

If not Josh figured Luke being aware of his presence would at least add a layer of safety for the whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me, dude!\" Matt said with excitement as he and Bobby started to make their way inside, leaving their shirts behind as they hurried into the living room to see Tyler and Luke already done with their meals, watching tv. Matt held his hand out as Tyler and Luke looked at him, curiously. \"You guys will never guess who I found popping out of my mouth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo way! I missed it, dude?\" Tyler huffed, reclining in disappointment. \"I didn't even know he picked you, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on.\" Luke asked, looking from Tyler to Matt, to Bobby in utter confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, dudes. Now we have to tell him!\" Tyler said with an annoyed look. \"Good going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were planning on it, dude. Josh had an idea.\" Bobby replied, waving his hand as Tyler dropped his look to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is that the boss in your hand?\" Luke asked, still not understanding the situation. \"Wait he popped out of your mouth? What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giant men laughed a little as they explained what happened. Matt recounted the events that had just unfolded as well as his own surprise in finding out he had unwittingly devoured their tiny boss, only to have him climb his way out completely unbeknownst to him. Luke sat back, slightly confused still as to why this was all being brought to his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah dude. You're round four. How do you wanna do this?\" Bobby asked Luke as he put a hand on his chin in thought. Luke snapped his fingers, having an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude. If you want a challenge, then I'll give you a challenge.\" Luke said, looking at Josh with a cocky smirk. Josh's face turned a little pale as his hope for Luke being merciful felt like they were about to be expertly dashed. \"So check this, you try and escape from my bod while I do some exercises. For the sake of being fair, I'll only for floor exercises so my body stays somewhat flat. Like planks and push ups and shit, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... that sounds... difficult.\" Josh responded in a moderate amount of fear. \"Do we have a fail safe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you needed a fail safe before?\" Luke asked, not remembering anyone mentioning one for anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but. This course just sounds exceptionally difficult.\" Josh responded a little nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shrugged as he responded. \"Well I guess I can puke you up after like half an hour or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half an hour?\" Josh replied nervously. \"That seems like a long time to be in a stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a slow metabolism, dude. Don't worry!\" Luke winked at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, your metabolism like pauses when you work out.\" Bobby added as everyone looked at him in surprise. \"What? It's why you get cramps, dudes. I did pay attention in some of my classes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, dude? Half an hour. You should be safe.\" Luke smiled as he stood up out of the chair and rubbed his bare chest down to his impressive abs, now dry from his sweat from earlier. \"So you ready, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Josh asked, sitting in Matt's hand, literally only escaping the surfer hunk not long ago. Matt handed Josh off to Luke and went to go take a seat with Bobby as they were ready to watch the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude.\" Luke smiled as he brought Josh up to his handsome face. Josh looked Luke in his striking green eyes nervously as he opened his mouth slightly. \"Bottoms up, boss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't even get a word out as he found himself being unceremoniously dumped into Luke's gaping mouth. Josh noticed as he landed on Luke's soft tongue that he was immediately plunged into darkness. Seeing Luke's mouth was still open, Josh looked outside to see he was sticking his tongue out to show his crowd that he really had Josh inside his mouth. Josh barely caught glimpses of his friend's faces before Luke's massive tongue retracted into his cavernous mouth and the handsome stud closed his lips behind it. Josh shivered slightly as Luke lifted his tongue, causing Josh to be positioned over his throat, and sent down with absolute ease with a simple gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Luke said, sticking tongue out again with a sigh. \"Annnnd he's gone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed and gave a quick clap as Matt and Bobby just watched with entertained smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I feel him like, right here.\" Luke said, putting a hand on his chest, slowly tracing it down to his abs. \"Someone start a timer for 30 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pulled out his phone, setting an alarm for 30 minutes before storing it back in his pocket. \"All set, bro. Now lets see some intense work out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch and be amazed, boys!\" Luke winked as he got down on the ground and started to do some slow deliberate crunches. The three other giants simply laughed as they watched Luke begin his work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slid down the the final depths of Luke's throat, reaching the blonde stud's stomach which at this point almost seemed routine to the tiny explorer. This time was actually starting off a lot differently though, as Josh quickly realized. The contents of Luke's stomach sloshed from flat, to up right, to flat again at a very massive rate. Josh sloshed back and fourth with the contents in rhythmic fashion, starting to feel sick to his own stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God this is a nightmare!\" Josh yelled into the cavern. As if Luke heard him, the contents of Luke's stomach flipped to the other side, laying flat as it felt like he was being raised and lowered slowly and steadily. Josh almost assumed Luke must be doing push ups, and took the opportunity to figure out his bearings. Racing against Luke's work out routine, Josh found the sphincter and pushed his way through as he was used to by now. Feeling like he was working in double time, Josh steamed his way across the esophagus while he still had the chance with it being flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and...       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Lunging forward with his front and touching his toes at the top, Luke was completely unaware of how badly he just hindered his tiny boss. Losing all his progress, thanks to Luke's new position, Josh found himself plummeting back down into the massive stomach of his muscular employee. Obviously unaware, Luke continued about with his challenge regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel anything yet, Luke?\" Matt asked, curious about his boss's whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Luke huffed between breaths as he swapped from jack knives to bicycles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was too tough for him.\" Bobby said, wondering if Josh has made any progress at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give em, time.\" Tyler smiled as he patted his pocket. \"We'll just wait for my alarm to go off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three agreed as they continued to watch Luke go about his work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed as Luke continued on, working up a sweat, but showing absolutely no signs of being tired. Matt sat transfixed on Luke, unable to believe he's been going nonstop this whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta feel something by now, dude.\" Matt asked finally after a long break of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Luke said as he looked at Matt. \"Sorry dude, I've just been in the zone.

If it wasn't for Luke's sudden movements, Josh felt like he really could have escaped. But with Luke's position changing so rapidly, Josh could barely tell which way was up and which was down. Josh's eyes watered from the foul air in the massive stomach, wanting nothing more than the half hour to pass so his friends would just pity him and let him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed on and Josh found himself continually being sloshed about in Luke's stomach. He felt like he was in there for an eternity, let alone a simple half hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't they let me out yet!?\" Josh cried out in the chaotic organ as it continued to flop about it's partially digested contents. Despite the fact that Luke's body was in motion so often, Josh found his skin started to burn. Rubbing the spots hoping to feel a little better as he was continually trounced about in the stomach, Josh began to question his ability to survive a half hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Josh was unaware that he had in fact survived now for over 45 minutes. As bad luck would have it, Tyler's phone was set to silent and the alarm wasn't going to save Josh any time soon. Josh cried as Luke's motions never seemed to show any signs of stopping or tiring out. Exhausted, Josh couldn't fight on for much longer as he was continually sloshed and churned with Luke's meal. It wasn't long before the agony of residual stomach acid finally caught up to the tiny man, causing him to be digested about in the mix of food ready to be processed within the confines of Luke's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pulled out his phone per Luke's request and his eyes widened as he saw his alarm went off over an hour ago. \"What? Why didn't it go off!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke immediately stopped his workout and laid flat, looking at Tyler. \"What do you mean it didn't go off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean exactly what I said, dude. I guess my phone was on silent...\" Tyler said, staring at it in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, well.\" Luke said sitting up. \"I can still get him out right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless he survived for almost two hours...\" Tyler mumbled dropping his phone to his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been two hours?!\" Matt yelled as he looked at Luke. \"How has it been that long?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess none of us were paying that close of attention...\" Bobby chimed in, feeling equally as guilty as everyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh.\" Luke said looking down at his sweaty abs. \"What do I do, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Tyler answered, sitting back and clutching his phone tight in his hand. \"He's gone, dude.\"       </span></div></div>",

Better get puking, bro.\" Tyler smirked as he stored his phone back in his pocket and watched Luke sit up with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better grab me a bucket then, unless he wants vomit all over his floor!\" Luke laughed as Tyler got up to go to the kitchen and found a pot used for cooking Luke could use. Tyler set the pot down in front of Luke and the three men watched transfixed as Luke shoved his fingers down his throat with great force, immediately causing a response and making the handsome man gag and vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends laughed hysterically as Luke continued to make himself self throw up repeatedly, making awful noises in the process that they found hilarious. After just a few minutes, Luke groggily looked into the pot, spotting some tiny confused motion as he reached in and scooped the tiny man as well as I hand full of vomit out of the pot. Luke smirked as he looked down at Josh before he arrogantly spat into the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you failed, bro!\" Luke smirked as Josh tried desperately to make his head stop spinning. \"Big Luke's too much for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes as he watched Luke clear out the excess vomit from his hand, letting Josh readjust in relative cleanliness. \"Big Luke also made the challenge practically impossible for him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\" Luke said putting a hand on his ear. \"Am I hearing this right, or are you defending the boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Tyler blushed a little. \"I'm just stating facts, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're just jealous you weren't the one to be too much for him!\" Luke challenged Tyler's ego a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, dude.\" Tyler spat back, crossing his arms and sitting back in his chair. Luke chuckled as he looked down at Josh, who finally seemed to be refocused on his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was insane...\" Josh finally said. \"My head is still swimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I was too much for you, dude.\" Luke winked with a pompous tone. Josh quickly saw Luke's arrogance as an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were too much.\" Josh quickly agreed. \"Guess that means I failed. Not really much I can do from here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right, dude.\" Bobby responded, making Josh's face glow with excitement. \"We'll just have to stick to easier courses in the future.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hung his head, figuring that type of response was coming. Josh sat down and thought about it. These past couple days HAVE been interesting. Also despite Luke's ridiculous challenge, he actually came a lot closer to succeeding than he thought he would. Josh shrugged. It wasn't like he wasn't enjoying all of this, but at the very least he felt like he was becoming accustom to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what now?\" Josh asked knowing it was inevitable. \"I feel like I need a break at least.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good with me, dude.\" Luke laughed as he rubbed his stomach. \"I'm hungry again now thanks to puking you up after all. So I guess dinner's on you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could think of worse things.\" Josh shrugged as paying for a meal to be delivered was at least a sufficient price to being puked out by Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Then as champion, I request pizza!\" Luke smiled with happiness as Josh nodded his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveying his credit card number to one of the guys, the group ordered a couple of pizzas and eagerly awaited their arrival. With food in hand and time passing by, Luke felt ready to pester Josh a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel feeding your champion, dude?\" Luke chuckled as he finished the last bite of his pizza and flexed his free arm a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a dream come true, I assure you.\" Josh smiled back finding Luke's arrogance to be amusing as well feeding it to pester Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it is. You had the amazing honor of being trapped in the very place the food you just bought was sent to feed and make me even more awesome.\" Luke smirked, closing his eyes and turning as he flexed both is biceps, much to Josh's amusement. \"But don't worry, I'm merciful god and I'd never leave you down there when you undoubtedly couldn't escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you're a god now? Not a champion?\" Josh chuckled as Tyler started to look more annoyed. Luke simply nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may as well be... I mean...\" Luke started to say before Tyler interrupted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok that's enough dude.\" Tyler spoke up. \"I don't care what you say but I'm...\"            </span></div></div>",

Right, dudes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a bit unfair.\" Matt agreed as he looked at Bobby who nodded his head in agreement. Luke simply sat back and chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, he can try again. I'll even make it super \"easy\" like you guys did. But when he's trapped again it'll prove just how much better I am than you guys.\" Luke smirked arrogantly as Josh looked around, having not agreed to any of this. \"So what, do we wanna give him half an hour again, even with my laying still? Plenty of time, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Tyler simply said, confident Josh could shut Luke up with ease in way less than half an hour. Luke stood up, having finished his food already and figuring he'd wanna get the show on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me some pizza so I can have something to eat after I puke again.\" Luke winked at Matt and Bobby who chuckled slightly, but agreed. \"Yo, Josh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Josh answered, more accustom to Luke calling him \"boss\". \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna make a bet?\" Luke smiled arrogantly as he looked down at the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet he does, dude.\" Tyler spoke for Josh. \"If he wins you have cut your act and treat Josh like he's a god instead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win, I want Josh to come home with me tonight.\" Luke added to the end of Tyler statement. Tyler merely blinked for a second before he was about to vehemently disagree with the terms before Josh spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, works for me.\" Josh said quickly, not really sure what Luke was up to but deciding to go along with it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn't believe Josh would agree to such terms, but didn't really have a chance to take it in as Luke set his hand in front of Josh, allowing the tiny man to climb on and be lifted up to Luke's handsome smirking face. Luke opened his mouth once again as Josh stared into the familiar cavern. It reeked of pizza which didn't seem all the bad since it was still fresh in Luke's system. Josh stood there for a second, expecting Luke to dump him into his mouth before, but instead, Josh found Luke moving his hand to level against his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside, Josh willingly made his way off of Luke's hand and into the massive maw. Luke slowly closed his mouth behind Josh, smirking to himself as he subconsciously made the tiny man walk inside his mouth with out even saying a word. Luke continued to smirk as he refused to swallow Josh, feeling the tiny man squirm about in his mouth. Josh, feeling impatient, slipped his way to the back of Luke's throat. As he neared the very edge, Luke stimulated a swallow in a quick and tiny gulp, barely noticeable to his friends as they watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Matt asked as he looked at Luke who rose an eyebrow at Matt. \"Did you send him down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no dude.\" Luke smiled boastfully. \"He sent himself down. Seemed pretty eager about it too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke rubbed his chest slightly as he let out a quick burp before patting his abs a little. \"He was pretty tasty actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude.\" Tyler crossed his arms impatiently as he pulled out his phone and set a new alarm for half an hour. \"Get on the ground and lay there. You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke put his hands in the air, indicating to Tyler to calm down, as he made his way out to the living room, laying flat on his stomach on the carpet. Resting his face on the ground to the side, Luke started to wait as the other three men cleaned up the food from the table and made their way over to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sloshed his way down into the now familiar cavern. Having just spent half an hour in here not long ago, Josh was mostly relieved to see the chamber was fairly relaxed and unmoving finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a difference... it's actually fairly peaceful in here.\" Josh thought to himself as he watched the walls of Luke's stomach contract and relax, churning its meal causally as the huge man lay still on the floor. Josh closed his eyes, listening to the groans and gurgles of Luke's body as well as his heart beat, pumping blood throughout Luke's massive body in the distance. Josh coughed he reopened his eyes, taking in a deep breath of the cheesy stale air in Luke's stomach quickly reminded him he had a bet to win. Josh cracked his knuckles, figuring this would be a walk in the park with Luke laying still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready to start his climb Josh...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

Looking down, Josh noticed a huge chunk of unchewed pizza that Luke undoubtedly swallowed down whole in his greedy attempt to eat faster. Josh pulled hard on his legs, but the warm cheese held onto his tiny body with extreme ease. Reaching down to try and pull himself free, Josh carefully put his hand into the cheese, immediately regretting the choice as his hand quickly became stuck much like his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Josh yelled as he was too afraid to do anything with his free hand. \"Damn it Luke! Why don't you chew your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to struggle as Luke's stomach groaned in bliss, happily just churning and digesting it's latest meal. Josh looked out into the gigantic organ with a little curiosity. Seemingly despite being stuck on the huge chunk of food, Josh was in relative safety as any potential digestive sludge merely swept up beside the pizza. Taking a very long time to break down the food Luke should have chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do...\" Josh said to himself. Resigning himself to being stuck in the cheese. Josh sat back, letting his butt get stuck now as well as he simply looked around. Figuring he may as well get used to Luke's massive stomach once again, as he'd likely be spending another half an hour within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tapped his foot, constantly looking from his phone, to Luke, then back to his phone. Just a minute remained on Tyler's alarm at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you feel anything?\" Tyler asked impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, for the hundredth time.\" Luke groaned at Tyler's constant pestering. \"I haven't felt a thing the whole time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler bit his lip, in absolute disbelief that Josh still hasn't made it out. Time ticked on however, and Tyler's phone started to buzz, indicating time was finally up. Tyler sighed as he went and got the same pot from earlier, bring it to Luke who looked up at him with an arrogant smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Better get puking! Poor little guy still couldn't handle me!\" Luke smiled, sitting up and leaning over the pot once again. Tyler crossed his arms with a blank look as he watched Luke start vomiting again like earlier. Matt and Bobby still found the whole process laughable, however Tyler sat by and watched silently. Chunks of food poured out of Luke's mouth, and the three men watched as he fished his fingers into the nasty looking sludge. Much like before, a struggling little speck caught Luke's eye as he scooped Josh out into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing out the excess vomit from his hand, Luke looked down at Josh who could finally get to his feet after being trapped for so long. Luke flexed his free arm as he gloated over Josh's second loss. \"That's right, boys! I'm still a god!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sat forward and looked at Josh, disappointed. \"What happened dude? That should've been a easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his face off from excess foul smelling liquids, Josh tried to explain. \"I just...\" Josh panted. \"I got stuck on a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was interrupted by Luke who bolstered over Josh with ease. \"You heard it here! He got stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sat back and rolled his eyes. Annoyed with Luke and disappointed in Josh. Josh looked over at Tyler who looked away from him. A little upset Tyler wouldn't give him the benefit of the doubt, Josh instead turned his attention to Luke, who continued to flex and gloat. \"Yeah Luke. Guess you really are just too awesome for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled, absolutely loving the praise coming from Josh. \"Oh I already knew I was, little man.\" Luke replied with a pompous tone. \"You should simply be grateful for the time you spent inside me and that I'm gracious enough to let you out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I most certainly am!\" Josh chuckled slightly, enjoying playing along with the ego inflated Luke. Josh peeked out of the corner of his eye to see Tyler, still looking away in anger. Suddenly, Josh almost lost his balance as Luke stood up to his full hieght and made his way over to the dining room table, closing and grabbing a box full of pizza and holding it in his free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me and my little worshiper have a bet to keep.\" Luke said with a smirk as he closed Josh into his hand. \"So I'll be taking him and this pizza home with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Have fun.\" Tyler yelled across the room with a bitter tone. \"Don't forget your stupid shirt too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shrugged, forgetting entirely about it. \"Keep it for now as a gift from someone as great as me. I'll pick it up tomorrow when I drop my little follower off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Tyler spat back. \"Bye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby and Matt simply sat in silence, unsure what to say or do as Luke left the room to the front door and Tyler continued to pout. Nothing more was said as Luke left, making his way home with a strong air of confidence about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had to cover his nose a little while curled up in Luke's fist. It reeked of vomit since the huge man didn't really bother to completely clean his palm. Josh mostly forgot what he agreed to when Luke said he had to come home with him. Even then, Josh didn't expect it to happen right away either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what he has in store for me...\" Josh thought to himself as he heard a door open, likely leading to the inside of Luke's apartment. Josh figured he'd have his question answered soon as Luke's hand opened up, giving him a breath of fresh air as he slid off the hand and on to a wooden table top. Josh turned around to see Luke hovering over him before dropping off the box of pizza behind him on the same table. Luke sat down and looked at Josh for a moment, before Josh decided to ask the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you want to take me home with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smirked as he put his hands behind his head and replied...          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Josh opened his mouth for a second, wanting to retort, but started to blush a little in response instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you don't have to say anything. I saw the way you were looking at me.\" Luke responded for Josh as he made his massive pecs bounce up and down a little. \"I can tell just how impressed you are by me, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was pretty impressed at how I couldn't escape you after having such an easy time with the others...\" Josh answered, looking down and feeling a little bashful. Luke smirked at Josh's shyness a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be shy, little fella.\" Luke said, standing up and double flexing his arms as he hovered over Josh with his massive body. \"You don't have to feel shy about worshiping someone as awesome as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh leaned back in awe of Luke's fantastically trained body. Face red, Josh really wasn't sure how he felt about Luke's arrogant side. But a big part of him really did want to break down on his knees and worship the ego driven hunk. \"Luke, you're so incredible I'm at a loss for words...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'l give you a word.\" Luke responded, running his hand down his muscular torso while he looked at Josh. \"Awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...\" Josh repeated to himself as he continued to stare at Luke's godly figure. Josh flinched a little as Luke reached over him, opening up the box of pizza that Josh completely forgot was even there while his attention was so focused on Luke. Josh watched as Luke grabbed one of the still warm pieces of pizza and shoved half of it in his mouth, chewing a little before swallowing it down. Josh stared at Luke's throat as he forced the food down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your god appreciates the tribute you bought for him.\" Luke smiled as he took another bite of the pizza. \"Especially since I had to waste my meal twice to rescue you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to waste your meals, just for me.\" Josh apologized as he lowered his head in response. Luke put up his hand and looked down at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, little one. It's not often you get to be made an offering to a god twice and have him decide to keep you both times.\" Luke answered egotistically before grabbing another piece of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a privilege to be an offering to your massive body, Luke.\" Josh said, with a smile as he recalled taking in his surroundings so vividly while he was trapped the second time. \"It was like a whole other world inside your godly body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine you might have been a little frightened taking it all in.\" Luke grinned as he swallowed another piece of pizza. \"But the second time, you didn't seem too scared... more eager.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he recalled willingly walking in and allowing himself to be eaten by the handsome stud. \"I suppose... doing it a second time felt less scary and more... exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exciting, hmm?\" Luke said with a smile. \"Would you offer yourself to me a third time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's heart raced at the thought of being eaten by the blonde hunk yet again. \"Honestly... yes I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged...\" Luke smirked as he licked his lips, just having finished another piece of pizza. \"But I did just eat again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd feel bad making my god puke up another meal, besides...\" Josh started to say, shaking a little. \"I'd rather permanently be part of that meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you'd truly be offering yourself to me completely?\" Luke smirked even more as he sat down finally to look at Josh. \"Well my little bug...\"      </span></div></div>",

So even though you won't fill me up, the pizza will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to sweat a little at Luke's words. The fact that he was being compared to pizza and even deemed less useful than the pizza excited Josh to no end. When in fact, Luke wasn't wrong. He's bound to get a ton more sustenance from pizza than from Josh's pathetically small body. Luke looked at Josh's little body and had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're too small to be a snack, why not be a topping for the pizza you bought me?\" Luke asked, mostly just feeling hungry for more pizza. Josh's head perked up at the idea, feeling like he might be a smaller part of a bigger meal that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea, Luke!\" Josh replied with excitement. Luke simply crossed his arms and shook his head up and down arrogantly. Josh watched as the tremendous blonde stood up and walked to his kitchen, coming back after a few moments with a bottle of soda as well as a paper plate. Luke reached into the box of pizza once more, grabbing a slice and and setting it on the plate before putting it next to Josh. Uncapping the bottle of soda, Luke took a quick chug of the carbonated liquid as he sad back down in front of Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need something to wash you down with.\" Luke winked at Josh as he set the bottle down on the table. Luke stopped for a second and looked up with a focused expression before expelling a tremendous burp. Luke laughed at his own burp as he patted his stomach, causing Josh to blush once again with excitement. \"Just made room for you too, dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't handle how incredible the situation was as Luke reached down for him, pinching him in between his fingers and dropping him on the pizza with ease. Josh felt the familiar cheesy warmth as his legs started to sink into the cheese once more. This time however, Josh took in his surroundings a bit differently. Just a simple apartment, a little messy and smelling heavily of Luke's musk. Josh closed his eyes as he finished taking it all in, knowing the next place he'd end up would be all too familiar at this point. He looked up at Luke's cocky smile as he went to grab the pizza. Josh felt no fear or nervousness at this point, only anticipation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke licked his lips as he looked down at the piece of pizza, seeing Josh squirm right on the tip. \"Lucky you. Third time and finally you can feed me in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited all day for this at this point.\" Josh replied staring Luke in his perfect green eyes, wanting nothing more than to be devoured and forgotten about by the muscular god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you wait no longer, my tasty little bug.\" Luke said, bringing the pizza and Josh dangerously close to his mouth. \"Next stop, your god's stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke very purposefully and slowly brought his mouth over the tip of the pizza, pulling off just the small section Josh was stuck to. Without chewing as he brought the piece into the center of his mouth, Luke merely sucked on the piece, moving it around casually in his mouth as he savored the taste. Finally, much to Josh's impatience, Luke brought the piece to the back of his mouth, lifting his tongue and forcing the piece of food down his throat. Luke sighed as he reached for his bottle of soda, taking a decent gulp from it as he washed Josh down as he promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slid down Luke's throat quickly in a torrent of soda. Before he could even register the fact that Luke swallowed him, Josh found himself being dumped like common bits of food in Luke's hungry belly. Thanks to the acidity of the soda, Josh found himself mostly free from the cheesy prison that ailed him earlier today. Laughing at the irony that it didn't matter he was free this time, Josh almost wished he was trapped to the pizza like before. It would make the imminent digestion he faced feel like it was happening earlier rather than right now. Shaking his head from the nostalgic feeling, Josh crawled his way away from the pile of food he found himself mixed up in, not wanting to be buried beneath the mounds of food like he learned earlier from his adventures within Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Josh thought to himself in amazement as he thought back to being inside the stomachs of four different friends of his in the past day, all of this starting with simple teasing and an accident from Tyler and Bobby. Josh couldn't believe that by the end of the day he found the idea of being eaten alive so enticing that he actually actually requested it from an ego driven giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore food plummeted into the spacious cavern as Luke's stomach groaned with pleasure, likely already processing food into Luke's small intestine. Josh sat back and watched the walls of Luke's stomach churn and contract, much like he did earlier. It still felt so calm and blissful, even though Josh knew there was going to be no rescue this time. Suddenly, Josh was lurched backward as Luke's stomach walls made a loud smacking noise. Josh was dazed for a second as he imagined Luke was arrogantly slapping his ripped abs, undoubtedly on purpose as a message to how insignificant Josh was within him. A change in pressure followed by a loud and boisterous belch from above confirmed Josh's guess, Luke truly enjoyed his meal, down to even last topping on his pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed with his tremendous burp, Luke continued to rub his stomach a little bit. He couldn't help but smirk to himself, knowing there was no way Josh was getting out. Standing up and throwing out his plate, Luke felt like the biggest most awesome guy alive at the moment. He knew that Josh's only ticket to freedom would be if he was to vomit him up, but he was even happier that the little man wanted nothing more than to stay down and become part of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've just kept him down the first time!\" Luke laughed to himself as he looked down at his gorgeous abs. Standing still for a moment, Luke tried to feel for the little man deep within him. He shrugged though, knowing that if he didn't feel him the first two times why would it be any different the third. Taking another chug of his soda, Luke quickly felt more pressure in his stomach thanks to the carbonation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUURRRRRP!\" Luke bellowed loudly as he walked his way over to his arm chair, sitting down and setting his soda down beside him as he flipped on his tv. \"Whew! Wonder what that was like for him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke thought about it for a second, wondering what the implications of him burping were like on the tiny man. In the end, Luke didn't want to think too hard about it. The cocky blonde simply rubbed his hand on his stomach as he decided he didn't care what the implications were. There was nothing but food in his stomach to him at this point anyway.                           </span></div></div>",

I'd say I did just that, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat back, in a little relief that Luke hadn't completely lost his head in this ego. \"So that's what you were doing the whole time. It was pretty funny, I'll admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You played along so well, boss!\" Luke smiled as he flexed his arm and mocked himself from earlier. \"Bow down to your god, blah blah blah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he bowed his head a little. \"Oh yes my god! Anything for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!

You beat them both at their own game even after they teased you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's head perked up. \"I never really thought about it like that. I guess that does make me feel pretty good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't beat me though, twice!\" Luke winked at Josh with an arrogant smile. Josh rolled his eyes and laughed as Luke nodded his head up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the first time was far from fair!\" Josh admitted. \"And the second time I got stuck on some unchewed piece of pizza sitting in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait really?!\" Luke laughed as he looked down at his chiseled abs. \"That's hilarious, dude! I thought you just stayed down on purpose to make me look good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish!\" Josh chuckled at the handsome blonde. \"Maybe you should learn to chew your food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind next time I eat you, boss!\" Luke teases as he clicked his teeth a few times at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off. I'm not food.\" Josh retorted as Luke shook his head and laughed in disagreement. \"And second, there's not gonna be a next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't be more wrong on both of those things, dude.\" Luke laughed as he rubbed his stomach a little. \"You're small enough to be eaten and have been eaten, what? Four times now? So you're basically considered food in my book, dude. Or should I say in my stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened his mouth to argue before Luke continued on with the second part of his statement. \"And second, of course there's gonna be a next time! I could tell you were starting to enjoy it, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't know how to respond, as it wasn't entirely far from the truth. \"I wouldn't say I ENJOY it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what would you call it, dude.\" Luke laughed as he leaned forward and raised an eyebrow at Josh. \"The second time I ate you, you showed no fear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't afraid.\" Josh answered, turning away and crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah when you on my tongue I didn't taste fear.\" Luke smiled as he licked his lips a little jokingly. \"I tasted excitement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he turned back to Luke and looked at his smug expression. \"Whatever!\" Josh sneered at Luke. \"So it is kind of fun. Sue me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't sue you, dude. Just eat you again if I wanted.\" Luke laughed as he leaned back a little once again. Just then Luke's stomach let out a long angry growl that echoed slightly in the small room. Luke laughed at the ironic timing as he gave his gut a good rub. \"Well now would be a good time actually since I'm running on empty here! That way I wouldn't need to puke up another meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shot up a little shocked. He was not expecting this so soon. Josh stared at Luke for a moment, wanting badly to say agree, despite having already spent a full hour in the godly stomach of the stud already today.

He was just so willing it wasn't as much fun. Just then Luke's stomach erupted in another loud gurgling growl. \"Man, I'm so hungry. I might just have to leave you down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't really want to die...\" Josh sweat a little feeling a bit concerned now for Luke's motives. \"Maybe you should eat a little something first and we can wait til later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to eat you now. Then I'll eat a bit more after that.\" Luke smirked as he reached down for Josh who now out of fear tried to avoid being plucked up by the handsome blonde stud. \"You're so squirmy for my little speck of food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fought now a bit, feeling like Luke must have some how snapped in the past couple minutes. \"I told you! I'm not food, Luke! I'm your friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's stomach roared again almost in response. \"My stomach disagrees. It says you're just food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh yelled and covered his face as Luke held him over his open mouth. Luke carelessly dropped the little man in his cavern like maw, now for the third time. Josh scrambled to his feet trying to find a way not the be easily swallowed down by the giant knowing accomplishing that feat was near impossible. There was nothing. Luke gave him no options as he tilted his head back, letting Josh slide toward the throat. Luke even hung his mouth open slightly as light hit his uvula as Josh watched it hang so gracefully before he slide right under it before he was completely enveloped in darkness now, sealed away inside Luke's warm and moist esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke felt Josh slip out of his mouth as he closed his lips and wiped the briefly. Wanting to continue to taunt Josh and make him squirm, Luke let out a loud \"Mmmmmm\" in satisfaction. Sure enough, Luke felt a little fighting as it slowly was eased down deeper and deeper into his thick chest before disappearing. Luke tapped his stomach lightly with two fingers, hoping Josh had made his way all the way inside him once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as a deafening squelch deposited him now for the third time in the blonde hunk's massive stomach. Josh scrambled in fear as things felt so much more terrifying this time though. His skin already started to itch, the empty stomach was desperate to digest anything as it churned and moaned angrily. Luke's stomach erupted into another loud growl, Josh had to cover his ears and kneel to the fleshy floor now though. They seemed loud from the outside, but the inside was it's own separate monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke!!\" Josh cried out in confusion and anger. \"Why!? What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly from above him, Josh yelled as a large chunk of pizza plopped right next tom him. Josh couldn't believe it. Luke really was eating on top of him. Josh scrambled onto the pizza, figuring it was a little safer there than his current position. Josh itched his skin again as he watched the walls of Luke's stomach contract and relax, churning and mixing as it didn't care about Josh's fear. It just wanted him broken down and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man he's probably freaking out!\" Luke laughed as he swallowed down the rest of one piece of pizza. He figured one piece was fine to give up for the greater good of his joke, knowing he still had the rest of the pizza for after he puked Josh up again. \"I hope this'll show him not to be so willing in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke gently patted his stomach and gave a light burp, hoping to scare Josh even further before he stood up and stretched. Figuring it was about time to get Josh out, Luke made his way over to his kitchen sink and cracked his fingered and neck as he knew the drill by now, sticking his finger into his mouth.

It didn't take long since there wasn't much in his stomach, but in the first little chunks Luke saw a little squirming speck emerge from the partially digested pizza and bile. Luke scooped him with a smirk and gently rinsed him off using the faucet. After, Luke brought Josh back out onto the table and set him down on a napkin as he reached for a piece of pizza. Stuffing the pizza in his mouth, Luke looked down at Josh with an arrogant smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on don't be mad.\" Luke taunted Josh. \"I was only messing with you. No worse than what Tyler does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, it was the truth. He couldn't really be mad. \"Yeah I'm not mad. It was just kind of scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it any more scary than the  like ten other times you were eaten?\" Luke laughed as he shoved another piece of pizza in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were gonna leave me down there...\" Josh said softly. Luke merely started laughing again as he started choking on the pizza he was eating. Swallowing it down with a mighty gulp and patting his chest, Luke continued to laugh a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my buddy, Josh.\" Luke smiled. \"I wouldn't do that to you, not unless you pissed me off of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard that one before.\" Josh said to himself as the line reminded him of Tyler. Luke stopped eating for a second and leaned toward Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, buddy?\" Luke asked as he bit into more pizza. \"Maybe I'd hear you better from on this pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just sound like Tyler, that's all.\" Josh laughed, lightening up a little. Luke put a hand on his chest, looking offended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I resent that, Josh!\" Luke swallowed his food. \"I'm not like that egotistical dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes, considering he was exactly like that egotistical dummy. \"Alright Luke, if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right!\" Luke smiled, his mouth full of food. \"Man I feel a lot better now with some actual food in my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh actual food? I thought I was food, huh?\" Josh teased as Luke swallowed down his last piece of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, let's do this again, buddy!\" Luke looked down at Josh while rubbing his chest. \"I thought you'd learn from being a willing little snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. Now I'm just the one giving you a hard time, buddy.\" Josh mocked Luke, laughing as the man blushed a little. Luke walked over looming above Josh for a moment before he leaned in close to him, burping chunks of pizza on top of the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man that was a nice rip.\" Luke complimented himself. \"Bet that smells familiar to you, huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wiped his face, looking up at Luke's spectacular body. Despite the danger Luke just put him in not long ago, Josh couldn't help but to continue fantasizing about being deep behind Luke's thick abs. Trying to shake the thought, Josh figured if he pushed his luck too many times he's bound to get burned one of these times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes very familiar. I kind of like it.\" Josh said as Luke laughed and walked away shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not learn anything?\" Luke laughed at Josh. \"I mean I like eating you, but you seem to like it a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking you to eat me.\" Josh laughed at Luke. \"I just said I liked the smell of your burp. If anything you should be making fun of me for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke rose a finger to retort but stopped and lowered it as Josh continued to taunt him. \"If anything you're thinking about it more than I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Luke answered with a smile. \"It is kind of a shame I can't keep you down though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for you!\" Josh answered a little shocked. \"I don't wanna die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said it was a shame! Not that desperately wanted to against your will.\" Luke defended himself. \"Trust me buddy I don't want you to die either. I really feel like aside from Matt and maybe a few of the other guys, you two are my best friends at the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww..\" Josh said quietly as Luke did have a soft side he found very cute. \"I feel like I'm really close to you too Luke. I feel like I get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do, dude.\" Luke smiled. \"We could be closer though. Like in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" Josh laughed sarcastically. \"I guess it is a shame it's so dangerous. Otherwise I'd spend more time down there for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we came up with something to make it safer?\" Luke asked now curious about the options they might have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm I guess there's the old tying me to piece of rope so you don't have to throw up?\" Josh offered thinking of clique giant eating tiny type things from cartoons. \"Maybe if I was in a capsule or something that was hard to digest? Or if you just took an antacid like Tums, that would ease up the acid in your stomach and make it safer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Luke chuckled. \"Either you've been thinking a lot about this or you're just a smart dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe both?\" Josh asked as Luke shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be too smart if he's trying to end up in here?\" Luke asked as he patted his solid abs with a smirk. Josh rolled his eyes, thinking perhaps it wasn't too smart after all, but his adventurous side was definitely taking over. \"Either way what's the plan little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Josh thought about the ideas he presented. \"We should at least use string regardless of what we do. I'd feel bad if you puked again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're out of luck if it involves puking.\" Luke rubbed his throat. \"My throat kinda hurts. Plus I wanna keep my meal, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case why don't we tie me up to a string and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Seems like the least invasive way to go about it?\" Josh asked as Luke shrugged his shoulders in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great but I don't have any tums. I have Tylenol?\" Luke asked as Josh shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close to the same thing.\" Josh shook his head in laughter. \"I know there's some in the break room at the park. Plus I can stop and get my phone in case there's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a solid plan.\" Luke shrugged. \"Should I go out like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at Luke who ditched his shirt at Josh's house and was simply standing there in his green running shorts. \"I mean I guess throw on a shirt if you want.\" Josh said hoping that he'd decide against covering up. \"I mean I think you're fine the way you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine the way I am?\" Luke taunted Josh. \"Yeah I guess you're right, I don't really need a shirt huh? Plus it's still early... and sunny out. Shit I get pretty sweaty too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah it is...\" Josh stuttered. \"So if you decided it wasn't worth sweating through a shirt then... yeah it's fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah not worth it huh.\" Luke bounced his pecs a little as he reached down for Josh, easily scooping him up in his hand. \"Hey I've got an idea. You don't really want to ride in my hand right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a little sweaty I guess...\" Josh answered sheepishly as he looked up at Luke's beautiful body. Suddenly, Luke lifted Josh up to his face before dropping him in his mouth. Closing it behind him and smirking, Luke felt Josh squirm about in there before he burped with his mouth remaining mostly closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you're just riding in there!\" Luke laughed as he hung his mouth open a little, wondering if Josh was panicking a little about being in Luke's sexy mouth once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwished around Josh panicked a little, but he figured Luke wasn't going to just swallow him without warning. For once while inside the man's mouth... Josh felt safe. Josh couldn't possibly gain any kind of balance inside the man's mouth though. At the very least, Josh felt like it was a descent chance to look around. As Luke walked away and out of his apartment Josh couldn't help but admire every nook and cranny of Luke's cavernous mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke made his way from his apartment to Shrink and Swim, Luke...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he had an amazing body but he never tried to show it off too much, until now. Strutting out into the outside, Luke smiled as a group of girls walked past him whispering and giggling as he made his way past them. Nearly forgetting he had Josh in his mouth, Luke halted the temptation to stop and talk as he took a long way to Shrink and Swim, knowing from his apartment he could easily take a short route to the water park. Luke swished his mouth a little in an arrogant smile knowing his little friend was likely enjoying it inside his hot mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy... we're taking the long way.\" Luke smirked as he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slide and swished around in Luke's mouth. It was hard to tell where he was but Josh tried to hold his head, hoping that he could keep his bearings long enough for them to make it to the park. Not that Josh was complaining. Luke's burp still lingered inside his massive mouth. Josh hoped he could just sit back and relax as Luke strode his way slowly to the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I could almost get used to this...\" As Josh found himself drenched in Luke's hot saliva. He could feel his skin wrinkle up a bit but really Josh didn't care. He was happy just spending time inside the hot blonde muscular stud's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke continued to smile behind his his dark sunglasses as countless girls and a few guys checked him out as he walked along the boardwalk. Sure he was one of the shortest guys at Shrink and Swim but in public... he may was well be a sexy giant. Luke's grin widened as a guy stopped and slapped him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice gains bro!\" The guy shouted as Luke's ego grew a little. A few girls stopped clad in bikinis, giggling and wishing they could spend a couple of seconds to even speak to the drop dead gorgeous blonde man. Luke smiled as the girls came up to him. He bounced his pecs a little absentmindedly as he swallowed his tiny friend in his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How we doing ladies...\" Luke asked as the cute girls giggled and hoped they'd spend even a moment with the muscular hunk. Letting his hormones get the best of him however, Luke forgot entirely about the man he called one of his best friends that was slowly being pulled deep into his ripped body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as he was drug quickly down Luke's throat. It wasn't like it was an unfamiliar trip at this point, but Josh wasn't entirely sure that Luke meant to do it. Josh squirmed, hoping his muscular friend would somehow realize his mistake as he fell deeper and deeper until he was deposited for the fourth time into the hunky blondes stomach. Josh shivered as he landed in a pile of digested mush, smelling of pizza and crust hoping that this was all some stupid joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke!\" Josh cried out in the stomach. \"We forgot the string! I know you wanted to eat me but we had to wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing came in response. Not even a pat of the stomach or a burp. None of Luke's tell tale signs of fucking with Josh played out. Josh sat back, hoping there was something Luke would do to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am all natural, ladies.\" Luke gloated as the huge breasted beach goers gloated over his immense muscles. \"You wanna touch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies caressed Luke's massive muscles as he smirked like crazy, loving all the attention before he gave the girls a fake number and promising to call them. Walking away Luke had trouble remembering what he was doing. Having thought for a minute, Luke remembered as he found a speck in his mouth, likely just a random food particle but Luke believed it to be Josh. Continuing he extremely slow walk to the water park, Luke continued to smirk as he was stopped by women and men alike, admiring his amazing physique.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hope for Josh. Consciousnesses started to fade as Luke continued to stride along. Absentmindedly burping believed Josh to be inside his mouth, Luke unknowingly deprived Josh of any necessary oxygen he required to keep alive. Nothing could save Josh as he exhaustively fell off his his mount of cheesy pizza landing deep in the pit of Luke's stomach. Screaming in pain, Josh landed in a pit of acid. It was too much for the tiny man as he screamed in pain before slowly fading from life as Luke's stomach acid slowly ripped apart his feeble body. With his last scream of help, Josh teared up as he believed Luke to truly be one of his best friends. For the man to forget about him so easily broke Josh down. He didn't care he was dying. If anything he was supplying the blonde hunk with a tiny shred of protein. Gone, Josh faded from existence as Luke continued to smirked, believing Josh to be safely in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to the park, Luke believed Josh was still in his mouth. Burping again with his mouth closed, Luke smiled as he opened the door to the break room. Reaching into his mouth, Luke pulled out the speck only to be disappointed by the fact that when he pulled it out, it was merely a piece of cheese. Searching his mouth, Luke was puzzled as he believed Josh to be in his his huge mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh...?\" Luke asked as he ran a finger though his mouth. Luke tried to think... but he couldn't think of anything. \"I must've swallowed him...\" He believed as he reached into his throat hoping to save his little friend. Little did he know, it was already too late. Luke got his wish, he got to keep Josh down, the true shame was that he wasn't even aware that he swallowed his \"best friend\" before he was gone forever. Giving up, Luke rubbed his gut. He felt bad, but at the same time, he couldn't help but smirk, knowing he did get what what he wanted in the end. </span></div></div>",

Josh watched as the enormous blonde reached in and pulled the phone out of his pocket and held it up to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, dude! What's good?\" Luke answered casually as Josh began to wonder who it was. Luke looked at Josh and smiled as he continued his conversation. \"Yeah dude, he's fine. He's with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to guess who it was, wondering if Tyler mellowed out or not. Josh shook his head, figuring it wasn't the case as he continued to listen to Luke's conversation. \"Yo, you should just come over, dude.\" Luke said to whoever was on the phone. \"Alright, dude. I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it Tyler?\" Josh asked, curious if his best friend was worried about him. Luke laughed for a second before he put his phone back in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding, dude? Nah it was Matt.\" Luke answered still chuckling at the thought of Tyler calling him right now. \"I'm sure Ty is still moping like a baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right...\" Josh sighed, a little disappointed. Luke crossed his arms as he looked at Josh's little form droop slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok dude. You can chill with Matt and Me.\" Luke smiled, trying to cheer up Josh a little. \"We can be just as good of buddies to you as Bobby and Tyler, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Josh asked, already liking both Matt and Luke a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you and Ty are so tight, then we found out you had Bobby who you were tight with too.\" Luke started to say. \"Well we wanna be tight too, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he never knew Luke and Matt wanted to be closer to him in the first place. \"Don't worry, Luke. You, me and Matt are already tight. I love you guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! Dude!\" Luke smiled as he reached forward and scooped Josh up suddenly and brought him into his gigantic chest for the biggest hug Josh has ever gotten. Josh squirmed a little as Luke pressed him between his massive pecs and held him still with his hand in extreme ease. Josh struggled for a moment before he heard Luke's door open and saw Matt appear, wearing his tank top from earlier and holding Luke's shirt. Josh reached a hand out in a call for help as Matt saw Luke hugging Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.\" Matt started to say as Luke looked at him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, the boss just told me he loved us!\" Luke said happily as Matt dropped Luke's shirt and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! Boss!\" Matt replied, coming and joining in on the group hug, crushing Josh between both Matt and Luke's chests now. Josh squirmed even more as he found it very difficult to breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" Josh huffed. \"I'll love you even more if you don't crush me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Luke looked at each other with goofy grins as they separated, leaving Josh gasping for air in Luke's palm. The two men laughed a little as Josh got to his feet. \"T-thanks, guys.\" Josh caught his breath as he turned and looked at Matt. \"How are Tyler and Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby's fine. He told me not to worry about Ty. He was still upset, but he figured that he could calm him down eventually.\" Matt chuckled as he thought about Tyler complaining like a child before looking at Luke. \"You sure got under his skin, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Luke laughed as he rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand. \"He deserves it after all he put through Josh through the past couple days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Matt asked as Luke and Josh looked at each other before explaining everything once again to Matt. Matt simply crossed his arms and smiled. \"Well,dude. At least you get a little break from them! Luke and I won't tease you! Not as badly anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, knowing the two goofy blondes were capable of being just as bad as Tyler sometimes, but was glad to have a break from Tyler himself none the less. Josh nearly jumped though as Luke's stomach erupted a second time with a hungry growl. Luke laughed as he rubbed his stomach with his free hand. \"Ha I forgot how hungry I was!\" Luke chuckled as he looked down at Josh. \"Probably shouldn't eat you now, dude. My stomach would tear you up in a second!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered slightly at the comment, not wanting to know what it would be like to be \"torn up\" in someone's stomach. Meanwhile, Matt just looked at Luke confused. \"You were gonna eat him again, dude?\" Matt questioned. \"Shouldn't you, like give him a break, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am now, dude!\" Luke laughed as he walked over to the dining room table and let Josh back down on the surface before reaching over for the box of pizza he set down earlier. Josh watched as Luke opened it up and greedily stuffed his face, barely chewing as he swallowed the food down in a massive hurry. Luke laughed as he realized he still didn't chew the pizza this time. \"Sorry dude, forgot to chew my food again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well based off what you said earlier, I should consider that a good thing.\" Josh smiled as Luke shoved more food in his mouth, forcing it down with a mighty gulp. Josh and Matt laughed as the handsome blonde started to get the hiccups, lurching every couple of seconds before he went to his kitchen to chug a bottle of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to slow down, dude.\" Matt laughed as Luke rubbed his chest, hoping his hiccups would go away. Luke merely shook his head as he grabbed another piece of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude. Hic! I have to eat fast so we, hic! Can do something fun!\" Luke sputtered as he quickly consumed another piece of pizza. Matt rolled his eyes as he looked over at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the boss would much rather just chill and play video games or something with his bros, right?\" Matt asked Josh who's head perked up at the idea of just relaxing for a change. Luke shook his head in disagreement however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! He wants to have fun and do something, hic! Exciting!\" Luke spoke out excitedly as he looked down at Josh with a smile. Josh pondered for a moment. He had a clue what Luke may mean by \"exciting\" but he wasn't so sure if he was up for it now or not, especially since Matt was here now, he wasn't sure what the two would come up with. However, with how the pace of the day had been going, Josh wasn't entirely sure he wanted to just sit between the two studs and watch them play video games either. Deciding to speak up and choose before Luke could choose for him, Josh decided that they should...        </span></div></div>",

The huge blonde shrugged his shoulders, figuring they could always do something more fun later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude.\" Luke responded, rubbing his chest as he realized his hiccups had gone away. Josh looked up at the handsome giant as he reached down for him, scooping him up in his slightly greasy hands. Josh rode along in Luke's hand as he and Matt made their way to his couch, sitting down in front of the tv. Matt and Luke sat next to one another as Luke dropped Josh off, right between the two stud's huge butts. Looking to his right and left, Josh saw nothing but the two men's asses all the way up to theirs sides and they both looked down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men grabbed a pair of controllers Luke had laying about as they turned on Luke's console and looked at each other trying to decide on what game they should play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play the snowboarding one dude.\" Matt asked as he grabbed it from Luke's pile of games beside him. Luke laughed as they put in the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with you and snowboarding, dude?\" Luke asked, with an amused smile as they started up the game. Matt shrugged his shoulders as they picked their characters and started to play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, dude. I've just surfed and lived in warm places my whole life. I've never even seen snow, but it seems like it'd be like surfing, just with snow instead of water.\" Matt tried to explain as he glanced down at Josh, who just sat back trying to get comfortable between the two behemoths. \"Boss, you ever seen snow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at Matt, surprised he was being asked questions while they played their game. \"I used to live in a pretty cold climate. We got snow a lot, I always hated it actually. But I suppose it has been a long time since I've had to deal with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's eyebrows rose a little as he started to think a little. Josh looked at the man briefly before he turned his attention back to the game. Josh quickly looked back to Matt as he responded. \"Oh so you don't like snow, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" Josh simply said as he continued to watch. \"It's just a hassle to deal with on the roads or shoveling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that makes sense dude.\" Matt responded after finishing another race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat in relative silence for a little while as they played the game. Josh enjoyed the down time as he would occasionally look over at Luke who's butt cheeks would clench every once in a while while playing. Josh chuckled as Luke finally leaned back and set his controller down on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, all this snowboarding and snow talk has been giving me ideas.\" Luke finally said with a smile. Josh and Matt looked at him as he explained his thoughts. \"Josh is small enough where he could have his own little winter for the first time in a long time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Matt asked, curiosity perked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he said he didn't really like dealing with snow, but what if that snow was made of chocolate?\" Luke asked Josh, raising his hands and putting on a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ice cream?\" Josh answered immediately. Luke looked disappointed that Josh stole his thunder so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what about a snow cone instead?\" Matt asked. \"It'd be more actually snowy than ice cream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but ice cream is tastier.\" Luke said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you wouldn't be eating it if I was in it.\" Josh said, tilting his head as Luke simply smiled at him. \"Oh god damn it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you can just go with Matt's snow cone idea instead, dude. I don't really feel like a snow cone.\" Luke said with a laugh as he rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well in that case-\" Josh started to say before Matt interrupted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could go for one, if that what the boss is into.\" Matt said with a eager grin, not wanting to miss out on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes, glad to see being eaten in a frosty treat was what he was \"in to\".

He's just gonna tell the big dork how the only one he can't escape from is me.\" Luke smiled arrogantly as he spoke to Bobby and Matt. Luke started laughing at his own comment a little as Josh found himself being unceremoniously scooped up by Tyler's massive hand. Josh looked up at Tyler's flustered face as they left the room, Luke's laughter echoing slightly as the two talked in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's seriously pissing me off. You're pissing me off a little too.\" Tyler spoke bluntly to Josh. Josh sighed a little as he tried to explain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, be honest, have you ever seen Luke act like this?\" Josh questioned Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Tyler responded, looking slightly confused. \"It's really weird actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's funny. That's why I've been playing a long.\" Josh revealed, hoping to rationalize his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Tyler answered, rubbing his side a little with his free hand. \"I didn't realize you were playing along because you thought it was funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Josh laughed at Tyler's slightly stunned expression. \"Did you really think I was giving into this silly god complex of his? It's just funny seeing someone act like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I just feel stupid, dude.\" Tyler said, closing his eyes and putting his hand on his chin in thought. \"What are we supposed to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I kinda just re-challenged you, dude.\" Tyler answered, raising his eyebrow slightly. \"I don't wanna look stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Josh wallowed, knowing Tyler's pride meant more for the thick headed jock more than whatever Josh could ever want. \"I guess we're gonna have to go through with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Tyler answered suspiciously as he rubbed the back of his head. \"So do you think you could lose on purpose too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Josh blinked as he looked up at Tyler's handsome face. \"Is this another stupid pride thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah dude.\" Tyler smiled. \"I can't let Luke be the only one to gloat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he thought about it. With how childish the whole situation was, Josh decided that...         </span></div></div>",

Josh shook his head, curious about one thing though still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by not letting Luke be the only one to gloat, by the way?\" Josh asked, knowing how easily Tyler lets things get to his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dude.\" Tyler laughed a little. \"Just that the whole point is so that I can gloat just as hard as he is, if not harder!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, figuring that was the case. \"Whatever, maybe you'll be funny too then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always funny!\" Tyler laughed as he walked back into the living room, carrying Josh and chuckling slightly. Luke's head pooped up as he saw Tyler re-enter. Matt and Bobby also turned as Luke yelled out to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, bro?\" Luke asked with an arrogant smirk as he took a sip from his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dude. Josh was just saying how easy it's gonna be to beat me.\" Tyler responded, finally playing along with Luke. \"He was saying how you're the only one who could possibly keep him down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh shit dude!\" Luke laughed loudly as he looked at Josh, who was simply looking around in slight confusion trying to figure out what was happening. \"That's hilarious! I never knew Josh was such a shit talker!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked as he finally realized what was going on and tried to come up with something. \"Uh, yeah! Ty's not gonna be able to hold me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men blinked for a second, stunned by how bad the shit talking came from Josh directly before Luke jumped to Josh's defense. \"Yeah you tell him little guy! I'm the only one fit to be your god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" Tyler smirked as he looked down at Josh with confidence. Josh jumped a little as Tyler quickly lifted him up to his smiling lips. Josh bit his lip as he looked at Tyler's mouth, his perfect white teeth starting to bare as he opened his mouth slightly. \"Alright buddy, you got half an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh found himself being tilted against his will into Tyler's opening maw. Unable to stop himself even a little bit, Josh slid easily out of Tyler's hand and into his massive cavernous mouth. With a splat, Josh landed in a pool of sticky saliva somewhere near the middle of the gigantic tongue. Josh wiped his face off as he looked out into the light one last time before Tyler closed his mouth shut, smiling as he did so. Josh shivered in the darkness, knowing all too well at this point exactly what was going to happen to him next. Closing his eyes and waiting for the inevitable, Josh knew not to get to comfortable as he scenery was quickly going to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tilted his head back, still continuing to smirk as he felt his tiny friend slide to the back of his throat before he gave a tiny gulp, barely doing anything as Josh slipped down out of his mouth down on his trip toward his massive stomach. Tyler chuckled as he put his hand on his chest. \"He didn't even squirm or nothing. He knew he couldn't fight me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed as he stood up to look at Tyler, as he was finally finished eating all his food. \"Nah dude, he's just confident! He knew he doesn't need to put up a fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say dude.\" Tyler smirked as he traced Josh down with his hand before his fingers rested on his deeply toned abs. \"I'm confident he's gonna be stuck right here for the next thirty minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, dude. If you keep standing around like that I'd agree with you.\" Luke chuckled. \"Not unless he's gonna claw out of your throat at that steep of an angle, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took his hand off his stomach as he shrugged and made his way into the living room and knelt down to the ground before slowly lowering himself to the ground, laying flat on his stomach as the rest of his friends gathered around him and took a seat to enjoy the show. Luke pulled out his phone and checked the time, setting an alarm for thirty minutes from now. Tyler rested his head, looking at Bobby and winking at his friend as Bobby nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt disgusted as he slopped his way through mounds of half chewed partially digested food as Tyler's movements finally settled down. Having adjusted to the darkness of quite a number of his friend's bodies in the past day and a half, Josh actually felt comfortable as he traversed the somewhat familiar landscape of Tyler's groaning and gurgling belly. Figuring the best place to go to stay safe would be up, Josh started to scale a nearby mound of food as he worked his way to safety, further away from the foamy sizzling acids deep in the pit of his friend's hungry stomach. Tyler's stomach churned and contracted as it gave off a soft moan, squelching fluids from Tyler's gut to be processed in his small intestines. Josh simply sat still, crossing his arms in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I agreed to just sitting down here like a piece of meat...\" Josh mumbled as he closed his eyes, listening to Tyler's distant heartbeat as well as the constant flexing of the nearby stomach walls. \"I guess it's not so bad though... it is Tyler after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to try and relax. He knew he was in good hands with his best friend. \"Well I guess in a good stomach, in this case.\" Josh chuckled to himself as he laid back, patiently waiting for half an hour to pass. \"This is actually kinda nice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke tapped his phone impatiently as it finally started to ring, indicating that thirty minutes had passed. Tyler looked over as he heard the sound of Luke's alarm, smirking as he sat up and looked down at his stomach. \"Well well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised, dude.\" Luke said, admitting defeat. \"Guess we better grab that pot for you to puke him up in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke got up and grabbed the pot from earlier, setting in from of Tyler as the three sat back and watched as the bronzed hunk stuck his fingers down his throat, triggering his gag reflex and causing him to spew chunks of vomit up into the metal pot. It didn't take long before Tyler noticed a tiny struggling speck among the carnage in the pot. Scooping it up and wiping his hand mostly clean, Tyler showed that Josh was indeed safe in his hand once more. Josh shook his body clean of any remaining goop as he looked from Tyler to Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I couldn't do it...\" Josh tried to lie, hoping to make Tyler look good, just wanting everything to go to plan. Luke looked down at Josh for a moment. Josh stared back at the handsome blonde awkwardly in the eye for a moment before Luke finally said...         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby simply looked at Matt, tilting his head a little. \"The protein thing would get him excited. Not me dude. I hate bugs.\" Matt explained, knowing Bobby didn't know him or Luke very well yet. Bobby watched as Matt started to push the plate away from him. \"I dunno if I want this anymore, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could pick it out at least. It's so small I doubt it really did any harm.\" Bobby tried to at least get Matt to clear his plate, figuring he could figure out what to do with Josh later.

But hey, you didn't seem bothered. More protein right, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, dude!\" Bobby smiled, wondering if he could some how keep eating while avoiding Josh struggling away in his food. Bobby deliberately spin his fork in an area away from Josh before putting more food in his mouth and looking up as Matt stared at him with a rose eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna give me a hard time, but go that far out of your way, dude?\" Matt laughed, commenting on Bobby's deliberate actions. Bobby swallowed down the food with a tremendous gulp as Matt yawned. \"It's ok if you think it's gross, dude. You can pussy out like I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby's stomach dropped a little. He definitely didn't like to be called a pussy or back down from anything. Looking down at Josh struggle, Bobby figured this would be ok. After all he did accidentally eat Josh yesterday and he was fine. Plus he got deliberately eaten by Tyler and made it out. Bobby moved his fork under Josh, scooping him up on one of the prongs and brought him up to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this wasn't the plan, but should be fun for him regardless.\" Bobby thought to himself as he slowly brought to fork into his mouth, closing his lips and pulling the fork back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as he was easily deposited in Bobby's enormous mouth. He knew Bobby saw him, plus he understood the events leading to this. But what he didn't understand was what was Bobby's next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to swallow me instead?\" Josh wondered out loud as he looked around Bobby's cavernous mouth. It reeked of soda and spaghetti sauce as Bobby's tongue was easily able to position Josh about in the huge mouth, moving him further back to the very edge of the throat. Josh couldn't help but watch in awe as Bobby's massive uvula twitched and dangled about before he was sent on a quick drop downward in a deafening gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross, dude.\" Matt winced a little. \"I was only teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. well too late now, bro.\" Bobby smiled as he took a sip of his soda. he did feel a little bad doing that to Josh, but he knew he was safe for now. He trusted himself far more than anybody else after all. A few minutes passed as the men finished their food and Bobby convinced Matt to maybe go outside and relax. As they made their way out, the two men...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They asked him to join them for a quick round of basketball.\" Bobby replied as he lowered his phone from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard they've been getting Ty to play basketball with them a lot lately actually. I wonder how long they'll be?\" Josh questioned aloud. Bobby merely shrugged as he set his phone down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it depends on what they play till. Probably like an hour I'd guess.\" Bobby estimated. \"What can you tell me about Blake and Markus? They chill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second for the best way to describe the two men. Out of all the guys at the park, the two of them certainly gave off the most intimidating presence when it came to their massive heights. \"They're both really tall. Markus more so than Blake though. Blake might be just a little taller than you. How tall are you now? I remember you and Ty used to be the same height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sitting about 6'7\" since college and may still be growing, dude.\" Bobby smiled, impressed with himself that he grew in the past couple of years, where as Tyler had not. Josh shook his head, as he guessed Bobby must've been about that tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so you guys should be close. Blake measured at 6'7\" on the nose when I hired him. Markus was about 6'9\" though last I checked.\" Josh thought to himself, putting a hand on his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that's tall dude. No wonder they're into basketball.\" Bobby smiled, wondering to himself if after he's gotten to know the guys if he could join in himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure about Blake, but Markus played basketball in high school and football actually.\" Josh continued to think as he was reminded of how Markus went to the same high school as Josh, although Markus was a year behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh were you guys buddies in high school?\" Bobby asked, curious now the the prospects of high school sports were brought up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we didn't really know each other. He was a year behind me, also I was more of a nerd than an athlete.\" Josh reminisced as Bobby laughed a little. \"But we get along great nowadays! He's always happy to sit back and joke about old teachers and stuff from back then with me. He's a good guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear, bro! Sounds like I'll like him a lot too! What's he look like besides apparently monstrously tall?\" Bobby chuckled as all he had to go off of so far was height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, let's see.\" Josh thought for a moment. \"He's black, he's got brown eyes and dark short hair. He's got some really cool tattoos across his chest that fan out on the front of his shoulders. Oh, he collects hats just like you do! So he's always got a wide array of hats.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dude! I love this guy already!\" Bobby smiled before stopping to think for a second. \"You haven't said much about what Blake is like though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well Blake...\" Josh closed his eyes for a second as Blake was a little different. \"He's really quiet. Like doesn't speak very often unless it's important.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so he's just shy?\" Bobby asked, scratching his brow a little in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Josh tried to think. \"No he's not shy. He's not like introverted or anything. He just doesn't like to talk much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand, bro.\" Bobby smiled, glad he just sounds like a nice guy, despite not being the talkative type. \"What's he look like, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got curly black hair and brown eyes, kind of lightly tanned skinned.\" Josh started to explain. \"He's pretty well built too. I think he'd give you a run for your money actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it!\" Bobby laughed as he did a double bicep flex, causing his already tight shirt to stretch even more to it's limit before lowering his arms and chuckling. \"Not that it's a competition or anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuure.\" Josh smirked as he knew how competitive some of these guys get when it comes to who has the best build. \"Well, now what do we do till they get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno dude. I don't think it's gonna be very long.\" Bobby replied looking at his phone. \"They said they're on their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Josh replied, shocked at how fast time flew by as he gave explanations and told stories about the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude. Sounds like they were playing 3v3 with a couple of other buddies and needed Tyler to round out the teams. Guess they just finished.\" Bobby answered, scrolling through the rest of the text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's cool. I didn't know they had that many people for their basketball group.\" Josh pondered as Bobby finished reading the text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude.\" Bobby smiled. \"Also sounds like...\"          </span></div></div>",

Bobby opened up the text and read off the names in the message. \"Andres, Mason and Xavier?\" Bobby answered as he looked at Josh, who seemed confused. \"Oh he says you don't know them, but they're cool so he invited them over too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shifted a little uncomfortably, not sure how he felt about having three strangers come in his house on top of already having Markus and Blake. Seven people seemed like a lot, but Josh knew now that Tyler invited them there wasn't much he could do besides suck it up and deal with it. \"Ok...\" Josh mumbled. \"I'm sure they'll be fine. A friend of Tyler's is a friend of mine I'm sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt he was giving much of a choice anyway, bro.\" Bobby chuckled as he put away his phone. \"You know how he is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... trust me I know.\" Josh wallowed a little as he heard a bit of ruckus coming from his front door. Josh looked at the door with anticipation before he found himself being scooped up by Bobby before being placed on the top of the red hat he was wearing. Josh held onto the button on top of the cap, using it as a vantage point as he looked to see his front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamiliar and new voices alike echoed through the door way as it swung open, Tyler leading the group as Josh saw he was now wearing a white bodybuilder's tank top, a backwards bright orange hat, as well as black shorts and shoes with bright orange highlights on both of them He also held two large bags, smelling greatly of tacos and burritos. Behind Tyler strode in the familiar faces of Markus and Blake, of which Bobby was able to identify the two men easily based off Josh's descriptions. Bobby moved forward, figuring it was time for introductions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Bobby!\" Tyler smiled. \"Let's get you introduced to the gang!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, dudes.\" Bobby said as Markus moved forward first. Bobby looked at the taller man, his dark skin dripping slightly with sweat as he wore a grey tight spandex shirt, showing his impressively strong body as well his each of the curves in his abs. He wore a similar looking red hat to Bobby's which made him smile slightly at their similar interest in collecting. He also sported a pair of black shorts, that barely made it to his kneecaps and a pair of grayish shoes with a Nike symbol across the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! I'm Markus, dude. Ty's told us a lot about you!\" Markus said, shaking Bobby's hand and patting him on the back with a smile. \"It's good to meet you, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, man!\" Bobby grinned as Blake was the next person to introduce himself. Wearing, a black sweatband and a black tight tank top as well as red shorts and red shoes, Blake simply extended his hand, to which Bobby shook as Blake pulled him a little for a bro hug. \"You're Blake, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply nodded, a slight smile on his face as he and Markus moved aside, revealing the group of three people who Josh finally peered over Bobby's cap for a better look. Josh gasped as he caught his first glimpse of the three new handsome men making their way into his home. First he saw one of them men come forward. He looked to be the shortest of the three but still rivaling at about Tyler's height. He was a young Hispanic man, Josh guessed to be only about 19. He had dark spiky hair and deep brown eyes on his handsome smiling face. A small amount of scruff littered his chin and along his jaw as Josh examined him further. Dripping in sweat, he had a sweat stained white tee shirt that clung tightly to his obviously very muscular frame. He wore a pair of cut off sweatpants made to shorts with the strings hanging out casually across his crotch as well as a white pair of new looking running shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, man! I'm Andres.\" The young man smiled as he reached in for Bobby's hand. Bobby shook his hand with a smile as the next man moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh peered at this massive man. He was practically the same hieght as Markus, if not even taller. He was black, and had a neatly trimmed scruffy beard covering his chin and lips. His dark hair was hidden under a black do-rag but his mature face and dreamy brown eyes were more than easily visible. Josh was in awe of his amazing physique. He was completely shirtless, with sweat gleaming on his thickly muscled body. Josh couldn't begin to comprehend how he achieved such an amazing physique. He also wore tight black shorts and white shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup. I'm Xavier.\" The huge hunk said in a deep tone as Bobby returned a hand shake, before looking at the last man who had yet to introduce himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh examined the last man. He was also fairly tall, just under Xavier and Markus's height. He was a young looking mulatto guy with a shaved head and a wide smile. Josh couldn't help but blush as the huge man have an attractive smile as he approached Bobby. Looking from his smile, to his light brown eyes, Josh trailed off looking at his more lean build as he wore a tight green spandex shirt, showing off his impressive chest and lean abs. Rounding out his outfit with black shorts and green shoes, Josh couldn't but stop and stare at the handsome man for a second before he introduced himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved the best for last dude! I'm Mason!\" He smiled widely with a pleasant and attractive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good meeting all of you dudes. How was basketball?\" Bobby asked as he had all six men finally in the house before shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We swapped up teams for a change today.\" Tyler groaned a little as he went to set the bags down on the table Josh and Bobby were sitting at not long ago. \"Markus, Blake, and Xavier are never allowed on one team together again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, dude!\" Markus laughed, slapping Tyler on his back and turning to smile at Xavier and Blake. \"Just because we crushed you guys doesn't mean you have to be so salty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not salty!\" Tyler complained as Xavier Put a hand on Markus's shoulder and laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was the first time we swapped it up, man.\" Andres said trying to console Tyler a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you guys been playing together, dudes?\" Bobby asked, curiously as the men motioned a little closer to the bag of food, getting impatiently hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple months.\" Mason replied. \"We kept running into each other at the court until Tyler came marching over and challenged us to 3v3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad he did though. Way more interesting than just shooting around half court.\" Xavier smiled, also trying to lighten Tyler's mood a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is way more fun, huh?\" Tyler perked up as he pulled out all the boxes of tacos. Tyler looked at the table, seeing it only really accommodates six people. \"Hmm where are we all gonna eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty wanna help drag a chair in from outside, or something?\" Bobby asked, wanting to get Tyler alone for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure dude.\" Tyler responded simply as the made their way to the back to go outside. Tyler went to grab a chair from Josh's patio as Bobby stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Bobby asked directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan?\" Tyler asked, confused. Bobby laughed, finding it funny how quickly Tyler forgot. before he pointed to Josh on the top of his hat. \"Ohhh yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these people are gonna make him kind of hard to keep track of. I was just thinking we just take him out of hiding and have him meet the group.\" Bobby proposed, unsure how anything could work with so many people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude!\" Tyler smiled. \"This just even better. I mean think about it. We were gonna bait Josh to either Blake or Markus, right? But Xavier, Mason, and Andres are all total strangers to Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up at Tyler's hat at Josh with a smile. \"If anything's a true challenge, its this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby thought for a second about how he promised not to let Josh be in any danger they couldn't handle. But he also felt like Tyler's words did hold some weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, dude... we should...\" Bobby started to say...                      <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's just go with my plan, dude.\" Bobby said, looking at Tyler somewhat seriously. \"He was saying to me earlier how he was nervous of us losing track of him and I have to agree with him with this many people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed a deep breath of relief. It was always a welcome change in pace for his friends to actually listen to his concerns after all. From the top of Bobby's hat, Josh looked at Tyler who looked a little disappointed, but merely shrugged it off. \"Fine, I'm sure the guys will enjoy meeting Josh like this instead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed nervously, haven't thinking about the fact that he was not only going to be forced into meeting three strangers, but also that he's going to be the center of attention for seven massive giants now. Josh braced himself as Bobby started to move, following Tyler back inside as they carried the spare chair in. Making their way back into the living room Josh saw the the five other men had seated themselves at the table, already digging through the massive boxes of tacos and unwrapping them hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that extra chair!\" Tyler said, pulling it next to Andres and making room for himself as he sat down while Bobby went to the spare chair across the table between Xavier and Markus. \"See you guys already started digging in! Bobby and I better catch up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched from a top Bobby's hat as the seven men tore through the boxes of food like they were nothing more than a few snacks. He couldn't believe it as he watched each of them practically inhale the food until there was nothing short of a few crumbs and left over sauce packets remaining. A few minutes passed and Josh watched as they gathered up the remaining wrappers and tossing them in the bags. Having thrown away the trash, the seven men sat back, stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dudes.\" Tyler broke the silence. \"Now that we're done eating, you guys should meet someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh someone else?\" Andres asked, a little confused, thinking he's already met Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we weren't gonna show him off at first. But Josh, the dude who owns this house, has actually been with us the whole time.\" Bobby smiled, looking from Markus to Xavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's tiny.\" Blake spoke up as Tyler nodded to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Tyler laughed. \"He's been a teeny tiny little shrimp this whole time you guys have been here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused.\" Mason spoke up. \"Is he like hiding under the table or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dude, he means like really small.\" Markus laughed. \"I forget how small he said the shrinking thing made people. He told me in my interview...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1/4th of an inch.\" Blake spoke up again. Once again Tyler nodded at Blake's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right again, dude.\" Tyler smiled, reaching over to Blake and giving him a quick fist bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1/4th of an inch? Shrinking thing? What are you dudes talking about?\" Xavier puzzled along with Andres and Mason. Bobby simply reached on top of his hat, feeling Josh's tiny body between his fingers as he plucked him off and brought him down to the table. Finally in plain view of everyone, Josh's heart stopped as all eyes were on him. To his left the unfamiliar and intimidating form of Xavier loomed over him like a giant muscular mountain. At the end of the table to his right, Mason squinted at Josh with unfamiliar curiosity. Finally, from across the table directly across from Bobby and next to Tyler, Andres's eyes looked down at Josh with a bewildered gaze, trying to figure out what he was looking at exactly. Josh could barely move, let alone speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, boss?\" Markus asked, unable to really see Josh's terrified state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" Xavier asked, looking at Josh and chuckling before looking at Markus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's the owner of the park we all work at.\" Tyler smiled at Josh with confidence. \"And he invented the whole shrink thingy that works as the park's gimmick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of that place!\" Andres smiled at Josh, making his heart beat a little more normally as a result. \"I had no idea the people really shrunk though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" Josh barely muffled nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely hear him.\" Xavier commented, being one of the people closest to Josh. \"Can you speak up a little, tiny dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.\" Josh spoke a little louder. \"I just wasn't expecting to meet anyone new today. Or have this many people in my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Xavier, dude. You're Josh?\" Xavier said in his deep voice, leaning in a little closer to Josh. \"So you're not always this small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Xavier...\" Josh said, still very nervous. \"And no, this was Tyler's idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My idea, but you still agreed to it!\" Tyler smirked, leaning back and putting his hands behind his head. Josh smiled a little before the next of the giants wanted to make his acquaintance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mason, although you probably knew that if you've been on Bobby's hat this whole time.\" Mason spoke up as Josh turned to see him at the end of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's still nice to meet you as well.\" Josh replied, feeling a little more confident. Finally Josh looked across from him at Andres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Andres, dude. Nice meeting you, little guy!\" Andres said with a smile as Josh smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice meeting you too, Andres.\" Josh answered, glad introductions were out of the way. Josh jumped a little as Xavier's deep voice swept over him again from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is kind of neat, dude. We must look so huge.\" Xavier said as he leaned forward to look closer at Josh. Josh flinched backwards instinctively, nervous about the huge man's approach. \"Whoa, sorry. Didn't mean to freak you out, little guy. Don't worry I'm not gonna crush you or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but he might eat you!\" Tyler laughed, still leaning back with a smug expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Dude, don't say that!\" Xavier defended himself. \"He seems freaked out enough already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's not a big deal.\" Tyler shrugged. \"I mean, I've done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done what?\" Markus asked, now slightly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ate him.\" Bobby answered for Tyler. \"So have I actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a joke?\" Markus continued with a look of even more confusion on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, bro. I mean I did it by accident, but..\" Bobby started to say before Tyler interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I did it on purpose!\" Tyler smiled as he lowered his arms and sat forward. Aside from Bobby and Josh, everyone else looked at Tyler still thinking it was a joke. Tyler looked from person to person with a raised eyebrow. \"What? Obviously he got out and he's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Josh spoke up, attention now being refocused on him. \"Bobby was an accident and I'm lucky to be alive, but Tyler...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He made a bet with me that he could get me to puke him out.\" Tyler smirked before brushing his chest. \"Which, ended up badly for him as he had to claw his way out himself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's badass!\" Mason chimed in with a hearty grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we said too, dude!\" Tyler chuckled, glad to see the guys were starting to join in agreement. \"We actually want to make a sport out of it, dudes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sport?\" Xavier asked looking down at Josh. \"I guess I have to give you more credit, little guy. That's a dangerous sport you're playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys wanna try?\" Tyler asked, feeling excited to see his friend eaten by someone else this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier, Andres, Mason and even Blake and Markus looked at one another. Xavier spoke up for the group saying...         </span></div></div>",

Sounds like it'd be a lot to put someone through.\" Xavier said, leaning back and crossing his arms before turning and looking at his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Xav's right. Being eaten alive sounds sort of terrifying.\" Mason agreed as he bit his lip. Josh sighed a deep sigh of relief as they each shook their heads in agreement. He couldn't believe the strangers he was so nervous of were actually the one's coming to his rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you guys wanna do instead?\" Tyler asked, feeling a little disappointed. Xavier simply leaned back and rubbed his tremendous bare abs a little with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, bro. But I'm so full I just wanna sit here and digest my meal a bit first.\" Xavier smirked as he let out a deep rumbling belch. Josh nearly fell to his knees from the sudden eruption of gas while the others merely laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, point taken dude!\" Tyler laughed, always one to appreciate a good burp. \"Then let's just chill I guess for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna know more about you guys!\" Josh chimed in looking at his three new acquaintances. Andres laughed, finding the sudden interest amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna know, my man?\" Andres asked, lowering his arms onto the table and resting his chin to get a better view of Josh. Josh thought for a moment before answering to the handsome faced man looking right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do you three know each other?\" Josh asked, hoping for an origin story of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy, dude.\" Mason answered instead. \"We were all in the same grade. We actually all graduated last year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so you're all a year out of high school?\" Josh asked shocked that Mason and Xavier were so young, but less surprised about Andres. \"How old are all of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andres and I are both 19.\" Mason smiled widely. \"Our little boy over there though is still only 18 though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Xavier, staring up at the sheer cliff of massive muscle leading to his mature looking face and annoyed looking eyes. \"Call me little boy again, Mason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really only 18?\" Josh asked as Xavier's eyes darted from Mason to himself. Josh's heart stopped for a moment as he expression took a moment to change from annoyed to a more neutral look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude. I hear this pretty much on a daily basis.\" Xavier sighed, feeling bad about his massive height and mature looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking more mature isn't a bad thing. Everyone always thinks I'm really young. It makes it harder to be taken seriously.\" Josh confided in the massive muscular teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too be fair it's hard to take a talking speck seriously.\" Xavier chuckled gruffly, making Josh's head drop a little before he noticed. \"But I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem if you were normal sized, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Josh smiled back up, appreciating the sentiment. \"So you guys went to school around here? Do you live with your parents still?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though I guess you could say we're mooching off Xav's dad a little.\" Andres laughed, crossing his arms and looking at Xavier. \"He let's us live in a little vacation condo he bought by the beach awhile back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically anything to be out of his hair.\" Xavier added as Josh turned his gaze from Andres back to Xavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you three live together too? You must be pretty close.\" Josh smiled, thinking about the fact that Bobby just moved in with him and how close they are as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're like brothers we never had to each other, bro!\" Mason fist pumped as he looked at his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brothers or not our parents are all getting fed up with our shit though.\" Xavier sighed, feeling more serious now that family was being talked about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Josh asked, feeling like the three young men seemed pretty responsible for their age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we can't get jobs. I blame the shitty job market, bro.\" Mason fumed a little in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Josh asked curiously. \"You guys can work for me if you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just like that?\" Andres asked, a little suspicious. \"Seems too good to be true dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the park just expanded. I'm in need of as many new lifeguards as I can get.\" Josh tried to explain himself. \"Besides, you guys seem responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I accept.\" Xavier responded right away without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not.\" Mason shrugged with a smile. The two looked at Andres who looked back and fourth between the two with a dumb grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh. If you guys do it so will I.\" Andres finally answered  with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! The crew expands even more!\" Tyler yelled excitedly as he looked about at his friends turned future co-workers. Tyler sprang to his feet giving his gut a good slap before giving off an obnoxiously loud burp. \"Well, I'm all rested! What are we gonna do with he rest of our day guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm good too.\" Xavier agreed, standing up and stretching his long torso a bit. \"It's nice out we should do something outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe for Josh outside?\" Mason asked, also getting to his feet while also looking down at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine, we just have to keep an eye on him.\" Tyler reassured the group as they started brainstorming ideas. \"Josh has a pretty killer pool. We could take a dip. I'm still pretty sweaty, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven doesn't work for basketball so I guess that's out.\" Markus offered as an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey technically there's eight of us!\" Andres laughed, looking at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah let's get the little guy on the court and see if he can block me.\" Xavier joked as he loomed what seemed like miles above Josh even as he stood on the table let alone the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd rather just watch in that case...\" Josh sweating a little, not wanting to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could still do 3v3 and just have one of us sit with Josh so he doesn't get picked up by a bug or something.\" Bobby offered as an idea, kind of just wanting to play basketball with his new buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone wants my opinion I'd rather just take it easy.\" Josh tried to suggest. \"There's a lot to do if I'm going to get these three registered to work with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group thought for a moment, before the majority decided on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               </span></div></div>",

With a fairly unanimous vote Tyler saw that the group seemed interested in his idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, bro.\" Mason answered, despite being interested in taking a dip. \"I don't have any shorts for swimming or nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not really a problem.\" Josh piped up. \"I've got a whole box of board shorts up stairs for new lifeguards. You all may as well grab a pair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's this box? I'll grab it.\" Tyler offered with a helpful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Bobby's room. I was just keep them in there as spares.\" Josh explained before looking at the rest of the guys. \"You wouldn't believe how confused delivery people get when they have to bring something to the park. So I just have some stuff shipped to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, that's actually pretty hilarious. I never thought about that.\" Markus chuckled as he stood up and stretched a little as Tyler made his way out of the room and up the stairs. A few moments later, Tyler reappeared with the box in his arms, setting it down on the table with a tremendous quake, knocking Josh off his feet in the process. Getting up, Josh looked around, glad everyone was more focused on the box than on him falling on his ass. Josh looked and saw as each of the men grabbed a pair, some of which already starting to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to change in here, dude?\" Bobby chuckled as he looked at Tyler, pulling down his shorts and showing his tight spandex before pulling up his new shorts and tossing off his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I ain't shy!\" Tyler retorted, now having finished changing and readjusting his hat. The rest of the guys shrugged, and started changing in a similar fashion on the spot. Josh did his very best not to stare as the many good looking men around started pulling down their shorts and peeling off their shirts. Having all mostly finished, Josh looked around him seeing all the men organizing their clothes and dropping them off on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we grab a couple drinks before we go out?\" Blake asked, politely to Josh. Not wanting to just rudely raid his refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh absolutely, please help yourself.\" Josh smiled at Blake, happy to see he was considerate enough to ask. Josh watched as all the men left the room to walk into the kitchen. Josh simply stood there for a second before processing the fact that he was just abandoned. \"Hey! Aren't you guys forgetting me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down, crossing his legs and resting his hands on his lap, surprised that they all just left him in unison. Meanwhile, the seven men made their way into the kitchen, Tyler leading the group as he opened the refrigerator. Pulling out bottles of Gatorade and a few sodas, Tyler started handing them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just water for me, dude.\" Xavier said, turning away one of the drinks and getting a red solo cup and filling it up instead. Andres and Mason did the same, feeling like they didn't know Josh well enough yet to raid his fridge so badly. Quickly draining and refilling their waters, Mason started to look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we forget Josh?\" Mason asked with a chuckle as he looked at Bobby and Tyler, unsure if either of them grabbed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops.\" Bobby laughed, forgetting completely that he had been the one transporting Josh around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of you newbies should grab him!\" Tyler smiled, taking a sip from his drink and looking at Mason, Xavier and Andres. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\" Andres replied eagerly as he set his cup down and left the room, making his way back to the dining table. Looking around, Andres looked at the spot Josh was in before, seeing he moved slightly nearer to Bobby's shirt that he set on the table. Andres made his way around, looking down at Josh with a grin. \"Sorry my man! Guess we got too eager and forgot to grab you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at Andres. Now shirtless only clad in his new red board shorts, Josh got a good view of his huge muscular body. With enormous pecs and sculpted abs with a slight collection of dark hair on his lower stomach, Josh couldn't believe how well trained his body looked, despite the fact that he had such a young looking face.  Josh blushed, as he had only moved slightly to look at Bobby's black shirt, noticing just how huge it was and wanting a better look. \"Oh it's ok, I'm glad you came back for me, Andres.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to, dude!\" Andres grinned as he rubbed his chin a little. \"So how does this work? Do I like pinch you between my fingers or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably easiest for you to just lay your hand down for now.\" Josh offered an alternative, knowing that some guys have trouble gauging their strength. Following orders, Andres lowered his hand next to Josh, allowing the tiny man to climb aboard the huge palm safely. Josh found himself being lifted very quickly until stopping suddenly at just about bellybutton height of Andres. Josh stared up at the practically sky scraper sized wall of muscle next to him as Andres walked the two back into the kitchen. Josh looked around, seeing Tyler was the only one left waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\" Tyler said in a mocking tone. \"See we didn't forget you, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Josh shrugged. \"Just don't forget me after you guys all are done swimming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, that kind sucks for you, huh man?\" Andres asked Josh. \"I forgot you wouldn't exactly be able to come in the pool with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should just make him his own little pool.\" Tyler chuckled, grabbing another red solo cup and wagging it in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's a cool idea, dude!\" Andres replied with a smile, glad to see there was a way for Josh to be included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I had a different idea.\" Josh offered as an alternative. \"Why don't you, Markus, and Blake all train the rest of the guys with some lifeguarding basics now, that way when the park re-opens they'll be one step ahead of the game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will we get paid?\" Tyler asked, rubbing his chin. Josh rolled his eyes, figuring it was good enough they were using his pool after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll add it on to your checks at the end of the week as long as you take it seriously.\" Josh sighed, feeling like it wasn't so bad since he would have had to pay them to train the newbies anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Andres?\" Tyler asked as the handsome young man jumped a little paying attention now. \"We'll let you decide what to do. Be the tie breaker, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well uhhh....\" Andres thought for a second as he wasn't fully paying attention to the options. \"Let's do...\"            </span></div></div>",

Andres looked at the two cups however, noticing a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few of us have those little red cups though. Shouldn't we like... mark Josh's or something?\" Andres asked, questioning himself and wondering how exactly they should do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've got an idea, dude!\" Tyler said excitedly as he opened up one of Josh's drawers, pulling out a little pink drink umbrella and sticking it in Josh's cup. \"I saw these yesterday while I was looking for snacks. There, now it's like a little tropical pool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome, dude!\" Andres smiled as he looked down into the little cup, now complete with an umbrella. Looking around, Andres noticed a little jar filled with tiny dry macaronis. Opening it with his free hand and dropping a single little elbow macaroni into the water, he grinned at his idea. \"Now with a pool floaty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, bro!\" Tyler compliment Andres, giving him a pat on the back. Andres smiled as he looked at Tyler, lifting his hand up to the cup and letting Josh slide off into the pool. Josh plummeted into the water, slightly upset he was never given any choice in this whole matter. Josh tread a little water as he made his way to the little piece of macaroni. It was just the right size for him to get on top of and float just like a noodle in a pool. Josh looked up, seeing the shade from the umbrella as well as the slightly obscured faces of Andres and Tyler. The view didn't last for long however as Tyler grabbed the cup as well as his own drink and he and Andres made their way outside to join the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held onto the noodle tightly as the short trip ended abruptly as he found himself being placed down outside. Josh looked up to see not only the pink umbrella but a real large one above him as well. \"I guess I'm on the patio table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Andres set their drinks down with the others as well as Josh's cup on the patio table. Eager to join the guys in the pool, they left without really checking on Josh aside from a quick glace, figuring he was fine in the cup on his own for now. Standing by the side of the pool, the two were greeted by the rest of the men by splashes and taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, dudes!\" Markus yelled as he splashed a huge wave up at Tyler and Andres. Tyler wasted no time before diving right in, making a huge cannon ball and soaking everyone's faces. Resurfacing and retrieving his hat, Tyler laughed as Andres jumped in, making not nearly as dramatic of a splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh ok?\" Bobby asked, coming up beside Tyler and looking around. Tyler nodded with a little chuckle as he pointed over at table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! He's having his own private pool party!\" Tyler said, noting that there was four red solo cups and not just three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Xavier, Mason. Don't drink the red cup with the pink umbrella in it.\" Andres said to his two buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do. It would be funny.\" Tyler winked, laughing a little to himself at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid.\" Josh sulked as he pressed his face into the wet noodle. \"I didn't ask for this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, trying to make the best of the situation. Trying to relax, Josh jumped a little as slight breeze rushed by and tugged lightly on the little umbrella, lifting it very slightly out of the cup. Josh looked up, watching the umbrella cautiously. The breeze subsided and the umbrella sunk it's way back down into the cup. Josh let go of his held breath, slightly relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later however...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Josh gasped as it left his view before toppling over and making a sudden \"plunk\" noise in the cup right next to his. Wishing the water was high enough to see out of the cup, Josh wondered what had happened to the umbrella. Paddling to the edge of the water, Josh put his hands on the slick wall, realizing very quickly that it was much to wet to climb. Josh looked up the wall, hoping that someone would notice the umbrella had changed places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Josh heard the sounds of wet feet stamping their way over to the table. Unable to see over the side, Josh started to wonder who exactly was making their over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which cup was mine again?\" Xavier thought to himself silently as he looked down at the four red cups, one of which sported a pink umbrella sticking awkwardly out of it. \"Well its not the umbrella one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Xavier decided on the cup next to the umbrella up. Figuring it didn't really matter, he huge man held the cup and turned to watch the rest of the guys in the pool, now swimming laps to see who could swim the fastest. Xavier chuckled and shook his head at their endurance as he lifted the cup up to his enormous lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xavi--!\" Josh was cut off as he tried screaming at the top of his lungs at the massive giant before the water shifted, sending him under in a weak gurgle. Josh resurfaced, panting as he realized he was some how thankfully still in the cup. Josh looked up, seeing Xavier stare off at the pool, blissfully unaware he was holding Josh in the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X--!!\" Josh could barely get a syllable out before Xavier tilted the cup again, sending back again beneath a torrent of water heading right into the huge hunk's open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier casually sipped at the water for a few minutes, taking periodic breaks as he watched the mayhem ensue in the pool. Taking one last chug of the water, Xavier emptied the cup into his mouth, setting it back down on the table as he finished. Swallowing the last bit down. Sighing, the young teen didn't really feel like rejoining the others at the moment. Noticing a lounge chair was set out near the table, Xavier head over and took a seat, laying down and putting his hands behind his head with his eyes closed. Enjoying the heat of the sun as it dried him off, Xavier was none the wiser that Josh was...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Unable to stop himself, Josh continued forward with the current of water, dreading what was coming next. Having experienced this twice already with both Bobby and Tyler, Josh couldn't believe it was happening a third time now with someone he just met. Josh felt like Xavier's esophagus went on for days as the absolutely gigantic teen was even bigger than either of the two men who ate him before. Josh was both relieved and terrified as he came to a stop momentarily before being deposited in the giant's awe inducingly huge stomach. Josh rubbed his face and covered his nose as the new massive chamber positively reeked of half mostly digested taco meat. Josh cried hoping some how someway he could find his way not to be directly in the middle of the dangerous digestive sludge sloshing and churning in Xavier's stomach. As if by some sort of miracle, Josh bumped into the same noodle he was floating on just moments ago. Climbing aboard the noodle, Josh gripped tight to the pasta feeling slightly better that the tiny piece of macaroni was able to join him down into the giant's hungry gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xavier! Tyler! Anyone!\" Josh called out into the darkness of the organ. Josh lowered his head on the noodle. Knowing nobody heard him and that Xavier had absolutely no idea he was here at all. Clutching tight to the noodle, Josh just shut his eyes hoping for another miracle, this time one big enough to save his life. For now, Josh's only comfort were the periodic groans and churns of Xavier's stomach as it processed the remainder of his lunch. Unaware of Josh's terror of being digested along with that meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier stretched a little as the guys started calming down in the pool. Opening one eye, he saw that Tyler was looking at him. Getting out of the pool Tyler came over with a smile and made his way to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup dude?\" Xavier asked, sitting up as Tyler stopped to look down at him. Tyler panted a little, dripping with water from the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" Tyler started to say...          </span></div></div>",

Tyler simply took a finger and poked at Xavier's massive abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a little squirt kicking around in there.\" Tyler chuckled as Xavier looked down at his abs.

I did?\" Xavier said, looking in the umbrella cup as well as every other red solo cup, unable to locate Josh. \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well either that or he climbed out of one of these cups.\" Tyler guessed. \"But he's so scrawny I doubt he could pull that off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude.\" Xavier said, believing Tyler. \"Guess I better puke him up then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already, dude?\" Tyler chuckled, patting Xavier's stomach. \"It's only been like what? Five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't wanna leave him in there too long.\" Xavier frowned looking down at his abs again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't!\" Tyler assured him. \"But we may as well have a little fun with him while we can, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier laughed a little as he looked away from his stomach. \"Yeah you make a fair point dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Tyler winked as he motioned for Xavier to come inside with him. \"Let's go inside where we can have a little peace, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men went inside, making their way into the kitchen as Tyler started going through some drawers. Xavier watched puzzled for a moment once again. \"What are you looking for dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw it earlier...\" Tyler said as he rummaged though a few drawers. \"Aha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned to show Xavier what he found revealing it to be a... </span></div></div>",

Tyler moved his face in close to Xavier's abs as he spoke to the wall of muscle. \"Hello? Anybody in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard Tyler's voice come from the other side of the massive slimy walls of Xavier's stomach. He couldn't believe they figured out he was eaten. \"Yes I'm in here!\" Josh yelled, before realizing once again there was no way Tyler could hear him on the other side. \"God, not like the dummy can hear me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dummy?\" Tyler's voice answered back, much to Josh's surprise. \"Well fine, you can just stay in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't!\" Josh yelled back. \"How are you hearing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found one of those heart thingies in your drawer!\" Tyler's muffled voice called out to Josh once more. \"So how do you like it in there? Not as cool as my stomach, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's way cooler. Your's smelt like puke, Ty.\" Josh teased, sarcastically. Xavier's stomach shifted violently after a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, punch your own stomach.\" Xavier complained after Tyler gave his gut a quick jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude.\" Tyler said as he stood up away from Xavier's abs. \"He was being a dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could really hear him in there?\" Xavier asked, putting a hand on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you wanna talk to him?\" Tyler asked offering the stethoscope to him. \"Apparently he loves it in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier put the ear tips in his ears as he rested the diaphragm roughly where Tyler had it. \"Yo, Josh can you hear me, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard the different voice of Xavier addressing him this time. \"Yeah I hear you, can you hear me now instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I got the things in my ears now.\" Xavier's voice said from far up above Josh's position. \"Sorry he got mad and punched me in the stomach, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I'm fine down here.\" Josh smiled, having it feel a little surreal to be talking to the person who's stomach he was inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, dude. It's good to hear you like it in there!\" Xavier's voice called down to him. Josh rose an eyebrow, unsure where he got the idea he actually liked it down here. \"I was worried you were gonna be pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is the third time I've had to deal with this.\" Josh explained. \"Guess I'm getting used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can stay in there as long as you want, little buddy.\" Xavier's deep voice said to Josh deep in the colossal stomach. \"I just don't wanna accidentally digest you or whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I don't want that either.\" Josh shuttered, not wanting to even think about being in the digestive sack long enough to be dissolved with the rest of the contents. \"But I'm safe for now, so I don't think it's a big deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude.\" Xavier's voice said plainly without any kind of follow up. Josh stopped for a second, expecting the giant to say more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, I think I'm ready to get out of here.\" Josh said out into the stomach. A few seconds went by with no reply. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier took the diaphragm off his stomach and pulled the earbuds out as he looked at Tyler. Tyler spoke up after a second. \"Well, what's up, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he's fine for now.\" Xavier responded as he held the stethoscope. \"Guess he likes it in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go figure.\" Tyler chuckled, feeling like it was ironic after all the teasing he and Bobby had done to him. \"I guess leave him be in there, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll check on him in a few minutes then.\" Xavier said with a smirk, feeling kind of powerful now that some tiny guy was actually enjoying basically being part of his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you two have fun then.\" Tyler said shortly as he made his way to the back door. \"I'm gonna go back to the pool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I should probably stay here and take it easy.\" Xavier said as Tyler simply waved on his way out the door. Xavier made his way into the living room, finding a nice comfy chair to sit down in as he held the stethoscope in his hand and looked down at his rippling abs. Taking the stethoscope and pressing it against his stomach, Xavier was ready to check on Josh.

I think I better get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bro. Hold tight.\" Xavier answered before everything went quiet for a moment. Josh shifted around the massive gut a little for a second while all was quiet before some heavy heaving started from up above. Contents of Xavier's stomach started rising and spewing up out of the sphincter as Josh found himself part of the vomity mess being forced up and outward as he was spat horrendously out of Xavier's mouth into a metal sink below. Head spinning, Josh looked up after a moment, seeing the huge man look through his upchuck for the tiny man he was just communicating with on the other side of his abs just a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, dude.\" Xavier smiled as he scooped Josh out of his vomit, happy to see his little stomach friend made it out safe and sound. \"That was like something out of a cartoon, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again!\" Josh laughed, regaining his senses as he sat covered in muck in Xavier's hand. \"Feels like my life has been as ridiculous as a cartoon the past couple days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey at least it's interesting, bro.\" He responded, making his way back into the living room, this time laying on his back sprawled out on Josh's sofa. Xavier tilted his hand, letting Josh off and sliding him onto his bare abs. \"Ah gross, got a little puke on my abs, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm covered in it.\" Josh chuckled, wiping as much off of himself as he could as he stood on the solid muscle. Xavier flexed his abs slightly as he laid and watched Josh with a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how you were just inside these abs, dude.\" He said, poking the other side of his abs with two fingers softly as Josh watched from his vantage point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like scary. At least at first.\" Josh clarified, not wanting to make Xavier feel bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess if Ty hadn't seen that I drank you then you would've been pretty fucked, dude.\" Xavier smiled, taking his hand and putting it behind his head, showing off his dark hairs in his sweaty pit. \"It'll be less scary next time though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Josh said plainly as he started down Xavier's amazing body, looking between his ruggedly handsome face and hairy pit. Josh was surprised at how comfortable Xavier acted around him considering he didn't have any experience with a tiny person until now today. \"So how do you like the whole being a giant compared to someone thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about that, dude.\" Xavier answered with a bright smile. \"It's really different than just being taller than someone. Obviously I'm pretty used to that. But being literally giant compared to you... it just feels really cool. I could get used to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long as you keep in mind that I'm still human!\" Josh chuckled nervously, not wanting to be mistaken as a bug by the massive teen. \"Even despite our sizes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say something bug?\" Xavier answered with silly grin on his face. \"I'm just messin' bro. I won't forget. Besides were buddies now right? I look after my buddies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's reassuring!\" Josh smiled, getting a little comfortable as he sat down on the solid muscle and continued staring across his magnificent body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like being tiny?\" Xavier asked, feeling like it was his turn for a question. \"I remember you were saying Tyler brought up the idea and you agreed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's hard to deny.\" Josh shrugged, feeling honest with the titan. \"I wouldn't have agreed if I didn't like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man we are like total opposites, dude.\" Xavier chuckled, causing Josh to stumble on his back. \"I'd hate to be in your place right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually really exciting for me!\" Josh smiled. \"Normally I don't get to just sit and relax with one of you giant guys like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we don't have to do nothing, bro.\" Xavier winked attractively. \"You can feel free to explore if you want too, dude. I ain't going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun!\" Josh smiled, feeling like it would be a good way to connect with Xavier a little more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm like a giant playground, bro!\" Xavier chuckled again as he looked down at his body. Leaning his head back and putting both his hands behind his head, Xavier stretched out, allowing Josh to go pretty much where he pleased. Standing up, Josh looked across the massive landscape once again. Between the valley of rolling abs and two massive twin peaks that were his pecs, Xavier seemed more like a country side than a simple playground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you realize how big you are. You're more like a nation park than a playground!\" Josh laughed as Xavier perked his head up with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Xavier Nation Park is ready for your tour!\" He smirked. \"Plenty of natural wonders to explore, bro. Where you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go to...\" Josh pondered as he looked across his body...         </span></div></div>",

A straight shot between Abdominal Hills before making it to the twin peaks of Mount Pectorals.\" Xavier smiled, also having a fun time naming the parts of his body like he really was a massive work of nature. Xavier peeked down at his abs, watching the tiny man slowly walk his way past his first row of abs, and gradually making it past the second and third. \"It's crazy bro. I can see you making your way across me but I swear I can't feel you at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your skin just isn't very sensitive to touch.\" Josh offered as an explanation. \"Or maybe I really am just too small to feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, bro.\" Xavier answered as he watched Josh trail off under his right pec, making his way around the tall round muscle toward his exposed armpit. Trying to look over his pec, Xavier couldn't really see Josh anymore. \"Now my chest is in the way. I can't see or feel you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm almost there!\" Josh said, rounding the huge mountain side of the pec before reaching the somewhat flat section leading up the Xavier's armpit. The smell of sweat grew stronger and stronger as Josh approached the hairy pit, but he didn't care. After spending so much time in stomachs reeking of vomit and digesting food, a little sweaty pit seemed like almost nothing. Josh approached the open arm as he was finally back within eye shot of Xavier. Josh waved, now just a few feet away from the thick black hairs as the glistened with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are, dude.\" Xavier smirked. \"Looks like you made it to the Pit Forest. It's pretty thickly wooded in there. Try not to get lost, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be alright. I feel like the park is watching over me if I did get lost.\" Josh smiled as Xavier chuckled a little, watching as Josh disappeared into his underarm. Laying still, he actually felt a slight tickle of movement in his arm pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pushed his ways through the smooth hairs. They were incredibly soft, yet very thick at the same time. Wet with sweat and residual pool water, it actually made it fairly easily to slide through. The smell was absolutely intoxicating. It was so bad with the smell of sweat, Josh was unsure if he loved it or hated it. It stung his nose but at the same time Josh didn't want to stop smelling it. Josh moved onward, having no idea if he was near the edge of the thick hairs or stranded somewhere in the middle. They were so much taller than him, Josh could only imagine Xavier's face looking at him right now. Josh didn't care. He sunk into the hairs and relaxed. Suddenly, Josh heard monumental shifting from above him as the slight bits of light he got went completely out, and the air around the hairs started to grow thin, while the musk of Xavier's sweat grew stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just close me in his pit?\" Josh wondered as he took a moment to adjust to the shift in light and the change in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier closed his pit tight as he sat up, getting off the couch before speaking to his closed arm. \"Sorry dude, I just wanna get up and grab a drink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth dry from vomiting Josh up earlier, Xavier was desperate to wash the taste of throw up out of his mouth and quench his thirst a little. Making his way to the kitchen with his right arm closed tight to keep Josh inside, Xavier grabbed a cup and filled it with water using his left hand only. Downing the liquid quickly before refilling it again and carrying it back to the living room, Xavier was eager to resume his position, wanting to know where or what Josh would do next. Setting his cup on a coffee table in front of the sofa, Xavier scratched under his left arm pit for a second and smelled his finger tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Must be like a thousand times worse for him though.\" He remarked to himself. Getting ready to lay down and check on Josh, Xavier...                 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keeping his arm shut, Xavier lowered himself into the same position he laid in before, then slowly opened his arm. Sticking briefly from the coats of sweat, Xavier exposed his armpit to the world once again and looked down in the mess of tangled hairs for movement. Sticking his finger in his hairs, he tried to locate Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok dude?\" Xavier asked to his pit as he fished around for Josh. To his surprise he did feel something. It was a like a tiny grain of sand as he pushed it out of his armpit, toward the edge of the forest of hairs before he saw he had in fact fished Josh out. Xavier chuckled as he saw the tiny man squirm a little before regaining his bearings and looking at Xavier's handsome face. \"Sorry for trapping you like that, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" Josh responded, his head still spinning slightly. \"I'm just glad to get out and get a breath of fresh air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can feel you there, dude.\" Xavier smiled, feeling a little bad he didn't get up to grab a drink before closing Josh in his sweaty pit. \"Did you have fun though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It was actually really interesting!\" Josh said with a smile, not wanting to go into too much detail over just how much he enjoyed it. \"Little smelly, but it was also pretty soft and comfy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot safer than my stomach, I bet.\" Xavier smiled as he patted his stomach a little with his left hand. \"Probably not as interesting though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong.\" Josh agreed, knowing Xavier was correct on both accounts. Josh watched as Xavier left his hand on his stomach, making him think about Xavier's almost otherworldly huge interior. \"Maybe I could climb my way to your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the face of the mountain.\" Xavier smiled, still having fun role-playing himself as a landscape. Moving his hand and touching the dark hairs of his beard, Xavier continued.  \"More trees grow along that trail, although I don't think they smell as bad as the ones in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can hope anyway!\" Josh chuckled as he started his hike, scaling his way up the side of Xavier's right pec before shortly making it to his neck. Xavier leaned his head back, allowing Josh to scale across his neck a little easier before reaching the very edge of his beard. Reaching up for the dark hairs they seemed shorter than the ones in his arm pit, yet they still easily out scaled Josh. Fortunately, the hairs proved to be extremely useful in progressing up the hairy chin, making it very easy to reach the flat part as Xavier's head rested normally. Coming over the side, Josh continued working his way through the hairs until he came across a break in the follicles at Xavier's lips. Josh bit his own lip as he looked at the massive lips. Moving forward, Xavier's mouth curled into a smile as Josh sat on the lower lip, holding on tight as he expected Xavier to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, you've spelunked that cave before by mistake.\" Xavier said carefully, trying not to launch Josh off his lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like I was washed down that cave by a waterfall.\" Josh chuckled. \"Besides I was just looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're free to check inside a little if you want?\" Xavier offered, hoping a little that Josh wanted to crawl inside his mouth willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Josh said eagerly as Xavier smiled a little more before opening his lips slowly and letting out his massive pink tongue. Josh watched the tongue curl out, presenting itself in front of him. Without much delay, Josh got on the tip of the massive muscle as Xavier shifted himself back, keeping his head level now for Josh to explore inside. Josh fell to his ass as Xavier retracted his tongue into his mouth, keeping it open but carrying Josh deep inside. Getting back to his feet, Josh looked around from saliva dripping from the roof of his mouth, to the rows of perfect teeth, Josh was in awe of Xavier's massive mouth. Without much thought, Josh simply moved forward, looking to the sides as Xavier's cheeks flared slightly with each breath before looking dead ahead at what was quite easily the main attraction. The throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Josh simply said as he looked at Xavier's throat open and close. With each breath exchange it shifted it's status and caused his massive uvula to wiggle slightly with each movement as more strands of saliva dripped casually off down on to the tongue. Entranced, Josh nearly jumped as Xavier's body shifted around, Josh looked outside the still open mouth seeing the scenery change quickly as Xavier moved about the room. \"Every thing ok, Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the massive cave, Josh saw the teen raise his hand and give a thumbs up, likely not wanting to speak while Josh explored the inside of his mouth. Relieved, Josh watched outside past the huge rows of teeth before he saw what looked to be a screen with Xavier's open mouth and face in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier made his way to his pile of clothes, pulling out his phone and immediately turning on the camera. Keeping his mouth open and facing himself, Xavier took a selfie. Pulling up the hone, he zoomed it close and tried to locate Josh within the confines of his mouth. To his surprised the quality camera on his phone did in fact capture Josh, facing the camera deep near the back of his throat. Xavier smiled as he closed his mouth slightly, moving his tongue and trying to force Josh to the front of his mouth once again. Sticking his tongue out and looking at himself in his camera, Xavier saw Josh squirming slightly on the tip of his tongue. Leaving it stuck out and making a face as well as pointing at the tip of his tongue with two fingers, Xavier posed as he took another selfie. Xavier once again looked at the picture, impressed he was able to capture Josh in it as well, stuck to his tongue thanks to the sticky saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are sweet, dude.\" Xavier said, forgetting Josh was still in his mouth for a second before he stopped moving his lips and stuck his tongue back out. Using his phone to look for Josh, Xavier saw him stranded near the middle of his mouth off to the side slightly. Xavier had an idea as he has hit the record button his camera, trailing Josh with the video for a few seconds before he closed his mouth and zoomed out to show his face. Xavier smiled as he put a fist against his lips and gave a closed mouth burp before smiling at the camera and ending the recording. Opening his mouth back up, Xavier finally reached in and got Josh out, having him stuck to his finger as he looked at the little man with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" Xavier started to say as Josh wiped his face and looked at his handsome face. \"I need to...\"                        </span></div></div>",

But it's such a good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" Josh barely got to say as he rubbed his eyes before seeing Xavier's massive lips close around his finger and enveloping him in darkness. Josh screamed a little as Xavier pulled his finger out of his mouth and left Josh to be deposited in the middle of the teen's massive tongue once more. Head still spinning, Josh couldn't even muster a word as a blinding amount of light came rushing into the cavern. Shielding his eyes, Josh saw the screen of Xavier's phone facing him once again, red recording icon active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Ya'll ain't gonna believe this shit!\" Xavier said to his phone before zooming in on his tongue, getting a perfect view of Josh trying to get to his feet before splatting back down on the enormous tongue. Xavier tilted his head back, watching Josh as he slid into the back of his throat and almost competently losing him before he closed his mouth and gave a huge exaggerated gulping noise before opening his mouth back up and showing it was empty. Xavier zoomed out his camera as he smiled and gave a little shrug. Putting a finger on his throat, Xavier pretended he could feel Josh, despite really feeling nothing. \"Yeah he's about here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracing his hand down his chest, Xavier rubbed it a little as he continued to play it up for the camera. \"Man, that was too easy, he's long gone now!\" Xavier winked at his camera before resting his hand on his ripped abs, taking a shot of himself from below and smirking down at the camera. Giving his abs a soft pat, Xavier gave a low, yet long belch, laughing a little as he finished. \"Guess that's the end of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier cut the recording and smiled as it saved to his phone. Immediately replaying it and watching the events unfold a second time, Xavier couldn't help but laugh at his own antics. \"Dang I look good!\" Xavier said as he walked back over to the sofa and sat down, continuing to watch the video and look back at the pictures. \"Yo, this is awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier sat there for a few minutes as his stomach gave a low gurgle. Putting his free hand on his abs, Xavier looked down at it, completely forgetting about the fact that Josh was a prop in his little game in the first place. Xavier leaned forward as he put his phone on the coffee table next to his drink as he grabbed the stethoscope and put the pieces in his ear. Resting the diaphragm on his stomach once again, Xavier leaned back as he grabbed his cup of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, dude. You hear me in there?\" Xavier asked to his stomach as he waited on a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh splashed about in panic. There wasn't many safe spots remaining in the massive stomach since most of the food he ate earlier had been digested. Trying to stay mostly to the edge of the cavern, Josh heard Xavier's voice as he found a relatively safe spot out of the caustic liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xavier?\" Josh called back. \"You hav-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, dude?\" Xavier's voice interrupted him as Josh shook his head, just wanting to get a word in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really dangerous down here right now!\" Josh cringed as the mostly empty stomach growled in hunger, wanting Josh to be a part of what little food was being digested. \"Your stomach is practically empty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, bro?\" Xavier answered, not sounding too concerned. \"That sucks, dude. Oh hey, do you have a tiny phone on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no.\" Josh answered, slightly confused. \"It's at my office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's too bad, bro.\" Xavier said, still in a very relaxed unrushed tone. \"I was gonna have you face time me or something. Next time, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, we can do that!\" Josh answered in a hurry, just wanting to get out of the huge teen's stomach. \"Why don't we go to my office and get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea, bro.\" Xavier answered as he got up and made his way over to the table and chugged a little water. Taking the earpieces of the stethoscope of of his ears, Xavier set it down and...     <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Josh looked up, seeing the pink umbrella was being moved aside slightly as he saw the now familiar face of Mason peering down into the cup. Mason chuckled slightly as he saw Josh floating there on a little noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, he really likes picking on you.\" Mason laughed as Josh's head perked up. \"Tyler was telling me to go drink from this cup. Now I see why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's soooo funny...\" Josh groaned as he laid on his back, staring up at Mason. \"Such a joker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just gave me an idea. Why don't you play a joke on him?\" Mason smiled as Josh rose an eyebrow in interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" Josh asked as he watched Mason look behind him, making sure he was out of ear shot of the other guys. Noticing that no one was paying attention to him, Mason started to move the umbrella closer to Josh until it was right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let's get you out of this cup, dude.\" Mason stated as Josh shrugged, getting off the noodle and holding onto  the end of the umbrella. Mason lifted Josh out of the cup, letting him rest on the patio table, finally able to look around outside uninhibited. Josh looked up as Mason lifted the cup he was just in up to his face, quickly draining the water past his lips in several loud deliberate gulps. Josh shuddered for a moment, glad he wasn't in there anymore, but also realizing what exactly Mason had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's step one, dude.\" Mason said, ready to explain the rest of the plan before Josh interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I assume I hide out and make Tyler think you drank me?\" Josh answered, feeling like it was obvious. Mason set the cup down and crossed his huge arms across his fairly large chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you stole my thunder!\" Mason smiled wide, looking down at Josh and putting them umbrella in the now empty cup. Mason lowered his hand indicating for Josh to climb on. Unsure what came next, Josh figured he'd comply as he climb on the huge still somewhat wet hand. Mason quickly cupped his hand close to his stomach, practically pressing Josh against his lean abs, as he tried to casually walk him way inside, trying to make it look like he was just holding his stomach. Once inside, Mason retracted his hand and looked down at Josh, head spinning slightly as he wasn't used to being flipped and pressed around like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I had to press you against my stomach like that, bro.\" Mason said, noticing Josh was a little off beat. \"I just didn't wanna look like I was carrying you inside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine I just wasn't expecting it.\" Josh answered, looking around and seeing they were back in the dining room. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna just leave you in here with my clothes. That way I'd be able to find you.\" He answered, lowering Josh on his green spandex shirt from earlier as well as his black shorts. Josh sunk into the fabric, it was cool yet very comfy and smelt very heavily of Mason's musk. Josh took in a deep whiff, actually enjoying the handsome man's smell. Josh looked up at Mason as his lower abdomen gave off a terrifying groan. Mason held his lower abs for a second before looking back to Josh. \"Dude, where's a bathroom? Those tacos went right through me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right over there by the entry way!\" Josh said in a hurry pointing toward his first floor bathroom. Josh watched as Mason stumbled his way into the bathroom, shutting the door dramatically. Josh shook his head and chuckled a little. \"God that kid better not destroy my toilet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Josh was relieved to see Mason reappear, rubbing his stomach and making a goofy relieved face as he came over to his pile of clothes. \"Man I feel like ten pounds lighter!\" Mason chuckled, giving his lower abs a couple of pats. \"I dunno how the others can manage. Must have bowels of steel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so!\" Josh chuckled, not really sure how to respond. \"Well I'm glad you made it in time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same, dude!\" Mason laughed. \"Glad I didn't really drink you. You would've been in and out, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, we're both glad about that.\" Josh sweat, not wanting to even think about it. \"So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now we wait. I'll head back outside and play it cool.\" Mason said as he started to leave the room. \"Oh don't leave my clothes, bro. Otherwise I'll never find you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't!\" Josh promised, knowing how stupid it would be to leave the one place he'd be re-found. Josh laid back, trying to get comfortable. Admittedly he was a lot more comfortable now resting on the fine smelling shirt of Mason's rather than floating around in the dank cup on a wet noodle. Josh closed his eyes, wanting to rest as minutes passed by, and soon about an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh awoke to the sound of footsteps. Someone or some group of people started to come inside. Soon Josh realized it was...       </span></div></div>",

It was just a short walk to Shrink and Swim, so for the group of handsome men it didn't take very long. However the seven men certainly turned a lot of heads in the short time they took to walk to the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it's so little!\" Andres looked down at the little glass box that held the entire park. Josh looked down at it, noticing the construction crew must've closed it all up, having been done with work for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, that means I can get in my office.\" Josh called to everyone from atop Bobby's head. Blake and Markus lead the way to the break room, knowing full well that there was back way into the park from there. Everyone followed suit, Tyler bringing up the rear of the group. Once in the break room, Bobby let Josh down on a little balcony waving to the little man as he disappeared into the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Tyler asked, clearly bored and slumping over the couch he was used to napping on. \"We just gonna sit here and wait for him to do paperwork?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he have a phone in his office?\" Xavier asked, not really sure what the tiny man didn't or did carry with him as far as a cell phone goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah he's got his cell in his office.\" Tyler perked up, remembering that Josh left it there the other day. \"I can text him and let him know we're going somewhere if we want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Bobby frowned, not really feeling right about ditching Josh. \"I don't mind staying here, though. He's my roommate again now, so I feel like I should be his ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, dude.\" Tyler shrugged. \"I mean i guess you can do what you want. I wanna go outside and enjoy the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, dude. I'll text him.\" Bobby pulled out his phone and letting Josh know that the guys would be heading out to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just come with us. I promise we'll come back to get him.\" Tyler looked at Bobby honestly just wanting his old buddy to go out and hang out with the rest of the guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked down at his phone, having just sent a message to Josh saying he'd wait here for him. Bobby bit his lip, knowing he did want to go out, but wasn't sure what to do. Finally, Bobby decided he'd...        </span></div></div>",

It was the least he could do after Josh so kindly let him live with him. \"Sorry it's the least I can do for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, dude.\" Tyler smiled as he looked at Bobby. \"Actually, I think I'll stay too. You guys can go back to playing basketball if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure bro?\" Markus asked, not wanting to just leave without waiting for Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude.\" Tyler smirked. \"He'll probably be hours. But he's our best friend. We have to wait for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five remaining men went around to Bobby and Tyler, fist bumping and patting each other on the shoulder as they laughed and bid each other farewell. Tyler and Bobby watched as they left the room, making their way out into the nice sunny day. Tyler sighed as he made his way back over to the couch, sprawling across it and stretching out his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... the things we put up with, dude.\" Tyler said to Bobby as he walked over and took a seat at a comfy looking arm chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd do the same for us, dude. More probably.\" Bobby tried to make Tyler feel a little better. Tyler simply sighed and looked over at Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhh you're right, dude.\" Tyler agreed with a smile. Bobby laughed, knowing he was right. The two men got comfy, knowing it was going to probably be awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw the message from Bobby happy to see he was staying and waiting for him. He felt a little bad, considering how much paperwork and how many phone calls he had to make. Josh hurried along, trying to file as much as he could as quickly as he could, hoping he could make some of the calls later or tomorrow, since there was but one more day of construction. A few hours passed and Josh frowned, feeling bad that he made Bobby wait this long already. Grabbing his phone and making his way out of his office, Josh headed back to break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door to the break room, Josh peered out to see not just Bobby, but Tyler as well as the two men sat near the TV, watching it intently as there were sports on for them to enjoy. Josh smiled as he had no idea Tyler stayed behind as well. Josh pulled out his phone, calling Bobby, waiting for the huge man to answer as he figured it was easier to do it this way than try to get their attention at his very small size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Josh!\" Bobby answered, his voice booming both from Josh's phone as well across the room. \"How's your work going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done for now, I'm in the break room!\" Josh replied as Bobby turned his head, seeing Josh over at the balcony. Bobby got up, walking over to Josh and standing in front of the tiny man as he hung up his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty fell asleep!\" Bobby chuckled as Josh looked over at Tyler, seeing now he was in fact laying there asleep. \"He felt bad and stayed with me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I feel bad.\" Josh frowned. \"I didn't mean for you guys to wait so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, bro.\" Bobby leaned down toward Josh with a happy grin. \"You've done so much for me. I owe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Josh shook his head. \"Not at all Bobby. That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too good, dude.\" Bobby smiled as he reached down for Josh, letting the little man come aboard his hand. Bobby raised Josh up, walking back over to the chair as Josh got a better view of Tyler, snoozing on the couch with his mouth hung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do about him?\" Josh asked Bobby looking up at his muscular friend. Bobby smirked as he looked over at Tyler, wondering the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could let him rest, maybe.\" Bobby offered as an option. \"Then we could just get him home and you can finish up whatever you gotta do for the park. Orrrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or?\" Josh wondered aloud back to Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could mess with him a little.\" Bobby chuckled. \"It's a rare opportunity for you, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a minute. It was a rare oppertunity, but Josh felt like it was more important to get all his calls in, ready for the park to open anew with plenty of new lifeguards to join the team.

Josh simply slumped into Bobby's palm as the two men laughed at him. Either way, Josh felt like he made the right choice, be it an accident or not. Josh sat back smiled as the two men got up, still amused at fooling Josh, even if they didn't get to bring out their full plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new day was dawning for Josh as he looked down at his massive list of new employees. It had been a few months or so since the parks expansion, and since then Josh had his hands more than full with training the masses of new lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, Brody, Matt, Luke, Brett, Markus, Ross, and Blake....\" Josh said to himself, recalling his original staff before the expansion before looking at all the new men he'd added to the crew. \"Ricky, Chad, Scott, Trevor, Jon...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at the list of new names. The five new men had been doing well since they joined before Josh continued to look at his new names to remember. \"Well there's Brandon too.\" Josh thought, a little reluctant to hire him at first since he was Josh's old high school bully. \"At lease he seems ok now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course there's Bobby, Xavier, Andres and Mason.\" Josh said to himself, knowing where all his new hires started. Josh's eyes then wandered to the names Vinny and Lyle, Brody's roommates that came on part time along with a constructions job. Next, there was Clifford, or \"Cliff\" as he preferred to be called. He was Mr. Morebucks spoiled son, but he seemed to be proving himself a decent worker so far. Finally, last but not least was Austin, Ross's roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe looking at the list, seeing that his staff had more than doubled since the park's expansion! \"This is amazing!\" Josh smiled. \"I never would've expected the park to get this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course with the park's massive new operations Josh found himself with even more new responsibilities.

Josh continued on his way, wanting to make it to the break room quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked passed many of the new attractions in the park, but at the very least this nestled corner of the park remained mostly unchanged as Josh was really the only one who used their entrance to the break room.

Making his way to the edge of the balcony, Josh looked out into the huge room. The break room it's had seen it's fair share of upgrades as well.

Over all the break room had better new stuff, much to Josh's best efforts, wanting his lifeguards to be as comfortable as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying attention now to who was actually in the room, Josh looked out to see a group of men together.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh swallowed as he looked at the group of men. He found it odd that these four men would gravitate to each other, but as time passed they formed quite the group. For starters, Josh felt leery knowing that his old high school bully, Brandon was part of the group. Josh saw the man, 22 years old and sitting at 6'3\" of pure massive muscle with brown hair and blue eyes, Brandon used to always make fun of Josh for being short and weak, and now he was even bigger, stronger, and better looking than when he was in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, Josh looked at the devilishly handsome blonde Ricky. 22 years old and sitting at 6'4\" Ricky was an experience lifeguard, but with a very arrogant attitude. He did great work, Josh would admit, but he couldn't help but feel like the man enjoyed being superior to everyone around him. Plus Josh always got this weird feeling when Ricky would stare at him with his dangerous looking eyes at he had done something horrible to him in a previous life or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh looked at the dashingly good looking Vinny. By far the nicest guy of the group, but still very much liked to push people to their limits. At 20 years old and sitting at 6'5\" with buzzed brown hair and blue eyes, he was clearly the tallest man of the group as well. Being Brody's roommate and old high school buddy, Josh knew the man was big into lacrosse and a total lax bro. Josh figured his lax go with the flow kind of messing with people nature was what drew him to the group of seemingly devious young men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, was Clifford, or Cliff as he preferred to be called. He was a very wealthy young man at the age of 21. His parents were the esteemed Mr. and Mrs. Morebucks, the people who invested in the park in the first place. Josh took the young man on the crew as an additional favor to Mr. Morebucks, hoping to make the handsome young boy work a little for a change. At a hieght of 6'4\" with strong lean muscles and a gorgeous face with shaggy dirty blonde hair and hazel eyes, Cliff tried to charm or bribe people into doing his work more often than not. Either way, Josh swallowed hard as he approached the group of intimidating young men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh cleared his throat as he leaned against the railing, \"Hey guys, it's almost time to change shifts!\" Josh called out to the four men as they all turned their attention to him. \"Just wanted to make sure everyone was on time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey short stuff!\" Brandon smirked as he sauntered on over arrogantly. Brandon hovered over Josh, showing off his massive muscle looming over Josh with immense proportions. Josh gulped as Brandon looked down at him from what seemed like miles away. \"Sorry you're so small, did you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just...\" Josh started to say as Ricky made his way over next to Brandon, smirking as he rested an arm on Brandon's shoulder. \"Just uhhh it's almost time to change shifts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're aware boss. Don't you worry.\" Ricky said smoothly with a cocky smirk. \"Pretty sure we still have 20 minutes though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do, I just wanted to uh...\" Josh fumbled as Vinny and Cliff made their way over on either side of Brandon and Ricky. \"Give a friendly reminder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about us, tiny bro.\" Vinny shrugged, feeling accustomed to calling Josh by \"tiny bro\" any time they spoke. \"We're fine, tiny bro, we'll be on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well good.\" Josh sweat a little as Cliff simply stood there staring at him. \"I guess I'll just be on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh why, shortie?\" Brandon mocked a little. \"You never wanna chill with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he only wants to hang out with Tyler...\" Cliff laughed, nudging Ricky in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff's right, boss.\" Ricky leaned down and looked at Josh with a sexy, yet scary smile. \"You should hang with us sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's my best friend, guys...\" Josh tried to make an excuse as he backed up. \"But I can hang out with you guys sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've know you longer than anyone else, dude.\" Brandon leaned in with a smile. \"I mean we did go to school together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh tried to remember how much of a jerk Brandon was most of his child and teen years. \"I'm sure we'll have time sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got 20 minutes right now, tiny bro.\" Vinny smiled, wanting Josh to stick around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could we even do in 20 minutes though.\" Cliff crossed his arms as he watched everyone else continue leaning close to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I could think of plenty of things.\" Ricky said in a smooth voice that made Josh shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Brandon looked at Ricky with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've heard some things.\" Ricky looked down at Josh. \"Tyler sure liked to gloat about stuff he's done when I first got hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed nervously. Not entirely sure what Tyler must've told people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me him and Bobby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Cliff you'll check on Josh with me too, right bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Cliff yawned still looking bored. Vinny shook his head and shrugged as he looked down at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay low, tiny bro.\" Vinny assured Josh. \"They definitely seemed like they wanted a piece of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks guys.\" Josh smiled and nodded his head in appreciation before making his way back to the door. \"I'll see you guys later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure tiny bro!\" Vinny gave Josh a thumbs up as Cliff simply nodded after Vinny elbowed him in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt a little better as time started to pass. Heading back to his office, Josh tried to lay low much to Vinny's advice waiting out as the end of the day approached. Getting ready to head out, Josh looked over as the door to his office opened and he saw as a pair of men entered... </span></div></div>",

Josh watched as the handsome tall me approached him at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you're doing well, tiny bro!\" Vinny smiled as he walked up to Josh, still a full foot taller than the shorter man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not tiny right now!\" Josh shook his head as he saw Cliff approach as well, also nearly a full foot taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still pretty tiny anyway.\" Cliff smirked, enjoying looming over his father's business partner at both giant and normal heights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Josh mulled for a moment. \"But I am doing well, thanks to you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw Brandon and Ricky try coming to your office.\" Cliff crossed his arms. \"We managed to get rid of them though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let him be so modest, bro!\" Vinny laughed. \"He threatened to call his dad if they kept trying to harass you. Then Brandon was still insistent, Cliff almost fought him, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I hope Brandon didn't hit you did he?\" Josh turned to Cliff with concern. Cliff simply shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't dare.\" Cliff smirked. \"I know I'm not an inflated meathead like him, but I could take him if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad they left without anything happening.\" Josh smiled, feeling a new appreciation for Cliff now as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, tiny bro. We wanted to show you something else.\" Vinny smirked at Cliff. \"Come to the break room okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure!\" Josh answered with enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, tiny bro!\" Vinny winked at Josh. \"We'll see you in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the two men left the room, distracted watching them turning from seeing their impressive muscular front, to their perfect asses as they left. Shaking himself from his daze, Josh went about his routine to close up the park as he grabbed his stuff and headed to the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked into the break room and immediately on the railing he saw dozens of pictures of Brandon and Ricky with mustaches and marker all over their faces. Josh couldn't help but laugh as he looked up and saw Vinny and Cliff, now giant and looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hilarious, you guys did this?\" Josh chuckled as he addressed the two giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, tiny bro!\" Vinny smiled attractively. \"We put em in here because we knew they'd never come in here shrunk anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these can hang up feet away from them and they'd never know, dude.\" Cliff chuckled, thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks guys, this is really funny.\" Josh continued to smile feeling a little bad he was laughing at two of his employees' expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it, tiny bro!\" Vinny smiled. \"Oh hey, Cliff and I were gonna hang out, you wanna come with? You can ride the Vinny express!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to your place, dude.\" Cliff shook his head. \"It's a fucking hole in the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe compared to your place! But that's not fair, Brody's got a nice place.\" Vinny slumped, feeling bad Cliff was still very spoiled in that regard. Cliff simply shrugged, not caring. \"Either way, tiny bro, you wanna come with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure!\" Josh said without really thinking. \"I did promise to hang out with you guys, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, tiny bro! Let me just call up Brandon and Ricky too!\" Vinny joked, making it obvious he wasn't serious. Vinny lowered his hand for Josh to climb on. \"All aboard tiny bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he climbed up onto Vinny's hand, riding outside as Cliff's driver pulled around picking them up in a fancy looking car. Making their way into the massive mansion Cliff's parents owned, Cliff dismissed the driver, telling him they weren't planning on going anywhere else at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad are away on business, like usual.\" Cliff explained as he lead Vinny through the house. \"So we got the whole place to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff lead them upstairs to a room with a large tv, games, and a mini fridge. Josh couldn't help but look around in awe at the spacious room, it was like a mini movie theater, gaming central, and awesome hangout spot all wrapped into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff slumped into a comfy looking chair as he watched Vinny and Josh look around the room in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bored.\" Cliff complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, we just got here, you're already bored?\" Vinny chuckled as he walked beside the chair Cliff was in, still trying to get comfortable with the huge room before he sat down. \"What do you wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh I don't know.\" Cliff shrugged. \"We could chill and play some games. Or just hang out I guess. I'm kinda curious about the stuff Brandon and Ricky were harassing Josh about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh finally spoke up. Not really wanting to relive that harassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that you never really got to tell the whole story.\" Cliff shrugged. \"There's lots of rumors going around about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip, he could talk about it now, feeling safer with Vinny and Cliff. But he also felt like he wouldn't mind just watching these two hunk play some games while he got to unwind. Thinking for a moment, Josh decided...</span></div></div>",

I never begged, Tyler never threw me up, and I certainly did not get shit out!\" Josh waved his hands trying to quell those rumors first. \"So first off I should explain how they started teasing me from early that day. Saying they'd eat me before Bobby stuck me to a gummy bear and dropped me in a bowl with other bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so they lost track of you and ate you?\" Cliff asked curiously. \"That's so far off from the rumors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hold on. Bobby did accidentally eat me. Luckily he laid down and I was able to crawl up his throat, otherwise I would've been a gonner.\" Josh explained the next part of the story. \"Then Tyler started taunting me, saying how lucky I was. That's when I got frustrated and told him I could make him puke. He barely gave me a moment before he swallowed me, saying if I couldn't make him puke I was stuck in his stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bro, so wait, he didn't puke you up. But he also didn't shit you out?\" Vinny asked, sitting down now at a chair next to Cliff and setting Josh down on a table between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clearly, I'm not invincible. He would have digested me.\" Josh tried to explain. \"He ended up laying down, falling asleep, and I clawed my way up his throat too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, tiny bro. That's bad ass.\" Vinny sat at the edge of his seat, thoroughly enjoying Josh's story. \"No wonder they spread those rumors, they sound kinda lame forcing you through that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, really.\" Josh shook his head. \"They thought it was cool too, they actually made a game with it. But we got side tracked by the hiring spree and the idea just kinda teetered off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you try it again?\" Cliff asked, leaning over with interest at Josh. \"In a better controlled environment of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Yeah I guess. Anything is better controlled than Bobby and Tyler nearly sleeping with me in their guts.\" Josh tried to laugh it off. \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff smiled, \"Well I was thinking we could...\"  </span></div></div>",

You be the chauffeur. I don't feel like carrying him.\" Cliff stood up and stretched. Cliff started to walk toward the back of the house, and Vinny reached down and grabbed Josh to follow. Making their way outside, they came out into a beautiful stone patio looking out over a private beach, however, Josh and Vinny looked over at Cliff who was staring down the beach further down looking at the people in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beach in the backyard is private, but all the way down there it's open to common folk.\" Cliff spoke like he was some sort of royalty. \"Tons of people down there right now. Bet we could scoop someone up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh squinted, staring out over the horizon, but to him it was millions of miles away at his minute size. Josh fell backwards onto his butt as Vinny started walking down the beach, wanting a better look himself, Unable to see beyond Vinny's abs to look behind him, Josh just figured Cliff was following along as he heard a second pair of massive foot steps behind Vinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men started to approach the crowds of people as Josh looked in awe of all the giant people. Josh curiosity was certainly sparked as he looked about. Looking out at the beach, Josh's eye caught a large looking man, clad in blue board shorts with a few arm tattoos and a backwards hat and sunglasses as he stood slightly off the beach in what looked like an outdoor gym used fr muscle beaches. The first man was absolutely massive, body rippling with well trained and bulging muscles, and based off his size, Josh guess he must've been taller than Vinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh turned his attention a little further off the beach on the boardwalk as his eye caught a young looking man on a skateboard. With tan skin on his shirtless torso and sagging his red shorts way past his ass showing off a plaid patterned pair of boxers, wearing flat skate shoes, a hat turned sideways, this giant looked like he was quite the douchebag. Josh still couldn't keep his eyes off him as he stopped momentarily skating to looking at his phone. Josh admired his lean muscled skater body. With perky well trained pecs and skinny, yet muscular, perfect abs, Josh could barely look away. Josh measured him to probably be a bit shorter than Vinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh looked out to the ocean as an absolute adonis came out of the water. Slicking back shaggy brown hair as he carried a surfboard under one arm, Josh's jaw nearly dropped as he saw him walk nearby. Wearing tight black swim leggings and nothing on his torso, Josh watched as his perfect muscular torso and abdomen turned to show off an impressive bubble butt. Compared to most surfers Josh had seen he seemed like he probably spent more time in the gym than on the waves. Getting a good look at the man, Josh figured him to be even taller than the first guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny looked down at Josh all the while, seeing him look from guy to guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tiny bro?\" Vinny asked as Josh perked up and looked to to Vinny's handsome face. \"See someone you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh started wondering who to pick. \"I saw this one guy he looks like a...\"         </span></div></div>",

Cliff followed Vinny off the beach and up onto the boardwalk as the two approached the skate boarder. As the two men approached, the boarder looked up from his phone and rose an eyebrow, wondering why he was being approached by two dudes that looked like lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup bro, nice board!\" Vinny smiled with a friendly expression as he pressed Josh against his abs to hide him a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks, dude.\" The man responded, still a little hesitant. \"Can I help you dudes? You lifeguards on this beach or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro not this beach. Off duty!\" Vinny continued to be social and friendly. \"Have you heard of that water park Shrink and Swim?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. It's that one where they shrink people right?\" The dude answered. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work there, dude.\" Cliff spoke up now. \"We actually left work with an extra person besides the two of us today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that mean?\" The guy asked, still confused. Vinny nodded at Cliff as he moved his hand off his abs, revealing Josh to the stranger. \"Woah, bro. They really do shrink people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro. We took this little guy with us to mess around with. We were trying to find someone else to join us, but we didn't want them to be associated with the park.\" Vinny lied, feeling like it was a decent excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you picked me, dude?\" The dude answered, raising his eyebrow again, skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemed like the right guy for the job. But if you aren't interested...\" Cliff yawned as he pulled out his wallet. \"I was planning on slipping you a couple hundred just for laughs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The man sputtered before composing himself. \"I mean, that's cool bro. Yeah I'm down. I'm Dylan by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff.\" Cliff answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vinny, bro!\" Vinny answered enthusiastically. \"The little guy is named Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, little guy has a name?\" Dylan leaned in to get a better look at Josh, as Josh cowered a little. \"Huh. He looks scared. You guys kidnap him or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he wanted to come with us, bro.\" Vinny quickly covered for Josh. \"Cliff and I are just hesitant to mess with a guest ourselves since we don't want to get fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so it doesn't matter what I do, huh?\" Dylan smiled, feeling like this was an interesting opportunity. \"Plus for a few hundred bucks, I'll do whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy enough.\" Cliff shrugged, hiding his excitement over the idea as he started to lead the group back toward his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group returned back to his private beach, leading Dylan now as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff, this is your place, bro? This is intense!\" Dylan looked around admiring the massive mansion. \"No wonder you can afford to drop money like nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh it's whatever.\" Cliff chuckled. \"Either way, we've got plans dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight.\" Dylan set down his board and took a seat at a comfy chair around an outside patio table. \"What do you want me to do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off, bro. We aren't going to do anything that's gonna kill him. Okay?\" Vinny said, still holding Josh very protectively. \"This is just for fun, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure. Dude is small, but killing a person is still not cool.\" Dylan agreed. Vinny looked at Cliff and nodded as he walked over to Dylan, handing Josh to the skater as he laid back, looking comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff you got any beers or anything, I'm ready to sit back and enjoy this, bro.\" Vinny smiled as he let go of Josh for the first time. \"How old are you anyway Dylan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"21.\" Dylan answered almost too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your mom, bro. I don't care if you're under age.\" Vinny chuckled as he walked away after Cliff pointed him toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"18...\" Dylan said under his breath, which Josh heard very clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, they don't care.\" Josh said finally, his first words to the giant as he snapped his attention to Josh in his had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right makes sense you could talk. Your voice is so tiny and squeaky, dude.\" Dylan now cupped Josh in both his hands. \"So why did you want to leave with these dudes like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm I just really always wanted to be shrunk.\" Josh lied. \"They gave me a chance, but didn't want to get in trouble with their boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I guess.\" Dylan shrugged as Vinny came back with a couple of beers, handing one to Dylan while cracking open his own. Dylan opened his beer and took a sip. \"Thanks, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, bro.\" Vinny sat down at the table now, joined by Cliff. \"So here's what we want to do with the little guy. He can tell you himself too if you don't believe us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Dylan looked at the two lifeguards a little impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants you to eat him, dude.\" Cliff leaned back with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.\" Dylan looked down at Josh and back at Vinny and Cliff. \"Well sure I could swallow him whole, but bro he'd die in my stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we aren't going to leave him in there, dude.\" Cliff clarified a bit. \"He wants to try and climb his way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan rose an eyebrow as he chugged his beer a bit. \"Uhhh yeah sure. You guys are paying me after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he can't make it out, we'll need you to puke, bro.\" Vinny chuckled as he took a sip of his beer, watching Dylan as he finished his own. \"I'll grab you another beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I'll need it, dude.\" Dylan set his empty on the table as he looked down at Josh. \"Well sorry little guy. Or not I guess since this is what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Dylan lifted him up, past his abs and well trained chest up to his handsome young face. Opening his mouth, Josh slide out of the teen's hand into the gaping maw landing with a splat on the skater's tongue. Cliff watched as Dylan leaned his head back and swallowed as Vinny came back with the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! I missed you swallowing him!\" Vinny set the beer down with disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry.\" Dylan rubbed his neck a little. \"It it makes a difference I think he'd like right here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan opened the second beer and gave it a good chug before leaning back with a sigh. \"Not anymore. Yeeted the little dude down with that beer.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... now we just need you to lay down, bro.\" Vinny commented as Dylan rose an eyebrow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he was climbing out?\" Dylan complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right now he's climbing straight up, bro. Lay on your stomach and give him a chance.\" Vinny crossed his arms as he watched Dylan shrug, stand up and chug his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuurrrrrrp!\" Dylan let out a massive burp as he rubbed his abs before sighing and looking over at a lounge chair. Going over and doing as he was told, Dylan laid on his stomach and smirked, pulling out his phone and looking down at it as he hung his face over the edge. \"There, good luck in there little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was hardly able to hear over the sloshing, gurgling waves around him. From the moment he had been squirted out into Dylan's stomach, he found himself in chaos. He landed with a splash into the caustic sea of booze, immediately losing his bearings. His small body sunk directly into the pool as if he had canonballed from 20 feet up. The beer had already been warmed by Dylan's body. It felt like he was swimming in a disappointing hot tub. But he knew from experience at this point that it could get very hot and humid within a person's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swirled about in the beer, trying to find his way out. He kicked and swam to what felt like no avail. He was utterly lost within seconds. It felt as if the stomach was trying its best to drown him. He couldn't tell if he was going anywhere or simply spinning in circles as he kicked and pumped his arms. He couldn't have even tried to see where he was if he could open his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Josh felt his lungs start to burn, hope granted him a light. In his mad flailing, he suddenly felt the unmistakable squishy surface of none other than Dylan's stomach lining. His cheek all but slammed against it, the rest of his body soon following. The flesh sunk beneath his touch, squelching in the wet darkness. Josh would recognize it anywhere at this point. It would be impossible for him to forget how it felt. But that was all he needed. He had found the ground, now all he needed was to swim up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was nearly at his limit when he finally broke the surface. His head burst free from the heated liquid into the caustic air of Dylan's stomach with a great (albeit incredibly minuscule) splash. He gasped the acidic air, never so happy to have ended up breathing the interior of a man's stomach. It tingled in his chest, but it was air, and that was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking as he tried to orient himself, Josh slowly regained control of the situation. \"Damn it...\" he grumbled. \"Gotta tell them that drinking before this isn't allowed next time.\" He picked a direction and swam, for once thanking his lucky stars that he ran a water park. It wasn't until he was able to reach a squishy, slimy wall that he finally relaxed. Placing his weight against the wrinkled surface, he was at last able to support himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea of booze around Josh constantly churned and sloshed, pushed along by the kneading walls. It took everything Josh had to stick close to this one and catch his breath. They moved in and out, almost in tune with his pounding heartbeat above. Low, ominous growls filled the entire space, nearly blocking out all noise. And all the while, bubbles drifted to the surface. Josh disregarded them for the time being, more focused with trying to figure out which way to go in the low-lit area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until the entire stomach rumbled and quaked. Josh's eyes widened. He realized what was about to happen just in time. A gasp in his throat, Josh pressed himself to the squishy, slimy wall of Dylan's stomach and braced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BUUURRRAAAARRRUUUUAAAAARP!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch roared around him like nothing he'd ever known (before he'd invented shrinking anyway). It was so much deeper and louder than any he'd ever heard before. Every bassy wave of sound seemed to penetrate his core, shaking him down to the smallest atom. Even bracing himself against the wall didn't help. As air rushed from Dylan's stomach, the stomach squished itself tighter together to compensate. The wall he was stuck to forced him back into the churning sea. And to make matters worse, the world soon flipped onto its side, sending Josh careening into the waters once again.</span></div></div>",

Josh shrunk down a little in his chair as he watched the two men approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heyyyy! What's up shortie?\" Brandon mocked Josh as he walked right up to his desk. \"We haven't seen you since earlier, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yeah...\" Josh answered bashfully, not really wanting much to do with either men at the moment after how they acted before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Vinny and Cliff huh?

I heard they wanted to see you, Boss.\" Ricky put his hands on Josh's desk and leaned closer to Josh. \"You better hurry and go see them... I bet it's urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Okay... I'll head over in a few minutes...\" Josh sunk even lower as he saw the two men turn around and start to leave. Taking a deep breath, Josh was relieved to see the two of them leave. \"I wonder whats up with Vinny and Cliff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh grabbed his phone, just in case Ricky and Brandon was lying. He knew it would be best to have a way to contact someone... just in case. A few minutes passed as Josh walked his way into the break room. Shielding his eyes as he made his way into the large bright room. Eyes adjusted, Josh felt something crash behind him as he turned and saw a plastic looking tower now blocking the door he just came from. Josh swallowed as he saw the arm of the person who set the water bottle down, the now giant form of Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice of you to join us, shrimp!\" Brandon mocked Josh as he finished blocking Josh's only escape route. \"I'm sure Vinny and Cliff will be happy to see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Ricky stepped forward, holding a small container between his fingers, shaking it back and fourth. \"Let's just say they're a <i>tiny</i> bit occupied.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you guys do?!\" Josh panicked now, worried that they really did capture tiny Vinny and Cliff. \"Whatever it is, just let them go, okay? This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mister tough guy all a sudden. Tell you what we'll make a trade, shrimp. We'll let them go. But in exchange, we get you.\" Brandon smiled, happy Josh was able to catch on so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... please just let them go...\" Josh knew it was the right thing to do, knowing he wouldn't want to be responsible for what would happen to them. Josh watched as Brandon lowered his hand next tom him, willing to comply Josh got onto Brandon's hand as was lifted up toward's the man's chest. Josh watched as Ricky popped the top of the container and set it down on the balcony, tipping it over and grabbing the water bottle away from the door as Brandon carried Josh away. In a moment, Ricky joined Brandon's side as they left the break room, making their way outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed in fear as he looked at Brandon's massive muscle chest. Having no idea what the men had in mind for him, but he felt better knowing Vinny and Cliff were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men left the park, on the way Josh...  </span></div></div>",

Shaking his head as he was somewhat pinned now between the folds of Brandon's palm, Josh could do little more than hear Brandon and Ricky talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've got Eric and Cody coming over.\" Josh heard Ricky state to Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh word, bro?\" Brandon answered. \"Nice, they aren't little bitches like Vinny and Cliff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude.\" Ricky laughed. \"Guess they're coming over to my place after they're done at the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooord!\" Brandon said excitedly, shaking Josh in his fist a bit. Josh started sweating, nervous about these two knew unknown giants they had plans on having over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they get along with Ricky and Brandon they must be pretty awful...\" Josh commiserated, worrying himself even more. Josh shimmied his arm a bit, wishing he could grab his phone and call for him. \"Probably not a great idea though.. what if they found out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a breath, only really getting sweaty palm stench in his nostrils. Holding off on thinking about calling for help, Josh decided he'd have to just just trust Brandon and Ricky didn't have anything too awful in mind for him. Josh waited as he heard the sound of a door and the walking on hardwood floors as it seemed like they had gotten inside somewhere. Light filled Josh's vision as Brandon opened his hand, dropping Josh on a massive table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice ride, runt?\" Brandon loomed over Josh as he looked around the room. He guessed this was Ricky's apartment, based off the conversations. Looking back up at Brandon, Josh swallowed nervously as he looked at the giant, still shirtless and clad only in his red lifeguard shorts. Josh looked around, not sure where Ricky was, and worried about the arrival of these new giants. Brandon's meanwhile bent down, impatient Josh didn't answer him. \"Runt, I asked you a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. Yeah it was a good ride. Thank you.\" Josh figured he'd be as compliant as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, runt. It was good? You clearly didn't get the point...\" Brandon pinched Josh between his fingers, watching him struggle as he tried to run away. Josh braced himself as Brandon opened his sweaty arm pit, sticking him inside and closing it. \"There, hopefully you learn a lesson, shrimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, dude?\" Ricky came out from his bedroom, now wearing a pair of khaki shorts, sandals, and a white american eagle tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having a little fun with the runt.\" Brandon patted his arm where he had Josh closed in his arm pit a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, whatever floats your boat, dude. You wanna change before Eric and Cody get here?\" Ricky asked, noticing Brandon didn't have a change of clothes with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I'm good bro. Besides your clothes would probably be too tight on me.\" Brandon laughed, flexing a little just to prove his bit more thickly laid muscle than Ricky's. \"More importantly, what are we gonna do when Eric and Cody get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to answer, Ricky was interrupted by a knock at the door. \"Guess we'll have to see, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky answered the door, letting in the pair of men as now Eric and Cody entered the room, fist bumping their friends as they came in and got comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stood sweating a bit from the gym next to the kitchen table, shirt slung over his shoulder as he stood shirtless wearing only a pair of black gym shorts. With a backwards black hat hat and black shoes, he tossed his shirt onto the table as he stood next to Ricky. Standing a solid 3 inches over Ricky, he was at least 6'7\" and very lean, but looked young probably about 18 years old. Hiding curly brown hair under his hat, Cody looked like he had somewhat of a arrogant looking resting face as he smirked chatting with his buddies. Sweat trickled down his prominent 8 pack on his muscled body as he leaned back with a smirk as he talked with Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric on the other hand laughed as he joked with Brandon, seeming like a bit more of a bombastic individual than Cody. He stood a few inches over Brandon, about Tyler's height at 6'5\" but young like Cody probably only about 18 years old. Wearing a pair of green athletic shorts, and no shirt he was very clearly the most thickly muscled man in the room. Beating out even Brandon in pure size. His abs were not as defined as some of the leaner guys, with a 4 pack somewhat viable, but you could tell he was clearly more concerned with bulking than cutting at least at the moment. He also wore a black flat brimmed hat with dark sunglasses resting on top and a protein shake in his hand.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro, Cody was just doing abs the whole time, like a little bitch!\" Eric laughed as he slapped Brandon on the back as Cody rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, at least I'm looking good for the ladies on the beach.\" Cody flexed his abs a bit. \"Not like you fatass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh glad you noticed all the squats I was doing, brah!\" Eric patted his ass obnoxiously as he walked over to the table and set down his protein shake. \"Either way, how was work dudes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring.\" Ricky flatly said as he saw Brandon scratch his arm pit, clearly grabbing Josh out and keeping him between his fingers. \"We messed with our little boss some more. That's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you mentioned how tiny that dude was before.\" Cody took a seat and turned one of the chairs. \"Won't stand up for himself and shit. Makes me think of the nerds me and my buddies would fuck with in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he used to be one of those nerds for Brandon, right?\" Eric asked, looking briefly at Brandon who was making his way over to the kitchen table, behind Cody before looking back at Ricky who was trying to draw the two men's attention, knowing Brandon was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro. Some things never change...\" Ricky trailed off, Cody's and Eric's attention him as he watched Brandon...       </span></div></div>",

The fuck was it?\" Eric stood up, standing a few inches taller than Brandon, an clearly more muscular and intimidating to the slightly smaller Brandon. Brandon put up his hands, still trying to fake confusion before looking at Ricky who simply shook his head, indicating to Brandon to probably just fess up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine bro. So you know how we work at that water park where they shrink people?\" Brandon asked as Eric turned his head a little as he looked down at Brandon, and said yes. \"Well, dude we kinda took a tiny person from the park. I thought it would be funny to prank you with them by putting them in your shake, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wandered over to the table, grabbing his shake and looking in the spout. Sure enough he saw a tiny tiny speck trashing about on the surface. Looking closely he could even make out tiny human like qualities before he set it back down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, the fuck?\" Eric walked over to Brandon like he was pissed off before quickly changing his demeanor to friendly. \"Dude, you should've just told me! That's awesome bro. I'll drink the little person. I don't give a shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would've been funnier if you didn't know, at least for Ricky and me.\" Brandon shrugged. \"But yeah bro if you're down, go for it, brah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this little twerp anyway?\" Eric asked as he went back and grabbed the bottle. \"Some rando?

I'm still gonna do it anyway.

Yo, does this little bitch have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's Josh.\" Ricky smiled, wanting to see just how far Eric was going to go with torturing Josh before finally deciding to drink the shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh huh? Well Josh... soon you can swim around in my stomach instead.\" Eric flexed with his free arm before rubbing his stomach as he held the cup just below his abdomen. Taking the cup Eric moved so he was holding it behind his ass and pulled his shorts down a bit, showing off his ass crack. \"But don't worry, these shakes give me some nasty protein farts! So ya'll can blame Josh later when he's got me stinking up the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blew a raspberry, imitating a farting down as he shoved his ass into the cup a little more before he brought the cup back to his front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you better not rip any nasty fucking farts.\" Cody crossed his arms. \"I think I speak for all of us, when I say we'll beat your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, blame Josh!\" Eric laughed as he held the cup to to his face. \"It'll all be this losers fault in a few hours! Down the hatch, Joshie boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, Ricky, and Brandon watched Eric tilted the cup back, starting to chug all the contents. With sickening slurps and gulps, Eric chugged for a few second before lowering the cup with a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, uuuurrp. That was delicious, thanks dudes.\" Eric lifted his empty cup in cheers to Brandon and Ricky, both of which were snickering mischievously to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as he was slurped up in the torrent of thick liquid, having only seen passing glances of the the muscular giant, Eric, who had just heartlessly decided to drink him. Rushing into the man's mouth and barely having time to process what was going on as he was sucked into the throat. Traveling down the giant's esophagus Josh could hear the man's healthy heart beating rhythmically around him as he was accompanied by the glorps and slurps on the way down deeper inside of Eric. With a nasty squelch, Josh yelled as he free fell into the jock's massive stomach.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good! What do I do?!\" Josh panicked, as he splashed about again, trying to find anything to cling on to before he found some large chunk of what smelt like meat. Climbing on Josh felt like he could collapse as he desperately tried to draw breath. Hearing a large burp from above, followed by some rumbling in the giant' stomach, Josh felt his breath grow even more shallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy... has no intention... of letting me out...\" Josh said to himself, having trouble breathing. Remembering his phone in his pocket, Josh panted as he reached in and grabbed it only to find it had been fried due to all the time he was stuck in the messy liquid of the protein shake. Josh dropped the useless device, knowing there was no hope. Eric's stomach gave off a large gurgle as Josh closed his eyes in the darkness. He had little choice but to accept his fate at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... just wish... I understood.. why..?\" Josh panted some more, not able to comprehend why Brandon and Ricky did this to him, or even the intentions of this stranger Eric and how he could be so heartless. Another massive gurgle came from all around Josh as Eric stomach churned violently, causing Josh to slide off his perch and back into the sloshing chyme in the giant's stomach once more. It didn't take long before Josh couldn't stay afloat, breaking the surface and sinking as he writhed in pain as Eric's stomach acid easily tore the tiny man's body apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as the men laughed and joked, easily forgetting about Josh's demise. It was never even a second thought to the men till eventually Eric let out a deliberately loud fart. After the complaints of his friends, Eric simply laughed and reminded them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, this is all Josh's fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Brandon knelt down, getting closer to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, shortie.\" Brandon smirked. \"You must be nervous about asking cool dudes like us to eat you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah for sure.\" Ricky chimed in. \"He probably was just scared because we're a lot better looking than Ty or Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip, he didn't like it when people said bad things about his two best friends, but unfortunately for him they weren't exactly here to save him from this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well personally, I don't give a shit.\" Cliff yawned as he walked away from the balcony. \"You dudes have your fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come on dude, where's your sense of adventure?\" Ricky followed Cliff, a little disappointed he didn't want in on the \"fun\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Where does it benefit me?\" Cliff shrugged. \"My dad would probably kick my ass if he found out I ate his business partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh wouldn't go squealing to your dad!\" Brandon looked at Josh sternly. \"If he did that'd be a really pussy of a move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff simply shrugged again. \"Whatever. Still not interested. But you guys have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny, Brandon, and Ricky looked at each other, giving each other looks of not caring about Cliff's spoiled behavior. Cliff yawned again as he reached into his pocket, however, knowing how he could remedy the situation. \"Look, I'll give $100 to whoever man's up and eats him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes went from seeing Cliff wave a crisp new looking 100 dollar bill to Vinny, Brandon, and Ricky who all looked at him with suddenly hungry eyes. \"Guys! I don't want this at all! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dude, 100 bucks!\" Brandon leaned in Close to Josh as he still knelt near the little man. \"Help an old buddy out, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah tiny bro.\" Vinny spoke up, also still knelt down staring at Josh. \"I know you like me better than any of these other clowns, Help a brother out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then turned his gaze toward Ricky, who simply stood there, narrowed eyes looking at Josh. Josh swallowed terrified, expecting the blonde giant to say anything to him. However the man's expression already spoke volumes to the scared tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're letting him pick?\" Cliff laughed. \"I was expecting a fight. But this is more interesting I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wished he could get out of it, but he knew he had no choice but to choose. Swallowing his fear, Josh felt his best option was to go with...           </span></div></div>",

Josh watched a Brandon got a wide, almost terrifying yet still attractive smile as Vinny stood up, leaving Josh now under Brandon's shadow alone. Josh swallowed in fear, wondering to himself if he was completely out of his mind for choosing his old bully for this. Josh watched as Brandon lessened his smile as the huge muscular man stood up from off his knees looking down at Josh for what seemed like miles to the the tiny man as Josh simply looked up at the man's chiseled features all the way to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you heard him, boys.\" Brandon gloated arrogantly. \"He's made his choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you only get the money if you actually do it, pussy.\" Cliff smirked, wanting to egg Brandon on, knowing how easily he could manipulate his friend with money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that, dick.\" Brandon spat back at Cliff as his friend simply laughed and rolled his eyes, still bored. \"I'm just having fun with it is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you haven't done anything yet.\" Ricky, puzzled in a mocking tone. \"All you've done is stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow, guys!\" Brandon put a hand on his chest acting offended. \" Why are ya'll suddenly in such a rush?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't we only on break for like 10 more minutes?\" Vinny reasoned with the men as he looked over at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Brandon looked at the clock, noticing Vinny was right. \"Well I guess we better speed this up, huh little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon reached down, scooping Josh up between his fingers. Josh tried to squirm free, hoping to buy a little time but it was a fruitless effort as he was easily curled up in the giant's massive hand. Raising Josh higher and higher from his perch before stopping right in front of his handsome face, Brandon opened his hand and smirked at Josh who blushed at Brandon's sexy expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was hoping we'd have more time for fun, but I guess we're on a schedule.\" Brandon shrugged as he tipped his hand toward his open mouth. \"Down the hatch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fell out of Brandon's hand, screaming as he was quickly engulfed in darkness in the huge smelly interior of his bully's mouth. Having shut his mouth almost instantly, Josh was sealed in the dark confused as he found himself rushed backward and falling once more with nothing more than an audible gulp to clue him in on his movement. There was no time to react, no time to negotiate. Josh found himself traveling past Brandon's beating heart and expanding lungs down deeper and deeper into the almost never ending pit of the bully's stomach. To Josh, it may as well have been hundreds of miles that he found himself plummeting downward before reaching Brandon's groaning stomach. Acting on instinct, Josh just tried to find his way to a spot that felt safe before the huge athlete's stomach acid could make quick work of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon ran a hand up and down his chest and abdomen, caressing his stomach as he knew Josh was deep with in him, completely helpless. \"I'll take my money now, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff begrudgingly stood up and handed Brandon the crisp new 100 dollar bill as Brandon stashed it greedily before storing it in his wallet. Storing his wallet, Brandon rested a hand on his stomach, forcing out a loud burp with a laugh afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That felt good!\" Brandon complimented himself. \"Alright, almost time to go back to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you gotta puke him up, dude.\" Cliff looked at Brandon confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dude.\" Brandon mocked Cliff. \"You paid me to eat him, not to puke him up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, you did only say to eat him.\" Ricky chimed in, knowing exactly where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck you both.\" Cliff turned away annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, guess Josh just got a new business partner.\" Brandon smirked as he rubbed his stomach. \"Although knowing my stomach it's more of a hostile takeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, 10 bucks.\" Cliff offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20.\" Brandon smirked still at Cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, idiot.\" Cliff pulled out a 20, knowing he could have gone way higher. \"The price is worth to watch you puke your guts up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon took the 20 before walking over to the sink. \"Man it's too bad. Kinda wish I could keep him down.\" Brandon said aloud before turning back to the guys. \"I mean if he wanted to! Plus there's other stuff I wish I could do to him... messing with this dude is even easier now that he's the size of an ant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try and get him to 'hang out' with you, dude.\" Ricky offered as an idea, deviously. \"He agreed to get eaten by you, Tyler, and who knows what else. Dude seems like he has a problem with saying 'no'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an awesome idea, Ricky!\" Brandon smiled wondering just how badly he could bully Josh in private an get away with it. Mind racing, Brandon leaned over the sink, shoving his fingers in his mouth and starting to vomit large chunks. It didn't take long before He saw the tiny wriggling form of his panicked boss. Brandon scooped the little man up and help him up with a fake smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you made it out in once piece buddy!\" Brandon faked concern as Josh cleaned himself off. \"Hey while you were in my guts, I forgot I wanted to ask you something. Mind if I come by your office later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Josh replied, head still spinning. \"Yeah sounds great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, buddy!\"  Brandon walked Josh over to the balcony leading back into the park. \"I'll see you later, just try and take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men left the break room, leaving a still frazzled Josh behind as they shut the door. The men couldn't help but laugh among each other as they made their way back into the break room, each of them slowly understanding how easy it was to control Josh to do what they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Brandon made his way toward Josh's office, eager to get the little man to hang out with him shrunk and ready to play with.

Putting on a cocky smile as Josh looked up from his desk to see Brandon, he stopped right before the desk, looking down at Josh much like he did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, how you holding up?\" Brandon offered somewhat fake concern, mostly trying to butter Josh up into coming with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm ok.\" Josh smiled a little weakly, as he wasn't expecting to be eaten today, leaving him a bit in shock still. \"That whole situation was a little unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I hear you, dude.\" Brandon responded as he absentmindedly scratched his stomach, watching Josh peek at his stomach as he did from the corner of his eye. \"Felt like we were pretty rushed what with the whole time constraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I barely knew what was happening.\" Josh recounted his adventure. \"One minute I was in your hand, the next I was in complete darkness, then before I could even adjust my vision I was in a pile of vomit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, dude. Sounds intense.\" Brandon smirked, trying to imagine what it must've been like for Josh inside his stomach. \"Well I'm just sorry it had to be that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked, still occasionally glancing down at Brandon's chest and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I had my way I would have wanted to draw it out a little longer, have a little fun.\" Brandon shrugged, trying to act casual about wanting to bully Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like roleplay?\" Josh tried to offer a word for Brandon's description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah exactly, dude!\" Brandon smirked, feeling like Josh was playing into his hands. \"I like the idea of role playing a giant. Just for fun, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. I bet you'd be really good at it!\" Josh tried to add light to everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably good at doing the tiny's job!\" Brandon added still looking down at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh me?\" Josh blushed a little, looking down. \"I suppose so. I'm pretty used to it at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of practice huh?\" Brandon continued to smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh muttered. \"Anyway Brandon, you said you wanted to ask me about something? I assume all this wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Brandon tried to play it off like he forgot. \"Sorry I was just worked up, hoping you were ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks, I appreciate that!\" Josh smiled genuinely, gullible enough to believe Brandon's lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, buddy.\" Brandon winked at Josh. \"But nah, dude. I was just curious what you were up to after work today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After work? Why what's up?\" Josh asked a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just I've been working for ya for awhile now and I've known you for so long. I was wondering if we could like, hang out or something?\" Brandon shrugged, trying to play it cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed, never in his wildest dreams would he have thought his old bully would come to him wanting to hang out. \"Umm yeah I don't have any plans. What would you wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave it up to you, bud.\" Brandon winked as he deliberately started to scratch his stomach yet again. \"But I'm happy you wanna hang, bro. That's mad chill of you after what I put you through earlier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Don't worry about that.\" Josh tried to play it cool, blushing a little that someone cool like Brandon wanted to hang out with him. \"It was a bet after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aight.\" Brandon smirked as he lowered a fist to Josh, offering a fist bump. Josh was thrown off for a moment before bumping Brandon's fist. Brandon started to walk away before opening the door and speaking back to Josh without turning. \"I'll be in the break room, whenever you're ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Josh yelled back to Brandon as the door shut. Excited yet nervous, Josh started to prepare closing up the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the park one last time, Josh made sure everything was closed. Deciding to make his way toward the break room, Josh figured he'd take a peek in the room to see if Brandon was really there. Opening the door, Josh peered into the massive room and walked out toward the balcony before he was Brandon's massive form standing at the ready only feet away from the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had changed into a light yellow tank top with barbells depicted on the front, cut off an extra amount on the sides so that from the side Brandon's entire abdomen and torso were completely visible. He also wore a pair of Black basketball shorts that seemed a little loose as he sagged them slightly showing off his tight grey spandex underwear. Also wearing a black backward flat brimmed hat and black socks that pulled up to his shins as well as a pair of black nike shoes, Brandon looked like he was more than ready to go anywhere and chill doing whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved to the attractive man, wanting to just acknowledge the fact that he was here before turning way, wanting to go out the front so he could hang out with Brandon at his normal size. Brandon however had other plans as he quickly scooped up the tiny man before he could make it to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I knew you'd want to hang out with me tiny, dude!\" Brandon smirked as he looked down at the little man in his hand. \"That's really cool of you, bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, trying to play off like it was his intention. \"Yeah, I figured uhhh..\" Josh stuttered. \"How often do you get to do this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word.\" Brandon simply answered as he made his way to the door. \"So you think of what you wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not really I guess..\" Josh answered, really unsure what to do now that he was so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well regardless of what you decide, I'm getting some food with that money I got from Cliff.\" Brandon smiled as he rubbed his stomach through his tank top. \"I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\" Josh blushed a little. \"Did you have any ideas of what to do? I didn't really have much time to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking...\" Brandon tried to play it off like he hadn't put much thought into it. \"We could do that role playing stuff you mentioned earlier? Or I could just eat ya again. Leave you down there this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real funny...\" Josh blushed a little more. \"We could go to the movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? A date?\" Brandon teased Josh. Brandon watched as the little man shifted uncomfortably in his hand at the comment. \"It's too nice out for the movies, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Josh stuttered again. \"We could go to the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an idea. It's getting a little late, but it's still nice enough for the beach. So up to you, dude.\" Brandon offered Josh the final say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, Josh decided to go with...        </span></div></div>",

Brandon made his way out of the break room, shutting the door behind him as the two made their way outside. Josh shielded his eyes briefly as the sun hit his face, still strong and warm even though it was later in the day. Brandon made his way down the block toward the beach before stopping and looking around. \"Any good places I can grab something to go around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Josh looked out into the enormous world, trying to figure out where he even was, let alone what restaurants were near by. \"I'm not really sure to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're real helpful!\" Brandon frowned down at Josh. \"You'd be more helpful in my gut right about now, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to laugh, being it the second time Brandon made a comment like that. Brandon wasn't laughing as he looked down at Josh fairly seriously. Josh swallowed hard as he looked around, finally realizing where they were. \"Um, I think there's a good burger joint like right around that corner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you better be right.\" Brandon commented grumpily, stomach growling as he felt like he hadn't eaten all day. Turning the corner however, there was in fact a little burger place. Making his way inside, Brandon shoved his hand into his tank top down on his abdomen, pressing Josh into his belly button as he went about his business to order food. Josh blinked, not having much time to react to being shoved in the giant's naval so suddenly.  Josh heard Brandon start to order from the other side of his shirt, but he couldn't really make out too much of the conversation as Brandon's stomach continued to make noise now directly next to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon started to move as Josh heard the crinkling of a bag as he found that the giant had moved back outside, walking his way over to the beach once more, while simultaneously eating one of what Josh assumed to be many burgers. Josh could easily hear Brandon's chewing and swallowing, coupled with the food's entrance into the man's empty hungry stomach. Every groan and gurgle made Josh a little nervous, but also a little curious, seeing as he had spent a very short amount of time stewing in the bully's belly himself. Brandon stopped, seemingly at the edge of the beach. Having finished eating, Josh watched as Brandon's shirt pressed forward, sealing him in darkness in the giant's belly button as Brandon rested his hand on his stomach. Some bubbling came from Brandon's gut before being forced out in a massive burp. Josh felt his face get bright red as from his position it just sounded so much louder. Finally, Brandon moved his hand away from his stomach before reaching into his shirt, pinching Josh between two fingers as he pulled the little man out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun in there, buddy?\" Brandon asked, seemingly now in a better mood now that he's eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty neat.\" Josh tried to play along as he dangled far above the ground in front of Brandon's face. Josh sweat a little nervously as it was just his shirt Brandon held pinched between his fingers. \"I'm pretty far up here though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Yeah I didn't even realize!\" Brandon chuckled as he moved Josh closer to his face. Instead, Brandon opened his mouth, dangling Josh over his face, looking straight down his throat. Josh squirmed a little as Brandon started to lower him into his mouth before pulling him away, setting the tiny man safely in his hand. \"Just kidding, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... you almost had me!\" Josh panted, feeling like the experience was almost exciting in a way. Josh looked up at Brandon's handsome smiling face, almost feeling like he wanted to be dropped in the huge man's mouth. Shaking the feeling Josh tried to play it causal, not wanting to ruin his first time hanging out with his old bully. \"I really thought for a minute you were gonna do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude the first thing you're gonna realize the more we hang out, is that I just like messing with people.\" Brandon winked at Josh. Brandon smirked as he watched Josh relax, knowing just now how much easier it's going to be to bully the tiny man. \"You can take it though. I've seen how Tyler messes with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he definitely does.\" Josh mulled over how similar Brandon seemed like Tyler in that respect. \"I guess you guys are a little alike in that respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to hang out with me, dude!\" Brandon smirked more, hoping his bullying will continue to play off as \"harmless\". \"Now then dude, I think we should hit the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Josh replied excitedly as he looked out at the beach. There were only a few people hanging around still. A few joggers, mostly surfers. Seemingly all the families had headed home by now. Josh shifted in Brandon's hand as the man leaned down, untying his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about feet, dude?\" Brandon asked, Josh as he pulled off his shoes, showing his tight black socks. \"I knew a dude once who freaked out at the sight of feet. So I figured I'd ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem, besides I can't imagine you want your socks and shoes all sandy!\" Josh answered politely as Brandon stripped off his sweaty socks. Brandon stuffed his socks on one of his shoes, holding them both as he walked out in the beach, sand between his massive toes below. Stopping a good distance from the water, Brandon set his shoes down and pulled off his tank top, setting it on the ground before sitting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really feel like holding you this whole time, bud.\" Brandon looked down at Josh in his hand. \"I can either just set you on my chest while I lean back and get some rays, or I can drop you in my shoe for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..\" Josh tried to retort, feeling like both options seemed a little awkward for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, just pick or I'll pick for you.\" Brandon looked at Josh seriously, wanting to flaunt his power over forcing Josh into an uncomfortable situation. \"Plus there's always room in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to laugh a little nervously, knowing what Brandon had just said about him messing with him. Trying to be light-hearted about the situation, Josh decided he'd spend some time...         </span></div></div>",

Brandon shrugged as he leaned back, starting to rest off his shirt and into the sand a little. Placing Josh now on his chest, Brandon rested his hands behind his head, exposing his hairy arm pits to either side of Josh now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my body that much, huh?\" Brandon mocked Josh as he looked down at the little man nestled between his pecs. Josh shifted awkwardly, looking up at Brandon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, I didn't know you'd take it that way if I picked your chest.\" Josh tried to apologize, blushing a bit because Brandon's body really was very impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late now, huh?\" Brandon smirked, laughing to himself that he forced Josh into an apology after he made such an offhanded comment. \"I figured you'd pick my shoe. I was joking about putting you on my bare chest, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I can go in the shoe then if that's better.\" Josh apologized again, simply wanting to do whatever Brandon wanted him to do, hoping the huge man would like him more. Brandon on the other hand was simply enjoying the easy control he had over Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah you're already here, plus I'm comfy.\" Brandon shrugged. \"So I guess you luck out, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, thanks Brandon.\" Josh smiled, kind of glad Brandon didn't change his mind and put him in the shoe. Now that the two men were comfortable, Josh took in his surroundings a bit better. Brandon's massive chest started producing beads of sweat, large enough to carry Josh away. The warm sun, although it was setting now, still blasted down on Brandon's body, creating heat all around Josh's tiny form. Josh felt Brandon's heart beating right below him as he looked down the chest toward the giants abs. Josh swallowed as he turned away from Brandon's stomach, not wanting to give the giant the wrong idea of him admiring the chiseled abs.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really able to see Brandon's face, Josh was curious if the man had closed his eyes or not.

Brandon moved his head forward a bit, seeing Josh had made his way to his right pec now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh.\" Brandon answered back, peeking at Josh through one partially open eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm I just wanted to thank you for asking me to hang out.\" Josh simply said, a little bashfully. \"I didn't think you liked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What made you think that?\" Brandon asked, knowing it was a fairly loaded question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just like, you know, stuff that happened in high school.\" Josh answered, nervously, knowing confronting Brandon about his old ways may not be the wisest idea he's ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stuff? I'm no different now than I was back then.\" Brandon answered, knowing he had bullied Josh pretty brutally back in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Josh tilted his head quizzically. \"You're a lot nicer to me now then back then, I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel wrong then, bro.\" Brandon smirked. \"I always just like messing with people. I liked messing with you in high school, and I like it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Josh asked, surprised. \"Maybe hanging out with Tyler taught me to take it a little better. I remember being really upset a lot in high school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I could tell you'd get pretty upset.\" Brandon laughed. \"All the more reason to do it to you more though, toughen you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never thought about it like that.\" Josh puzzled, always just feeling like he was being bullied, not playfully messed with. \"Brandon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, shortie?\" Brandon smirked as Josh looked like he still had more to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry I was such a baby in high school.\" Josh looked down, feeling bad despite the fact that Brandon was currently playing him. \"Plus I remember I was so cold to you a lot. I always thought you were just a bully. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon leaned his head forward a little, opening both his eyes as he looked down at the little man apologizing to him on his chest. He couldn't believe the hell he put the man through, not just in high school, but even today in yet he was the one being apologized to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this Brandon truly felt...  </span></div></div>",

Retrieving his shirt off the sandy ground as well as his shoes and socks, Brandon made his way off the beach as the sun was starting to disappear over the ocean. Slinging his shirt over his shoulder and holding both his shoes in one hand and Josh in the other, Brandon started making his way down a street, away from the park or even Josh's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, Brandon?\" Josh asked up to the massive man curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanna keep chilling with you, but now I'm all sandy.\" Brandon shook his feet a little. \"So I'm bringing you back to my place so I can get a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok!\" Josh just agreed with whatever Brandon wanted to do. Trying not to worry about if Bobby or Tyler were wondering where he was since he had left his phone in his office, Josh just tried to enjoy spending time with Brandon for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon made his way around a couple blocks, Josh could only imagine how hot the side walk must have been on Brandon's bare feet, but the giant seemed unfazed as they finally made their way into an apartment complex a little ways into town. Finally inside Brandon's apartment, he set down his shoes by the door, walking over to a tv tray fold up table, setting Josh down and throwing his shirt onto the futon it was station in front of. Josh looked around the room, it was very plain with a mid sized tv across from the grey futon. More tv trays were stacked against the wall apart from the one Josh now stood on. Josh turned and watched as Brandon strode out of the room back facing Josh as he caught a nice glimpse of Brandon's huge bubble butt sticking out plainly from his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and stay out of trouble, I'll be right back.\" Brandon said without looking back to Josh as he closed the door to the bathroom and turned on the shower. Josh sat down, heeding Brandon's words and resisting his urge to look around a little little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed and Josh finally heard the shower shut off and not long after Brandon had reappeared with nothing but a towel around his waist. Josh tried not to stare, but the huge man had other plans as he walked over to Josh, still a little wet from his shower as he easily loomed over the small tv tray with his height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, that shit was refreshing.\" Brandon smiled down at Josh as he shook his head a little to get water out of his ears. \"There was a lot of sand in a lot of uncomfortable places, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... I can imagine...\" Josh tried to comment, feeling a little awkward at seeing Brandon in nothing but a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong squirt?\" Brandon asked, knowing exactly why Josh was being so fidgety. \"Oh I know, you want a tour of my pad, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... umm... sure.\" Josh answered awkwardly, hoping the hunk would at least put on some shorts before that. Brandon scooped Josh up however, holding him dangerously close to his body, particularly his waist, knowing it was making the little man very embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet I smell good, huh?\" Brandon looked down at Josh at his waist. Not bothering to wait for an answer, Brandon knew he was just making Josh more and more uncomfortable by the second. Starting to show Josh around the apartment, Brandon really took his time showing each room, occasionally tilting his hand so Josh would slide up against his crotch for a few moments before the little man would slink away. Finally making it to his bedroom, Brandon set Josh down on nightstand next to what looked like a sweaty pair of socks. Josh covered his nose as they smelt quite rancid before he looked back to Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I wear, squirt? Nothing?\" Brandon asked Josh as he suddenly dropped his towel. Josh turned bright red before he realized Brandon had been wearing that same pair of grey spandex underwear from earlier. Brandon laughed as he knew he got a reaction out of Josh from it. \"Yeah I had em on all along, bro. Just wanted to prank ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down, a little overwhelmed as Brandon continued to laugh, pulling up a new pair of black shorts with yellow accents on them. Not bothering with a shirt or socks, Brandon grabbed his hat from before, putting it on backwards as he went over to Josh and scooped the little man up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling shirtless, deal?\" Brandon asked Josh as he made his way out into the living room and sitting down at the futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your apartment.\" Josh answered, honestly not minding seeing Brandon's thick solid muscles on display all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Brandon said in a commanding tone. Leaning back a little as he set Josh back down on the tv tray Brandon looked at Josh from the corner of his eyes with a smirk. \"Yo, Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yes Brandon?\" Josh answered back, sitting down on the now familiar tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon smirked even more arrogantly before saying...       </span></div></div>",

Sure it had been a few hours, but he didn't realize how quickly Brandon could get hungry. \"What are you hungry for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" Brandon said simply as he stared right at Josh. Josh laughed nervously again as Brandon held a very straight and serious face. Neither men said a word for several second before Josh decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't be very filling?\" Josh tried to offer as a response, never really sure when Brandon was joking or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah true. You would even be a snack. You're more like a crumb.\" Brandon shrugged, but still kind of wanting to torture Josh in his gut once again. \"I don't feel like making anything though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could order something?\" Josh offered as a solution, not particularly wanting to be on the menu. \"I'm sure you still have some of that money Cliff gave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhh but I don't wanna spend it...\" Brandon leaned back lazily. \"So my only snack in the house is you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm what if I paid for your food?\" Josh felt like he was almost pleading not to be a snack at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what? Tiny money?\" Brandon rose an eyebrow to Josh. \"Don't think they accept that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my credit card on me!\" Josh answered, sweating, really unsure how far Brandon was just messing with him over being serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I guess that can be a thing.\" Brandon smiled cockily, glad to know how easy it was to intimidate Josh into buying him food. Brandon thought it over for a minute. Part of him still really want to stubbornly end up eating Josh. Brandon wondered, if he refused Josh's offer once more how far Josh would trust him, thinking he was just playing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving thought on it, Brandon decided...    </span></div></div>",

I'm not feeling takeout again.\" Brandon waved his hand. \"I think I'm just gonna eat you, squirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sweat, not sure if he should beg the giant for mercy or go along with it, figuring Brandon was just joking. 'Maybe he's not even actually hungry...' Josh thought to himself as he looked at the arrogant giant. \"Well if that's what you've decided, how can I argue with you, Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure are a smart little snack just like those little candies...\" Brandon leaned forward licking his lips a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm smarties?\" Josh leaned back slightly at Brandon's voracious look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah you remind me more of nerds. One tiny speck of candy... one little nerd...\" Brandon said slowly as he reached down for Josh, pinching him between his fingers like he did earlier. Josh didn't fight, he figured Brandon was just joking as Brandon stood up, lifting Josh higher and higher into the air like he did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels familiar...\" Josh said as Brandon lifted him above his face. Josh figured any moment his now friend would pretend to put him in his mouth, before taking him out and laughing at Josh once again. Brandon did in fact open his mouth, however this time Josh found himself being lowered closer and closer before Brandon completely let go of him. Josh couldn't even scream as he barely reacted to being dropped. With a splat, Josh found himself land right down onto Brandon's tongue, in shock that Brandon had just dropped him in his mouth for real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is probably as far as he'll go...\" Josh said to himself as he looked out of Brandon's mouth seeing that the man hadn't closed the massive cavern yet. Josh swallowed as he ate his own words as Brandon's mouth slowly started to close, trapping him in the darkness of the giant's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kind of tasty.\" Brandon's voice boomed out over Josh, as the tiny man needed to cover his ears. \"I never got a good taste of you earlier today, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm sweet, just like those nerds you mentioned?\" Josh called out, still nervous, but wanting nothing more than to trust Brandon after everything that happened today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm definitely.\" Brandon answered as he started sucking on Josh's teeny tiny body a little more. \"You should squirm your little way to the back of my throat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be a little dangerous?\" Josh tried to reason with Brandon, not sure how far the man was going to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna make me swallow you myself, are you buddy?\" Brandon asked Josh softly. \"It's the least you could do for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip as he's already come this far. Against his better judgement, Josh squirmed amidst Brandon's sucking... closer and closer to the back of the giant's throat. Lost in the dark, Josh kept moving, not even realizing he was part the point of no return. Without even any audible swallow, Josh merely slipped down the throat, Brandon's natural peristalsis taking care of the rest as it carried Josh downward. Josh started to realize he had gone too far as he tried to squirm backwards, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon!! I went too far!!\" Josh panicked as Brandon's body started to pull him deeper into his massive chest. Brandon on the other hand, barely heard Josh's screams, but knew the tiny man did his job and sent himself down into his awaiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing, Brandon ran a hand down his chest, feeling faint struggles grow weaker and weaker as the descended further into his body. Completely vanishing eventually, Brandon knew Josh sealed his own fate, and the thought behind it couldn't make it more sweet for the manipulative bully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I'm talking about!\" Brandon patted his stomach a little obnoxiously. \"That's how it should have gone earlier today...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting his hand on his stomach, Brandon knew he wasn't actually hungry this whole time. Punching his chest gently a little, Brandon clenched his abs as he pushed out a mighty and wet burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, nice.\" Brandon complimented himself. \"That was awesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked down at his chiseled abs, wondering what kind of hell Josh was being put through. He couldn't help but chuckle to himself, wondering if Josh still trusted him to get him out alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it... Brandon...     </span></div></div>",

Standing up of his futon and rubbing his gut, Brandon gave a devilish smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah let's leave him in there. Let the little punk get what he deserves.\" Brandon chuckled as he walked into his kitchen, looking to see if he could find a suitable snack for the time being. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda, Brandon roughly plopped back down on his futon and turned on his TV, flipping around until he found a game of football to distract him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when they find out he want missing Cliff's dad will pick a new manager or something.\" Brandon thought out loud as he stuffed his face with chips and took a long swig of soda. Stopping for a second Brandon let loose a massive belch as he resumed his thought. \"Cliff would never want to do it, but maybe he'd pick me! I'd make so much more money than I am now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent in his fantasy, Brandon continued watching TV and snacking on his chips and soda. Caring absolutely not for the tiny man he so gullibly convinced he was his friend, as he digested horribly on the other side of his manipulative bully's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon!\" Josh plead as he was tossed about violently in the massive acidic chamber. It was rather still full of food, and Josh could help but sake the feeling Brandon had just tricked him. \"Haha really funny buddy! I can see you still have a lot of food down here! So you weren't hungry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh received no answer. He could occasionally hear Brandon speaking to himself through the walls of the stomach, but it was all muffled and hard to make out. Instead, Josh was only greeted by the occasional plop of mushed up chips and a sudden torrent of soda as he screamed, being whisked about as if he was almost nothing inside the enormous organ. Pressure would change rapidly as Josh could hear the distant rumbles of burps coming up and out of the stomach and out Brandon's mouth. But other than that, Josh's only answers were the rhythmic groans and churns of Brandon's stomach as it went about it's business digesting it's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to feel very tingly as he breathing was starting to become shallow. \"Brandon...\" Josh could barely muster a shout anymore. \"I thought we became friends! Please let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's pleas continued to go unheard. Faintly Josh could hear cheers or something come from the other side of Brandon;s stomach as Josh's whole world jumped as Brandon jumped out of his seat in excitement over football. The motion had done Josh in, as he was sent hurdling to the pit of Brandon's stomach. Struggling and crying against the acid of the massive jock bully's belly, Josh choked and gurgled as he body was easily dissolving, being broken down to fuel his old bully's body. With his last thought, Josh couldn't believe Brandon would be the one to do him in after all these years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Scott, Xavier, Bobby, Jon and Lyle...\" Josh said to himself looking at the absolutely massive men in the room. Of all the new hires in the park, these guys were the biggest tallest and most muscular group Josh could even scarcely imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the familiar face of Bobby, Josh took his presence with great ease. Josh knew he shot up a few inches since college, but seeing him with the rest of the biggest guys showed how massive he really was. Sporting his red swim trunks and a backwards red lifeguards hat, shirtless and with his classic two diamond studs in his ear, Josh couldn't help but feel Bobby was looking as dreamy as ever. Now especially without that boot on his now healed foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh turned his attention to another more familiar face, that of Xavier. After all he was in Josh's home not long ago when the park was being expanded and one of his couple impulse hires! Having gotten an official hieght since they met, Josh now knew the man was a towering 6'10\". Other than that, the man was dressed in traditional lifeguard attire aside from a red do-rag on his head apart form the typical hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh turned his attention to the shortest man of the group the 19 year old Jon. Only standing at 6'7\" Jon stood just slightly under Bobby's height. But to call Jon small in comparison to the other massive giants would be an absolute lie. Rippling with massive well trained muscles, Jon was a sight to behold even among all the other athletic lifeguards of the park. Josh appreciated the man's work ethic. He strives to always be perfect in everything he does and he used to be a lifeguard. A win win! Jon wore the same lifeguard attire, matching Bobby's look of a backward red hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were the two biggest giants in the entire park. Lyle and Scott. Both men stand at a colossal 6'11\". Starting with the younger man, Scott was only 18, much like Xavier. But with his tan skin, incredible height and massively trained muscle, Scott could easily go toe to toe with anyone in weight lifting and pure strength. Josh looked at his head, his saggy brown hair poking out of his also backward red cap and his red shorts sagging and showing of his ass a bit. One thing Josh noticed about Scott, was that as sweet and gentle of a giant he was, he was incredibly dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle on the other hand was a very different man. Being Brody's friend from prep school and currently one of his roommates, Lyle was the same age as Brody at 20 years old. Much like Brody, Lyle is a total lax bro, playing it up more often than not as the friendly college jock mentality comes natural to him. His body much like the other guys was deeply trained with huge pecs, and deeply cut abs. He does however sport tufts on blonde hair around his lower abdomen and on his chest, which he neglects to trim or really care about, similarly to Bobby. Being one of the few guys not wearing a hat, Josh could see his blonde hair clearly with the sides shaved a mess of scruffy hair on the very top as well as attractive stubble on his face. Josh always seemed to notice Lyle would lose his pants down his ass slightly as he'd often unintentionally sags his shorts due to the sheer volume of his bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone admiring the towering titans, Josh shook his daze as he approached a microphone set up in the break room, used to address giants he needed to speak to from a distance. Clearing his throat, Josh spoke to the moving mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey guys!\" Josh called out to the men as they heard Josh, each turning over to where the voice came from. \"I was just coming to check on you all, it's almost time to swap shifts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the giants shifted over to Josh to better see him. Nervous as it looked like literal skyscrapers were approaching him, Josh simply smiled and stood his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy!\" Bobby smiled down at Josh with his usual friendly tone. \"Man I don't think I'll ever get used to seeing you teeny all the time, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, Bobby had been living with him since the park was remodeled. It's been a joy having one of his best friends with him at his house lately, even if he did get eaten by him once so far! Every now and then, Josh can't help but stare at Bobby's abs, thinking about how he was unintentionally trapped behind them and somehow climbed his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss, how much longer to we have on our break, anyway?\" Josh heard Scott ask, the polite massive muscular giant always treated him with respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 minutes! So there's no big rush!\" Josh felt like he accidentally emphasized the word \"big\" as he stared at all the massive men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, so you can hang out with us, right micro-bro?\" Lyle smiled as he looked way down at Josh from beside Scott, both men seeming like their body's stretched on forever. Josh however shook his head and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Lyle. I'm not microscopic.\" Josh laughed, having had to explain to the giant he wasn't THAT small. But it's started to stick as somewhat of a nick name from the giant lax bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's pretty close to it though, right dudes?\" Jon laughed as he joined the conversation, smiling with his perfect white teeth and leaning against a wall near where Josh was standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought he was a bug when I first saw him.\" Xavier chuckled as he loomed far above Josh as well beside Bobby. Josh crossed his arms feeling a little hurt from all the teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Whats with making fun of me all a sudden!\" Josh asked, knowing the group of men are usually quite friendly. They all simply laughed, clearly not serious about the teasing they were doing to the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I don't have a gummy bear!\" Bobby joked as he made a motion next to Josh with his thumb like he was pressing Josh into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real funny, that was scary you know!\" Josh complained, looking at Bobby's massive thumb beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened with a gummy bear?\" Jon asked pulling his hat off and running his hand through his hair before putting it back on his head.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I remember this. Bobby here accidentally ate the little guy.\" Xavier chuckled as he remembered them tell him back when he was hired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon, Lyle, and Scott looked at Bobby with shocked looks as Bobby rubbed the back of his neck a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he slipped off the one I stuck him too and I ate the new one he stuck too.\" Bobby laughed. \"We were lucky I was so tired and I laid down. Otherwise we wouldn't have our little boss man today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you laid down and...?\" Scott was a bit slow to catch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He crawled his way out, bro.\" Lyle helped clarify as he looked at Xavier and Bobby who nodded in approval. \"That's badass micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Josh felt a little awkward. \"I was mostly just fighting for my life to be honest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least it all turned out okay. So now it's just a fun story to tell!\" Bobby tried to change the subject. \"Anyway, Josh. I hope you won't get mad at me about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Josh asked, curiously. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda invited some people over to your place tonight, if that's okay.\" Bobby leaned down closer to Josh, trying to put on a very slight pout to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Bobby.\" Josh smiled at his friend. \"Who'd you invite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled. \"Oh just...\"             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Weird for him to miss out.\" Josh asked as Bobby shrugged and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, dude. I asked him, he said he was busy.\" Bobby answered, just as confused as Josh was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's okay. Let him do him, right?\" Josh smiled as Bobby nodded. \"Lyle what about Vinny and Brody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they're going out of town tonight, bro.\" Lyle answered. \"I was just gonna stay home till Bobby invited me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll I'm happy to have you over too!\" Josh smiled at the massive handsome titan. \"I guess it's just gonna be us six tonight then huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be fun, my man.\" Jon smiled attractively at Josh. \"I heard you've got a nice place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess!\" Josh answered a little embarrassed. Looking at the time however, Josh realized they wasted their whole 20 minutes talking. \"Hey guys it is time for the shift change, but I'll see all of you later at my place tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants all hurried along as they made their way out of the break room and suddenly Josh found himself alone in the silence of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\" Josh couldn't help but mutter as the men left. Like seeing the world itself move and suddenly massive pieces of it disappear, Josh needed to sit still for a minute after seeing all the men leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finished up his day and grabbed his things, just a bit excited to have so many good looking guys to hang out with at his house. He couldn't help but smile, maybe he should have Bobby invite them over more often? He could get used to the men towering over him at his normal size as well as his shrunken one. Feeling adventurous, Josh decided to head to the break room in his still shrunken state, wondering if he could catch a glimpse of any of the guys before they leave for his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way inside, Josh looked around and saw Scott, a bag slung over his shoulder as he was changed into a white stringer tank top, barely hiding any of his torso, and a pair of yellow shorts, which he had sagging showing off his black compression shorts underneath on his massive bubble butt. On his head he wore a white flat brimmed hat, backwards. Josh saw the man turn around toward him. Josh waved, not sure if Scott really saw him or not as the building of a man came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey boss!\" Scott smiled as he came over to the balcony and knelt down, still towering over the edge of the balcony anyway. \"I was just about to head out to your place. You want a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no that's fine, I just live around the block. I usually walk back and fourth to work.\" Josh shook his head, appreciating the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow that must take you a real long time.\" Scott puzzled, wondering how long it would take an ant sized person to go around the block. \"Do you wanna come with me anyway, so you can show me which place is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure that's fine.\" Josh smiled, not wanting the kind of dumb but adorable giant to get lost. \"Let me just go around the fron-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was cut off as Scott didn't let him finish his sentence before he was scooped up by the giant and carried immediately out of the break room to the outside. Josh dazed for a moment as he was thrown off with the sudden rush out into the open world, but it wasn't long before Josh found Scott rounding the corner to his street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what he meant by ride!\" Josh thought to himself, thinking Scott meant in a car. Josh stared up at the man, who intently looked at the houses as he went by, determined to find the right house on his own. As luck would have it for the giant teen, he saw the recognizable faces of his friends outside of house, seeing as Lyle, Xavier, and Jon were being let into a house by Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dudes!\" Scott called out to them as he approached the group. Josh saw as Scott approached the group, all of them now changed into casual clothes much like Scott. Josh looked at each man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier was sporting a tight looking blank tank top and loose looking grey sweatpants as well as his classic black do-rag.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLyle had changed into a navy blue sleeveless spandex shirt, tight showing off his every muscle, and a pair of loose jeans, which sagged quite a bit as it didn't seem they were big enough to hold his massive ass. His hair was also styled slightly now on top as opposed to the usual messy look he went with at the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had changed into a red bodybuilder's tank top, complete with matching looking black and red gym shorts and a hat, looking he had just come from the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, was Bobby who looks like had already changed into a white spandex tank top, closely forming to his massive pecs. He also wore a white hat, backwards with his diamond studs gleaming in the sunlight. In contrast to the rest of his outfit, he wore a pair of black jeans, no belt looking like they were a tiny bit loose. Enough show to show the waist band of his nike compression shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sup Scott, you're just in time!\" Bobby smiled as he unlocked the door. \"We were gonna have some food deliver, but we wanted to wait for Josh too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's right here, dude!\" Scott lifted up his hand as he showed the four other men a dazed and confused tiny Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he still tiny? He normally grows back to normal before he come home.\" Bobby scratched his head as he started to let the guys inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he does?\" Scott looked down at Josh with an apologetic look. \"I'm sorry, boss. I can bring you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally slowed down enough to be put out of his daze, Josh looked up at the somewhat sad and dumb face of Scott. \"No, no this is fine Scott! Maybe it'll be more fun to hang out with all you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One less mouth to feed too.\" Jon laughed as he looked around the entry way of Josh's house. \"No offense boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken! I won't eat much. But yeah guys make yourself at home!\" Josh yelled out, wondering if any of them even heard him. It didn't really matter much at this point. Josh had Scott set him down on his kitchen counter as he watched the men look around the house, having Bobby give them the tour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on and the guys got a little more comfortable, things started to get a little exciting when the group decided to...     <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Being far too small, Josh knew even a drop of alcohol would be more than enough to intoxicate him, so despite all the drunken offers Josh did not indulge himself. It was pretty funny seeing the other guys get drunk though. All of them had lost their shirts at one point or another from either being too hot, or from spilling something on themselves. Either way, Josh didn't complain as the five men were having a good time. Josh watched curiously as he saw Bobby setting up cups out on the dining room table for beer pong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as he cleans it up later...\" Josh said to himself, not wanting spilled beer all over his table. Josh watched as Bobby filled each cup with a little beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoooo! Who wants to play some beer pong?!\" Bobby called out to his buddies as they laughed and chatted over some music playing. Josh watched as the men turned, seeming interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, we wouldn't have even teams.\" Lyle noted, knowing there was five of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine I'll watch, dude. I'll play winner with who ever gets the most cups on the losing team!\" Bobby smiled as he stumbled a bit away from the table, simply leaving the 20 cups filled with beer just in the middle of the table. Josh watched as Scott and Xavier both teamed up, determined they could be the two older guys of team Lyle and Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys even know how to play? Or are you both too old?\" Xavier taunted as Jon started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homie you're one year younger than me!\" Jon laughed as they bantered back and fourth. Meanwhile Josh watched as Bobby came over near him with a drunken smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you know you wanna play too! Remember the gummy bear? I call this one, remember the cup!\" Josh heard Bobby say to him, confused before Bobby reached down for him and quickly snagged him before he could react. Josh squirmed, not know what Bobby meant as he carried him over to the table of unorganized cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for this bros? Josh wants to play too! Try and remember the cup!\" Bobby said as he dropped Josh into one of the beer filled cups and started shuffling them around  before helping the other four laughing me organize them to ten on each side. Josh swirled and screamed about as he saw hands grabbing and moving the cup he was dropped in as he desperately kicked his feet and flailed his arms to stay afloat in the beer. Finally, Josh stopped and was able to keep himself afloat thanks to the carbonation in the beer, but the smell was quite unbearable. Meanwhile, Josh had no idea what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dudes hopefully you remember the cup!\" Bobby laughed, feeling a bit like Tyler right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all laughed as they started shooting balls back and fourth. Bobby smiled, still pretty drunk, not realizing the danger he jokingly put his friend in once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game went on, Josh head a ping pong ball bop and smack against his cup every now and then. Once in awhile his cup would get moved as the men made different arrangements as the game went on. Josh shivered in fear, as it seemed like less and less cups were on his side now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally...       </span></div></div>",

In an instant and true to the shot, Josh screamed as massive white ball came crashing into the cup. Slammed under the liquid and forced to the side of the cup, Josh considered himself lucky for not getting knocked out by the ball. Shaking his head, Josh watched as the ball got pulled out of the cup by a pair of fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot, Scotty boy!\" Josh heard Xavier yell. \"Drink up old man Jon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" Josh heard Jon's voice as his cup was being picked up. Briefly, Josh saw Jon's face as he started tipping the liquid toward his mouth, washing Josh away in a torrent of beer toward the handsome giant's open mouth. Josh fruitlessly tried to swim away from Jon's mouth, but it was no used as he was easily swept up in the current, rushing past Jon's lips toward the back of his throat in a glug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon wiped his mouth, completely forgetting they were supposed to be checking cups as they went. Setting aside the cup, they continued the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes went by as Jon had to chug the last cup, feeling really tipsy now at this point. Xavier and Scott high fived each other as they won with just one cup left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott you were on fire!\" Xavier slapped the slightly larger man on the back. Scott picked up the last cup, chugging it down as reward for himself. Scott burped as he looked over at Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Jonny boy was the weak link. You're better of playing with Lyle, bro.\" Scott slurred his words a little as Bobby started to laugh and fill the cups back up with beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" Josh screamed in the sea of warm beer in Jon's stomach. \"Oh god what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fumbled for a moment before he managed to find some sort of chunk of food, undoubtedly undigested food then men had ordered earlier in the night. Josh then, Josh felt his pocket, remembering he had his phone on him. Pulling it out, Josh looked down at it, hoping somehow it had survived the torrents of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at it Josh saw...    </span></div></div>",

Scrolling through his phone Josh winced for a moment at the light in produced in the pitch black organ, but quickly regained his determination to make a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it's working!\" Josh exclaimed excitedly as he scrolled to Bobby's number. Hitting the call button, Josh held it up to his ear and waited. \"Come on Bobby pick up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bobby was setting up the game now standing beside Lyle as his partner, determined to dethrone the team of Scott and Xavier. Having left his phone on the kitchen counter, it buzzed violently but nobody was there to pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stood by, watching as they started the game, a little pissed Scott did so well and made him look bad. Sipping a beer and feeling a little light headed, Jon looked down at his phone, playing around on it and swiping through social media without really reading or looking at anything in his drunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No good.\" Josh said to himself as Bobby's phone went to voice mail a second time now. \"I think he was going to play beer pong next... what about Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a moment, but even if Tyler did pick up by the time he came to the rescue he's be nothing more than a scrap of extra protein for Jon's body. \"Wait! What about Jon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just realized, calling the person he was currently trapped inside might be the best idea. After all if Jon was currently just watching them play he might be on his phone anyway. Looking through his contacts, Josh knew he saved Jon's number somewhere from when he hired him. Finding it, Josh hit the call button and crossed his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his phone, Jon saw he had a call coming from \"Boss man\" as he backed away into the quiet of the kitchen and picked the phone up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss dude! Am I supposed to be at work right now?\" Jon asked, somewhat forgetting what he was doing as he took a sip of his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jon, you're at my house.\" Josh responded on the other end. \"More importantly, I'm in your stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, bro?\" Jon answered a bit confused. \"Oh yeah this is your house, I forgot you weren't here. Where are you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your stomach Jon!\" Josh cried desperately on the phone. \"I was in a cup of beer, you drank me! You have to let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, bud.\" Jon set his beer down and rubbed his forehead. \"You aren't making sense, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Listen closely okay?\" Josh tried to stay calm and speak slowly, knowing Jon must be really drunk to be this confused. \"I'm currently shrunk really small. You said early I was pretty close to microscopic, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so.\" Jon tried to think back to earlier. \"So you're still really small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Then you guys started playing beer pong.\" Josh continued to explain slowly. \"Bobby dropped me in a cup, and you accidentally drank me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I?\" Jon continued to rub his head.

He's too good for us!\" Bobby joked and smiled as he put a hand on Lyle's shoulder, acting like he was upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Bobby!\" Jon smiled back , shoving his friend playfully. \"I forget what the call was even about. Who cares! Let's play more beer pong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on!\" Scott grabbed a pong ball, ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude! You take a break.

Grabbing the beer, he cracked it open and started to fill his cup all the way to the top. \"Nahhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched in terror as a massive torrent of carbonated yellow came rushing in the cup, swirling him around in a vortex as it filled all the way to the top. Splashing an sputtering in the liquid, Josh gasped for air as now he actually had a fairly good view at nearly the top of the cup. Although Josh's vision was getting a little blurry as he slowly got intoxicated himself, Josh could make out the massive muscular form of Lyle looming over him letting his can of beer drip to the last drop into the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyle? Lyle!!\" Josh questioned for a moment as he vision adjusted before splashing and waving his arms up at the giant. Unfortunately, Josh saw Lyle turn away as he could see the massive man grabbing more of their food from early, stuffing it in his mouth before chewing briefly and swallowing. Stopping his waving for a moment, Josh was momentarily transfixed on the studly man. The side view of the giant that he had right now was fantastic, able to see every curve and chisel of muscle in his body from the side, all the way down to his massive ass sticking out of his jeans even worse than before now as he drunkenly let the waist fall down fully below his glutes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Lyle looks really good right now...\" Josh swooned as the man snobbishly scratched his abs and burped again. Josh couldn't help but to continue to stare, normally the behavior would have been a bit obnoxious to him, but right now Josh couldn't help but drunkenly admire the enormous jock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Josh saw the man turn. Reaching down for the cup, Josh realized Lyle was undoubtedly going for sip of his beer. As Lyle lifted the cup, Josh...      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow... just look at his abs...\" Josh admired, the alcohol completely going to his head. It was like everything was moving in slow motion as Josh traveled pasted Lyle's incredible abs to his massive chest. \"Woah... they're like mountains... but on the side of a cliff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't really register what was happening as Lyle lifted the cup to his face. The enormous jock easily opened his throat and chugged the cup of beer in mere seconds. With a rush like a raging river, Josh slashed and gasped, not fully understanding what was going on as he was rushed into the handsome blonde's mouth and started his journey down deep inside the 6'11\" titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ulp... ulp... ulp...\" It didn't take long for Lyle to drain the solo cup. He was a big guy after all, chugging a small cup full like that was nothing special. Lyle wiped his mouth as he reach back down for more of his food, stuffing more in his mouth and grabbing another beer as he made his way back out to where the guys were playing beer pong. Sizing up the game, it looked like Bobby and Jon were behind a cup. Swallowing his food as he made his way over to them, Lyle grabbed a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celeb shot!\" He called as he tossed a ball, landing it in with a plunk on the other side. \"There now it's even, bros!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice Lyle!\" Bobby patted the huge jock on the back. Lyle drunkenly nodded his head arrogantly as he backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dude!\" Jon nudged Lyle in the stomach. Lyle didn't finch, however the nudge did cause his stomach to bubble a bit before the man belched loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, bros. I'm still hungry. Just made more room in there.\" Lyle patted his own stomach as the guys continued to play their game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat, dude.\" Bobby smiled at Lyle. \"We ordered way too much food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Lyle laughed as he left the room thinking about why they ordered too much. Counting in his head he knew there were five of them here. \"Why did we order for like six again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle wondered aloud as he opened another pack of wings and sucked the meat quickly off the bone with ease. \"Who paid for this again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind fuzzy, Lyle tried not to worry about it as he took a long chug of his beer, swaying drunkenly slightly as he set it down almost spilling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops...\" Lyle blinked as he grabbed another wing. \"Oh yeah wasn't micro-bro with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle ate the wing as he tried to think, but couldn't quite remember where the little guy wandered off to. Shrugging, Lyle figured he wasn't dumb enough to get himself in any dangerous situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's head spun as he head another plop fall from above as large piece of food was deposited in Lyle's stomach. Still drunk, Josh didn't completely understand what had happened. He was able to put enough of two and two together to realize Lyle had accidentally eaten him however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Josh's head spun, sobering up a bit as he squinted around in the darkness, lucky he hadn't already been flung into digestive fluid and quickly eaten up by the giant's stomach. \"I'm in Lyle's... stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, still having thought's of Lyle's incredible body. \"I'm on the other side of those abs then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was reminded of when he stared at Bobby's abs earlier, it has happened again but now with a different blonde titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... that's awesome!\" Josh unintelligently believed. \"Lyle's stomach is so incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around in awe as he saw the walls churning and listened to the moan's of the giant's guts working on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait... he's going to digest me isn't he?\" Josh finally reasoned to himself. \"That's cool, but I don't think I wanna die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering his phone in his pocket, Josh reached inside and squinted as he looked for Lyle in his contacts. Hitting the call button Josh blinked as he held the phone to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his phone vibrate from his pocket, Lyle reached down and looked to see it was Josh calling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, micro-bro! What's up?\" Lyle smiled, wondering if he could find out where the little guy had ran off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Lyle!\" Josh responded nervously, feeling suddenly apprehensive about talking to the handsome lax bro after he had just been staring at him a few minutes ago. \"Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, micro-bro?\" Lyle asked as he took a sip of his beer. \"I was just thinking about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you were?\" Josh asked nervously, still at a lost of words and embarrassed about calling the man. As Josh answered, a stream of beer came into the man's stomach, washing him off his feet as he was barely able to hold onto his phone as he was swept away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle paused as he heard the noise, not sure what it was. \"Uhhh micro-bro? I hear like running water? You in the bathroom or something?\" Lyle asked as he walked out of the kitchen and made his way up stairs to the bathroom he knew about. Lyle turned the water on and off at the sink to see if the sound was similar. \"Bro, you still there? I forget you're micro right now, right bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled but was able to cling onto something and pull himself out of the liquids of Lyle's stomach before he could answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I'm small right now!\" Josh was able to answer, starting to realize just how hard he was going to have to get over his shyness with Lyle if he wanted to escape being digested by the behemoth. \"Lyle... this is going to sound crazy but right now I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was interrupted as Lyle burped again, the motions of going up and down the stairs stirring up some gas in in stomach. Lyle rubbed his stomach as he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that last part, micro-bro? Sorry I've been burping like crazy tonight!\" Lyle asked, waiting for a response. Making his way back into the kitchen, Lyle didn't hear anything besides some weird sloshing and gurgling noises. Having no idea what they were, Lyle simply smiled and spoke again. \"Well, micro-bro, I'm glad to hear you're okay. Give me a call back if you need anything, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle hung up the phone, satisfied figuring the little guy must've just found a nice place to hang out and maybe sleep for the night. Sticking his phone in his pocket, Lyle took another swig of his beer as he rejoined the guys. Jumping into the next game of beer pong, Lyle enjoyed the rest of his night unaware of how his good looks and love for beer would ultimately mean his micro-bro's demise.            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snapping out of his infatuation, Josh realized he was about to be drank by the blonde stud! Screaming at the top of his lungs and waving, Josh tried to splash and make himself as noticeable as possible. As Josh approached Lyle's lips closer and closer, Josh looked up at his huge eyes as he saw them dart down and look at his position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lyle questioned as he saw the small speck splashing about in his beer. Lyle looked closer, before noticing it was actually Josh. \"Micro-bro? What are you doing in my beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swam to the edge of the cup, holding on to the edge and sighing with relief as Lyle set down the cup and pulled over a chair and leaned in close to his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh you good, micro-bro?\" Lyle leaned in looking closer as he saw Josh resting near the rim now. \"Again, micro-bro what were you thinking hoping in my beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to be in here!\" Josh called out to Lyle who blinked him a bit, clearly pretty drunk. \"Remember? Bobby dropped in in one of the beer pong cups!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle scratched his chin for a second trying to remember. \"Ohhhh yeah.... remember the cup or something?\" Lyle laughed, finding it funny now thinking back. \"Guess we all forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you guys forgetting almost got me drank!\" Josh yelled desperately, still a bit miffed Lyle is just leaving him in the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, bro. I guess now that I think about it you were in the last cup, huh?\" Lyle still chuckled, thinking this was pretty funny in his drunken state. \"You're lucky, micro-bro. If Xavier or Scott sank your cup, Jon or I wouldn't have even known!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well aware...\" Josh huffed. It wasn't like he wasn't grateful for his luck, but he wished Lyle would show at least a little more concern over Josh's near end in either his or Jon's drunken bellies. \"Either way, can you let me out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, micro-bro?\" Lyle looked confused at Josh. \"You're swimming in a pool of beer! That's awesome bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't really like beer...\" Josh stuttered, feeling like he was ruining the fun Lyle was imagining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, micro-bro? Come on, that's got to be like every dude's dream.\" Lyle smiled at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's cold... and I really don't like the taste...\" Josh complained as Lyle looked down on him. \"Plus it's so deep I might drown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you micro-bro! I'll make the pool shallower and a little warmer. I don't know if I can do anything about the taste though...\" Lyle said to Josh as he picked up the cup. \"Maybe the BBQ sauce from the wings will make it not as bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked, as he question was quickly answered as Lyle slurped him into his mouth in a little sip of beer. Josh screamed as he was pulled into the darkness of Lyle's mouth. The giant started to squish Josh around in the liquid, under his tongue and into his cheeks before letting it rest somewhere in the middle. For Josh it was certainly warmer, and much shallower, but the smell in Lyle's mouth smelled like nothing but beer and wings as Josh felt like he might puke from the collective horrible fumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that? Better, micro-bro?\" Lyle asked, with really no regard with how he spoke as he sputtered a bit and Josh was washed about as his tongue moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyle! Let me out!\" Josh yelled as he saw the giant's mouth close again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear you in there, micro-bro!\" Lyle spoke back to Josh, giving Josh at least the assurance that he wouldn't be heard. \"I'm guessing it's super cool though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around in the mix of light and dark. It was pretty cool, seeing the massive tongue and lines of perfect teeth, before looking to the back of Lyle's throat with his massive uvula and what looked like a terrifying drop of death. if it wasn't for the putrid smell, it might have been a much more interesting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I just wanna puke...\" Josh said to himself, wondering how awkward it would be to puke while inside someone else's mouth. Holding it in, Josh didn't want his time with Lyle to be any weirder than it's been already. Just then, Josh heard a rumble from Lyle's throat as a disgusting wet belch washed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, micro-bro!\" Lyle's voice boomed out around him. \"I was holding that one in for awhile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held his nose and curled his legs, arm bumping his phone as he remembered he had it in his pocket. Reaching in as he waded in waist deep beer, Josh figured if he called Lyle it might be easier to communicate. Calling the giant and putting the phone to his ear, Josh heard the man's voice boom out around him and through the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, micro-br-- woah! Bro! I can heard my... self through...\" Lyle got confused hearing his own voice boom through the phone before he moved the phone a bit away from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... can you hear me now? You should probably not talk as loud.\" Josh asked, hoping Lyle kept the speaker near his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro.... I'll just try to talk quieter...\" Lyle started to speak softer as he could still quite clearly hear his voice echo through Josh's phone. \"You having fun in there, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip. He felt bad, because he didn't want to disappoint the giant. Lyle was a very friendly guy but sometime he was a bit spontaneous. However, Josh didn't expect his spontaneous nature to have him end up swishing him around in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really cool, Lyle.\" Josh held back the whole truth, but it was admitably still really neat. \"I'm not cold anymore, or drowning. So those are both good things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooord, bro!\" Lyle whispered with enthusiasm. \"Hey, know what would be sweet? You should go to the back of my throat and take a selfie, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Josh asked, failing to see how that would be sweet at all. \"That seems a little dangerous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-bro. I'm not gonna swallow you or anything.\" Lyle spoke softly, trying to reassure Josh. \"Don't you think it'd be a super dope picture though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked to the back of Lyle's throat. Seeing some of the beer drain down the throat little by little, Josh could see strands of saliva sticking from the roof of his mouth to his massive uvula as it would occasionally wiggle with each of Lyle's breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, Lyle. I'll do it. But you'll have to keep your mouth open so I can see...\" Josh requested, knowing if it was too dark he was liable to stumble down the man's throat in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Lyle's mouth shut, sealing him in darkness for a few moments before it opened up again. Looking out the mouth, Josh could see Lyle's face mouth agape in a mirror in one of the bathrooms. Josh could see Lyle giving him a thumbs up from the mirror as he hung up his phone. Josh swallowed his fear as he wadded out of the poor of beer on Lyle's tongue, and wandered deeper and deeper to the back of the gigantic jock's throat. Approaching closer and closer to the edge, Josh figured he was close enough for a good selfie. Pulling out his phone Josh tried to smile despite his fear and...     <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh posed an awkward smile as he snapped a picture of himself before turning his phone and looking at it. Scampering a good several feet away from the throat in the process, Josh examined the picture. Looking at himself, he could see the awkwardness in his smile, but it was kind of cool seeing Lyle's massive uvula in the background as well as the partially lit interior of the jock's bottomless throat. Just then Josh looked up as he saw Lyle texting from outside the mouth as Josh got a message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howd it turn out?\" The message from Lyle simply read. Josh replied by sending the man the picture, who in turn chuckled as he looked at it. Josh saw Lyle had responded and looked at the next message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"bro imma close my mouth u should record this next part!\" The message read as Josh saw Lyle starting to close his massive mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" Josh called out, not sure what was happening next. He knew he has no say in what was going to happen though, so the tiny explorer pulled his phone out and turned on the video recording. With a tiny light from his phone Josh looked around as he heard a rumble from Lyle's throat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Josh said aloud as a massive belch came roaring up from Lyle's stomach. Josh couldn't keep his footing this time as he was sent flying backwards screaming and holding instinctively onto his phone the whole time before he was stopped in something soft. Eyes adjusting he looked up and saw Lyle's face as the giant man had apparently caught him in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get that, micro-bro?\" Lyle asked excitedly as Josh shut the recording off. Josh sent Lyle the video, re-watching it himself from the oh no all the way to Lyle asking if he got it, plus all the chaos in between! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-bro! Between this and the self this shit is gold! I love the little \"oh no\" you gave right before I burp! Bro that shit's classic!\" Josh sat in Lyle's had as the man replayed the video a few times, laughing to himself each time. \"Bro and that selfie! You look worried I'm about to swallow you, micro-bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't sure. Also I wasn't sure that you weren't going to swallow me after you told me to start recording...\" Josh admitted, having the throat cross his mind that Lyle might've wanted Josh to record that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bro, I didn't think of that!\" Lyle leaned his head back in thought. \"That'd be dope though! You down to be part of my dinner, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The last thing I want is to be sloshed around in your wings and beer filled guts.\" Josh dejectedly shot at Lyle who seemed a bit taken-aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, micro-bro. I was only kidding.\" Lyle waved his hand drunkenly at Josh. \"You know how much trouble it would be to puke you back up? It'd be a waste of the meal I ate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it was the difference between me staying down there or not, I don't think it'd be a waste.\" Josh looked down feeling a little bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on micro-bro! I'm still kidding!\" Lyle shook his head as he carried Josh out of the bathroom, stumbling now into Josh's bedroom and sitting down on the bed. \"Woah, this your room micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahh...\" Josh answered, still feeling a bit down. Josh lost his footing however as Lyle laid down on the bed, setting Josh on his abs as he sat back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so down, micro-bro! Big bro Lyle won't let anything bad happen to you!\" Lyle looked across his body at Josh and smiled. \"Hey, how about another selfie! I'll be in this one too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gave a weak smiled as he pulled out his phone, snapping a shot and looking at the picture. He could see he looked a bit down in the picture, but all the way what looked like miles Lyle made a face, sticking his tongue out and making a Shaka with his hands in the background. Josh sent it to his friend as he pulled out his phone to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! I look so far away!\" Lyle commented, unable to believe just how far it looked like he was. \"Is that really how I look for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah more or less.\" Josh answered weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-bro, I can't hear you.\" Lyle scooped Josh up and brought him closer to his face. \"You'll have to speak up and stop looking so sad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" Josh answered, embarrassed. It was bad enough Josh was crushing on the giant earlier, but even after a little teasing it was enough to send the poor tiny into the dumps. \"I'm sorry, I just didn't realize you were just teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-bro you have to stop apologizing.\" Lyle laughed. \"We're bros, bro! We just give each other a hard time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle sat up, holding Josh near his chest as he got out of Josh's bed. Standing up and stretching Lyle turned and looked back at the bed. \"Bro, your bed is comfy. I'll have to sleep with you one of these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's face turned red, as he really wasn't ready for that kind of comment. \"W-well y-you're w-welcome to use it tonight if you want?\" Josh stuttered as he hid his face from looking up at the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to get me a little more drunk first, micro-bro!\" Lyle winked down at Josh. \"Then I promise to spend the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle laughed as he left Josh's room making his way back downstairs, rejoining the others. Watching them, it would seem they had finished a few games of beer pong in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Lyle where have you been, dude?\" Jon slumped over to Lyle. \"What are you holding, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, it's micro-bro! He was in the beer I almost drank!\" Lyle laughed as he looked over at Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Bobby exclaimed as he looked at the cups upon cups of beer they had gone through. \"I forgot, but I guess it worked out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good thing, dude.\" Scott chimed in as well. \"I totally forgot too. Good thing Lyle was paying attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we had some fun with it too!\" Lyle smiled as he pulled out his phone, showing the guys the selfies Josh took as well as the video. \"But I am still the best, bro! I think I deserve a beer for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby left and cracked open a beer for Lyle, thankful that he was watchful enough not to actually drink his tiny roommate. \"Bro, the rest of these are on me tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle chugged in down fast, clearly having experience chugging beers as Bobby handed him another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more beers and games happened throughout the night eventually...        </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things started to calm down a bit as the night went on. Xavier had bid his friends good night as he left Josh's house not long ago. Jon had recently passed out on the couch and Bobby had gone to bed. Lyle and Scott however remained, keeping Josh up as well as both me seemed pretty wide awake and wanting Josh to stay up with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepily, Josh was now sitting on his dining room table as he looked up at Scott and Lyle converse with each, both still with beers in hand and both very much active and awake. For Josh it was pretty surreal though, considering both men matched each other's heights at the massive scale of 6'11\". Neither of them wearing their shirts from earlier, and both of them looking like they're practically losing their jeans and or shorts as they slumped well past their asses, constantly needed to be pulled back up. But the two men had more interesting things to do as Lyle showed Scott his phone again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's such a crazy picture!\" Scott looked at the selfie Josh took in the back of Lyle's throat. \"Your dangely-thingy looks like one of those big things that hang from a cave ceiling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but laugh. It was no surprise, even if he wasn't drunk Josh figured Scott would have difficulty coming up with the right words. Josh continued to watched the men as he heard the video of Josh getting burp launched out of Lyle's mouth for at least the thirtieth time tonight. Both men laughed at the video as Josh simply rolled his eyes, very sleepy at this point. Closing his eyes for only a moment before he felt the presence of both men looming over him. If Josh had been his normal height, the table would measure just over crotch height, but for these two massive giants they loom well past down to about mid thigh, Josh stared up at them, exposed compression shorts on the both of them all the way up to their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Josh. You should take a selfie of us looming over you!\" Scott slurred a little as he put an arm around Lyle and the two men posed as they loomed. Josh swallowed nervously as he pulled out his phone and snapped a shot of himself from a low angle, struggling to get both massive giants in the shot. Unsure if either man could hear him, Josh just sent the selfie to the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broooo, we're fucking huuuuge!\" Lyle looked at the picture, unable to fathom that this was what Josh was actually seeing from his point of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuude, we look like this to you all the time?\" Scott asked Josh as he got down on his knees to get a bit closer to Josh, although he was now only about mid abdomen level with the table instead. Josh watched as Lyle did the same, however they still loomed quite intimidatingly from abdomen up over him. \"Take another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did as he was commanded. After all, these guys were drunk and the last thing he wanted was to argue with a drunk giant. Josh took another selfie as the guys posed over him and sent it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooo we're still so far away looking!\" Lyle laughed as he looked at the picture. Lyle got all the way down now, resting his chin on the table as looked down at Josh, much closer to eye level now. \"Sup, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved awkwardly at Lyle's handsome but clearly drunken face as Scott lowered down to his chin as well. Josh's vision was now completely obscured by the two handsome men's faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one now dude, this one will be dope!\" Scott winked and stuck his tongue out as Lyle did a similar pose. Josh had to back up though this time. There was no way he'd get both giant's faces if he was too close. Snapping the picture again, Josh sent it to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men stood back up as they looked at the pictures, now loomed over Josh without really acknowledging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! It looks like he's on your tongue, sort of!\" Lyle laughed as Josh's portion of the selfie lined up with Scott's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! It does! Hey that gives me an idea!\" Scott smiled as he reached down, pinching Josh between his fingers carefully without warning. Josh screamed as he was zoomed up to Scott's face with incredible speed. \"Dude, take a selfie of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott held Josh over his head, tilting it back and opening his mouth as he lowered Josh down a couple inches away from being put inside. Panicked at first, Josh realized Scott wasn't actually dropping him in. Doing as he was commanded, Josh took another selfie as out of the corner of his eye he saw Lyle also take a picture. Now holding Josh in his hand, the men shared the photos they took around with each other. In particular Josh looked at the one Lyle took, as it looked like Scott was lowering an indistinguishable crumb into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's how small I look to them?\" Josh focused on the picture. It was crazy for him to see just how small he was from their point of view. Josh turned and looked up at Scott as he chuckled at the picture Josh took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is wild! Look how small he is, but then look at him up close right over my mouth!\" Scott laughed as he set his phone down to take a sip of his beer. Josh couldn't help but smile, it was fairly harmless fun after all. Perhaps it was even giving them men a better prospective of just how small he was. Feeling like he was having fun, Josh posed for a self of his own from Scott's hand, making it look like he was pinching Lyle's nose. Josh smiled as the picture turned out well and sent it to the two giants as they were transfixed on their phones. Scott burst out laughing at it was Lyle chuckled and looked over at Scott's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a sneaky one, micro-bro!\" Lyle sauntered over closer to Scott now. \"You're like those people who take a picture acting like they're holding up the leaning tower of Pisa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People take pictures of themselves holding up pizza?\" Scott asked, blinking as he was a bit confused. Lyle looked down at Josh before looking back at Scott laughing. \"What? We still have some pizza left right? Let's put Josh on a pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro... that's not what I'm talking about.\" Lyle laughed. \"Besides wouldn't you rather keep having him take selfies with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, he can take selfies on the pizza. It'd be sweet.\" Scott argued back. Meanwhile, Josh just sat there, listening to the go back and fourth. It was a bit awkward, Josh was starting to just feel like an object of their amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least this is all harmless...\" Josh thought to himself, unlike the \"fun\" Bobby and Tyler put him though before. Some time went by and the two men came to an agreement that they wanted to...                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh awkwardly smiled and posed as he stood by the gaping throat. However, as Josh went to click for the picture, he slipped and lost his footing. With a scream, Josh slid backwards right into the darkness of Lyle's throat. With a tiny gulp, Josh found himself being slurped down the the giant's esophagus, much like he'd experienced once before with Bobby and Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, bro!\" Lyle gasped. It was very hard for him to tell, but he definitely saw Josh disappear down his throat. Coupled with his involuntary swallow, he knew he had accidentally sent the tiny man on a trip down deep within his body. Lyle put a hand on his chest, swearing he could feel the faint struggles of the tiny man go further down until disappearing into his stomach. \"Woah! That's crazy! Micro-bro I could feel you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle talked to himself, realizing that Josh might've not been able to hear him at all actually. Lyle realized he still had his phone in his hand as he called Josh. A few moments went by before Lyle heard Josh pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Micro-bro! You good?\" Lyle asked, realizing it was a bit of an awkward question to ask someone he had just swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyle! You told me you weren't going to swallow me!\" Josh complained on the other end. Lyle simply laughed and apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, bro! It was an accident! But hey did you get the picture?\" Lyle asked curious if Josh snapped anything before slipping down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important! Lyle! You have to get me out of here!\" Josh pestered Lyle, hoping to keep the giant man focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, bro. You've got like five seconds to send it to me! Hey you should take a selfie in my stomach, bro!\" Lyle spoke excitedly into the phone, wondering what a selfie from inside his own stomach would look like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Lyle this isn't funny!\" Josh complained, his words not reaching the drunk man's ears though. Lyle simply rolled his eyes, feeling like Josh was being a bit of a kill joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro. I think you need to cool off.\" Lyle answered a bit drunkenly, feeling like Josh wasn't being reasonable. \"So I'm just gonna hang up for now, okay? Just mellow out in there, micro-bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle hung up the phone and shook his head. Looking at himself in the mirror, he couldn't help but admire himself a bit for a few seconds. Lyle flexed his abs a bit, feeling it was a little surreal he had a tiny person on the other side of them. But also it was like a once in a lifetime opportunity for him to have someone take a selfie in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he making such a big deal out of this...\" Lyle drunkenly said to himself. He couldn't help but smirk at his dashing good looks though. \"He should feel like the luckiest dude ever. I mean look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle flexed his arms for himself in the mirror. Resting his hands on his hips, Lyle shook his head with a chuckle. \"Guess I can let him out in a little bit. Bro, that sucks he's being such a little shit about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle walked out of the bathroom, making his way into a bedroom and sitting down on the bed. Lyle looked down at his phone as he laid back, getting a little comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better send me those pictures, bro.\" Lyle said to himself, looking down at his abs. Lyle rested his phone on his chest as he closed his eyes. A few moments went back and...     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyle immediately opened his eyes as his phone started to buzz. Looking at the device, he saw he had two new photos from Josh. Looking at the first, it was a very comedic look as Josh's face was in a mix of panic and confusion as he looked like he was falling backwards into fleshy darkness. The next Lyle could see Josh gave a bit of a forced smile as the background was a bit hard to make out, but it was definitely wrinkly and stomach like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! I think I can see a piece of chicken!\" Lyle looked closer at the photo as he saw what looked like chicken he ate floating in some goop in the background. Satisfied, Lyle called Josh back and waited the tiny man to pick up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeee? Just go with the flow micro-bro!\" Lyle antagonized Josh a little. \"Admit it, it's awesome being inside me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle could faintly hear a sigh from Josh on the other end. \"It is pretty cool, Lyle. But at the same time I really don't want to die in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, bro? I don't want you to die either!\" Lyle sat up, realizing now finally in his drunken state that's what was worrying Josh. \"Listen, bro. My gut is telling me you're going to be fine. I always listen to my gut, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud gurgle on the other side of the phone, Lyle could feel it too in his own body. \"Umm... Well I trust you, Lyle. But I don't know if I trust your gut on this one... I think it just wants me to be part of dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, I always trust my gut...\" Lyle repeated to Josh as he got up out of the bed and wandered back into the bathroom, admiring himself in the mirror once more. \"I'll know when the right time is to let you out, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... if you say so.\" Josh answered nervously. Lyle put a hand on his hip and tried to think of a way to make Josh feel less nervous. Without hanging up, Lyle took a picture of himself with his hand on his stomach and sent it to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check out that picture, micro-bro. Your eyes only, bro.\" Lyle said to Josh, feeling like that would give the tiny man more reason to want to stay inside the massive jock's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you look really good Lyle...\" Josh answered sheepishly. \"Hey Lyle, I have an idea if you're up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure micro-bro. What is it?\" Lyle smirked, feeling like Josh sounded a bit more secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it might be cool if I started recording down here.\" Josh started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro that sounds awesome!\" Lyle sounded up for it. \"I can't wait to see that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Maybe after I record for a few minutes I could record...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Hand falling off his chest, Lyle let his phone slip off to his side as he quickly drifted off into a deep sleep. Lyle never felt his phone start to buzz as he received two photos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... answer me...\" Josh looked at his phone desperately. Lyle's stomach churned and gurgled peacefully, as Josh did his best to stay out of the center of the organ, keeping to the sides where he felt most safe. Getting impatient, Josh had no idea why Lyle wasn't answering. He did what the giant wanted after all and sent the two pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey? You get those pictures? See you can let me out now!\" Josh texted to Lyle, waiting and seeing the message sent. Josh tapped his phone and bit his lip impatiently, waiting for a response. Looking at the time, not even a minute had gone by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not moving around. I'd be able to tell... I don't hear him talking either.\" Josh tried to rationalize, trying to figure out if something distracted him or not. \"What's going on out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was driving Josh crazy. Time seemed like it was just crawling as he waited for answer, each churn and gurgle of Lyle's body a constant reminder of just the type of peril he was in. Finally, Josh decided just to call him. Josh waited as the phone rang... and rang... and rang... before going to Lyle's voicemail. Josh didn't bother leaving a message as he called a second time. Twice to no avail Josh started to seriously weigh his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh filed through his contacts, finding Bobby's name, calling him with no response. Then Josh called Scott... then Jon... then Xavier... and finally even Tyler. No answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God! You normally can't get these guys off their stupid phones! But now they're all suddenly too busy to notice me calling?!\" Josh shouted angrily at nobody. Josh used the light from his phone to navigate through the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not like I haven't done this before.\" Josh said with some decent confidence as he sloshed through a bit of partially digested mess as he scanned the walls of Lyle's stomach. Sure enough, Josh was able to locate the sphincter leading out of the dangerous cavern, much like had had previously for Bobby and Tyler. Josh took a deep breath as he reached his hand into the sphincter and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Josh nearly dropped his phone as he excitedly picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby! Oh thank god!\" Josh happily cried out into his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about god, but I'm close.\" Bobby somewhat slurred on the phone in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are. Bobby listen. You have to save me.\" Josh started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why where are you, dude? I lost you at the party.\" Bobby seemed to struggle to remember just where Josh had even ended up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Bobby.\" Josh didn't feel like letting the man know this was more or less his fault he ended up here. \"I can tell you exactly where I am. Lyle accidentally swallowed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro...\" Bobby simply said on the other end. \"Really, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby! Please trust me!\" Josh plead, knowing he'd never lie to Bobby. \"He didn't do it on purpose, then I think he fell asleep! He's upstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I trust you more than anyone.\" Bobby slurred, which while touching, Josh knew time was of the essence. \"I'll find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Bobby...\" Josh said as he could hear Bobby start to move through the phone. It sounded like he enlisted the help of the other guys as part of the search, taking them a few minutes to convince them of Josh's whereabouts but ultimately getting a command over the drunken men. A few minutes went by as Josh could swear he even heard them come up stairs through Lyle's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's asleep on your bed, dude.\" Bobby finally said to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to get him to throw up.\" Josh ordered Bobby, looking around as he knew he'd have to change his location or risk falling into the pit of Lyle's stomach the moment they moved him. Feeling secure, Josh found a spot just in time as Lyle's body started to shift around suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's out cold, dude. We're dragging him to the bathroom.\" Bobby said to Josh, narrating their actions as they went. \"Scott, you and Xavier hold him, I'll stick my fingers down his throat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard Bobby give orders as he sounded a bit further away, like he set down the phone. But to Josh it was incredible hearing his best friend be willing to make another man puke just to save him.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, keep an eye for him when he come up.\" Josh heard Bobby still giving orders before Lyle's stomach started to lurch violently. Josh held on to a piece of half eaten food, not even carding what the chunk was, but hoping it was large enough to be forced up first. About a minute went by before Lyle was unconsciously throwing up in Josh's tub. Stunned from the sudden ejection from Lyle's body, Josh took a moment, before he saw a hand scooping him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got em!\" Josh looked up to see the muscular form of Jon scooping him out of the mess of vomit. Josh looked over to see Bobby sticking his hands out of Lyle's mouth, as the massive blonde was supported by Xavier and Scott, all of which were now looking at Josh.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, he really was in Lyle's guts!\" Xavier looked at Josh, astonished. Josh looked at Bobby, who simply had a look of relief on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...\" Bobby moved so he could be beside Jon. \"You are so lucky I looked at my phone, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't thank you guys enough...\" Josh looked at the four men who collectively saved him. Josh watched as Xavier and Scott started to slump Lyle over, however. \"Be careful with him, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, he almost killed you.\" Xavier rose and eyebrow as he looked at Josh. \"Like we aren't going to hurt him or nothing. But at least make the dude sleep on the floor as punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, dude.\" Bobby spoke a little softer to Josh. \"You don't have to stand up for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip. Lyle did make the conscious decision to leave him in his stomach after all. Maybe he did deserve this. But on the other hand, Josh truly did enjoy the time he spent with the titanous hunk. Josh considered reminding Bobby how Lyle only accidentally swallowed him because of his prank originally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided... </span></div></div>",

Josh bit his lip, he didn't want to blame Bobby or any of the other guys, especially since they had just saved his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident, I fell in and it was too high for me to climb out.\" Josh lied, wanting to protect Lyle from him being fully aware of playing with him, as well as the rest of the guys for completely forgetting about him. Josh bit his lip awkwardly, unsure if they'd buy the story or not. \"Lyle definitely didn't notice me in there, he went upstairs to use the bathroom and drank me by mistake on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough, dude.\" Scott frowned at Josh before looking Lyle. \"Any of us would've made that mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding, bro.\" Jon looked at Lyle's face, dripping with a bit of vomit and still out cold. \"He seems more messed up than any of us, no wonder he didn't notice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you guys are right.\" Xavier agreed with the rest of the guys, propping Lyle up a bit. Let's put him back in bed. Scott and Xavier started to drag him back into Josh's room as Bobby wiped the spit off the unconscious man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay him on his side, just in case dude.\" Bobby said as he finished wiping his face off with a wash cloth. Jon followed them into the room, still holding Josh as they got him into the bed, laying on his side facing off the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, if he hurls again at least it'll be on the ground.\" Xavier said as he finished positioning Lyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's smart, dude! I never would've thought of that!\" Scott looked at Xavier, still a bit drunk but far too easily impressed. Meanwhile, Josh looked up at Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, could you maybe let a little water run into your hands? I'm covered in uh.... stomach gunk.\" Josh tried to ask as nicely as possible. Jon took a moment to realize what Josh was saying, before acknowledging it and helping Josh clean off. With Josh clean, and Lyle safely in bed, the group felt like they could get back to enjoying themselves as the night was still young for the partiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often should we check on him?\" Scott asked, looking at Lyle, feeling some concern for his fellow gigantic friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just leave me here with him.\" Josh offered, knowing the guys wanted to go back to having fun. \"Just leave me on the other side of the bed so he doesn't accidentally roll over on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure, bro?\" Jon asked, raising an eyebrow as he looked down at the tiny man in his hand. \"I mean it's one thing to stick up for him, but another to look after him too, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the kind of guy Josh is, bro.\" Bobby looked over at Josh. \"Call us if you have any problems, or for whatever, dude. We'll be paying attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys!\" Josh smiled at the group as Jon set him down on the bed, opposite side from Lyle. Josh felt fairly safe, considering Lyle looked like he was miles away from him at his size. Each of the other men left the room, as Josh was left now alone with Lyle as the man laid unconscious facing away from him in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to fill him in, in the morning.\" Josh laid down and got comfortable. Confident that there would be no issues, Josh shut off his phone to conserve battery and tried to get some sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...    </span></div></div>",

But seeing Tyler's name gave him an idea as he remembered Tyler was scheduled for a morning shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tyler, can you open for me? Feel free to leave at noon and tell Bobby to close for me when he gets there.\" Josh texted Tyler, feeling like he should be able to delegate some responsibility away every now and then. Josh waited a few minutes before he got a few texts back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"fiiiiiiiine but u owe me bro\" Tyler's messaged read follow by. \"what happened last nite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't feel like typing the whole story and simply answered, \"I'll tell you later. It's a long story. Come by after work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aight\" Josh simply got as a response. Figuring it was good enough, Josh rolled over and tried to get more sleep, knowing he wasn't going anywhere until Lyle got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by and eventually Josh was rattled awake as a massive weight shifted on the mattress. Josh shot up and looked, seeing Lyle lumber his way out of the bed. Josh saw him push off his jeans as they were mostly off his body anyway and stumble out of the room to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, he's finally up.\" Josh said to himself, blushing a little bit as now he just stumbled into his bathroom wearing just a pair of compression shorts. Looking across the bed, Josh saw he left his phone. Sitting back and waiting, eventually Josh heard the toilet flush and Lyle came back into view, rubbing his head. Right away, Josh noticed something different as Lyle had marker drawn all over him. Specifically, on Lyle's abdomen Josh saw a crudely drawn stomach with a little stick figure in it. An arrow pointed to the figure labeling it as \"Josh\" while a speech bubble had him saying \"Help!\". This wasn't all as also on Lyle's face he had a speech bubble coming off his mouth onto his cheek that said \"Tiny people are food, not friends\". Apart from that there were other various markings and swirls all over the man's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, they must've been quiet to do all that!\" Josh said to himself, impressed he didn't wake up to hear any of this happen. Josh continued to watch Lyle as he bent down to grab his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this, bro...\" Lyle said to himself, checking his messages and missed calls. \"The fuck? Oh shit! ... Wait... On the bed, opposite side of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved, figuring he must've been reading the message out loud someone must've sent him to help him locate him in the morning. Lyle squinted as he walked around the bed to Josh's side, sitting on the ground as he looked over at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-bro?\" Lyle asked as he leaned in a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Lyle!\" Josh smiled, happy to see Lyle doing well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro... What happened last night? I got a message from Bobby saying not to panic, that he accidentally drank you and passed out with you in my stomach, but they helped me throw you up?\" Lyle squinted his eyes, not sure if he believed it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, sort of.\" Josh simply answered, not wanting to remind Lyle he actually intentionally left him down there. Lyle shook his head, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember some of it, micro-bro. You don't have to lie.\" Lyle looked back at the messages they had sent each other. \"See? I remember the selfie thing. Then your message after you sent them asking to be brought back up? Bro, I did that shit on purpose didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle looked down at his stomach, looking at the little stick figure in his \"stomach\". \"I deserve this, bro. Eating your host is probably a pretty big party foul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lyle it's fine.\" Josh tried to brighten the man up. \"First off you didn't do it on purpose. You were drunk, you just weren't thinking clearly. Also I fell down your throat. You never meant to swallow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, bro. I should've got you out right away... and judging from the time between these calls and messages I wasn't in a hurry.\" Lyle scrolled through his phone, looking at all the time stamps. \"Shit bro. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. Last night I actually had an incredible time.\" Josh looked over at the blonde stud, truly happy that he's gotten to spend time with the titan. \"I had a lot of fun hanging out with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle couldn't help but laugh, which seeing a smile on the jocks face made Josh feel a bit better. \"You're either a good liar or you have a wild idea of what fun is, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a terrible liar.\" Josh shrugged, not that the building of a man could notice. \"And I mean it. I mean aside from the near accidental digestion, you're a lot of fun to be around. Besides, even the last part was pretty exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle started laughing a second time, still in disbelief over what Josh was saying. \"Well micro-bro, you keep hanging around me I can promise you your life will always be pretty exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Lyle stood up, stretching his massive body and scratching his stomach. \"I'm gonna run downstairs and get some breakfast. I'll bring you something! Breakfast in bed, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Josh squeaked, not that Lyle could hear him, the giant man was already on the move out the door. Josh couldn't help but stare at the giant's perfect ass as it bounced and flexed with each step he took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle looked around the kitchen, unfamiliar with what Josh did or didn't have, but wanted to do something to make it up to the tiny man. While in his search, he couldn't help but smile as he thought about how Josh looked back at the night and proclaimed it as fun. Lyle's search was interrupted however, as he heard a knock at the front door. Disregarding how he was dressed, or that he was covered in drawings, Lyle went to the front door and answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuuup? Lyle?\" Tyler looked at the taller man in confusion. Fresh from work, Tyler still wore his red lifeguard board shorts and was shirtless. But his eyebrow rose a little at Lyle's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sup, bro. I didn't know you were coming by!\" Lyle greeted Tyler in a friendly tone. He noticed Tyler taking a long look at him however. \"It's a long story bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhhh seems like it dude.\" Tyler laughed as he let himself in and patted Lyle on the shoulder. \"Where's the pip-squeak? Unless he's yelling for help in your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle looked down at the drawing as Tyler pointed at it. Lyle immediately shook his head. \"Oh nah bro. He's upstairs in his room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word.\" Tyler nodded to Lyle as he turned to head upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What's he like for breakfast?!\" Lyle called out to Tyler as he started up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh make eggs and bacon!\" Tyler answered as he made it to the top of the stairs. Heading inside Josh's room, Tyler looked around the room and immediately rolled his eyes. \"Really, dude? You had me open because you're busy being tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh saw Tyler enter and chuckled a bit at Tyler's reaction. Pulling out his phone, Josh was able to get Tyler to locate him as the two sat down and talked about what happened the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the events that he had missed, Tyler burst out laughing at Josh's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is gold. No wonder Lyle is all covered in that shit too.\" Tyler chuckled, thinking about all the drawings on the man. \"Either way, don't forget dude. You owe me for bailing you out earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Josh was surprised after all he just told Tyler, that's what was on his mind. \"Come on Ty... I had a rough night. Can't I owe you tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh plead, not even sure what owing Tyler even entailed right now. Tyler tapped his chin thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you owe me double.\" Tyler gave an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double of what?\" Josh asked, legitimately curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I want.\" Tyler smirked. \"So what'll it be, dude. Now or double tomorrow?\"             <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt on the spot but decided it was best to deal with this...  </span></div></div>",

Whatever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed nervously, knowing that Tyler was capable of making his life total hell when he's in a mood like this. Against his will, Josh found himself being carried downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find him, bro?\" Lyle asked as he stood at the stove cooking eggs, seeing Tyler come around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little squirt? Yeah I brought him down with me.\" Tyler opened his palm to show Lyle. Lyle turned and looked at Josh sitting awkwardly in Tyler's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sup, micro-bro! Guess I wasn't fast enough to give you breakfast in bed!\" Lyle laughed, completely unaware of the fresh predicament Josh was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that, dude. Josh said I can have his breakfast.\" Tyler smirked as he looked down at Josh. Lyle was just finishing the food as he distributed it on two plates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not hungry, micro-bro?\" Lyle asked as he watched Lyle let Josh off his hand onto the table. \"I'm starved, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up little Joshie. Tiny people are food after all.\" Tyler chuckled, looking at Lyle's cheek. It took Lyle a moment before he realized what Tyler was talking about before he laughed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot about the shit on my cheek, bro!\" Lyle laughed as he ate some of his eggs. \"Nah, I don't think little Joshie wants to experience that again, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure he does, bro.\" Tyler shoved some food in his mouth. \"Since you're part of the exclusive club of dudes who have eaten the little shrimp, you should know he loves stuff like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to sweat. He didn't know what Tyler was talking about. Sure he liked being tiny, but to flat out say he enjoyed things like being humiliated and eaten isn't anything they'd ever talked about. Josh tried to speak up, but neither man was paying him any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, bro? I guess that makes sense. He was telling me how much fun he had last night.\" Lyle told Tyler, thinking about how it was a little weird Josh enjoyed the night so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Bobby and I have known for awhile.\" Tyler kept going on, much to Josh's surprise. \"He loves it when we mess with him. Bobby used to be really careful until he figured out how much Josh loves getting messed with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lyle looked down at Josh. \"So you liked it when I was messing with you, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Josh stuttered, feeling like this whole conversation was ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broooo, you're a terrible liar. Like you said!\" Lyle laughed at Josh, knowing Josh was lying even from a simple stutter. \"It's okay if you like it when we mess with you. Bros are always supposed to be messing with each other, but with you it's just so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy?\" Tyler filled in the word for Lyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally, bro.\" Lyle nodded at Tyler in understanding. \"It'd be shitty if you hated it. Bro your life would be hell then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe this. How quickly Tyler was able to corrupt Lyle. Josh sighed, maybe it wasn't all that bad. He did like it when Lyle toyed with him, as much as he hated to admit it. It just made Josh feel awkward to know that Tyler, Lyle and even Bobby all were fully aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the bright side, micro-bro.\" Lyle looked at Josh, clearly able to tell the tiny man was at least a little distraught. \"I felt guilty about teasing you before, now I don't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a good thing.\" Josh agreed. \"I never wanted you to feel bad about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, micro-bro. Then that means I won't feel bad about this!\" Lyle reached down suddenly, quickly snatching up Josh before sticking him in his mouth. Josh screamed as it was so sudden for him being dragged back into the titan's cavernous mouth. Josh squirmed and covered his nose, it reeked of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just don't swallow him.\" Tyler requested, knowing he still wanted a piece of the little man. \"I own that little bitch right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lyle asked, swishing Josh around in his mouth a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did him a pretty big favor. In exchange I own his tiny ass for the rest of the day, dude.\" Tyler crossed his arms, setting down his fork as he had finished his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, bro.\" Lyle spat Josh out into his hand, watching as the little guy was completely covered in spit. \"Guess you luck out, micro-bro. Or not? Not sure what's worse, my stomach or being owned by Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was simply in a daze, his head spun as he took deep breaths. He absolutely was not expecting Lyle to just randomly stick him in his mouth like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably being owned by me, dude.\" Tyler laughed with Lyle. \"Dude if he was in your stomach he'd be able to hide from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too true, bro!\" Lyle laughed as he handed Josh over to Tyler. \"Well micro-bro, if you're looking for a hiding spot I've got you covered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned to see Lyle rubbing his stomach, ironically on the stick figure. \"What did I get myself into?\" Josh asked himself, simultaneously enjoying the attention from Lyle but also feeling a bit overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Josh turned his attention to Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright listen up, little fella. There's two thing I want first. Number one, I'm hungry. Order me a pizza.\" Tyler commanded to the spit covered man in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you just ate!\" Josh tried persuade Tyler into reconsidering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hungry.\" Tyler leaned forward with some seriousness in his voice. \"Not unless you wanna end up in my stomach instead. You'll have to get comfy though, dude. Because you won't be coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of pizza?\" Josh asked, choosing to not tempt Tyler, not sure how far Tyler would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meat lovers. Make sure to get enough for my boi Lyle too.\" Tyler winked at Lyle who gave Tyler a smile and nod. Josh pulled out his phone, making the order and paying ahead with his card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all set. Should be here in like 20 minutes.\" Josh tried to smile, looking up at Tyler who looked down at Josh with sharp demanding eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. Well I know what you're doing for the next 20 minutes.\" Tyler smirked at Josh as he set the little man down on the table. Josh watched as Tyler propped his feet up on the table, sticking them in front of Josh. \"You made these babies do extra walking today. So give em a good massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the massive feet. Josh swallowed, it was very unlike Tyler to tease him with his feet. Josh didn't want to know what the consequences were if he didn't comply however. Josh went up the the rough skin, rubbing his hands into it as hard as he could. He knew it would take a lot of pressure for Tyler to actually feel it, however it proved to be a massive challenge as Josh could hardly breath due to the horrible stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing the rest of the day, dude?\" Tyler asked Lyle who was leaning back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, bro. Probably should wash this shit off me though.\" Lyle put a hand on his chest and abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, why don't you go do that, dude?\" Tyler asked. \"Josh had extra towels. I'm sure he'd show you where they are, but he's busy at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, bro.\" Lyle stood up as he made his way out of the room. \"Don't push him too hard while I'm gone, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He loves it, don't worry dude.\" Tyler shoved his feet into Josh a bit more. \"I can barely feel anything, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle laughed as he made his way out of the room, going up stairs to shower. All the while, Josh tried his hardest to keep massaging Tyler's rough skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by as Josh struggled to keep up with Tyler's constant demands for him to massage harder. Suddenly, Josh heard the doorbell ring as Tyler's head turned to the door. Frowning, he didn't want to put his feet down. Hoping Lyle was on his way down the stairs, Tyler waited a second before...         </span></div></div>",

Laying on his back, Josh listened as Tyler interacted with the pizza guy. A few minutes went by as Tyler came back with the pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave him a 20 dollar tip, on your card of course.\" Tyler smugly said as he came in and set the pizzas down. \"Seemed pretty surprised, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Josh panted, still fairly exhausted from all the massaging he just did. \"Happy I could make someone's day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard the sound of Lyle coming down the stairs as Tyler started to open the pizza. Josh watched the huge man enter to room, how clean of any marker on his body and back to wearing his jeans, but still hasn't relocated his shirt. Tyler looked over at Lyle and shook his head, a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn dude, if only you were like five minutes faster.\" Tyler chuckled as he looked down at Josh. \"You could've grabbed these and this little guy would still be hard at work on my feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh sorry, bro. That marker took forever to scrub off.\" Lyle looked down at his chest and abs, glad he got it all off. \"But bro, pizza's here! Good thing too, I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head as he laid there. He couldn't believe how much these giants ate. For Josh, he could never imagine having a full breakfast, followed by immediately stuffing his face with pizza. \"I wouldn't even have finished all the eggs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, dude?\" Tyler asked, feeling like he heard Josh's little squeaky voice. Josh sat up, feel like if Tyler was eating, he was safe from his friend's desires from now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying, if it was me I probably wouldn't even finish the eggs. I'm just surprised you're both still hungry.\" Josh explained, always impressed with how much they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair, you're so small even half an egg would be too much for you, micro-bro.\" Lyle laughed as he grabbed himself a piece of pizza as well. Josh shook his head, feeling like Lyle wasn't understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I mean if I was my normal size.\" Josh clarified. Meanwhile, Lyle simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro. That's what I meant.\" Lyle swallowed a gulp of his pizza. \"I mean if I was talking about your size right now, you probably couldn't handle a crumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, dude.\" Tyler fist bumped Lyle as he took a seat next to him. \"Seriously, bro maybe you could have some scraps later when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, Josh was remembering he was hungry. After all the breakfast he was supposed to have was stolen from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I could have some pizza? I'm really hungry actually.\" Josh asked, feeling like it was a little weird that he was pleading for a piece of pizza that he bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over at Lyle and rose an eyebrow. \"Hear that, Lyle. He's \"really hungry\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro. I know just what to give him then.\" Lyle smirked as he set down his pizza. Josh wasn't prepared for Lyle to...    </span></div></div>",

Josh screamed in horror as the acid of Lyle's stomach was making quick work of him now that the tiny man was very easily exposed to the organ's full force. It didn't take long as the tiny man helplessly flailed before sinking below the surface, nothing more than being part of the mixture in Lyle's stomach at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle turned over in his sleep, meanwhile. Shifting from laying on his stomach, to on his side, to laying up a bit, to laying flat. There was no rhyme or reason to the man's movement, he simply moved a lot in the unfamiliar bed that night. As the night went on, the other guys had gone home, and Bobby went to his own room. Briefly he checked on Lyle, laughing that the man had found Josh's room seemingly by accident and fallen asleep. Bobby didn't bother the massive man as he sprawled out on Josh's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning had came and it already neared afternoon by the time the sleeping giant started to rustle from his long drunken slumber. Rolling out of Josh's bed, Lyle looked down for his phone, wanting to know the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, it's dead...\" Lyle said to his phone, the battery clearly draining as it sat on all night unplugged. Looking around Josh's room for a moment, he found a cord coming out of the wall, luckily the same as his phone's as he plugged it in as walked out of the room rubbing his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck did I do last night?\" Lyle looked around the somewhat unfamiliar hallway. Stumbling into Josh's bathroom, Lyle yawned as he got on the toilet, going about his morning routine as he tried to remember what he did last night. Finishing taking his shit, Lyle flushed and washed his hands as he went back into Josh's room and grabbed his phone, seeing it had enough power to turn on now. To his surprise, he saw he had several texts and missed calls from Josh.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" Lyle looked through the messages, starting with the two pictures. The first was hard to make out, but he could see it was a blurry picture of Josh falling somewhere. The second one was just weird. Josh with an awkward smile, surrounded by darkness and what looked like wrinkly walls? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey? You get those pictures? See you can let me out now!\" Lyle read the message out loud. Lyle scratched his head, trying to make sense of it. He saw he had a few missed calls from Josh but also he had a call with Josh that lasted a few minutes before all this happened. Lyle sat down, looking at his phone, still trying to make sense of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was trapped somewhere, and I had to let him out?\" Lyle wrapped his brain. It was no good though, he just drank way too much last night. Lyle hit the call button on Josh's name, but instantly was sent to voice mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wherever I had to let him out of I sure hope he got out, bro...\" Lyle scratched his chin still thinking, not realizing he did in fact just let Josh out finally just a few minutes ago.   </span></div></div>",

Getting up to leave, Josh knew he had three of the new guys to swap out at the wave pool. Heading out, Josh recalled from memory that the three men were Trevor, Andres, and Cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh headed to the wave pool, seeing the three men all together, seemingly they had already been relieved by the other lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've know.\" Josh thought to himself. Bobby was one of the people who was to relive them, and he knew he could always count on his roommate to be on the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he watched the three men chat.

Despite how smart he was, Josh was happy to see him making friends with some of the other guys, as it was his ultimate goal to make more casual and gym buddy like friends when he wasn't trapped on his internship at the hospital. Josh couldn't help but admire Trevor; tall, strong, and handsome? What didn't the buff nerd have going for him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh shifted his attention to Cliff, the son of the investors who helped with the park's expansion. The handsome yet spoiled young man was prone for hanging out with some of the trouble makers at the park, but Josh was glad to see him getting along with Andres and Trevor who are much better influences.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah based off what Bobby told me, it could be interesting if you guys think we can pull it off?\" Josh heard Trevor saying to Andres and Cliff as they came closer. The three men saw Josh, however and approached him. \"Hey boss, we were just headed to lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I was coming to check on you guys, but it looks like I wasn't needed.\" Josh smiled, feeling like things almost went too smoothly nowadays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Bobby kept the other guys on time, dude!\" Andres gave Josh a thumbs up. \"But it's good we ran into you, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Josh questioned, wondering what was up. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we talk about it over lunch?\" Cliff suggested. \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'll meet you guys in the break room!\" Josh nodded in understanding, not wanting to eat up his employee's lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the men made their way to the front of the park, going back around outside to grow to their normal sizes before going to the break room. Still never bothering to grow to his normal size when entering the break room, Josh headed to the room, choosing to remain shrunken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the break room, it was bigger and better than ever. Josh chose to update the room to accommodate for more lifeguards, improving a lot of the features of the room as well as the transport system for him to get around the room in his shrunken state. Josh looked around the room, seeing the door on the far side open as he saw Trevor, Andres, and Cliff enter. Josh made his way to the edge of the balcony, where he had a new microphone and a magnifying glass put in so it was easier to talk with people in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, I'll be right over here!\" Josh addressed the men as they grabbed their lunches out of the refrigerator. Josh watched as Andres grabbed his sandwich before coming over to Josh. Josh tried not to change his expression too much as the huge handsome man was now looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, why don't you sit with us at the table?\" Andres asked, setting his free hand down next to Josh. Josh looked over at the hand, feeling like he'd be rude not to accept as he made his way onto the man's palm. Riding over to the table, Josh finally let himself blush as he looked up past Andres's perfect abs to his handsome scruffy face. Andres set Josh down on the table as Josh looked at Cliff sitting down with a very rich looking salad, complete with shrimp and other fixings. Josh looked over at Trevor, who was just finishing heating some chicken and rice in the microwave. Finally, he watched as Andres took a large bite into his sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shifted a little awkwardly, it was a little intimidating sitting at the table as the three giants tore into their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you guys want to talk to me about?\" Josh asked, wanting to get the ball rolling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! So, we were talking with Bobby about that little accident that happened to you.\" Trevor started to say, as Josh shifted even more uncomfortably, being surrounded by food and now bringing up that topic making him a little wary. \"Andres here mentioned it to me the other day, so I was curious and asked Bobby too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. What about it?\" Josh asked, hoping the topic would remain tame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Trevor was interested in the sciency side of it, but I thought it'd make for an interesting water slide idea!\" Andres spat up a couple crumbs in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ride that would go inside a person's body?\" Josh asked, knowing there would be at least a million safety hazards involved in a ride like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hear me out first, boss.\" Trevor interjected, knowing exactly what must be going through Josh's mind. \"You see we'd just be...\"           </span></div></div>",

Okay well that'll take some testing. Plus I don't know how well things would go if a lawyer got involved if someone was hurt...\" Josh tried to wrap his head around some of the possible legal implications this idea could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad's got a great lawyer we're planning on talking to to right up release forms. They'll be air tight.\" Cliff leaned back with a cocky grin. \"Besides, we have an idea of charging extra to wear the suit. So we'll need a pretty good waiver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Like they pay extra for the protection? So it'd be an at your own risk thing?\" Josh continued to try and figure out what the men had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, my man.\" Andres turned Josh's attention to him. \"For those little people in the suits it'd be a full ride. But those without the suits well... let's just say they don't make it past the stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would anyone pay to go on that ride?\" Josh questioned. Feeling like they have to be crazy or have a death wish to want that. \"You'd be paying someone to end your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds horrible, boss. But hear me out.\" Trevor tried to get Josh back on board. \"There's actually apparently a market out there for that sort of thing. People bored or sick of life with some cash to burn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Josh tried to refocus on the idea at hand. \"But there'd still be a safe option. Admittedly, even I would be interested in that. However... I don't know how happy people would be about making the full trip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised about that too, boss. Besides we could come up with a way of catching them once they pass all the way though.\" Trevor continued to explain. \"But yeah that's our basic idea so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's something we can work on. Sounds like Trevor and I can work on the inventing portions. Cliff can figure out the legal end.\" Josh looked toward Andres wanting to give him a role too. \"Andres, why don't you come up with a name for this \"ride\" and more ways to make it interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice man! Yeah I can do that!\" Andres perked up, glad to hear he got an interesting role in their idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded, feeling like they had a decent idea going, though Josh himself was still very unsure how successful it would be or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks of planning, Josh and his crew made some progress and were ready to test out the new \"ride\". Andres came up with the idea of allowing visitors to pay for certain trip packages, ranging from a super cheap unprotected group trip all the way to a vip experience. He also dubbed the \"ride\" to be called \"The Giant Experience\". Josh and Trevor had developed a suit allowing a person to survive the full trip through said giant, and Cliff had gotten the waivers set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess all that's left is to decide who the first couple guys we want to advertise...\" Josh thought to himself as he ironed out the last couple details of the plan. Each of the lifeguards had made a bio for them self complete with pictures and their style in devouring little people. Josh decided that he'd let the men keep whatever money they got thrown at them for the work they did, as incentive for each of them to draw in as many people as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that what was left was decide on the first three guys to be advertised this week. Thinking on it Josh decided he'd choose... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh let a sigh of relief, glad he didn't have to try and escape from both his friend's dangerous stomachs tonight. Josh looked up at Bobby, noticing the handsome titan's face starting to drop slightly with sleepiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look tired, Bobby.\" Josh said up at the giant as he snapped awake at the sound of Josh's tiny voice. Bobby yawned again, covering his mouth with his free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine. Just glad I can be with you both again...\" He said, starting to close his eyes again and almost drift off to sleep, before Tyler snapped his fingers in front of his friend's face to keep him from toppling forward and crushing Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, go to bed. We can all hang out again tomorrow morning.\" Tyler said, looking at the clock and noting the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Bobby said with a slow blink. \"I can stay up a bit longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ty's right. You should go to bed. Get adjusted to your new room upstairs ok? It's all yours from now on.\" Josh said looking up at his muscled friend with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude. Thanks again for all you've done for me, Josh.\" Bobby responded with a tired grin. \"What about you guys though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna stay up for awhile longer. I'm not really that tired, dude.\" Tyler said with a little bounce in his seat, still feeling full of energy. Both giants turned their attention to Josh. He figured he could sneak upstairs with Bobby and catch an early night's sleep, or he could stay downstairs and stay up a little while longer with Tyler. Rubbing his face, Josh came to the conclusion that...  </span></div></div>",

Why don't I just go up to bed with you Bobby? Ty can have my room tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! You bed is so much cushier than the sofa!\" Tyler beamed with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're happy, guess you can feel free to watch some TV before you go to bed too?\" Josh offered thoughtfully, pointing at the remote on the nearby end table. Bobby looked at Tyler and started laughing a little as Tyler looked at the remote with disgust. Confused, Josh merely shrugged his shoulders as Bobby stood up, bringing Josh up with him.Josh looked up at Bobby as he watched the huge man sleepily make his way up the stairs before turning down the hall to enter his new bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way into the room, Bobby looked around as saw a nice looking queen sized bed along side and end table with an alarm clock. A few other furnishings decorated the room as well as a spacious closet and a door leading to a small bathroom. Bobby made his way over to the end table and carefully let his minuscule friend slide off his hand and onto the wooden surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna go to the bathroom and clean up a bit before bed, alright?\" Bobby said sleepily as he yawned looking down at Josh. Josh simply nodded as Bobby turned his back and walked into the little bathroom. Josh sat down, trying to make himself comfortable on the end table. Sitting back, Josh heard the toilet flush as well as the sink water run for a minute before he saw Bobby reemerge, dropping his tank top on the floor and holding a cap of sorts filled with water. Josh blushed slightly as the now shirtless behemoth approached him and set down the cap in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I thought you could clean up a bit too, dude.\" Bobby said thoughtfully as he sat down the bed and breathed in a massive yawn. Josh simply smiled as he reached over the edge of the cap and splashed a little water on his face and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Bobby!\" Josh smiled. \"It's good to get all that gross stuff off of myself from your... uhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I figured, dude.\" Bobby laughed. \"Next time just tell us to cut our shit, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I didn't end up in your stomach on purpose right?\" Josh sighed, raising his eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said to Tyler...\" Bobby started to say before realizing what happened. \"Ohh... Yeah I guess I didn't think about that. You were just letting him be right, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just easier that way sometimes.\" Josh smiled, trying to clean himself up a little more efficiently. \"In truth, I was pretty terrified. I didn't think I was going to make it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Bobby said simply with a yawn. \"But since you did, it's a new experience you've got under your belt, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's one way of looking at it.\" Josh scratched his nose with a slight frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides terrifying, what was it like?\" Bobby asked as Josh shifted uncomfortably. \"Sorry dude, it's my body. I was just curious.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that's perfectly understandable.\" Josh replied, waving his arms. \"I guess... it was warm. Really wet and really dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby leaned his head back. Trying to take in the description, but failing to do so due to Josh's lack of details. Josh looked up at Bobby and tried to elaborate. \"It was enormous too from what I could see. Once my eyes adjusted a bit all I could take in was just mounds of food and moving walls that just seemed to stretch on forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" Bobby responded, looking back to Josh once more. \"You make it sound like there's a whole world inside me, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To me, it may as well have been. It was so vast it was actually pretty breath taking.\" Josh shivered as he remembered everything he witnessed from within Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing dude. Kinda wish I could see pictures of it or something...\" He said poking his abs gently as he leaned his torso back a little. \"Do you... have your phone with you, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's at work...\" Josh said, knowing that's where it truthfully was. \"I don't know if I'd be down with what you're thinking though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be ok, dude.\" Bobby reassured Josh. \"I wouldn't leave you down there or anything. Besides maybe experiencing it again in a safer way would help you appreciate how breath taking it was. Like you said dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, wishing he had picked his words a little better. But he couldn't help but agree, it may be interesting to take another dive under a more controlled environment. \"Alright, we can see about it tomorrow. We'll have to get up a little early so I can get in the park before they start construction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dude. I'm sure we'll have fun with it. Tyler will probably get a kick out of it too!\" Bobby said with a smile. The thought made Josh shift a little, thinking about just how Tyler would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh started to say...              </span></div></div>",

Bobby nodded his head as he reached his hand over to Tyler and let his tiny friend slide from one hand to the other. Sitting now in Tyler's palm, Josh watched as Bobby waved goodnight on his way up the stairs to locate his new bedroom. Once the door closed Josh turned and looked up at Tyler, smirk already plastered across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god what's that look for?\" Josh asked, feeling like he made a poor choice in staying with Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what actually happened with the gummy bears there, bud?\" Tyler asked with a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Josh yelled pointing up at Tyler for dramatic effect. \"You lead Bobby on to thinking I did it on purpose, didn't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, and you just let me do it, dude.\" Tyler smirked, leaning back and letting his hand rest against his solid abs and allowing Josh to slide up against them. \"So what, it really was just an accident?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was.\" Josh responded, pushing himself away from Tyler's abs and trying to regain his footing. \"I tried to get off that first gummy bear and just got stuck completely to the other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Tyler responded scratching his nose. \"Guess you really were lucky Bobby ate it then. I started chewing all of mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered at the thought of being on the bear right before Tyler's massive white teeth come crashing down to crush him to bits. \"I guess that is really lucky.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean even if I didn't chew it you still would have been pretty boned.\" Tyler said confidently. \"I'm not nearly as tired as he was. I wasn't about to lay down, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess yeah I wouldn't have had many options...\" Josh replied sadly, glad this was just hypothetical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, I'm not trying to lecture you or anything. I mean it was pretty bad ass how you clawed your way up this throat like that.\" Tyler laughed, leaning forward and trying to make his tiny friend feel a little less bad. \"I'm just saying you lucked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and yeah I guess you're right. Sorry if it was worrisome in any way in hindsight.\" Josh replied solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it dude. You're all fine now so nothing to worry about.\" Tyler winked at Josh. \"Though I am a little jealous. Sounds like a cool experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What being eaten? I assure you it was mostly just terrifying.\" Josh shuddered, crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No dude. The other side of it. I don't wanna be eaten. Eating a little person like you just sounds cool.\" Tyler smiled with a slight stretch of his abdomen. \"I'd let you out of course. You're my best friend after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed. it was both a cute thing to say as well as such a terrifying one. Josh didn't exactly want to be eaten again. \"Thanks, but I don't think that's something I'm exactly up for doing again. But I guess if it's any consolation, I do trust you, Ty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dude. Yeah I feel you. Maybe you'd change your mind sometime. But for right now I gotcha, bruh.\" Tyler smiled as gave Josh a thumbs up with his other hand. \"In the meantime what do you want to do until bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could watch TV. Remote's right over there on the end table.\" Josh said, pointing at the table right at the end of the sofa. Tyler turned and looked at it with a shocked expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was right there the whole time?!\" Tyler exclaimed loudly as he looked at the remote with surprise. \"No, dude. I don't even want TV anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Josh wasn't sure what his outburst was all about. \"What do you want to do then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno dude. Remember how we used to mess around and play stupid games when you would shrink in college?\" Tyler answered, eye's lighting up a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you forcing me to work out while you threatened to crush me under your body. I'd rather do literally anything else.\" Josh huffed, crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnythiiing?\" Tyler asked with exaggerated emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides eating me...\" Josh shook his head, feeling like he shouldn't have to include that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we'll save that for another time! I was just thinking of playing a game. Like a giant and tiny version of man hunt!\" Tyler answered with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like hide and go seek?\" Josh questioned as Tyler's expression shifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Men play man hunt! Come on, dude.\" Tyler shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just get cleaned up instead?\" Josh said, noting how filthy and covered with strange liquids he was. \"That's fun right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make that fun.\" Tyler smirked, making Josh a little nervous about what he meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooook...\" Josh replied awkwardly. \"Which would you rather do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled, ideas flowing though his mind as he decided to...       </span></div></div>",

Having no idea what Tyler was even talking about. \"What do you mean by any of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your room and you stay tiny living here and remodel the place so you can have a tiny living space somewhere.\" Tyler answered simply, as if he had it planned out like that all along. \"Then Bobby and I can both be your giant roommates, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Josh barely got out before Tyler turned to Bobby with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't that be awesome, dude?\" Tyler beamed at Bobby. \"The three of us living together while the two of us get to be literal giants around Josh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked down at his tiny friend, smiling as he loomed over him with extreme ease. \"It is pretty sweet being so huge.\" Bobby smirked. \"You'll be fine with being tiny 24/7 though, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to speak up, wanting to voice he absolutely was not alright with the idea before being cut off by Tyler once again. \"Of course he is! It'd be lame if he turned down the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his tongue as he looked up at Bobby. Josh looked at his enormous friend's handsome face, not wanting to disappoint him after he traveled here. Josh sighed, playing right into Tyler's hand. \"Yeah I could easily have the house modified like I've got the break room and have a personal apartment built in the wall or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler leaned back, putting his massive arms behind his head as he smirked, knowing he played Josh perfectly. \"Well we better get started on all of that!\" Tyler responded arrogantly as he reached for Josh suddenly. Josh flinched as he was easily scooped into his best friend's hand, dazed his looked up past Tyler's muscular body all the way up to his face as he was held slight above the waist. \"We need to go get your phone so you can get those construction dudes to work on your place too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, dude.\" Bobby retorted. \"What about all your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...\" Tyler thought for a moment. \"Maybe you can bring the little shrimp to the park to grab his phone and I'll start grabbing my stuff and moving in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked back and fourth at the two men. Everything was happening so fast. Tyler started mentioning how his lease was up anyway and joking how he didn't have much to move, While Bobby was asking for directions to the park to grab Josh's phone. Before Josh could react, he was being transferred from one friend's hand to the other as he looked up, seeing the tight shirt of Bobby rather than Tyler's bare torso. Without much discussion, both men were on their way, as Josh found himself being carried off to the park he just left not long ago. Following the directions Tyler gave him coupled with some guidance from Josh, the pair made their way to the park and Josh was able to retrieve his phone from his office before construction could begin. Calling the construction company that designed the break room,  Josh was quickly able to strike a deal along side the parks expansion, having his additions to his home done by the end of the day tomorrow. In the mean time Josh sighed as his pocketed his phone and went to the break room, seeing Bobby waiting patiently for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd everything go, dude?\" Booby asked, getting off the couch and making his way to the balcony where Josh stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gonna start working on it first thing tomorrow. Should be done by the end of the day.\" Josh answered with a smile. \"This'll be good. I'm glad all three of us can live together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it'll gonna be awesome dude.\" Bobby smiled. \"You're really ok with being small all the time though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get used to it.\" Josh shrugged. Coming to terms with his situation before he smiled at Bobby. \"Besides, I've got you and Tyler to protect me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled at the comment. \"I think the only thing you need protection from is Tyler, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shuddered, knowing Bobby wasn't entirely wrong. \"I'll count on you then, Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby gave Josh a thumbs up as a loud buzzing noise came from Bobby's pocket. The huge man answered the phone as Josh heard Tyler's voice booming from the other end. The conversation was short but it sounded like Tyler wanted to spend the night away from Josh's to avoid getting up early for the construction. After a short debate, the two men decided they would spend the night...        </span></div></div>",

Josh and I are already here, then that way you can hand off your key to your land lord and ditch, dude.\" Bobby explained to Tyler as Tyler voiced his agreement. Bobby hung up the phone as he looked to Josh. \"It's ok for us to just chill here for the night, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's fine. Construction is going on for the park, not this room after all.\" Josh shrugged his shoulders. \"Plus its all very small scale so it won't be loud or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect dude.\" Bobby smiled. \"Guess we just have to wait for Ty to show up then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head in agreement as a huge rumbling growl erupted directly from Bobby's stomach. Bobby rubbed his solid abs from beneath his tight shirt as he chuckled a little. \"Sorry forgot I haven't eaten in awhile, dude.\" Josh smiled, but also sweat a little. It was kind of crazy to him how loud the sound was for someone his size. Just as Bobby took his hand off his stomach, it protested a second time with a second fierce growl. This time Bobby slapped his abdomen with a frown. \"Ok, we get it. You're empty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we order some food or something?\" Josh offered. \"My treat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby nodded his head in appreciation as he watched Josh pull out his phone and dial a number, ordering a pizza for his friend. Finishing the order, Josh smiled as he looked up at Bobby from his perch on the balcony. \"I got a few pizzas on the way for you and Ty. I'm just assuming he's hungry anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you know that the two of us eat a lot!\" Bobby laughed as he rubbed his stomach a little more. \"Hopefully we don't eat you out of your home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too worried about that!\" Josh laughed, knowing he cost of living was really not bad, and if he was going to be permanently small he'd really only be feeding two people. \"I'd be more worried about one of you literally eating me in my home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that, dude.\" Bobby chuckled a little, knowing Josh was just joking. \"Not unless you run out of food and we get desperate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed a little, glad he could make jokes like that with his friend. \"Oh I'll make sure to keep the fridge stocked for my own sake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled for a moment before the door to the break room started to swing open. Bobby turned and looked as Tyler came through the door with two huge gym bags over his arms and two massive pizzas in his hands. Josh looked at Tyler, his clothes changed now to a red sideways flat brimmed hat, a white stringer tank top that barely hid his torso, and a pair of red athletic shorts and red nike shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you grabbed my bag!\" Bobby smiled as he walked over to Tyler to help him with the bags and pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I wasn't sure what you needed, so I just grabbed the whole thing, bro.\" Tyler smiled at Bobby. \"Also I ran into the pizza guy trying to deliver here. He seemed confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too, I'm starving, dude!\" Bobby grinned as he immediately opened up the box of pizza. \"I was about to resort to eating our little buddy over there!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that shouldn't be your last resort, dude.\" Tyler answered Bobby with a serious look before quickly cracking down to a laugh. \"That should be one of your first options!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes as the two men started to laugh and eat the pizza he was so gracious to buy for them. Josh watched as they quickly started devouring the pizza slice after slice before already going through the entire first box. \"Hey! I wanted a slice too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's ears perked up as his mouth curled into a smile as he looked at Bobby. \"Did you hear something dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro.\" Bobby laughed as he looked back at Tyler. \"Too busy eating this pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm the one dropping money on the pizza!\" Josh complained. \"I want to be included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that, dude?\" Tyler chuckled. \"He wants to be included as a topping on the pizza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he's kinda hard to hear, since he's so little.\" Bobby laughed as he shoved another slice in his mouth. \"But that's about what I heard too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not one to argue.\" Tyler turned quickly as he snatched up Josh with ease with greasy fingers and carried him over to the open pizza. Casually, Tyler dropped Josh right down on one of the slices of the pizza. Tyler watched as Josh fell screaming into the pizza before reaching his hand for the cover o the box and shutting it, sealing Josh inside in the warm dark box. \"Oh whoops!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok dude. Accidents happen.\" Bobby laughed as he started spinning the pizza on the table, completely losing which way the box was facing originally before reopening the box again. \"Huh, wonder where he went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno dude.\" Tyler looked down at the pizza hungrily. \"I only see toppings on this pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah same, bro.\" Bobby smiled, having fun playing with Josh like this. Tyler meanwhile rubbed his stomach, genuinely still very hungry as he looked down at the pizza not so carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh however found himself completely stuck and disoriented as his head was still spinning and the fumes of the pizza made him choke a little for fresh non-cheesy air. Having reached his bearings Josh looked up to see...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Struggling as his arms were stuck to the pizza Josh could do little more than squirm his upper torso around in hopes Tyler would take half a second to at least look at the food he was about to eat. Sweating, Josh looked over to Bobby for support, hoping his promised protector would be looking at Tyler's food for him. To his dismay, Bobby was busy carefully examining every inch of the slice of pizza he just pulled for himself. Panic set in as Tyler took a bite into the pizza, Josh nearly being swept away in a strand of cheese as Tyler lifted it into his massive mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his glob of food, Tyler peeked over at Bobby for a moment as he finally started eating his piece of pizza. He chuckled to himself that Bobby was being so careful, after all Tyler knew exactly where he put his terrified little friend, and he knew exactly the piece of pizza to avoid eating the little man on. Taking another huge bite of the pizza in his hands, Tyler was confident Josh wouldn't be on any of the slices he's going to eat. Dropping another strand of cheese in his mouth and swallowing the food down without much chewing, Tyler had no idea how wrong he was.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as the large loud gulp drug him easily down his gigantic friend's throat. Peristalsis set in as Josh was casually slipped down deeper and deeper in the dark smelly dankness of Tyler's esophagus. With nothing more than faint laughter and talking coupled with Tyler's incredible heartbeat to accompany him, Josh and the glob of food descended further until being deposited in Tyler's unfathomably large stomach. Still trapped and unable to move his arms thanks to the cheese as well as more and more food continuing to pile up in the organ, Josh couldn't do anything as he hardly squirmed in protest, unable to believe he was just eaten alive by one of his best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler finished a final piece of pizza while Bobby examined his last slice as well, noticing a distinct lack of Josh anywhere on the pizza. \"Dude, he's not on this slice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Tyler mused. \"Well he wasn't on any of mine, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? I check all of mine really well.\" Bobby protested with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely without a shadow of a doubt dude.\" Tyler winked at Bobby. \"I put him on the pizza. I think I'd remember what slice I put him on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're probably right, bro.\" Bobby replied, feeling like it made perfect sense. \"So what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you probably ate him, bro.\" Tyler laughed pointing at Bobby's ripped abs as they showed through his tight shirt with ease. \"He's in there somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, dude.\" Bobby said, dropping his pizza and standing up. \"I guess I should...\"       </span></div></div>",

Seeing Josh right away as one of his recents, Tyler put the phone to his ear as he listened to it ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms still trapped, Josh struggled mightily as he could feel vibrations coming from his pocket. \"They're trying to call me! Oh my god I need to get my arms free!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling as hard as he could, Josh felt himself being turned over as Tyler's stomach continued to groan and churn it's meal with no regard for the tiny passenger struggling for his life within it. The buzzing stopped as some fresh acid washed up against Josh's cheesy prison, loosening it slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did he not answer?\" Bobby asked as Tyler turned off his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably just pissed at me and ignoring me to make me worry.\" Tyler laughed. \"You should try, dude. He'll answer for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby shrugged as he pulled out his own phone, finding Josh in his contacts and calling his number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing once again permeated Josh's pocket as he struggled to free his hand. Thankfully, the acid in Tyler's stomach was helpful enough to digest some of his prison, enough for Josh to snag his phone, answering the call and holding it to his ear. \"Bobby! Oh thank god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright? Where are you dude?\" Bobby asked on the other side of the line. \"I didn't eat you did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you!\" Josh yelled. \"Tyler did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby's face curled into a smile as he answered Josh back. \"I'm sorry, Tyler was the one who ate you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Josh's voice boomed from the other side of the phone as Tyler leaned back, raising and eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me talk to him. I don't believe it.\" Tyler answered arrogantly as he barely reached forward for the phone as Bobby handed it to him. \"Sup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup? I'm in your stomach, dummy!\" Josh spat back at the phone. \"You ate me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it. Send me a picture.\" Tyler challenged Josh, skeptical of his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the inside of a stomach? How could you possibly tell it was yours?\" Josh argued, in a panic, just wanting Tyler to believe him so he could be rescued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, good point.\" Tyler answered, looking at the ceiling as he tried to think of something else. Absentmindedly Tyler rested his hand on his stomach pressing it slightly with little force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you not slap your stomach while I'm in here?!\" Josh panicked, undoubtedly having the organ shift a bunch even from such a small amount of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a slap. I barely rested my hand on it.\" Tyler argued back before realizing there would've been no other way Josh would known if he did it or not. Tyler smirked as he reared his hand back, giving his solid abs a legitimate slap this time. \"Now that's a slap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams echoed through the phone as Tyler laughed before Josh finally replied. \"You ass! Do you have any idea how badly that bounced shit around down here?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Tyler answered simply. \"Hey what happens when I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sucked in a little air and puffed his chest before belting an absolutely monumental and disgusting sounding burp. Rubbing his mouth and chin with a grin, Tyler held the phone back to his ear to await a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dizzy.\" Josh barely got out as he panted for air. \"Air thin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very descriptive.\" Tyler frowned a little disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, it was like the whole place shook like an earth quake.\" Josh tried to answer as he gasped a little for air. \"The pressure changed, and now the air feels thin. I think there's enough for me down here though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I didn't get it all? Maybe I should burp again.\" Tyler joked as he chuckled giving Bobby an amused look and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Don't! I'm begging you!\" Josh plead. \"I just want to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Tyler asked flatly. \"You wanted to be a pizza topping. You got your wish, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! You're right, Ty.\" Josh conceded, knowing there was never any winning when it came to an argument with Tyler. \"I'll just stay down here and get digested with the rest of the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Tyler responded with a smile as he just sat there, phone to his ear with an ever growing smile. Silence spread across the call for a solid 10 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me out...\" Josh plead again weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two conditions, dude.\" Tyler answered, knowing he had Josh, hook line and sinker. \"One, you buy me more food since I'm gonna be hungry again after puking your ass up. Two, you have to do whatever I say for the rest of the night, no complaining, or face the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous. This is your fault!\" Josh protested, not being his wisest decision at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" Tyler shrugged as he pulled the phone away and clicked it off, tossing it back to Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh you aren't leaving him down there, are you?\" Bobby asked, concerned for Josh's safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll call back when he's ready.\" Tyler smiled confidently as he stood up and looked down at his own phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That asshole hung up on me!\" Josh fumed as he looked down at his phone. With his body still partially stuck to the cheese, Josh sighed as he knew he'd have to agree to these stupid terms if he wanted to get out alive. Swallowing his pride, Josh took a look at his phone as he...           </span></div></div>",

Flipping to Tyler's name in his recents Josh was ready to hit the call button, when Tyler's stomach shifted slightly. Losing his grip on his phone from the sudden lurch, Josh completely dropped his phone as it was quickly swept away in the churning and sloshing of the massive stomach's contents. Josh froze, completely in shock over what just happened. \"Oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't even muster any more words as he phone was easily lost for good in the pit of his best friend's stomach. Tyler's stomach started to growl loudly as some processed food was already being sucked away into his intestines, causing Josh to break from his daze and snap to reality. \"Doesn't matter.\" Josh said confidently. \"They know I'm in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tapped his finger next to his phone while Bobby sat staring at his own. \"Should we call him back?\" Bobby asked. \"I'm getting a little worried, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Tyler smiled as he stood up straight and looked away from his phone. \"He's just being stubborn. Jokes on him though, he's not in a position to bargain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, dude.\" Bobby replied as he stood up holding his phone and setting it next to Tyler's. \"So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged as he walked away from the table, leaving his phone as he turned his back to Bobby and looked around the break room. Looking from the gym off to the side and the soft couch coupled with sizable tv in front of it, Tyler made his choice. \"Let's just bum and watch some tv, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh you sure dude?\" Bobby asked as he looked back at their phones, resting on the table. \"Shouldn't we be paying attention to our phones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear it buzz from over here!\" Tyler waved, nonchalantly as he already plopped himself down in the sofa, turning on the tv and flipping through the channels. Bobby shrugged, making his way over and planting himself in a reclining chair as he watched Tyler settle on Sport's Center. He yawned, tired from his trip as he leaned back and listened to the sports, closing his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much time passed as Tyler looked over at Bobby, his eyes completely shut and some slight heavy breathing coming from his mouth. Undoubtedly the huge man had already fallen asleep. Tyler chuckled as he turned his attention back to the tv, propping up his feet on a coffee table and scratching his stomach. Already absentmindedly forgetting about his tiny friend being horribly digested on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed in pain from the caustic cavern's fumes and acids as they sloshed him around like a tiny speak of meat. Josh found himself free from his cheesy prison at this point but it offered him little to no solace as he was now completely at the mercy of Tyler's incredible digestive system. Being pulled under and above the mix of acid and digested food, Josh was nothing more than an insignificant part of the process, helpless to do anything. Unable to speak and barely able to think, the only thought Josh could even muster was, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler yawned as the sports cast had already started to repeat the news he had been listening to. Clicking off the tv, Tyler didn't want to disturb Bobby as he got up and walked over to the fridge. Hoping someone let a snack in the break room, Tyler was eager to find a little more food, already hungry from earlier. Locating a cup of yogurt, Tyler shrugged as it was better than nothing. Opening it up, Tyler went and sat at the table looking down at his phone as he put a spoonful of it in his mouth. He choked for a second as he remembered Josh, swallowing hard and sending the glob of food down to his stomach like he did to Josh earlier. He looked at his phone, no new calls. His last call to Josh was well over an hour and a half ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.\" Tyler simply said as he set his phone down in a panic. His stomach gurgled slightly as it accepted the little bit of yogurt, greedily growling as it demanded more. Tyler looked down at his stomach, knowing Josh was long gone at this point. Leaning back and looking over at Bobby as he slept, Tyler started to sweat, wondering what he could possibly do to explain himself.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Tyler was the most stubborn person he ever met, and he knew the giant man would sooner leave him to burn in his stomach than admit he was wrong and just remedy the situation. Pulling up Tyler's number, Josh hit the call icon as he held the phone back up to his ear. Noticing his other hand was now free thanks to Tyler's stomach acid eating away a little at his cheesy prison, Josh scratched his face a little as it started to itch. The phone rang for much longer than Josh expected as he knew Tyler was simply standing there watching it buzz. Josh could swear he could even hear the phone buzzing on the table on the other side of the walls of his friend's stomach before finally he picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be busy digesting?\" Tyler asked in a condescending tone as Josh rolled his eyes in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Please just get me out of here...\" Josh answered in an almost robotic tone. The whole chamber shook at little as Tyler chuckled, both audible to Josh in his stomach as well as over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just agree to my conditions, bro, and I'll be happy to.\" Tyler mused, not wanting to spell it all out again for the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy you as much food as you want, ok?\" Josh tried to bargain, not wanting to endure whatever Tyler had planned for 'do whatever I say or else'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure I made two conditions, dude.\" Tyler answered, not backing down for even a moment. \"Not unless you're happy down there. I'm not one to judge, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there isn't anything else you want? I could buy you some cool stuff for you new room?\" Josh tried to bribe Tyler now, just wanting anything than being forced to cooperate with Tyler's antics for an entire evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Tyler answered simply, his one tracked mind focused on exactly what he wanted now, rather than what he could have later. \"If weren't done here maybe I should just hang up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" Josh plead, wanting to keep Tyler on the phone more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kept the phone on as he sat there in silence, seeing what Josh would say.

Josh clicked off his phone as well as Tyler's stomach started making strange pained groaning noises. The food mixed up in the stomach started forcing itself upward, toward the top of the organ before expelling itself out up through the esophagus. To Josh the process was blinding and a total just mess of fluids and chunks of food. Josh struggled trying to find up from down as he just shoved his way past half digested bits of food before he opened his eyes, face hitting fresh air. Taking a deep breath, Josh's lungs could have sang with joy over it's first breath of non-foul stomach air in who knows how long. Looking directly up, Josh saw Tyler's face, hunched down looking at the pile of vomit. Waving his arms and locking his eyes with Tyler, Josh hoped the huge man would spot him before expelling more vomit all over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh that was almost too easy.\" Tyler smiled arrogantly as he saw Josh sticking out on top of his first round of puking. Reaching down and easily plucking Josh out of his own vomit, Tyler moved Josh back over to the table, setting the tiny man next to his gigantic phone. \"I got you on my first push, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Josh answered, relived to be free as he brushed some unknown goop off of himself. \"But I guess I still owe you food anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later.\" Tyler shrugged as he looked down at Josh. \"Didn't waste too much getting you out, so I'll wait till I'm a little more hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright.\" Josh answered nervously. \"Well thank you again for getting me out, Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me, bug.\" Tyler cockily grinned. \"I am a gracious god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know if I'd go that far...\" Josh complained as Tyler wagged his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna rephrase that?\" Tyler asked coyly. \"Because that's strike one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike one?!\" Josh questioned. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our deal, bug.\" Tyler replied, crossing his arms. \"And that's strike two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shut his mouth immediately. He had no idea what Tyler meant earlier by 'consequences'. Tyler peered down at Josh, seeing his friend elected to standing in silence, not wanting to blow his third and final strike. \"I'll take your silence is that you're simply in awe of how great I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled from across the table as Josh slowly forced himself to look up at Tyler with a fake smile. \"Oh absolutely. I can't think of anyone great than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right!\" Tyler smirked as he reached down and plucked Josh off the table. Bobby watched as Tyler kicked off his shoes and revealed his black socks as he made his way over to the couch. Setting Josh down on his abdomen, Josh looked past Tyler's massive chest to his face as he sat on the soft fabric. Tyler put his hands behind his head as he looked down on Josh, resting on his stomach. \"Tell me how much you loved being inside of my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip. He knew he had to play the part of loyal worshiper no matter what. \"It was an absolute privilege.\" Josh started, trying to milk it. \"It was even more of an honor that you deemed me worthy of being let out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe next time I'll just keep you down.\" Tyler smirked. \"Then my body could use you for what little you could offer to make mine bigger, and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh actually blushed slightly as Tyler made his chest pop and flexed his arms a little. \"If that's what you'd desire.\" Josh blushed, hiding his face a little. \"Then I'd happily give you what little protein my body would offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your all powerful god may take you up on that sometime.\" Tyler said in a slow sexy voice as Bobby rolled his eyes from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you guys could role play somewhere else?\" Bobby complained as he leaned back at the kitchen chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can move closer to you if you wanted a better view.\" Tyler mocked Bobby. \"Just don't blame me if you pop a boner from it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll just go for a walk.\" Bobby decided as he stood up and grabbed his phone. \"Get to know the area a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get lost.\" Tyler smirked as Bobby made his way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call one of you if I do.\" Bobby answered as he started to shut the door, smirking. \"If you two hear your phones over the sound of you guys making out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be pretty loud, so good luck!\" Tyler mocked him once again as the door shut. Tyler turned his attention back to Josh as he stretched his abdomen a little, shifting Josh's position slightly. \"Anyway, where were we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\" Josh stuttered, still thinking of Tyler flexing his massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter.\" Tyler shrugged as he reached down for Josh and plucking him between his fingers. Laying back on the couch and hovering Josh over his face, Tyler smirked as he wanted to continue playing with Josh. \"Hope you're ready for a fun time, bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's face felt like it exploded. Tyler's cocky grin and arrogant tone of voice really set him off. Josh decided he would...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh smiled, blushing a little as he hovered over Tyler's handsome face. This was a side of Tyler that rarely come out, at least not to this extent. His normally protective best friend was always one to tease Josh, but never role play a giant master or god. Josh always kind of wondered what Tyler would be like as god. Taking the rare opportunity, Josh continued to play along with whatever Tyler wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of fun time?\" Josh asked nervously. Tyler's lips curled into a smile as he lowered Josh down close to his mouth. Josh thought for a moment that Tyler was going to drop him back in the massive cavern and send him back down into the stomach he was just released from. Instead, Tyler compressed his stomach and let loose a disgusting belch right over Josh. Josh took in the smell, as it reeked of Tyler's stomach contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells very familiar!\" Josh tried to add his own flavor to the action. Tyler laughed at the comment as he pulled Josh a little further away from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you love that smell, huh?\" Tyler mocked Josh as he licked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's reminiscent of my privileged time inside your god-like stomach.\" Josh answered, wanting nothing more than to feed Tyler's ego just to see where this all goes and what he does next. Josh watched as Tyler noticed he still had his other hand behind his head. Moving Josh over to his open arm pit, Tyler dropped his friend in, slowly closing it behind him. Josh took a deep breath as the foul sweaty and musky air filled his nostrils. He couldn't believe Tyler just nonchalantly tossed him in his sexy pit like that. Josh took in the darkness and felt the hairs, coated with Tyler's sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying himself as he squirmed about in his friend's armpit hair, Josh was slightly disappointed when it opened back up and Tyler reached back in, scooping him out and holding him close to his face once again. \"Tell me, bug.\" Tyler asked smoothly. \"Which smell did you like better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved them both!\" Josh answered, actually honestly. Tyler laughed arrogantly as he shifted his body slightly and sat up a little, letting Josh slide into the palm of his hand rather than between his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Tyler smiled, feeling like Josh was playing along almost too easily. \"Maybe we should explore another smell, my little speck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sat up, holding Josh in one hand as he reached down toward his feet. Pulling off one of his socks and tossing it aside, Tyler stuck his tiny friend between his toes before resting his foot flat on the surface of the couch without a second thought. Leaning back and resting his head, he simply sat there and felt his friend squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of his body was trapped under Tyler toe while just his head was sticking out between the two massive digits, Josh found himself pinned with little more than the ability to struggle and smell as his face was pinned between his friend's massive sweaty toes. The sweaty musk of the toes was similar to Tyler's armpit but much more focused and pungent rather than being spread across and dampened on each hair. Taking his hands, Josh rubbed the toe he was pinned under, covering himself in salty sweat and hoping what tiny stimulation he could offer would please Tyler. Just as Josh was getting comfortable, Tyler once again retrieved him, bringing him back to his beautiful face.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got one more smell I want you to sniff.\" Tyler smirked as he stood up, holding Josh far above the ground. Josh puzzled for a second, wonder what Tyler was doing as he pulled down the back of his waist band on his shorts, exposing his tight black under armor spandex clad ass. Tyler turned, pulling back the spandex before dropping Josh down inside, snapping the spandex back with a loud snap. Tyler turned, laying on the couch on his stomach, allowing his ass to point into the air as he left his shorts to sag and show off his underwear as he relaxed and felt his minuscule friend squirm underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could barely breath as he was slid down by gravity in between Tyler's massive glutes. It was absolutely incredible how tiny he was compared to his friend's impressive butt muscles. Smell of sweat and what Josh assumed to be literal shit, Josh choked on the nauseous fumes as Tyler ass continued to slide him closer and closer the his friend's hairy anus. The smell kept getting stronger and more pungent before finally everything shifted and Josh was suddenly sliding away. Guessing Tyler moved to laying on his side, it would seem he was slipping now to the center of one of Tyler's ass cheeks before the tightness of the spandex held him in place. Tyler stood as he fished down the back of his shorts before locating his friend pressed against his right cheek. Holding a dazed and exhausted Josh, Tyler smirked as he looked down at his tiny toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time maybe I'll just take a seat and see if I can feel you squirm.\" Tyler cockily said as Josh shook his head to regain focus. \"How did you feel about those second two smells, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" Josh said again with excitement. \"It was so overpowering. I'm practically helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are completely helpless.\" Tyler corrected Josh with a strong voice. \"However if you submit to me I'll keep you personally safe through out this treacherous night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll happily submit to you forever and always, my giant god.\" Josh milked it once again as he truly enjoyed Tyler playing this part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Tyler voiced deeply. \"Now tell me, slave. Which of my godly amazing smells did you enjoy more. The first two or the second two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second. Wondering what would happen based off what he chose. Deciding it would be best to just be honest Josh chose...     </span></div></div>",

I just need to think for a few minutes.\" Josh tried to reason with his friend, hoping he'd be at least somewhat sympathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time, dude!\" Tyler laughed as there was once again a sudden smack on the other side of the walls of Tyler's stomach. The organ shook violently like it did before as Josh screamed as felt disoriented as he was sloshed all the way to the pit of his friend's massive belly. \"You aren't going anywhere anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Josh couldn't even respond as amidst the darkness there was an opening as some of the more digested food was being slurped into Tyler's intestines. Terrified, Josh was in fact going somewhere as he was small enough to be easily swept through the opening along with the rest of the liquid. With a sickening 'blorp' the sphincter closed as Josh was sealed beyond the stomach, entering his friend's small intestine. Somehow floating at the surface of the liquefied food, Josh felt like the conditions were much less acidic all of a sudden. \"Ty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like that slap this time dude? You were screeeeeeaming!\" Tyler mocked Josh as the tiny man felt like he was in utter shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I slipped into your intestine.\" Josh shuddered as he started feeling a completely different sensation than the acidic burns he was growing used to. \"I feel... funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Tyler questioned on the other side of the phone. Josh suddenly started convulsing in pain as the absorptive properties of the intestines were completely different than the destructive nature of the stomach. Josh struggled to stay afloat as  he writhed in pain, mumbling and crying as he felt like he was being torn apart slowly and violently. Somehow still clutching his phone in sheer agony, Josh could barely mutter one last word before completely succumbing to the harsh new conditions. \"Ty...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went silent as Tyler stood there, hearing Josh's last word. Trying to process exactly what happened, Tyler set down his phone as he looked at Bobby. \"I can still puke him up if he's in my intestine, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\" Bobby scratched his head, never one to pay attention in class to know. \"I don't know, google it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sure something will pop up if I good 'can I puke my friend out of my small intestine'.\" Tyler rolled his eyes as he pulled up google on his phone anyway. \"Swallowed something important, but I think it's in my intestine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler read out his google search, hoping to find some kind of answer. Tyler slammed his phone on the table in anger after a few minutes. \"Everything I search says I just have to wait and shit it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he'd make it?\" Bobby asked, hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, there's no way. You ever hear of someone swallowing a bug and shitting it out in one piece, let alone alive?\" Tyler answered, knowing there was no hope for Josh, deep in his bowels. Tyler rested a hand on his lower abdomen as he looked down at it, with a frown. \"I'm sorry, buddy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence spread across the the room as the two men sat there, guilty over the reckless loss of their tiny friend.     </span></div></div>",

Without much hesitation, Bobby knelt down and hovered over the bucket as he started jamming his fingers down his throat in an attempt to vomit. After some heaves and some splats into the bucket, Tyler had to look away in disgust as Bobby started poking through his own vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find him yet?\" Tyler asked, turning away and crossing his arms as Bobby continued to vomit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Bobby replied simply as he spat into the bucket. \"Think I still got more to puke up. You wanna help look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo thank you!\" Tyler laughed as he walked away. \"I'll let you look through your own puke, dude. I think I'm gonna go for a walk or something.

Without waiting for a response from Bobby, Tyler shut the door and made his way outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was completely helpless as he was trounced around in a ball of cheese. Screaming and crying in pain as the walls contracted and churned around him, there was nothing he could do but hope and pray. Even then the pain on his face and upper torso were too much to handle as he was periodically sloshed into and out of acid filled pools withing the massive chamber of his friend's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty please!\" Josh cried out fruitlessly, tears in his eyes. \"You have to get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Tyler's stomach started to churn and gurgle violently. Everything felt like it got lighter and Josh's ears popped hard as the pressure escaped from the organ, bursting out above him in a massive belch. Josh dropped his head as he gasped for air. There was no rescue coming for him. resigning himself as nothing more than a bit of meat in his friend's stomach, Josh was easily swept into the mess of digested food, pulled under the surface to be processed with the rest of the giant's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rubbed his gut with pride after the recent belch as he made his way past his old apartment. Simply looking at the building Tyler just wanted to reminisce a little as he waited for Bobby to bring Josh up. \"Maybe Josh will buy him more food for me to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler burped loudly again as he rubbed his muscular stomach. It felt like he made a considerable amount of room already. Tyler had no doubt his body had already cleared out the pizza in his gut, ready for the next meal to be consumed. He chuckled slightly as he turned away from the building, heading back to the park. Already feeling hungry again he couldn't wait to see the not so surprised look on Josh's face when he tells him he's hungry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always hungry, Ty!\" Tyler mocked Josh's tone of voice as he walked along laughing.      </span></div></div>",

Josh watched as Bobby scanned the pizza carefully before the two men's eyes locked. Josh breathed a sigh of relief as he saw Bobby smile, knowing he could trust his massive football star friend. Bobby lowered the slice slightly away from his face as he turned to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, there's something like struggling on my pizza.\" Bobby smiled as he looked down on Josh. \"I think it's a bug or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it.\" Tyler said casually. \"Extra protein dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I bet this little bug is scared.\" Bobby smiled as he looked down at Josh. \"Probably doesn't want be eaten today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, if it's dumb enough to get stuck to a piece of pizza then it deserves to be eaten.\" Tyler shrugged as he shoved more of his own pizza in his mouth. \"Its like nature or whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you got stuck to my pizza, I should eat you?\" Bobby asked Tyler with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude.\" Tyler swallowed. \"I'm too big to be stuck to any pizza. So it's not relatable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo...\" Bobby thought for a second trying to catch Tyler in a loophole. \"What if someone like Josh, who is small enough to be stuck to pizza, was stuck to my pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat it, dude.\" Tyler said immediately. \"What did I just say? If it's dumb enough to get stuck to pizza, it deserves to be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you only meant bugs though, bro.\" Bobby chuckled at Tyler and his stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it applies too all things small.\" Tyler swallowed yet another large chunk of pizza. \"In his case he's smaller than most bugs. So the rule applies like twice as hard, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll make an exception for this little bug, for today anyway.\" Bobby smiled as he reached for Josh, easily pinching him out of the sticky cheese and rolling him into his index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so something else will eat or crush it?\" Tyler smirked, leaning in and clearly seeing Bobby had Josh in his hand now. \"If you won't eat it, I will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled as he set Josh on his shoulder, looking down at the little man as he balanced perfectly in the middle of his board muscular shoulders. \"You can't though dude. I made friends with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffff.\" Tyler spat. \"You can't be friends with a bug. Besides what's it matter. I'm hungry and bigger than it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, bro. Can't let you eat my friend.\" Bobby smirked as he stood up and towered over the seated Tyler. \"Besides. I'm bigger than you, dude.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiine!\" Tyler leaned back as he crossed his arms. \"Weirdo over here being friends with a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh merely sat back on Bobby's shoulder, feeling like he had no idea what the heck was going on. \"Uhhh well I'm glad that all worked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Josh!\" Tyler said, looking at him on Bobby's shoulder. \"When'd you end up on Bobby's shoulder? That bug he was friends with must've flown away or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah too bad for that. But at least I got my best buddy on my shoulder, right?\" Bobby smiled as he looked down at Josh. Josh simply smiled and nodded his head, happy to see Bobby was being so protective of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men continued to enjoy their meal as the night went on. Tyler laid on the couch watching TV while Bobby found it much more comfortable on the cushy carpeting of the floor, laying there with Josh resting on his huge chest between his pecs. Bobby yawned as he started to really feel sleepy, due to the long ride here and from just the cumulative stress he's endured lately.  Dropping Josh off on the balcony so that he could sleep up and away from the giants in peace, Josh watched as Bobby made his way back over to his spot on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're alright on the floor?\" Josh asked, concerned for Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, bro.\" Bobby smiled as he tossed off his shirt and set down his hat before laying down on the ground. \"The carpet is like ultra plush bro. It's practically a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine on the couch, don't worry!\" Tyler shot back to Josh, feeling left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't!\" Josh yelled back, unsure if the huge man even heard him from so far away. Either way, Josh found himself getting comfortable on a little bit of padding he had Tyler and Bobby make for him. curling up and looking at the time, Josh tried to get to sleep, excited for what the new day would have in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling in his sleep, Josh woke up in a shock before looking around forgetting where he was for a little while. He looked at his phone for the time seeing it was already 5am. Yawning, Josh wasn't sure if he'd fall back asleep right away. Looking out over the balcony he saw his two best friends, one laying on his back shirtless with his shorts hanging half off his hip on the floor, and the other with a tank top ripped half off his body laying on the couch. Josh smiled, thinking it was kind of funny seeing them both sleep like that. Going back to his cushion Josh also looked at the door to the park, Shrink and Swim, itself. Knowing it was going to be renovated in just a few short hours. Yawning, Josh was feeling adventurous. Deciding he was going to take an early morning stroll, Josh decided to... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Bobby laid near Josh, laying on his back completely shirtless with his shorts pulled down halfway showing his tight spandex underwear underneath as he undoubtedly rolled around a lot in his sleep. To his other side, Josh looked to see the literal wall that was the couch, hanging high above him in what may as well have been hundreds of feet to the minuscule man. Tyler's hand hung off the side, however, as it reached all the way down barely touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man they're out cold.\" Josh laughed to himself as he looked from Tyler's unmoving hand, to Bobby's massive muscular body. Josh shrugged as he approached Tyler's hand seeing just how close it was to the ground. from further away it certainly looked closer to the surface, but alas as Josh approached his friend's giant hand it was much more evident it was out of his reach.

Seeing that his friend remained still as he rested his face on the floor with his mouth hanging open, Josh decided to move closer for a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez...\" Josh said to himself softly as he inspected Bobby's sculpted abs and massive pecs. \"I know it's been awhile since I've seen him with a shirt off... but damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but admire how much more muscular Bobby had gotten since college. It was fairly incredible since Josh had seen him shirtless in the dorm many times before, but all his hard work in the gym showed even more improvement on his already incredibly impressive body. Josh made his way all the way next to Bobby, standing right along his waist as he ran a hand across his skin, admiring his friend's deep and well trained abs and he walked along his abdomen. Josh stopped a little past the belly button as he looked up and Bobby's stomach as he could hear the faint groans and gurgles of Bobby's innards, likely completely done processing the meal from earlier. Josh really took in the sight as he looked up and down Bobby's abs, from the attractive dark blonde fuzz below his and around his belly button, to where it leads flawlessly to his enormous round pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntranced, Josh continued staring before...  </span></div></div>",

Josh couldn't help but smile, hoping that he'd have ample opportunities like this in the future to get closer to his enormous and very attractive friend. Bobby stirred in his sleep however, completely unnoticed by Josh as his massive body started to turn over, ready to rest with his stomach pressed flat against the ground. Finally noticing the movement, Josh looked up and nearly screamed in terror as his first instinct took over. Run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Bobby please don't roll over!\" Josh yelled as he ran as fast as he could out of the way. Alas for the tiny night explorer he may as well have been hundreds of feet from his nearest safe exit. Josh fruitlessly ran before tripping and falling, turning just in time to look up and see Bobby's tremendous abs fall onto him, as if in slow motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought back to a few years ago when Bobby would always mention how restless of a sleeper he was. He distinctly could remember some nights staying up late, studying by flashlight as Bobby laid across the room sleeping. He remembered looking over at Bobby as the huge man would toss and turn and roll in his sleep like crazy. There was more than one occasion where Josh witnessed him either falling out of bed or completely or flipping his body the other way around. He always used to chuckle as his huge friend would contort and roll in different ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, as this was no time to be lost in memories. However it was really all the tiny man could do as he reached his hand up, helplessly trying to brace Bobby's body as it finally flopped on top of him. Josh was completely pressed flat against the cushiony carpet, trapped between the floor and Bobby's rock hard muscle. Somehow, his fate was put on hold as he was pressed roughly against the plush carpet. Unable to move and barely able to breath, Josh chalked up his miraculous survival to carpet's softness. Though it was merely prolonging the inevitable, Josh gasped barely able to draw any kind of breath as he felt his body being completely compressed. Unsure if his bones were broken, or if his lungs were collapsing, Josh simply gave up as he laid there, pinned. Tears rolling out of his eyes from pain, Josh wanted nothing more than for his suffering to end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Bobby's body lifted and Josh turned on to his back seeing Bobby's huge abs being lifted away. Josh smiled as he took a breath of fresh air, feeling alive again. Josh's joy was short lived however as Bobby's solid abs came crashing back down in a tremendous and much less gentle than before crash. Josh didn't stand a chance as he watched his friend's abs come slamming into him, snuffing him out in a tiny unheard squish almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it would turn out, Josh's false hope was nothing more than Bobby shifting again in his sleep. A simple behavior the huge man did on a nightly basis. With a deep breath a little snore, Bobby continued to sleep blissfully unaware of the tiny blood stain he created right up against his stomach.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

With one pectoral muscle next to him and the other high above him, Josh stopped to stare at the giant's chest for a moment. Bobby's heavy breathing and his loud heart beat filled Josh's ears as the giant continued his slumber, completely unaware of the tiny man now making his way toward his face. Josh passed Bobby's huge neck before reaching the chin as Bobby laid on his side, cheek pressed against the floor with his mouth hanging ever so slightly open. Josh bit his lip as he inched in closer and closer before Bobby's breath was all he could smell. Curious, Josh looked inside the huge dark cavern. It was fairly fascinating to the little man after all, considering all the joking he went through while stuck to pizza earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's crazy how easily I'd get lost in there...\" Josh said to himself with a slight shiver as he turned away from the opening, ready to explore somewhere else. However, try as Josh might, he seemed to be finding himself being pulled backward. Suddenly Josh's feet left the ground as he was pulled into the air, Josh turned his head in shock as he was being sucked into Bobby's mouth in what appeared to be a very deep breath. Before Josh could react any fourth he found himself being closed inside the dark cavern he was peering into moments earlier. Josh shivered despite the warmth of Bobby's mouth, hoping whatever happened next would lead  to him escaping the dangerous position. Luck was not on Josh's side however as Bobby's body shifted once again as the huge man seemingly returned to resting on his back, spelling bad news for the tiny explorer as he was sent hurtling toward the back of Bobby's throat. With little to no effort and a very tiny gulp, Josh found himself being dragged away down Bobby's powerful esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby wake up!\" Josh plead as loud as he could as he was being eased down, almost gently by Bobby's natural peristalsis. Josh fought, not wanting to be drug any deeper when finally the little man caught what seemed like a break. Somehow, Josh managed to lodge himself in the enormous jock's throat, halting any further movement to the football star's awaiting stomach. Josh stayed very still as he could feel Bobby start to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby opened his eyes, blinking a few times as he adjusted himself. Sitting up, the huge man rubbed his throat, feeling like there was something minuscule, yet annoying trapped in there. Standing up, he made his way over to the kitchen area, trying to locate a cup or something to fill with water. leaning over the counter, Bobby... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Josh shifted slightly while he sat looking up at Tyler, feeling a little nervous about being left alone while Tyler went to pack up. Noticing his friends slight discomfort, Tyler quickly pulled out his phone and typed out a quick couple of messages with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you texting?\" Josh wondered aloud as Tyler stored his phone back in his pocket. Tyler simply smiled as he sat back down in his seat, resting one of his huge muscled arms down on the table just in front of Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked a couple of the guys to come by and look after you while I was gone. Then I figured it would be cool if we all hung out after anyway, dude.\" Tyler smirked as he leaned back slightly in his chair. Josh shifted a little more as he sat on the table. It was a good idea after all, but part of him wished Tyler had at least asked him before just inviting over a bunch of the the guys over to his place. Deciding not to make a big deal out of it, Josh simply smiled and nodded, appreciating that Tyler was looking out for him in the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who all did you ask to come by?\" Josh asked, curious of who to expect at his door step in a few minutes. On cue, Tyler's phone buzzed and Josh watched as his titanic friend pulled out his phone and scrolled through a few messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well three of the guys are free I guess.\" Tyler started to say. \"They said they'll be by in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned, knowing his question wasn't answered at all. Crossing his arms as he looked up at Tyler's arm stationed in front of him, Josh could help but wonder who all was actually coming to his house. Minutes passed as Josh watched Tyler continue to play on his phone. Feeling left out, Josh started to wish he hadn't left his phone on it's charger back at his office, earlier today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just ordered us some food too.\" Tyler finally piped up as Josh started to slide off to his side in a little boredom. \"So I'll pick that up on my way back, dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Tyler finished his sentence, the door bell rang. Josh watched as Tyler's muscled frame pushed out from the chair with a loud scrape along the floor as he got up to make his way over to the door. Hearing the door open and voices started to travel into his home, Josh looked out trying to see who all showed up at his place. To his surprise, Josh noticed the trio enter his living room consisted of...           </span></div></div>",

Immediately Josh recognized them as Matt and Luke, a pair of lifeguards that worked at Shrink and Swim. The two of them were constantly together as their laid back and goofy natures matched each other well. Stumbling forward, Luke held Matt in a bit of a headlock as the pair pounded into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude! Let go!\" Matt laughed as he pulled Luke off of himself finally. The 22 year old, blonde haired surfer dude smiled as Luke punched him playfully on the shoulder. Josh simply stared at Matt for a moment. Standing at 6'4\" with stunning blue eyes and short styled blonde hair, Matt wore a tight pink v-neck tee shirt with his signature shark tooth necklace hanging out casually on his muscular chest. Also sporting a pair tan cargo shorts held up by a brown loop belt as well as a pair of black sandals and bare feet, Matt looked like he was just fresh from a walk on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I can't believe this is where the boss lives!\" Spouted Luke, the 23 year old goliath. Shifting his attention from Matt to Luke, Josh examined his other goofy blonde employee. At a slightly shorter 6'3\", the buzzed blonde goofball Luke looked around the room with his sharp green eyes, curious of the place his boss lived in. Wearing a blue tank top Josh watched as Luke turned around, from showing off his muscular front to his impressive back. Between his shoulder blades, Josh caught a glace at Luke's bird tattoo before he turned around facing Josh once more. Also wearing a pair of black basketball shorts as well as black running shoes, Josh figured Luke must've been at the gym before coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bros! You better not both be goofing off!\" Josh heard a third voice as he saw the final one of his employee's enter the room, Brody. 20 years old and very attractive, Brody put a hand in his short black hair as he saw Luke and Matt standing by with guilty faces. Despite being the youngest of the three, Brody was easily both the biggest at 6'6\" and the most dependable. Josh sighed in relief as he looked at the massive bro. Wearing a tight black short sleeved spandex shirt as well as some almost form fitting blue running shorts, Brody looked like he had just finished going for a run. Josh watched as the huge man politely stripped off his shoes, revealing his black sweaty looking socks. Crossing his arms as he looked at Luke and Matt, Josh caught a quick glance at Brody's tattoo, a sort of chain that went around his right bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We promised Tyler we'd take this seriously, right bros?\" Brody asked, already knowing how much of a pain in the ass it was going to be to keep those two under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are taking this seriously!\" Luke replied as he put and arm around Matt with a goofy smile. \"Right, Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Matt replied as he looked around the room. \"But uhhh where's the boss anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro... weren't you listening at all to Tyler before he left?\" Brody frowned, shaking his head in not too much surprise. Both Matt and Luke looked a little confused as Brody sighed in frustration. \"Remember? He told us the boss is...\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Sliding a little toward Luke's side of the table as it shifted, Josh planted his hands and feet on the ground, trying to break his momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there you are! Wazzup boss!\" Luke blurted enthusiastically as he spotted his minuscule boss. Taking his hands off the table, Luke sat down and allowed the surface to be level once more, much to Josh's relief. Matt walked over beside Luke, resting his hand on the chair, while Brody made his way around the table and sat right next to Josh in Tyler's old chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing alright, I wasn't expecting such a crowd though.\" Josh piped up finally, commenting purposefully on all of his unexpected guests. Brody crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair, looking at Josh with a somewhat puzzled look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were a little surprised when Tyler told us you had shrunk yourself for the next couple days for the fun of it.\" Brody said before nodding in understanding. \"That's probably not the case though is it bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, not terribly surprised that Tyler would tell everyone he shrunk himself in his own home just for shits and giggles. \"You'd really believe Tyler? All of this was his idea. He didn't even ask me if it was alright to invite you guys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody leaned forward, looking sullen as both Luke and Matt turned to each other with nervous looks. \"Oh we can leave if you don't want us here, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! It's totally alright!\" Josh replied waving his arms, not meaning to offend the three men. \"I just wish Tyler would ask me before he just does things sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's understandable.\" Matt decided to add into the conversation. Luke smirked as he reached up for Matt's head and pulled him down toward the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very insightful Matty!\" Luke mocked as he pushed the table up with his leg while trying to bring Matt's body down. In the struggle, the table started to shake dramatically once again. Caught off balance Josh started to slide directly at Brody, rapidly nearing the edge of the table while the two men wrestled on the other side.

Fearing the worst and expecting to splatter on the wooden floor below, Josh was surprised when the landing seemed oddly soft. Uncovering his eyes as he took a deep breath, Josh instantly regretted the decision as his nostrils were immediately filled with rancid foot stench. Covering his nose and looking around the expansive black surface, Josh held his breath in anticipation. Grateful for the soft landing, Josh tried to relax while he hoped the med above took notice of his absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bros, knock if off!\" Brody yelled at Luke and Matt as the two froze and stared at him.

Luke simply looked up at Matt with a straight face, slowly raising once of his eyebrows at the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start again, bros. Matt's probably right, let's search the floor.\" Brody said as he carefully slid his chair back, tucking his feet under the chair as he lifted them carefully off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody's foot moved faster than Josh could have ever imagined. Screaming as he held on to the fabric of the sock, Josh found himself being carried off under the chair. Dizzied by the sudden rush, Josh shook his head trying to refocus as he held on to the now angled sock and looked around. Looking straight up, Josh saw nothing more than the underside of the chair. Taking a deep breath as he looked forward, he could see Brody's massive body leaned forward slightly as he scanned the ground directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, if you're on the ground we're really sorry! Try and get to a place where we can spot you, bro!\" Brody's voice boomed out from directly above him. Josh sighed, knowing the best thing he could do at this point was to drop off Brody's sock and make his way out from under the chair. Readying to let go of the fabric, Josh struggled for a moment as the crusty sweat drenched on the sock prevented him from pulling out his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lord...\" Josh murmured to himself as he struggled desperately to free his hands, pushing back with his legs for extra leverage before hanging in place in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll give you like 10 minutes boss! Then we have to start walking around to look for you!\" Josh heard Luke's voice call out from the other side of the massive table above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might not notice me on Brody's sock...\" Josh choked as the smell from Brody's feet continually made it painfully obvious where he was trapped. Trying harder to release himself from the sweaty surface, Josh tried to use the thoughts of being stuck to Brody's feet while he stomped around looking for him as his motivation to break free. Pulling as hard as he could against the sweaty material, Josh...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

Sighing in defeat, Josh figured he had little chance but to hope one of the men took a closer look at Brody's actual foot rather than where it was going to step. Putting his faith in Brody, Josh tried to relax and wait for the three to expand their search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude. It's been ten minutes! If you're in a safe spot just try and wave us down!\" Luke called out to the room as he got up and looked at Brody. \"He didn't fall in your lap did he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody quickly looked down at his legs. Quickly scanning the form fitted blue shorts on his lap, he shifted about a little looking all along his upper legs. Standing up, Brody turned and looked at his seat, wondering if maybe Josh had fallen between his legs. Spotting nothing Brody frowned as he shook his head and turned back to Luke and Matt. \"No, bro. He wasn't on my lap or on the chair. He's got to be on the floor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo... if he fell from the table to the floor... wouldn't that like... hurt?\" Matt managed to finish his thought after a few pauses and some hesitation. Brody nodded his head, having not thought of that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, bro. At his size it must've been like falling off a building. He might have a broken leg or something and crawled off somewhere we wouldn't step on him.\" Brody imagined, picturing his tiny boss huddled up by a wall or under some furniture. All the more motivation to start the search, Brody motioned to Luke and Matt to start scanning the area carefully. Looking carefully before taking a step, Brody lowered his foot down as he started to make his way around the side of the table. Taking another step, Brody's foot slid slightly on the floor causing him to almost loose his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit that was close bro.\" Brody said to Luke and Matt who looked over at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find him, dude?\" Luke asked, raising and eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just almost slipped on this floor, bro. My socks are kinda sweaty I think.\" Brody replied, looking behind him and trying to keep his balance steady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take em off, dude.\" Luke laughed as he started to kneel carefully down on the ground to better expand his search. Meanwhile, Brody simply shrugged, reaching down and sticking a finger down the back side of one of his socks, pulling it forward inside out. Doing the same to the other sock, Brody finished unknowing trapping his boss in his now inside out socks. Noticing his traction was a lot better now on the floor, Brody held his socks in on hand as he started to his shoes. Looking down at the enormous running shoes, Brody took his socks and...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Reaching dead end after dead end within the sock, Josh felt like he would never be free of the smelly prison. Damp with sweat that wasn't his own, Josh panted as it became harder to draw breath before finally he made a small tumble. From one sweaty fabric to another Josh found himself out of the sock, but much to his dismay at the toe of a shoe. His eyes a bit better adjusted to the darkness by now could make out the mesh ceiling of the running shoes as well as what was clearly the toe. The path to the heel and the exit however was completely blocked, courtesy of the sock. Josh sat down on the damp floor of the shoe, feeling defeated. At the very least it seemed like the air was moderately more clear here than it was in the sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a circle, the three men felt lost. Having searched the room as thoroughly as they could they started to feel like the tiny man didn't want to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if one of us did step on him?\" Matt asked, frowning and looking down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's small but we would have noticed a crunch or blood or something, bro.\" Brody reassured Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't he just come out?! He knows we aren't going to hurt him!\" Luke said angrily, crossing his arms in frustration. Brody laughed and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, he's probably waiting for Tyler to get here or something. He trusts that dude like crazy.\" Brody answered Luke, trying to be the voice of reason in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get why, dude. Tyler is always messing with him.\" Luke mumbled, still feeling frustrated and impatient. Brody shook his head again, unsure how to reply to Luke's hissy fit. Sitting back, Brody felt a quick buzz from his pocket. Reaching inside, he pulled out his phone, noticing he just got a new message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me that's Tyler?\" Matt asked, looking nervously at the phone. Brody shook his head while he read the message to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro. It's my buddy that lives with me. Guess he went out for the night and forgot to turn off the oven.\" Brody replied as he lowered the phone to his chest, wondering how he should reply. Knowing his oven was newer, it probably didn't have a chance of setting fire. But Brody felt like he should really go home and turn it off. Looking at Matt and Luke's faces however made him rethink it a little. Brody bit his lip, unsure if he should leave the search for Josh in the hands of these two goofballs since they were just as likely to keep looking as they were to get bored and start wrestling each other again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the messager app on his phone, Brody replied...         </span></div></div>",

I'll be back to help you guys look for him though, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it up, dude.\" Luke replied, reaching forward and grabbing Brody's hand. Brody smirked as he stood up, pounding Matt's fist as he straightened his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No goofing off, bros.\" Brody warned once again as he carefully made his way over to his shoes, pulling out the socks and looking at them with a sour face. Tucking the socks in his pocket, Brody decided he'd just slip on his shoes barefoot instead. Sliding his foot into the first shoe, Brody pushed his toes forward and tucked his heel into the flexible mesh of the back of the shoe. Doing the same with the other foot, Brody nodded to the two blondes as he made his way to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking outside to the still sunny day, Brody made his way over to his car which was a slick looking red convertible. Having inherited a good amount of money from his parents, Brody was actually quite well off compared to some of the other guys working at the park. Driving the fancy car  a few miles away, Brody quickly found himself in his home neighborhood. Pulling into his driveway, he looked toward the house. It was rather large for just him and his buddy as it easily could fit a family of six or seven, but it was one of his parents old houses after they moved. Brody found himself lucky enough to inherit it with no payments attached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the front steps, Brody unlocked the door and made his way inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh panted uncontrollably as he gripped the toe of the shoe with all his might. The past few minutes have been filled with nothing but horror for the tiny man. Without any warning, he found himself face to face with Brody's enormous big toe and being squashed against the front of the shoe. Somehow, Josh found a way to shimmy away from the massive toe thanks to the mesh interiors of Brody's shoe, but it wasn't enough to stop the terrifying lifting and dropping of Brody's feet with every step. Nor was it enough to stop the stench of Brody's sweaty feet from washing directly on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Josh simply remained in place hyperventilating and desperately trying to stay calm. Knowing if he let go, it was entirely possible he slipped under Brody's foot. Josh swallowed roughly, not even wanting to think about that happening. Trying close his eyes and relax, Josh hoped against all odds they somehow he could get out of this ordeal. As if to taunt him on cue, Brody's toes flexed menacingly, as if they were challenging Josh's hope directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody reached for the dial on the oven, clicking it off with a sigh as he made his way into his spacious living room. Sitting down on his comfy couch, Brody swung his feet up on the other end, stretching out slightly and laying his head back. Rubbing his hands on his face, he shuddered to think how the search was going back at Josh's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit I wanna help, but I dunno what good it'll do.\" Brody said aloud, feeling exhausted from searching earlier and putting up with Matt and Luke's constant distractions. Trying to just relax a moment, Brody pulled his phone out of his pocket and set it on his chest. Figuring if someone needed him they'd text him, Brody took a breath for a moment while he decided what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went vertical as Josh hung onto the mesh with all his might. Shaking his head as his arms started to give out, Josh nearly cried as he finally released his hold and started to fall ending up...           </span></div></div>",

Having gotten a mouth full of what he could only was assuming was toe jam, Josh made a sour face and gripped his position tightly. Feeling at least somewhat thankful not to be on the underside of Brody's feet, Josh simply hoped this new position would grant him some benefit at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody let loose a massive yawn. Looking at his phone he decided that he would be fine to chill for awhile longer. Reaching down to his feet, Brody untied his shoes and pulled them off tossing them aside with two thumps. Wiggling his toes as he leaned his head back once more, Brody shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the way down at his feet Brody had no idea how happy he just made a tiny hitch hiker. Josh stretched his neck up as far as it would go, breathing in the mostly clean air while he still clung between Brody's toes. Feeling somewhat invigorated, Josh pulled himself up and swung his legs to the other side of the toes. Looking down Brody's feet, Josh cautiously started to slide his way down the steep incline. Reaching the bottom, Josh took a breath. The air was already started to taste less sweaty and more just of Brody's general odor instead. Peering across the long black haired leg in front of him, Josh started to slowly push his way through the dark hairs hoping to reach the bottom of Brody's shorts before too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as Brody's arm suddenly came crashing down near his position. With a massive stroke, Brody itched the spot Josh had just trecked across. Staying still, Josh hoped he would remain hidden from Brody's nails as the huge man retracted his muscular arm. Josh wiped a little sweat from his brow, glad to see Brody's monstrous arm go back to laying along his side. Treading more carefully so as not to create another itch, Josh pressed on making his way to the edge of Brody's tight shorts. Feeling like Brody wouldn't feel his tiny foot steps through the fabric, Josh stepped up and started to work his way once again at a comfortable pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made quite the distance all the way from the leg finally to Brody's slowly rising and lowering abdomen, Josh looked at Brody's phone. Resting not far from where he was, Josh figured that was his ticket to being found. Reaching the device with relative ease, Josh took in his surroundings. From the massive room, to Brody's rolling muscles, there was certainly a lot to take in for such a tiny explorer. Waiting for something to happen, Josh felt impatient. Wanting nothing more than to be found, Josh swayed nervously until...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Puzzled for a moment, Brody's brown eyes met with that of a tiny bug like speck waving at him from on the surface of the screen. Squinting, Brody looked a little closer before raising his eyebrows in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" Brody blinked a few times in surprise as he pulled his phone closer to his neck to get a better look. \"It is you, bro! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Josh started to say as he sat down in relief of being found. \"After I fell off the table I got stuck to your sock.Then you kind of tucked me in your shoe. But now I'm here... so it all worked out in the end I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody tilted his head, confused slightly by the brief recollection of Josh's journey. Figuring the little guy didn't want to have to go into too many horrific details, Brody simply smiled. Glad to see he was safe. \"I guess you're lucky to be alive, bro. Sorry you had to go through all of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody took his phone in his hand, letting Josh simply sit on the surface while he re-positioned himself into a seated position. Holding his phone at about chest height, Brody looked down at Josh as he held his hands against the screen of the phone for balance. \"Yeah, lucky is definitely one way of putting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're safe now, bro.\" Brody winked with an attractive smile. Josh blushed slightly as he looked at Brody's perfect teeth being flashed at him. Looking down, a little embarrassed, Josh suddenly nearly screamed as it seemed like there was a massive earth quake below him. Brody looked at his phone as it lit up, buzzing a bit as he received a message.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked down at Josh, clutching his chest still in surprise. With a simple little pluck, Brody retrieved his tiny boss from off his phone, placing him carefully on a coffee table that sat right across from the sofa. Unlocking his phone and viewing the message, Brody chuckled slightly to see it was from Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty just texted me, bro.\" Brody said with a laugh. \"He's worried sick about you and wants me to come back to help look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed his arms. It was nice to know Tyler was worried about him, but considering this whole stupid ordeal was basically Tyler's fault, Josh held a slight amount of resentment. \"I guess we should let him know you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess, bro?\" Brody asked a little questionably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this whole stupid thing is basically his fault. He's always messing with me like this.\" Josh pouted, thinking of all the times he's been subject to Tyler's childish games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we mess with him then, bro? I'll just tell him I can't make it back tonight.\" Brody smiled at Josh in a friendly way, once again. Josh chuckled at the idea. It would serve Tyler right to have him be the one messed with for once. But on second thought, Josh did feel a little bad that Tyler was at his house looking frantically around for him. Looking up at Brody's handsome face, Josh decided to...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Brody smiled at Josh as he tapped out the reply to Tyler, sending the message and setting down his phone on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done, bro. So I guess it's just you and me now, huh?\" Brody said leaning forward and putting a hand under his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh replied, a little awkwardly as he looked around the room for the first time. \"So this is your house? I've never been here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, bro. I'm sorry. I should show you around or something.\" Brody answered in surprise as he lowered his hand next to Josh, inviting his tiny boss to climb aboard. Josh scaled the side of the huge man's hand, making his way into the center of the palm and sitting down. Josh looked up at Brody as he lifted his hand, standing up as he showed Josh a bit around the living room. Walking from room to room, Josh was in awe of the size of the house. Even if he wasn't currently so tiny, the house would have still be extremely impressive in scale. Going upstairs, Brody continued the tour toward a few bedrooms and bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Vinny's room... and this is my room.\" Brody said as he walked past a few messy looking rooms. Stepping inside his own bedroom, Josh saw it wasn't really all that bad. It smelt heavily of Brody in the large room, and only a few spare clothes and pieces of trash laid scattered across the room. \"Sorry it's a little messy, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries.\" Josh smiled up at Brody. \"Who's Vinny though, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's an old buddy of mine. He lives with me since I've got so much room, bro.\" Brody answered casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so about that... how do you have all this room?\" Josh asked, wanting to get the obvious question out of the way finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my parents are pretty well off, bro. They bought a new home further away on the coast. So they left me this house since it's close to work.\" Brody answered, making it still not sound like such a big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have I never known this? Sorry, but why do you bother working for me?\" Josh asked, hoping not to offend Brody in anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't talk about it, bro. I don't want people thinking I'm a rich snob. Besides, I work for you because its fun, bro. I like my bros down at the park.\" Brody replied, scratching his head a little uncomfortably. \"But bro, if you wanted to give my spot to someone who needs the money, I'd get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that at all!\" Josh said frantically, waving his arms. \"I love having you on staff. I don't want you to go anywhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody simply smiled and looked down at his tiny boss. \"Thanks, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh returned the smile as Brody left the bedroom, making his way back down the stairs toward the entryway. Up next, Brody was determined to show Josh the basement of his house, practically a full gym. Reaching for the door knob, Brody started to explain to Josh what was in the basement and...</span></div></div>",

Josh looked out into the beautifully finished basement with surprise as he saw a wide array of gym equipment. Free weights, benches, a few machines and even a treadmill filled the basement, making it look like a small private gym. Brody walked Josh over to a small counter top at one side of the gym. With a small sink and cabinet, Josh figured Brody must store things that were useful to his works in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, bro?\" Brody asked as he set Josh down on the counter before putting his arms up and spinning to each side, admiring his gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger and has more equipment than the gym I gave you guys at work!\" Josh replied, embarrassed now about the tiny gym he gave the lifeguards back in the break room. Brody laughed, thinking about the tiny gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know my bros appreciate your gym. I do too, bro. Beats running home when I'm on break, am I right?\" Brody replied humorously with a smile. Returning the smile, Josh was glad Brody was overall still such a modest guy, despite his wealth.

Do what you got to do.\" Josh answered, not too thrilled, but glad it'll give him the opportunity to relax none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, bro.

Unscrewing the tops and pulling out a few pills and scooping out a little power into a glass, Josh watched in fascination as Brody mixed the powder with some water and quickly started to guzzle it down. Looking to his side, Josh looked at the pills Brody laid out. Easily dwarfing Josh in size, he almost jumped as Brody grabbed the seemingly car sized pills and popped them in his mouth, swallowing them down with the rest of his drink with ease. Setting his glass down next to Josh with a sigh, Josh looked up at the handsome man with a slight blush on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuurp!\" Brody released a moderately closed mouth burp as he rubbed his stomach through his tight black shirt. \" 'Scuse me, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries...\" Josh nearly stuttered as the black haired colossus took his hand off his stomach. \"What were those anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my pre-workout, bro? It was just like, creatine, a little supplement, some pill form of some NOS. Does wonders for my workout, bro.\" Brody said with an attractive wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's pretty amazing how something so small can have such a big impact on your body. Makes me a little...\" Josh started to say before finishing his final word under his breath. \"Jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody rose an eyebrow as he barely heard the last thing Josh said. \"Bro, jealous of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Josh replied, embarrassed Brody heard him. \"I didn't say that.. I said it makes me a little... inspired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I heard you bro. What are you jealous of? That those little supplements can have such a big impact on my body? Or just that they have a big impact in general despite being so small, bro?\" Brody asked, crossing his arms in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, feeling like he was caught red handed in midst of a fantasy. Feeling like he couldn't fool Brody at this point, he decided to just tell the truth. \"Well... I meant specifically having an impact on your body. I mean I'm so small and I'd do nothing for you if I was a supplement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be better as a post workout protein snack, bro!\" Brody joked, laughing and putting a hand down on the counter top. \"After all it's after the workout that my body would need the protein, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed even harder, knowing Brody was probably just joking. But the idea of being Brody's little protein snack after his workout started to sound like such an appealing idea. \"Sounds like I could be useful after all then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody continued to laugh a little as he didn't really notice Josh shaking a little in a mix of excitement and fear. \"Yeah bro! I'll have to give you a try after my workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Brody turned away to head into his gym. Still shaking a little from the exchange with Brody, Josh's knees felt to start weak as he fell to the ground. Sitting down, Josh watched as the massive god that was Brody, worked his way over to his bench press and started to rep out some heavy weights. Josh could do little more than stare in awe at the muscular man as he moved from the bench to free weights, doing everything from chest flies, to bicep curls. As time went by, Josh noticed Brody started to work up quite the vigorous sweat. Casually, the colossal bro stripped his shirt and stood in the room with nothing but his tight blue shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way over to Josh, Brody panted in a sweaty saunter. \"Bro, did you see me killing it out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he looked up at the shirtless sweaty man. His scent just oozing off of him smelling like a gym. \"Yeah, you looked like you were working pretty hard, Brod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro. I just kept thinking about how much of an impact you'd have on me as my protein!\" Brody said, still panting, but finding a way to add in a charming wink in his words. \"What do you say, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh froze, unsure how serious Brody actually was. \"Say to w-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being my protein, bro.\" Brody laughed. \"You'd literally be brotein, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe the offer he was being made. Unsure how to react, Josh thought about it for a few seconds before replying...            </span></div></div>",

Brody set the shake down on the counter top and looked at Josh with a friendly wink. \"Bro, taking those pills gave me a bit of an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh?\" Josh replied in a delay, more focused on Brody's ripped body than he was on what the huge man was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro. I've got some clear pills, I could open em up and stick you in side of that? You'd be like a little brotein pill, bro!\" Brody smiled happily as he reached up into the cabinet, fumbling around for a moment before pulling out a clear pill, opening it up and emptying the contents into the garbage. Brody set the open pill beside Josh, who still stood still in somewhat of a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Yeah we could do that.\" Josh replied finally. \"I just thought you'd wash me down with your protein shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bro, you're small enough were I wouldn't need anything to wash you down.\" Brody laughed as he put a hand on his chest in amusement. \"But if that's how you wanna go down then let's do it up, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed at the comment. He was pretty small after all. But something about being washed down between chugs of Brody's shake just made him feel like he was really a part of it. Looking over at the open capsule beside him, Josh began to wonder how scenic the view would be from the capsule instead. Looking at it closer, he could easily fit inside and have tons of room to walk around and take in the whole trip. Conflicted, Josh decided if he was going to be protein for Brody then he was going to do it...         </span></div></div>",

Looking up at Brody's chiseled body however, Josh started to feel more excited than he was nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure bro?\" Brody asked as he picked the shake up off the counter. Once again Brody started to rub his chest as he looked down at his body. \"You're just so tiny, bro. I feel like I'd lose track of you as soon as I swallowed you!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head a little confused at the statement. \"I'm not really sure why that matters? It's not like you normally have to keep track of things while they go down your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody frowned as he took a short sip from his shake, swallowing it down with a light gulp before setting it back down on the table. \"Well no, bro. But normally I don't have to worry about bringing little buddies back out of my gut.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes widened a bit surprised at the the huge hunk's words. \"You were going to bring me back up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody rose an eyebrow as he leaned down closer to Josh with a half smile. \"Wait you thought I was gonna keep you down, bro? You're my buddy, bro. I wasn't about to just digest you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well...\" Josh swallowed nervously. \"I guess in my mind I just didn't care what happened after you swallowed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh you wouldn't have cared if the acid in my stomach literally killed you, bro?\" Brody laughed as he rested his elbows in front of Josh and stared down at the little man. \"I just don't know if I could do that to you, bro. Ever since I started working for you, you always seemed like more of a buddy than a boss to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed at Brody's comment, finding it kind of charming in a way. \"You know, I bet plenty of guys wish they could just eat their boss and be done with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody chuckled as he continued to squat in front of the counter and speak to Josh. \"Yeah you aren't kidding, bro. Still though, you're not one of those bosses. If I had know you were this serious, I wouldn't have teased you so much, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to do it?\" Josh asked, almost disappointed he wasn't going to be eaten by the colossal stud. Brody moved a finger to his face, scratching his cheek a little at Josh's disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really serious, huh bro?\" Brody said finally with a smile. \"But let me ask you, does it have to be me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked somewhat puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, do I have to be the one to do it. I mean if you are just looking to just get eaten for the thrill of being some dude's protein I could easily set you up, bro. But if you feel like your heart is set on me, I'd do it for you, bro.\" Brody explained, giving Josh a confident wink. Josh wasn't really sure what to make of all that, but he could tell Brody was still hesitant about doing it himself. Unsure if he wanted to put Brody through it or not, Josh bit his lip as he looked at the handsome man's face, feeling like he may really well be set on Brody. Making up his mind, Josh decided...       </span></div></div>",

But I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to slurp you up since I found you. So I'm happy to help.\" Brody slowly raised you to his shake and gently plopped your body in, before giving it a small shake or two. Not enough to disorient you, but enough so that he couldn't see you in the shake. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well\" he said \"no more chance for backing out. This is it\". He raised the protein shake to his lips and began to chug. You slid back into the bottle, before drifting back towards his mouth. He paused to swallow, before returning the edge to his lips and sucking the rest of the shake and you into his mouth, running his lips tightly over you as you slip inside his mouth. He feels you enter his mouth and washes you around his mouth, tasting every inch of you with his tongue, rubbing you into the roof of his mouth and gently squeezing your naked form. This becomes almost too much for you to bear, as you give into your urges and kick your pants off as he tosses your around his mouth. You mount his tongue and begin to rub up and down his soft, wets tongue. You ride his tongue like theres no tomorrow, moaning loudly. Brody feels your motions in his mouth and hears your moans, and smiles. Before you can climax, Brody moves you to the back of his throat, and swallows, dragging you into his tight throat. As you begin the long trek to his stomach, his throat muscles tighten constantly around you, bringing you further down into his massive body, while providing your groin with constant friction. Within seconds you climax in ultimate bliss, and sigh as his body slowly pulls you in further into his warmth.</span></div></div>",

In the end, he started to just narrow it down to a fit young guy in need of the tiny extra protein. \"I guess it really doesn't matter if it's you or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody wiped his brow in a bit of relief. \"That's good to hear! I mean, sort of, bro. I still don't know if I entirely like the idea of just sacrificing you to some dude, but if it's what you really want then I'm up for it, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at Brody's considerate nature. He really wasn't sure what was driving his determination through this epic fantasy of his, but now that it's started he wanted to see it through. \"Maybe it was my brush at death in your shoe earlier or something, but it made me realize just how frail and insignificant I am. I can't really explain it, but it was a rush... I want to experience this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shook his head with a smile, still not entirely understanding. \"If it's what you really want, bro. I guess I can bring you to a gym and drop you in a random dude's protein shake if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scratched his chin for a second. He hadn't thought about being in some completely unaware dud's shake. Being insignificant was one thing, but being so unnoticed that some dude would drink him and never know any better sounded like it was taking it too far. \"I think I want the guy to at least know I'm there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want the dude to want to eat you?\" Brody asked, still trying to wrap his brain around his tiny boss's logic. \"That's gonna be a little tougher, bro. Can't exactly just walk into gym and flaunt you around to everyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I guess when you put it like that it all sounds very stupid...\" Josh said, feeling a little disappointed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bro. I could always talk to one of my house mates, Vinny and Lyle. Either of them should be home soon.\" Brody replied, trying to put on a smile. \"They're both fit guys, they both work in construction. Either of them would probably get a kick out of eating you up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, it was a very sweet, yet somewhat morbid offer. Thinking for a minute, Josh did figure it would be easily to approach either Vinny or Lyle, but there was something still oddly enticing about approaching a total stranger. Thinking on it for a minute, Josh decided he wanted to approach...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You wanna go with that, bro?\" Brody asked, unsure where Josh was taking his thoughts exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I want to find a total stranger to both of us. I hope that's not asking too much...\" Josh said looking down at the floor in embarrassment. \"I feel bad I'm putting you through all this trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really any trouble for me, bro.\" Brody responded as he stood up straight and grabbed his remainder of his protein shake. Quickly, Brody downed the shake in a few swift gulps before laying his free hand down on the counter top, indicating Josh to climb on. Getting on the sweaty palm, Josh looked up as Brody continued his statement. \"I actually have a gym membership I never use, bro. We could scope out that gym and see what's up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh merely settled in Brody's hand as the two of them made their way up the stairs. Josh looked up at Brody's massive still bare torso as watched carefully as his pecs bounced gracefully with each step he took. Close to the man's ripped abdomen, Josh swore he could hear the faint groans and gurgles of Brody's stomach, no doubt hard at work processing the protein and supplements the enormous man just took. Josh sighed to himself for a moment, trying to picture what it would be like to be on the other side of the wall of muscle. Shaking the thought though, Josh tried to focus. After all he didn't want his mind stuck on Brody in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way into the kitchen, Josh crawled off Brody's hand onto the kitchen table as he watched Brody drop his empty cup in the sink. Without a word, Brody left Josh for a moment, returning briefly wearing a black tank top. \"Alright, you ready, bro?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Josh simply said with excitement. He couldn't entirely rationalize his excitement even to himself, but at this point he figured logic and reason were all pretty much out the window. Brody actually smiled, looking at the little man's eagerness as he lowered his hand once more. Brody moved his hand up to his broad shoulder, letting Josh off on his skin next to the cloth of his tank top. Holding on to the black fabric, Josh was ready as Brody started to move, making his way out of the house and toward his car. Josh blushed as he watched the handsome man flip on a pair of sunglasses before the two made their way off toward the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around in amazement at the massive gym he and Brody just entered. To Brody it was really nothing special, but the sheer size and scope of the inside of the building left Josh absolutely speechless. Men and women rand tirelessly on treadmills on one end while loud grunts and groans came from the other as some burly men set heavy weights on the ground. Holding on tight, Josh looked closely as Brody made his way near a group of guys lifting barbells in front of a mirror. Grabbing a few himself, Brody grabbed a couple heavy ones showing off just how much he could lift. Josh was puzzled, after all they didn't come here for Brody to work out, but looking at Brody's face Josh saw a knowledgeable smirk curl on the man's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Josh nearly jumped as a voiced popped up near Brody. \"Yo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as the man walked over as Brody set the dumbbells down. Looking closely at him this man looked to be...   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

With short spiky brown hair and sharp blue eyes, Josh couldn't help but eye the young man as he stood in front of Brody. He was very slightly shorter than Brody, which Josh guessed put him at about 6'4\". He wore a grey tank top and black gym shorts. Josh couldn't help but bite his lip as his eyes wandered up and down the stranger's body, easily bulging with muscle and showing through his much too small tank top. Snapping back to reality, Josh nearly jumped as he responded to the stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up bro?\" Brody asked with a slight smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give me a spot, dude?\" The young man asked with a bit of sweat forming around his his face and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, bro.\" Brody responded as he followed the young stud to the bench press. Josh held on tight as Brody leaned over the guy's face, positioning his hands under the bar, ready to help if need be. Josh watched as the bar lifted off the rest and the huge man started to lift and lower the weight. Josh couldn't help but be astonished, to him the weights may have been gigantic buildings, and this guy was simply moving them up and down to get a work out on. A little time passed and the man thanked Brody as the two worked together to re-rack the weights. Brody stepped aside to a little more remote part of the gym and looked down at his shoulder, still seeing his tiny friend in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, bro?\" Brody asked, looking at his tiny boss, clinging for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of what?\" Josh asked, still looking around the room in awe of all the giants working out frivolously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dude, bro. Did you like him?\" Brody asked, hoping he didn't have to explain himself further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head, finally focusing on what Brody was trying to ask. \"Yeah absolutely, I guess I just didn't understand how you were getting his attention in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy bro.\" Brody said giving his arm a little flex. \"Just do a couple easy work outs in front of people and they see you and start asking for spots. I'm gonna follow him out the gym, bro\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded as he looked out into the gym, seeing the guy in question as he left the locker room holding a gym back over his shoulder and sipping from a shaker bottle. Brody casually started to follow him at a distance as the two made their way out of the gym. Brody worked up his pace a little bit until he was right behind the man, before he pulled his keys out of his pocket, intentionally dropping them on the ground. The college stud turned around to see Brody picking up his keys and recognizing him as the guy who gave him a spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey dude, have a good work out?\" The man asked politely as Brody stood back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, bro. How about you? You look like you're in good shape, you on any teams or something?\" Brody asked trying to strike up a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah dude, I play baseball for my college. I also do club football so I don't get hurt in the off season. What about you? You're huge dude.\" He asked, looking at Brody's taller yet equally buff figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro. I play lacrosse. Not for a team anymore though.\" Brody added with a friendly smile. \"Hey bro, wanna see something cool?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah sure dude.\" He responded as the two of them walked out of the parking lot and over toward the sidewalk instead. He watched carefully as Brody reached for his shoulder and carefully pinched something off and held it in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this bro, it's a tiny person!\" Brody said, trying not to make his connection to Josh super clear. Josh simply looked up at the stranger's look of bewilderment and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How is that even possible?\" The young stud wondered as he looked at Josh waving at him casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that Shrink and Swim park around here? There was a malfunction or something and this guy is seemingly stuck like this.\" Brody tried to lie, turning a little red as he was a terrible lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... I'm sorry to hear that little guy.\" The giant man said, leaning down to look at Josh a little closer. Standing back to his full hieght he looked at Brody again. \"So why did you want to show me him, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Brody started to say as he glanced down at Josh and took a deep breath, ready to try and make up another lie once again. \"He's gotten a little tired of being small. He kinda wants to go out with a bit of an adventure, bro. I'd do it myself, but I can't bring myself to do it. So I had to find someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha, dude.\" The young stud replied with a smile, buying Brody's lie. \"I don't think I could live with being so small either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll help me our, bro?\" Brody asked, lifting Josh to about chest height. \"He kind of has a specific way he wants to go out, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fair. The little dude should be able to pick how he wants to end it.\" The college stud responded, looking at Josh with a friendly smile. \"How do you wanna do this dude?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked nervously at the handsome man before deciding to speak for himself. \"Well like he said... I want to go out on a bit of an adventure. I was kind of hoping I could be... eaten.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man blinked a little before nodding his head. \"It's an odd request. I can see why your buddy couldn't do it. But I think I gotcha, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Brody and Josh asked in almost unison. He simply nodded his head more with a grin. Brody reached out his hand, offering Josh to what he knew would be the man to do him in. Reluctantly, Brody watched as he handed off the tiny man. Brody bit his lip as the man brought his hand closer to his chest and...              </span></div></div>",

Josh could tell that the boy was really hungry and really needed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be that food soon\u201d Josh thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for that little dude, my stomach is pretty hungry after that workout.

Josh could not keep his balance and fell onto the hand. Josh watched the mountainous abs fly by and change into giant pec shaped mounds until he was face to face with the perfect closed lips of the young man. The lips started to part revealing the inside of his mouth with strands of silvia looking like columns inside connecting to his sexy soft inviting tongue. The jock\u2019s breath smelled of the sports drink that he had been downing during his workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody watched as the young man tilted his head back and positioned his hand over his mouth. He then started to tilt his hand causing Josh to slip towards the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fell into the jocks mouth landing on his tongue and sliding a little towards the back of his throat. The young man stopped his slide towards the abyss of the throat by pushing him against the roof of his mouth with his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm the little dude tastes pretty good.\u201d Said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock moved Josh around his mouth, tasting him and covering him in silvia to prepare him for the trip down his throat. After about a minute of tasting he opened his mouth again to let Brody see him again one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked into the jock\u2019s mouth to see Josh coated in spit it the middle of his tongue. Josh seeing Brody started to reach out his hand. The jock chose that moment to start flexing his tongue pushing Josh towards the back of his throat, and with his mouth open swallowed. Brody watched in fascination as the jocks throat and tongue flexed in unison to grab Josh and drag  him down the young man\u2019s throat. After about two flexes only Josh\u2019s head was left in his mouth. With another flex Jost was just a lump in the jock\u2019s throat. The young man traced with his finger Josh down his throat passing his massive pecs and dropping into the stomach behind his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the snack bro, but I need to get more food now to build muscle from that workout. I\u2019ll catch you around sometime.\u201d Said the jock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock jumped into his car and left Brody standing there still in a little bit of shock and awe at what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had landed in a small pool in the jock\u2019s stomach and was starting to have second thoughts about this decision.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the stomach \u2013 Josh was pounding his fists against the walls of his organic prison and screaming for help.  After a terrifying trip down the throat, Josh found himself in a shallow pool of some sports drink surrounded in a putrid darkness with ominous sounds of gurgling around him.  Josh was quickly realizing that becoming protein for some nameless jock was a really poor decision on his part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrody! Anyone! Get me back out!\u201d Josh yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the thick layers of organic mass and muscle, Josh\u2019s cries went unheard by both his devourer and Brody.  Instead, the only response was from the stomach itself which groaned and rumbled seemingly to protest against Josh\u2019s tiny mass and what little protein or sustenance it would provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant of the tiny\u2019s plight within his body the young student-athlete continued driving and listening to his car radio until a series of gurgles and rumbles from his torso interrupted the music.  As he expected from before, the tiny guy barely made a dent in his appetite and his body needed much more to recover from the strenuous gym workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming Josh would hear him, the muscular bro looked down at his abs and said \u201cSorry little dude, you were tasty but my stomach is going to more than you as a post workout snack.  Gonna need to send something else down so get ready for some company down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering he still had his post workout shake the guy grabs his shaker bottle and chugs down the chocolatey liquid protein.  The cool mixture descends down his throat with each gulp, following the same journey that Josh took moments ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the toned stomach Josh had heard every word and was yelling in protest as a deluge of the brownish goopy fluid quickly spewed out of the sphincter and dumped over him.  Josh was quickly swept off his feet and completely submerged as the once empty cavern became a deep swirling vortex of slimy chocolate muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God! Please stop!\u201d Josh yelled as he finally breached the surface and saved himself from drowning in liquid protein.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the young jock took the last few sips of his post workout drink and wondered what was it was like for the tiny guy inside his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019re having a blast in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy paused waiting for a response from Josh but couldn\u2019t feel or hear anything even though tiny Josh was yelling his loudest and furiously beating against the fleshy walls of the stomach.  The only response the young stud heard was from his stomach which again groaned and gurgled angrily back clearly unsatisfied with only liquids and a tiny man inside of it.  It was demanding real solid food and lots of it after a strenuous full-body workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, calm down.\u201d  he says to his stomach just as he arrives to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that fueling his body was a bigger priority than getting to class on time the young student strolls into his favorite joint near the campus and places a large order of a double-stacked burger with a large drink, salad, fries, and an extra order of wings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular stud sits down at an empty table and lifts his shirt, admiring his toned gut and wondering how the tiny man is enjoying the ride.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright little dude, if you\u2019re still alive in there get ready!  Hope you don\u2019t mind but it\u2019s my cheat meal today and I need to bulk up after that workout with a large meal.  More fuel in the tank!\u201d the jock says before taking a bite of the juicy burger and working to down his cheat meal quickly so he could make it to class on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Josh heard every word from inside his devourer and couldn\u2019t disagree more about the chosen diet plan.  Despite Josh\u2019s objections, the stomach groaned and gurgled with joy \u2013 eager to receive the copious amounts of carbs, fats, and proteins that began arriving with each mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewed masses of food began raining down from above and poor Josh was forced to find safety on the far edge of the cavernous stomach to avoid becoming buried.  Things were quickly becoming crowded and chaotic inside the gut as the once empty space was replaced with the piles of masticated mush and sludge dropping into the now noisy, busy chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within the rancid darkness of the jock\u2019s massive gut, everything was in constant motion as the young athlete\u2019s metabolic processes began their normal routine.  Detecting a large meal needing to be processed, the stomach was already busy contracting and churning every few seconds \u2013 mixing everything together and saturating all the stomach contents with secreted acid and enzymes.  Josh was helplessly trapped within the hellish environment and feeling its effects.  The shrunken man beginning to notice what started as a mild burn on his bare hands and skin was quickly turning into a stronger more searing pain all over body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocused on the delicious food in front of him, the muscular stud had long forgotten about tiny man inside his gut and was instead more concerned about what to eat next.  However, a quick glance down at his phone screen interrupts this as he sees the current time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!  Gotta get to class if I don\u2019t want to be late!\u201d he realizes as he stuffs the last bits of his meal into his mouth and gulps down a few mouthfuls without bothering to chew thoroughly.  The young student grabs his backpack and hurriedly exits the fast food restaurant to reach his next class.  At first the student starts off with a casual walk but halfway there notices that time is running short and he begins a light jog across the college campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within the stomach Josh was still clinging to life but quickly losing the strength to keep himself afloat in the constantly churning lake of half-digested mush and acids.  Each step the young athlete took on his casual walk to class caused the digestive slurry to slosh back and forth.  Josh was nearing complete exhaustion but luckily found a half-chewed mass of burger bun that was relatively intact enough to support him.   Josh climbed aboard and sighed \u2013 grateful that this raft of carbohydrates would provide him with refuge from the acidic chyme.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this relief would prove to be short-lived as the young stud\u2019s walking pace suddenly changed into a quick and more intense jog.  Josh screamed in terror as chaos ensued and things inside the stomach became much more violent with each pounding step.  The delicate raft of carbs would not hold and suddenly broke apart, sending a screaming and panicked Josh into the raging lake of acids and digesting food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no strength left to surface, the tiny man was unable to free himself from the pool of caustic acids and enzymes.  His exhausted body eventually gave out as it finally lost its battle against the efficient metabolism of an athletic teenager.  Josh\u2019s lifeless body floated away in the soupy chyme, joining the rest of the digesting food to be sloshed and churned about with each stomach contraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving to class in the nick of time, the young student sits down for lecture just as the instructor begins the day\u2019s lesson.  Finally able to rest, the jock contemplates about the guy he ate earlier and wonders if he\u2019d be able to find other \u2018willing\u2019 tinies that were in the same shrunken accident that Brody told him about when they met at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should get try getting a job at the water park where that tiny guy came from.  Maybe I can get some more tinies as protein that will want to go out the same way as the earlier guy\u201d The man thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a slight gurgle from his midsection, the muscular bro looks down and wonders where the tiny man is within his digestive tract.  Resting his hand on his toned abdomen, the young stud couldn\u2019t feel anything except for the slight rumbles from his digesting gut which was happily churning away at the large meal it finally received.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle guy must be gone by now.  Hope he got the adventure he wanted!\u201d the student thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he would quickly regret his adventure choice, Josh did become the first human to be ingested and journey through the digestive tract of a male jock.  It wasn\u2019t only the adventure of a lifetime for Josh but his last ever.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's like five inches taller than me and works out twice as much as me.\" Brody laughed thinking about Lyle for a moment. \"If you can even believe that, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think he'd you know...\" Josh tried to be coy about the awkward conversation. \"Be interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ummmm...\" Brody thought for a moment, rubbing his chin in thought. \"He's pretty impulsive. But I could see him being a bit questionable with the whole deal, bro. We might have to come up with a lie or something, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... okay well... we'll cross that bridge when we get there...\" Josh mulled it over for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean 'if' we get there, bro.\" Brody corrected Josh. \"What if you saw him and thought... nah I don't wanna do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's a good point.\" Josh fakely replied. To be honest, based off the short description Brody gave him, Lyle sounded perfect. But Josh was trying his hardest not to seem too eager. \"When do you think he'll be home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody pulled out his phone and looked at the time. \"Should be any minute. Sounds like Vinny went out for the night, but Lyle will be here soon.\" Brody answered as he looked at his messages. As if on cue, Josh and Brody heard the sound of massive footsteps from upstairs. Brody stood up straight and smiled as he looked down at Josh. \"That's gotta be him, bro. He always works out after work, so I'll leave you here to scope him out while I go take a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Brody started to saunter away, heading upstairs from the basement and leaving Josh on the table. Josh sat still, hearing muffled voices from the floor above, before hearing lighter foot steps go further upstairs and the heavier ones coming toward the door to the basement. Josh swallowed nervously as the door opened and he watched as an absolute titan started to squeeze his way down the stairs. Josh's jaw dropped as the enormous man came into full view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brody has described, Lyle was absolutely huge. Taller than Brody with muscles bursting out of his tight white tank top. Josh was immediately distracted by his grey athletic shorts, sagging in the back showing off the most perfect muscular bubble butt clad in compression shorts he'd ever seen. Looking up past his incredible torso Josh was transfixed on the man's handsome and rugged face. With blonde hair shaved on the sides of his head and styled on the top, leading down to his chiseled face covered in a slightly darker scruff, Josh was instantly in love with the massive titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nearly shrieked as the giant peeled off his tank top, revealing his amazingly muscular body. With rippling abs and a massive chest with light hairs littered across them, Josh could do little more than gawk.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get started, bro.\" Lyle said to himself in a deep sexy voice. Josh couldn't help but turn red as the man's voice was so perfect. Still observing, Josh watched as the godlike man started to do his workout routine. Watching carefully, it was true what Brody had said. Lyle spent more time doing more reps and with higher weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, Lyle finished his workout. Sweaty, the titan came over to the table where Josh had watched the giant. Looming over him, Lyle made a protein shake as Josh could do nothing more than stare up at his sweaty perfect body. Walking away with the shake, Josh watched him go upstairs mesmerized by the way each side of his ass would alternate bouncing up and down. Shaking his daze, Josh saw as the familiar form of Brody came down the stairs, now wearing a black tank top, hat, and a pair of blue athletic shorts. Coming over the the table, Brody knelt down to look and see Josh was right where he left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro. So what'd you think?\" Brody asked, partially hoping Josh would just back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's perfect. Let's go talk to him!\" Josh replied excitedly, a little to Brody's disappointment. Brody shook his head and laughed, if it was what Josh really wanted he wasn't one to argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bro. But we'll have to come up with a lie, otherwise I think he'll have second thoughts about going through with it.\" Brody informed Josh. \"You wanna come up with something, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm why don't you?\" Josh asked, tilting his head. \"You know him better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I'm a pretty terrible lair, bro.\" Brody scratched the back of his neck. \"You're better off doing the talking I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I don't know this guy at all...\" Josh mulled to himself. Thinking on it for a moment, Josh decided that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially with Lyle or Vinny. They've known me too long.\" Brody chuckled, leaning back as he's thought about a few times he's tried and failed miserably to lie to his two closest friends. \"You're better off trying than I am, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... well I'll do my best.\" Josh answered as Brody laid his hand down for him to crawl onto. Lifted up to the massive man's face, Brody gave a bit of a half smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll come up with something, depends on how badly you want this, bro.\" Brody reminded Josh, a little relieved himself he didn't have to come up with something that would ultimately lead to his tiny friend's death. Regardless, Brody carried Josh up the stairs knowing that there wasn't much he could do to change Josh's mind from at least trying. Reaching the top and rounding the corner, Brody turned and saw Lyle in the kitchen. Still shirtless and drinking his protein shake as he was pulling some food out of the refrigerator, undoubtedly preparing himself something to eat after a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Lyle.\" Brody said to his housemate, who turned and looked at Brody as he finished cutting up some chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Brod!\" Lyle answered with a smile as he looked at Brody, somewhat awkwardly standing there with his hand cupped at his side. \"Uhhh whatcha got there, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um. So you know how I work at this place where they shrink people, right?\" Brody asked, as Lyle turned on the stove and started to cook his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, bro. Shrink and Swim, right?\" Lyle chuckled, hoping Brody had a little more confidence in him to know where he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got it bro.\" Brody walked over and leaned on his island counter across from Lyle. \"Well, I have a little guy here from the park and he wants to talk to you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, you have a tiny person in your hand, bro?\" Lyle asked as he chicken cooked in the pan. \"I can't even see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Lyle turned fully away from the stove, now standing across from him at the island, staring right at him with his eyes squinting. Brody lifted his hand a little, letting Josh off close to Lyle on the smooth surface of the island. Josh stared up as Lyle leaned down, to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah hey there, little guy!\" Lyle smiled as his entire muscular body took up Josh's view. \"You're like almost microscopic! A little micro-bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think I'm that small!\" Josh called up at the titan, very nervous about talking to the handsome man for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you can talk?\" Lyle asked a little surprised. \"Well I guess you are human, even if you are really small, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, bro. You can look after him for a few minutes right?\" Brody interrupted. \"I have to make a run to the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem, bro!\" Lyle smiled as Brody left the room, giving Josh a bit of a long look before leaving. All the while, Josh stared up at Lyle, his amazing body and godlike voice having him in an absolute trance. \"So anyway, micro-bro. Brod said you wanted to talk to me? Kind of weird he has you in the first place though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" Josh thought, having had time to come up with a story. \"You see I've been actually living here for awhile now. Brody just had me in hiding in case something ever happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, for real, micro-bro?\" Lyle looked a little surprised. \"I would've never known. Why were you here for so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an accident at the water park. The shrinking machine shrank me, but then I was never able to regrow.\" Josh recited the lines he'd been practicing in his head. \"I was lucky Brody found me, then he's been trying to find a way to regrow me ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it without much luck, huh micro-bro?\" Lyle responded, quickly turning as he shifted his food around in the pan a bit. \"Don't mind me cooking, bro! I'm staving, but I promise I'm listening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Josh smiled, low-key hoping he could be a part of that meal after Lyle's intense workout. \"But yeah, you're right. We can't figure it out. I don't know how much longer I can live like this, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't say that, micro-bro!\" Lyle gave Josh a thumbs up as his food just finished cooking. Josh watched as the giant dumped the food onto a plate and pulled a chair over to the island and set it down and started eating. \"You don't mind if I eat while we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all...\" Josh felt a little mesmerized as he watched Lyle take a huge bite out of his food, distracted for a moment as he saw the huge man's adam's apple bob, sending the food down into his enormous stomach. \"But for real, we almost had an accident the other day where I almost got squished under a quarter. Can you imagine how sad it would be to go out like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could think of worse ways.\" Lyle chewed up and swallowed some more food. \"What's your name by the way, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Josh.\" Josh answered, feeling like Lyle was getting a little distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's cool to finally meet you, Josh! I'm Lyle as you probably already knew!\" Lyle chuckled, trying to imagine all the time he might've passed by Josh without even knowing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's cool to meet you too.\" Josh smiled at the kind giant. \"But do you mind if I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, micro-bro!\" Lyle chewed through a bit more of his food with a loud gulp afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after a few times of almost getting accidentally squished I realized how frail I am.\" Josh explained to Lyle, who simply watched Josh as he ate. \"And I realized, I don't want to be tiny anymore. But I also don't want to go out just insignificantly squished by mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhh?\" Lyle asked, wondering when Josh was going to actually ask what he wanted to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I had originally asked Brody to eat me, I figured it'd be a crazy experience I could have and also my life could have significance since I'd at least be a tiny bit of protein. Rather than being uselessly stepped on or something.\" Josh tried to explain without sounding crazy or weird. \"But he couldn't do it. We tried, but he couldn't bring himself to swallow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo you want me to do it?\" Lyle asked, feeling a little tentative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I figured you didn't know me. So for you it'd be easy.\" Josh tried pump Lyle up a little with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\" Lyle mulled it over for a second. \"Yeah sure! I'll do it, micro-bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Josh answered excitedly. \"Thanks Lyle. I know it's crazy but I really feel like this is what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good, micro-bro. Won't be any skin off my bones.\" Lyle shrugged as he finished eating. \"Whew! That was a good meal! So should I eat you now? Or wait? Like how's this going down, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm well I guess I'd prefer it if it was right after you worked out.\" Josh suggested as Lyle nodded in approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that that idea. You'd go straight to my muscle, micro-bro!\" Lyle flexed his chest and abs a little. \"I could name one of my abs after you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed, it was nice hearing Lyle was so on board with the idea. \"Well you did work out not long ago. So is now good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did just eat. It's probably a mess in my stomach, micro-bro.\" Lyle gave his perfect 6-pack a slap followed up by a little rub. \"But if you're down with that, than I am too. But we could always wait till the next time I work out. I could gobble you up right after I finish my workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it. It almost didn't matter to him, but it was crazy to think he had options from the handsome titan. Choosing the timing of his demise, Josh thought it sounded more enticing to be eaten...   </span></div></div>",

Shit, I didn't know you'd go ahead and want me to actually eat you.\" Brody rubbed the back of his head, a little embarrassed. \"You're so small you'd have no impact at all on my body, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well okay...\" Josh answered really disappointed. \"I'm sorry Brody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro...\" Brody felt a little bad now after bringing Josh up s much and now putting him down. \"Look... maybe just give me some time to think about it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Josh perked up, maybe feeling like he was useful after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises, bro.\" Brody simply said as he finished off his shake and set it down with a casual burp.

Brody tilted his head and stood up suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you hungry, bro? I just realized you probably haven't eaten in awhile.\" Brody looked at it as a possibility for Josh's mood. Meanwhile, Josh smirked seeing it as a possibility for something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am pretty hungry. I feel like I haven't eaten anything all day!\" Josh baited Brody, hoping he'd make a bunch of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word bro!\" Brody moved over to his fridge and fished around for a second. \"Let's see, I've got some applesauce, some rice, and some leftover meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Brody pulled out the food and set it down on the counter. \"All that sounds good to me!\" Josh smiled as he watched Brody divide out a tiny bit on a small saucer plate. \"Aren't you hungry too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhhh...\" Agreed, now looking at the food and realizing he was hungry as well. \"I'm always hungry, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Josh said under his breath as he watched Brody put now the small plate an a normal sized one into the microwave. A minute or so went by as the microwave beeped, and Brody removed the food, moving his and Josh's plates over the the kitchen table when Josh was still seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just gave you a little, I didn't want you to be overwhelmed, bro.\" Brody smiled at Josh as he set the plates down and reached back into the fridge, grabbing himself a soda and taking a sip. Josh watched as Brody set it down and proceeded to walk away. \"I'll be right back bro, just gotta use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Josh said to himself as he saw Brody walk away.

What do you have to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Josh a chance to reply, Tyler left the table as he made his way into the kitchen the next room over. Josh scurried frantically to the end of the table closest to the kitchen door as he heard Tyler open his refrigerator. Josh fumbled his hands together and bit his lip as he wondered just how much Tyler planned on eating. \"God I'll have nothing left if he goes free range on all my food...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReappearing through the doorway, Tyler held a bag of chips in on hand and a closed container of ranch dip in the other. Giving the dip a little shake, Tyler set it down on the table beside Josh and popped off the top. With a frown, Josh watched as Tyler tore up the bag of chips. With a satisfying gust of air coming from the bag, Josh knew his gigantic friend would likely eat the whole bag, his last bag he had stored away. With a quick scoop, Tyler sent a chip hurtling down into the open dip and collected some of the cool white ranch on the chip before tossing the chip into his mouth with a loud crunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There goes all my chips.\" Josh complained as he watched Tyler much away on a large handful before swallowing it down easily. Tyler simply chuckled as he reached into the bag for another handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good host offering up snacks like that. You said I could eat the whole bag right?\" Tyler mocked Josh as he sat down in frustration, watching Tyler as he shoved his greasy fingers into his mouth and smacked his lips as he pulverized the chips to mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, at least share some with me?\" Josh plead, knowing his ravenous friend was already halfway through the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? You're so small I can barely hear you, dude.\" Tyler lied. \"You're saying I don't need to share? Thanks man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed loudly, upset about Tyler raiding his last bag of chips with such force. \"Damn it! Fine I don't want anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Tyler replied, still pretending he couldn't hear Josh. \"A soda would go great to wash down these chips!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Tyler left the bag open on the table as he made his way into the kitchen in search of a drink. Josh looked at the unguarded bag, wondering how long Tyler would take. Standing up, Josh started to make his way toward...     </span></div></div>",

Making his way over to the tall side of the container, Josh looked up and saw a few bolder sized crumbs littered on the rim. Figuring that although they were mere crumbs to Tyler, they were more like giant chips to himself. Looking up the side of the container, Josh jumped against the plastic surface and hugged the cool wall as it was still fairly chill from being in the refrigerator. Shivering as he shimmied up the side, Josh reached the rim and pulled himself up with tremendous effort as he looked across the thin plastic surface before it dropped into a sea of white. The smell of ranch completely filled Josh's nose as he spotted the crumbs from before, carefully making his way along the ridge toward the delectable food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUURRRRRP!\" Tyler belted as he made his way back into the room, holding an open can of soda. \"Yo, that was a pretty decent rip! Don't ya think buddy?\" He said as he looked down at the table, noticing Josh was missing from he spot from before. \"Buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler set the can of soda down with a small quake on the table. Josh nearly screamed as he started to fall before landing with a nasty splat, the smell of ranch now completely surrounding him as he struggled to resurface and wipe the thick white substance from his face. Looking up and out of the dip container, Josh saw as Tyler smirked while he tilted the bag of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where you arrrrre!\" Tyler mocked as he suspected Josh couldn't help but nab a few chips in his absence. Tyler reached inside the bag, pulling out a single chip and inspecting it closely. Moving it over to the dip and dunking it in, Josh screamed as he was nearly drug along with the thick sauce on the chip. Josh watched in fear as Tyler popped the chip in his mouth, crunching it up and swallowing it down. \"You better be careful in there. I might eat you up, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered, watching as Tyler rubbed his stomach with a laugh. \"He thinks I'm in the bag of chips...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled, trying to make his way to the wall he'd have to scale to reach his freedom. Unfortunately, the dip was still fairly cold and thick. Progress was about as good as if Josh were swimming through quick sand. Relaxing his body slightly, Josh started to just count himself lucky that he hasn't been drug below the surface yet. Wiping his eyes Josh watched as Tyler let the bag of chips lay flat as he tilted his head to look inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better watch out! I'm hungry!\" Tyler roared as he reached into the bag, pulling out a few more chips and inspecting them each carefully. Noticing that they were all free from any tiny people, Tyler dunked them into the the dip. Josh watched in horror as the chips came crashing down on his position, pulling up him between two chips. Josh struggled, seeing nothing but the yellow walls of two chips on either side of him. With no indication of where he was going, Josh felt the mass of food travel quickly in an upward direction. Screaming as the two chips pressed hard against each other with a crunch, Josh found the glob of ranch he was trapped in was being squeezed out. Landing with a splat, Josh shook his head before taking in his surrounding with pure terror. Deposited in the middle of Tyler's tongue, Josh merely watched as the chips he was just between were easily decimated between Tyler's teeth. Saliva dripped from the roof of Tyler's mouth, moistening the dry chips until they were nothing more than pulp. Still frozen in terror, Josh watched as the yellowish mush was pushed directly on top of him. Struggling to breath beneath the mass of food, Josh felt everything lurch and drop with force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed the lump of food easily as he reached for his soda, taking a few quick sips before he turned his head to look in the bag of chips once more. Frowning as he saw no movement what so ever, Tyler decided it was time for a tone shift. \"Hey dude. I didn't mean to freak you out. I wasn't really gonna eat ya.\" Tyler said to the empty bag. \"You know I was joking, so why don't you come on out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned the bag away from himself, facing it to where Josh was seated before. Hoping his friend would feel a little more comfortable now that the supposed threat of being eaten had subsided, Tyler sat back as he waited for his tiny friend to emerge and feel silly for doubting him as usual. Putting a hand on his stomach as it still growled in hunger, Tyler looked up over the bag hoping to see Josh outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he got pinned under a chip or something...\" Tyler thought aloud as he stood up and looked down at the table. Grabbing his soda, Tyler left his seat, pushing in the chair as he left. \"Yo dude, I'm gonna run to my place and grab some clothes. Take your time if you're struggling. I'll find you if you're still not out by the time I get back, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler waited for a moment hearing nothing in response. Scratching his head as he walked away from the table, Tyler was hoping he'd at least hear a faint response. \"Maybe I knocked him out when I moved the bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged as he made his way out of the room and headed for the door. Taking a chug from his soda as he left and feeling a bit of pressure in his gut as he closed the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud belch roared from above as a sudden change in pressure shifted in Tyler's stomach. Josh shook his head in dizziness as he felt Tyler's stomach swaying back and fourth in movement. Josh sweated as he squirmed his way further up the mound of chips, considering himself lucky for not being crushed beneath them before. Feeling weak, Josh had no idea what he could do. He was doomed unless Tyler got it in his head that he wasn't in the bag of chips at all. Unsure how confident he was in his friend, Josh started to already give up hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be worse.\" Josh said to himself as he looked around at the walls of his best friend's stomach. Watching for a moment as the walls contracted and relaxed churning  the contents within so they could be processed into nutrients to power Tyler's body. Josh sighed, resigning his fate in becoming part of that process for his friend. \"Guess if I had to pick anyone, it would have been you, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pointed up as he finished speaking, as if to point at Tyler himself. Realizing he could have pointed in any direction, Josh lowered his arm in somewhat defeat Just as the sphincter above him opened, releasing a stream of cool soda washing down directly on Josh. Sloshing him from his position, Josh fell from the mound of chips some where near the bottom of the mostly empty stomach. Feeling to weak to struggle against it, Josh simple slid down into some sticky digestive fluid. In a matter of seconds, the acid caused Josh immense pain as it quickly tore through the tiny man. Processing what was usable of Josh's body, it became part of the pool in Tyler's stomach, ready to go on to be used elsewhere in the body. Tyler's stomach churned and groaned happily, wished there was more substance to the meal but thankful for what little Josh could offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing out the can of soda as he finished packing up his bag, Tyler stood up quickly and caused the contents of his stomach to lurch slightly. With another resounding burp Tyler was so famous for, he rubbed his gut softly. \"Man I'm still starving...\" Tyler said to himself. \"Hopefully he's done playing around. Because the rest of that bag has my name all over it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled as he swung the bag over his should and left the apartment. Grinning as he made his way down the sidewalk, Tyler was excited to get back to Josh. Both excited to get back to eating, but even more excited to spend some quality time with his best friend for the next two days.                 </span></div></div>",

I know you're a busy guy. It was dumb of me to even ask.\" Tyler said, dejected. The massive man stood back up. Grabbing his fallen shirt from the floor, he slung it back over his shoulder and turned sadly away from his boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler put his hand on the door knob, Josh couldn't keep it in any longer. \"Wait!\" He yelled after his huge friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned back looking over sullenly at the balcony where Josh stood. \"Once construction is over...

Well it might not be two days of shrunken antics, but dinner and a sleep over with me would be good enough!\" Tyler interrupted, now standing back in front of Josh with a hand on his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh starting sweating. Looking up at his giant friend as he acted so confidently made it hard to say no. Not to mentioned he did say he wanted to make it up to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got a deal, big guy.\" Josh said trying to look past Tyler's mountainous abs and round pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with his boss's answer he knelt back down to look at the little man. Smiling he said, \"I'm looking forward to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tyler left the room beaming with excitement over his night with Josh coming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to see a smile on Tyler's face Josh left the park as well.

Look here's some money grab us whatever you want and meet me in the break room. I just have to look over these files first.\" Josh said handing the larger man a crisp 50$ bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the busy body huh boss?\" He said jokingly as he headed off to the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off the remaining files he had on hand, Josh headed over to the break room. He opened the door to a magnificent room with a balcony for him to walk around, as well as elevators and conveyor belts for getting around easier. Looking over the balcony he saw Tyler again, only he wasn't just some 6'5\" guy compared to Josh. Now he looked more like a massive moving sky scraper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up dude! You took forever!\" The giant shirtless man addressed his boss. \"Look dude, table's all set.\" He motioned over to the giant's section of the break room complete with kitchen, lounge, bathroom, and even a small work out room. On the kitchen table was a huge cheese pizza with a slice missing already, as well as a liter of coke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the handsome giant Josh could just barely see his face from what seemed like a great distance, and Tyler's already impressive body seemed even more godlike. \"Looks like someone got impatient!\" Josh said noting the missing piece of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his sculptured abs Tyler looked down at his little boss. \"What I got hungry! It's not my fault you took so long!\" With a smile he put his massive hand next to his miniature boss and waited for him to climb aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Josh the massive palm looked like several football fields in size and even the ridges and grooves of his hand seemed like trenches. Looking up at his giant employee he gave a tiny thumbs up and with a swift yet deliberate motion Tyler carried his boss over to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the table Tyler put Josh on a plate, carefully sliding him off his palm on the dish. The giant lifeguard then carefully took a piece of pizza and put it on the plate beside Josh for him to snack on. Next, he took the top off the bottle of coke and poured some into the cap. Placing the cap down next to his boss he joked, \"Some for you, the rest for me!\" as he took a large gulp of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the giant lifeguard guzzling down what seemed like a lake full of liquid in a single gulp. Watching even closer he saw Ty's adam's apple bob up and down as his powerful throat muscle pushed the liquid down past his chest. While Josh continued to stare, Ty started to rub his bare stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUUUUUUURRRRP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosive burp made Josh's ears ring, although he knew Ty must've been holding back. At such a small size it just seemed a lot louder. Now blushing he tried looking away from the muscled lifeguard, trying to hide his interests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok dude? I didn't burp too loud did I?\" Ty asked concerned for his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no it's not that, don't worry about it man!\" Josh said nervously as he looked back at his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow Tyler looked down at the little man and smiled. \"Oh well if its no big deal let's eat! I'm starved!\" He said rubbing his stomach again for added effect. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill blushing at the almost intentional action Josh began tearing little pieces off his pizza, eating as much as he wanted was easy at his size. He knew Tyler had a lot more of an appetite and could easily eat the whole pizza himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily,\" Josh thought, \"We do this all the time so he knows to be very careful and checks with me before taking my slice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the eating continued the two laughed and joked with each other, Tyler would poke fun at his tiny boss's size both at normal height and shrunk, meanwhile Josh would make fun of Tyler for being a fatass and eating way too much pizza!

He was part of the first bit of pizza. Helplessly he hoped not to be chewed by his giant employee, maybe there was still some way out of this! He just had to find a way to break free. Meanwhile a giant white molar crushed down near him tearing way part of the pizza covering his tiny body, while also nearly obliterating the tiny passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree at last Josh desperately tried to find something to hold on to the slippery tongue and vicious saliva proved to make it a very difficult task.

Plus we play hockey together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you play golf and hockey?\" Josh tilted his head for a moment, feeling like he didn't know much about Ross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, I'm more of a golfer, but Austin is more of a hockey player.\" Ross explained. \"But we love both, don't get me wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still that's great! I'm sure the swing translates well between both sports. Plus you must get a lot of strength from hockey.\" Josh commented, clearly seeing Ross's very well trained and muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure!\" Ross smiled rubbing the back of his neck and exposing his hairy pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well either way it'll be great to meet Austin tomorrow!\" Josh said with excitement. \"I hope you'll be ready to train him in Health and Safety. That's gonna be a huge responsibility for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you down, boss!\" Ross beamed, almost forgetting about his new responsibilities in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh day had dawned as Josh made his way into the park. Josh made his way toward his office, already running into Ross, Tyler and a new handsome looking man he assumed to be Austin. He stood slightly taller than Ross but about the same height as Tyler at about 6'5\". He was the same age of Ross at 20 years old but looked very different. He was much more muscular, with deeply cut abs and larger rounder pecs. He seemed more on the lines of Tyler as far as bulk went but slightly leaner. He had shaggy dirty blonde hair, not too long but longer than your typical short cut hair. As Josh approached the handsome man, his took in the stubble on his face, a light color covered his cheeks and chin as Josh looked toward his almost emerald green eyes. Josh's eyes wandered up and down his torso as there was a good amount of hair nestled between his huge pecs and connected down to a patch around his belly button before it went down a  treasure trail down his new red board shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Austin!\" Josh finally reached the man and shook the man's huge hands. \"I'm Josh, I spoke to you on the phone yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro!\" Austin answered with a smile. \"Ross was telling me a little bit about what happened. Like how Ross was promoted and uhh...\" Austin paused for a moment. \"How there was a little mistake with you being eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhhh...\" Josh rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, not really wanting to recall that terrifying situation as he looked at Tyler who bit his lip slightly. \"It was definitely a silly mistake, but it's all in the past. Plus it's kind of funny in hindsight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sounded funny to me.\" Austin smiled as he looked at Ross and Tyler who shifted awkwardly. \"Maybe just because I wasn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. I just feel bad.\" Tyler half frowned looking away. Josh looked at Tyler, not wanting him to feel bad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey no feeling bad. You've got work to do.\" Josh smiled at Tyler and motioning toward Austin. Tyler looked down at Josh and ruffled the hair on his shorter friend's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it buddy.\" Tyler answered as he put an arm around Austin, leading the man away while Ross followed. Josh smiled, seeing the three men walk away. Josh felt good about hiring Austin, feeling like today was going to be great as he made his way into his office. Josh sat down at his desk, ready to fill out paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by and Josh was feeling a little bored. Josh couldn't help but let his mind wander, thinking about Austin, wondering how the handsome giant was doing. Getting up, Josh took a walk over to the break room, deciding to open the door and see if he was on break with either Ross or Tyler from the days training. Looking out into the room, Josh saw Austin...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Getting up, Austin slowly approached the balcony with a smile as Josh watched the muscled and somewhat hairy man come closer. Looming over Josh now, Austin had to bend down a little to be a little closer to eye level with his tiny boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey! I don't think I've seen you this small yet, Josh!\" Austin smiled before biting his lip and correcting himself. \"I mean, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Josh is fine.\" Josh wanted to assure his newest employee with his friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! I just got used to them calling you \"the boss\" all day is all.\" Austin laughed a little with an attractive white smile. Josh couldn't help but sweat a little as he stared at Austin's attractive and scruffy face. \"So anyway, maybe it's good it's just the two of us. I wanted to ask what happened the other day. Tyler and Ross were acting weirdly quiet about it so I never heard anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\" Josh shifted awkwardly a little. \"Well it was just a little accident. To make a long story short, I was eating lunch with Tyler and he thought I left. I was actually stuck to a slice of pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah so that's how he ended up eating you?\" Austin asked, resting his hand under his chin as he leaned in with interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly actually. I somehow ended up between his teeth. Then he flossed me out and I ended up in the middle of his tongue.\" Josh recalled the events as best he could without breaking eye contract from Austin's dreamy green eyes. \"Then he looked at me in the mirror before swallowing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he didn't even know it was you?!\" Austin gasped as if he was listening to an epic tale. \"Yo, this is crazy dude. What happened next? Did you know... like end up in his stomach and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened really fast, but yeah. It was dark. It reeked of soda and pizza.\" Josh trailed off a bit. \"I've never experienced something like that in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's super cool though. In hindsight of course.\" Austin Leaned back a bit and stretched. \"You're probably the first person alive to ever do something like that, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're probably right...\" Josh thought for a moment, thinking about how incredible it actually is he experienced all that and survived. \"When you put it like that, it doesn't seem so bad, Austin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Austin rubbed the back of his head, showing off his hairy pit for a moment. \"It's just good you're okay too, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure!\" Josh smiled as he looked at Austin still hunching over. \"Hey what do you think about carrying me over to the table so you don't have to crouch like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Like in my hand?\" Austin looked a little confused as Josh nodded. On command, Austin lowered his hand down next to Josh, allowing the minuscule man to climb aboard as the pair made their way over to the table. Setting his hand down, Austin watched in fascination as Josh climbed off and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so cool, dude.\" Austin smirked as he sat down in front of Josh. \"I could barely feel you. You're just so tiny! It's no wonder Tyler mistook you for food. He probably couldn't see you on the pizza or feel you move in his mouth, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right.\" Josh agreed as he stared up at Austin, eyes wandering from the man's hairy chest to his fuzzy abs. \"I forget how small I am sometimes around the giants here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giants...\" Austin trailed off quietly for a second. \"That's really cool, Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men conversed more and more as they awaited the return of Tyler and Ross. Turns out they were looking for Josh the whole time as they made their way back into the room. Having Austin bring him back to the balcony, Josh turned and glanced at Austin as he rejoined his two trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so nice...\" Josh said to himself as he made his way back into his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays turned to weeks after Austin joined the team and most people started to notice just how close Josh and Austin started to become. Fast friends, Josh and Austin actually started hanging out and planned  a special time together with Josh at his shrunken size per Austin's request.

Josh! I got it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by the shirtless man bouncing up in down in front of him Josh simply felt inclined to ask, \"Got what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An idea of how to make everything up to you of course!\" Tyler said starting to relax a little. \"Ok so here's what we'll do. I'll head into the break room from here, and you go around front. Then you can humiliate tiny me for a change!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled Josh looked blankly at his muscled friend. \"I'm not doing that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha! I figured you'd say that. It was supposed to be a joke to prepare you for the real treat!\" Tyler said lifting his arm. \"I want you and I to take a day off, of which I want to bring tiny you to my apartment for a spa getaway, where I will be your personal giant butler!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing at the idea Josh thought to himself. \"Guess its no big secret I enjoy being little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it make you happy if I say yes?\" Josh said looking up at his bulky friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than anything, dude!\" Tyler said with a little hop, shaking the room a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright! Sounds like a real treat, Ty. Why don't we do it tomorrow. I can let everyone know we're taking the day off tonight.\" Josh said standing up and starting to walk around to the front of his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Tyler yelled, grabbing his short friend and pulling him in for another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, easy big guy!\" Josh said, he muffled his words in Tyler's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spa day with a giant butler... \"This is gonna be fun!\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Josh waited in the break room in the morning. Already shrunk and ready for his day with Tyler. After a few minutes the door opened, revealing Tyler, wearing a white collared shirt, and a pair of green and white plaid shorts. Around his neck he wore an attractive looking silver chain, that dangled freely over his broad chest.  Down to his feet he wore red nike shoes with a pair of low cut white socks. Finally, on his head he wore a tan baseball cap with a flat rim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the balcony Tyler greeted his tiny friend with a polite bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning master, might I say you look excellent on this fine day!\" he said with a slight accent that made Josh chuckle for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do you my faithful servant.\" Josh replied regally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am humbled sir.\" He said straightening his back. \"How might I transport you, master?\"    </span></div></div>",

Standing up he brought the bucket back over to the sink, looking in it carefully for any sign of his tiny boss. Hoping maybe a gust of air brought him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Washing out the bucket he returned it under the sink, rubbing his still aching stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe convulsions ended and the walls of the stomach went calm once more. Josh sat there dumbfounded at the peak of the mushy food. \"He's gonna keep trying right? I'm sure he won't give up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach moved as Josh could sense Tyler was moving around once more. Hearing his muffled voice sound sad and dejected. \"No...\" Josh thought. \"No! Don't give up I'm still in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walls swayed and contracted the mounds of pizza started to dissolve more peacefully. The mountain of food eventually fell over with a splat sinking Josh into a mixture of pizza and acid. With one last squirm Josh gave in, never to wake again. Only becoming part of his godlike lifeguard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Ross did indeed reenter the park and check in Josh's office. Only to find it empty. They walked around the park aimlessly hoping maybe someone caught a glance of him. Calling his cellphone and even home phone proved to be a fruitless effort. At the end of the day, Ross said his goodbye's to Tyler, promising not to tell anyone what they horribly suspected happened to their boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tyler arrived home. depressed at what happened. He looked down at his stomach trying to find some positive in all this. \"He'll always be with me I guess.\" He thought with a slight smile. \"Rest easy little guy.\" He said rubbing his stomach, as if to put closure on the whole ordeal.   </span></div></div>",

The giant man slowly and extremely quietly moved his hand behind his boss, without his notice. Creeping slowly forward he extended out his pinky and ring fingers around both of Josh's sides. The two shadows cast next to Josh and barely had time to say, \"What th---\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Tyler snatched his tiny wriggling boss between his fingers, and moved him over to the half filled bottle cap. \"Ty! What are you dooooooooo---\" Josh was cut off again as the massive stud dropped him in the awaiting liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplashing around in the cold soda, it made Josh's skin tingle a little. Barely staying afloat in the carbonated liquid he looked up at Tyler's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler the amazing lifeguard is on duty!\" He said triumphantly over his tiny boss. \"Don't worry tiny citizen! You're safe as long as I'm on duty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the bottle cap to about chest level, Tyler dunked his pinky in the shallow liquid next to his panicked boss. Josh swam over as best he could to the massive finger, trying desperately to cling on to Tyler's smooth skin. The wetness from the soda made it almost impossible to stay on as just slipped and fell multiple times off the finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down, amused at his tiny boss's struggles. Giving him a few minutes to try to climb out Tyler then had a different idea. Removing his pinky from the cap he addressed the tiny man once more. \"Worry not little citizen! I~ The amazing Tyler shall drain the pool for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the cap up to his face he pressed the ridge up against his lips. \"No, Tyler! Don't do this!\" Josh screamed as the current swept him toward Tyler's gigantic mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler drained the bottle cap, Josh...        </span></div></div>",

I reeks of pizza in here!\" Josh yelled covering his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at the now empty bottle cap, noticing the missing passenger. \"Oops...\" he thought, rubbing his lips and checking his fingers.

He laughed out loud, causing his mouth to shake violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -et -dis -ool is -a-ot -armer!\" Tyler said with his mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his mouth, the giant man was onto his tiny boss's interests. \"He always watches me chug soda, and blushes when I burp... I bet he's loving this!\" He assured himself walking out of the bathroom. Feeling a little pressure come from his stomach, he deiced to give his boss a treat. Keeping his mouth closed he forced up a little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUURRRFFFMM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise filled the pitch black cavern Josh was trapped in.

Now let me out!\" The little man ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the pool of liquid he was in suddenly shifted, moving all the way back toward the throat. Josh slapped into Tyler's massive uvula as he realized he was floating just above the throat. \"Is he planning on swallowing me??\" Josh gasped starting to panic even worse. \"Please Tyler!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RELAX!\" The gargled voice boomed out around him. \"Relax?\" Josh thought to himself. \"Maybe I am safe after all.

He figured the simple word was enough to get his worried boss to calm down. Feeling the pool of soda sit at the back of his throat he knew his little boss safe. Now he just wanted to give the little guy time to chill. \"Dude barely ever takes a break...\" Tyler thought. \"At least this way I can force him to!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached down and grabbed the remote, flicking around on random channels on the tv.

With a dramatic splash Josh found himself pushed out the sphincter leading to Tyler's massive stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh landed softly in a pile of mush, seemingly floating over some fowl looking liquid. \"Oh god, stomach acid!\" Josh said scurrying to the center of the mass. \"W-what happened up there?\" Josh questioned himself. \"Why would he swallow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the stomach groaned and swayed majestically as it churned its unwitting meal.

I know he will...\" Josh said as he starting drifting off to sleeping. The warm air finally did its job, and the raft Josh clung so depretaly to finally gave way. Tyler's stomach groaned happily as it accepted the last bit of meat from the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes passed quickly for the young man as he watched the epic battle of life and death between an evil force and the badass young heroine trying to defend her home. As the minutes became an hour the movie's credits finally started to roll. Standing up the gigantic man stretched out his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great break!\" He said happily relaxing his arms. In a swift motion he walked over to the kitchen table, grabbing the unfinished bottle of coke. In a few massive gulps the muscular man drained it easily. Tyler sighed as he rubbed his stomach triggering his reaction to let out a massive burp he was instantly proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUUUUUUURP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! That was a good one!\" He said aloud, giving his gut a hard slap. \"Bet Josh would... have... loved... OH SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's stomach suddenly felt sick as finally realized what he did well over an hour ago. Running to the bathroom he kept just repeating, \"What do I do... What do I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCramming his fingers down the back of his throat he desperately tried to throw up into the bathroom sink. After tossing up what little was left in his stomach Tyler finally stopped. Desperately, he fingered through the slimy mush hoping beyond hope that his tiny boss had been able to survive in his belly for the past hour and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over the sink Tyler spat. \"That movie was definitely over an hour...it must've been too long...\" He said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\" He said looking down at his 6 pack. 'I think he's gone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a glass of water, he chugged it down to ease his stomach. Rubbing it sadly, he hoped the experience wasn't too painful for the little guy.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler's eyes started to feel heavy as he watched the somewhat boring documentary on the television. Deciding to give them a rest, Tyler laid on his back and propped his head up on a pillow slightly and closed his eyes. Stopping only for a second to swish the liquid in his mouth away from the back of his throat and more toward the front. He knew he didn't want to put his boss in any unnecessary danger, but he couldn't help but smirk to himself as he didn't exactly want to let the tiny man out either. Keeping his head mostly level, Tyler started to relax as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pool of liquid seemed to calm down finally after it was moved quickly to the center of Tyler's mouth. Josh's eyes had finally adjusted to the darkness in the cavernous mouth as he could make out every massive corner of Tyler's mouth with decent detail. Unsure of what Tyler was actually doing Josh decided to swim to the edge of the pool of soda and make his way more toward the front of the cave, near the teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... his teeth are huge!\" Josh said aloud as he finally made his way out of the liquid and started to walk along the moist tongue on his journey to the front of the mouth. Each tooth looked like a massive white building to Josh, lined perfectly along the jaw of the closed mouth. Making his way to the tip of the tongue, Josh stared up at the closest tooth in awe. His amazement however was short lived as he heard a rush of liquid behind him. Holding on to the front of the tongue Josh tuned to see the pool of soda he was just in rush to the back of the throat before disappearing down in a deafening gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that could have been me!\" Josh yelled as the massive tongue relaxed once more to a resting position and the dark cave looked more like a moist cavern than a cave with a lake. \"Tyler! You almost swallowed me you meat head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waited for a response, but instead all he heard was deep breathing going in and out from what he could only assume was Tyler's nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either he's ignoring me of he fell asleep...\" Josh sighed as he figured it was the latter. Keeping his grip on the tip of the tongue Josh looked out in the cavern once more. He'd always wondered what it would be like to be in one of his employee's mouths, especially Tyler's. Tyler always toyed with Josh the most in yet this is the first time he's gone so far to leave Josh in his mouth, let alone fall asleep while he was trapped in here! Shaking any thoughts from his head Josh tried to remember how dangerous of a situation he was in. If Tyler really was asleep, the best course of action would be to escape. But looking back into the massive moving cave once more Josh couldn't help but wonder when he'd get the chance to explore Tyler's mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Josh decided...     </span></div></div>",

Covering his eyes, Josh tried his best just to live through the situation. Finally, he landed. The ground was wet.. and soft. Dreading opening his eyes to see the inside of Tyler's mouth, he instead got his attention snagged in a different way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day is saved!\" Josh heard as Tyler's voice boomed out in front of him. Opening his eyes, he merely found he was was at the bottom of the bottle cap. The squishy disk just seemed almost fleshy in Josh's confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was safe Josh stared up at Tyler's smiling face. \"You could have drank me you big dummy!\" Josh yelled at his careless employee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I didn't!\" Tyler replied, shutting up his tiny boss as he brought the cap back down to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Josh said looking up at the tall ridges. \"Just tip this sucker over so I can get out please?\" Josh asked, still a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms and turning his head, the muscular stud declined. \"Not till you apologize for yelling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe how childish Tyler was acting all of a sudden. Why should he apologize when Tyler was the one who dropped him in the cap in the first place! \"You should apologize to me! I wouldn't be in here if it wasn't for you wanting to play \"super lifeguard\"!\" Josh fumed once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, don't be so bossy, boss.\" He said looking down at the cap. \"I think you should stay in there until you learn to talk a little nicer to me.\" He said teasing the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill angry, Josh turned away from the giant stud. \"I can outlast him.\" He thought pouting to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're so adorable when you're mad, boss!\" Tyler said hovering his face above the cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to look away Josh tried his best just to keep ignoring the big bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few quiet minutes Tyler started to get a little bored with his game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boss, I'm gonna go work out for a bit!\" He said motioning to the small workout room attached next door. \"So you can just sit there and think about what you did till I come back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Josh... </span></div></div>",

Closing the door behind him, leaving Josh alone in the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by and Josh sat there thinking, maybe he should just apologize and get this over with... he still had a lot of work to do today and he couldn't just keep sitting here in a bottle cap. Then again he really didn't want to give Tyler the satisfaction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's thoughts went interrupted when he heard a door open. Figuring it was Tyler finishing his workout he didn't even bother to look. \"That was short.\" Josh thought. \"He must've felt bad leaving me alone... looks like I win this one!\" He snickered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to little Josh it was not in fact Tyler. Instead it was one of his other lifeguards Brody, just getting off his shift wanting to wind down at the break room. Brody is a good looking guy, he's 20 years old 6'6\" with short black hair and brown eyes. He has a strong looking chin and always seemed to be a good mood with a smile on his face. Like all the other lifeguards on staff he's very well built, with his large bouncing pecs still wet from being in park and a solid 6 pack with a black treasure trail leading attractively down to his shorts. He also has a tattoo of a chain going around his right bicep. The best way to describe his personality however, is that he is a bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody lumbered into the break room, tired from his shift. He figured if anything he could just grab a snack and something to drink and just relax. Walking over to the kitchen table he saw a single slice of pizza on a plate, as well as an opened bottle of coke with he cap off the side. \"Weak bro, someone forgot to put the cap back on, its gonna lose its fizz!\" He thought snatching up the cap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's whole world shook as he realized the bottle cap was being moved again. A bit more concerned he opened one eye and turned his head to see a familiar face...however that face wasn't Tyler's. \"Brody?\" Josh asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Josh found his whole world being flipped as he started plummeting through the air. With a splash Josh found himself treading water... except it was fizzy and brown... \"Uh oh...\" Josh thought as he realized he was swimming in soda. The carbonated liquid made his skin tingle as he swam around looking for some way out of the cold sea of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luckily he found what looked to be some crumb of pizza crust. \"Backwash...\" Josh thought a little sick to his stomach. However, not being too picky in the situation he climbed aboard the floating crumb, hoping Brody would notice him waving at him through the thin plastic of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Brody happily grabbed the final slice of pizza, a little cold by now he popped it into the microwave for a few seconds. Grabbing the warm plate he walked back over to the kitchen table and looked at the bottle of soda. \"Bet it's kinda flat by now...\" He said looking at it sadly. \"Oh well a drink's a drink.\" He said grabbing the bottle and walking over to the lounge to watch tv while he ate his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the channels he found a a football game on and decided it was perfect break time tv. Taking his slice of pizza he started to tear the cheesy front off chewing absentmindedly as he watched the game. Swallowing, he lifted up the liter of soda, and twisted off the cap, listening to the delightful \"ssssss\" as an indicator it was still at least somewhat fresh. Taking a sip, he looked down at the bottle. \"Hey, its still pretty good!\" He said putting it back on the ground unaware that he nearly gulped down his tiny speck of a boss in the first sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brody finished off the pizza he swallowed hard looking down at the bottle of coke. \"Only a little left, its all mine, bro!\" he said licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody lifted the bottle to his lips and...     <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Looking closely, be barely noticed something moved in the dark beverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" He started as he examined it closer, this time whatever it was looked to flailing around. Brody let the bottle rest so the liquid would settle back in the middle and walked over to the kitchen counter. Setting the bottle on the counter, he reached up into one of the cabinets and pulled out a small glass. Carefully, Brody tilted the bottle and started to pour its contents into the glass, waiting for the mysterious speck to emerge from the fizz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled and the plastic prison he was in shifted one way and another, causing huge waves of soda and fizz to pour over him. Josh clung on to the crumb with all of of his might, hoping that it would keep him afloat in this acidic environment. Suddenly, his whole world was flipped as the somewhat calm ocean of soda turned into a mighty torrent. Josh screamed as the soda flowed out like a waterfall, crashing down into a cup below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh coughed as the fizz started to clear and he began treading soda. The crumb he was using as a flotation device seemed to have been washed away, at least it wasn't anywhere he could see across the bubbling surface of the drink. Looking up, Josh saw the face of Brody. He started flailing his arms around as much as he could in an attempt to catch his dark brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fizz finally cleared Brody looked down at the drink.

Brody walked over to the kitchen table, sitting down at the nearest chair as he couldn't believe he was just moments from accidentally drinking his boss just mere minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to talk now that he wasn't drowning in soda, Josh spoke to the giant man. \"Thank you Brody! I'm so glad you noticed me in time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little shocked, Brody rested his hand on the table and continued to look at his tiny boss. \"It's no problem bro... but I have to ask... why were in the soda? Bro, don't you know that dangerous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I wanted to be in there!\" Josh retaliated. \"Tyler left me in that bottle cap, then you accidentally dumped me in the bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bro... then it's my fault you almost ended up as lunch!\" Brody said looking down at his chiseled abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your fault, Tyler was the one who had to play his foolish games. You on the other hand saved me, so please don't worry about it!\" Josh said trying to cheer up his rescuer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Brody let the little man slide off his finger and on to the table, next to a napkin to dry off. \"Why did he leave you in that bottle cap anyway, bro? I know he likes messing with you but still...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the napkin Josh wiped off the sticky soda as best he could from his body and looked up at Brody's handsome face. \"Because he's an idiot and he thought he was being funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody leaned forward, letting Josh have a fantastic view of his round pecs as they obstructed most of his vision. \"Wow bro, sounds like you had it pretty rough... why don't you...\"   </span></div></div>",

The idea of putting Tyler back in his place seemed really appealing to him. He's always the brunt of Tyler's jokes, and maybe it was time to get back at him for a change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind, Brody?\" Josh finally asked, curious about the stud's plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood up and walked over to the counter where the glass of soda Josh was just trapped in moments ago was, as well as the bottle with a small amount of soda remaining in it. \"Let's start by doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody picked up the glass of soda and began to chug it down. Josh watched as torrents of liquid poured into Brody's mouth and he observed as his adam's apple bobbing up and down with each gulp. To Josh it made him shiver slightly, knowing he could have easily been lost in the torrent as it was so simply drained by Brody. After Brody finished the glass, he put it in the sink and rinsed it out, placing it on the drying rack. Next he grabbed the bottle and swallowed the last bit of soda in it in one gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" He said simply as he put the cap back on the bottle and brought it over to the kitchen table. \"Gotta make sure this is in plain view, right bro?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was on to Brody's idea, but he figured he'd ask anyway. \"Brody, what exactly is your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, bro.\" Brody said as he sat back down at the kitchen table. \"When Tyler comes back in here, I'll make him think I drank you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head, figuring that was the case. \"Great idea! Where should I hide while he panics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... why don't we put you on the kitchen counter, in the corner where he can't see you bro.\" Brody said, lowering his hand and allowing his boss to climb on. He then carefully carried the tiny man over to the counter and waited for Josh to hide in the corner, making sure he remembered the spot. Backing off he went and took a seat back at the kitchen table and even put up his feet for good effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood in the corner watching Brody as he put on an uncharacteristically smug looking smirk on his face as they both waited for Tyler to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the door from the gym opened, and Tyler emerged, covered in sweat and wiping his brow. He looked over at the kitchen table and saw Brody sitting there with his feet up. Brody pretended to ignore Tyler as he started to walk out and let out an enormous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUURRRP!\" Brody rubbed his stomach and looked up. \"Oh hey what's up Ty? Have a good workout, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's face looked pale as he watching Brody massage his belly before finally asking. \"Did you drink my soda, man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody relaxed his feet off the table and stood up. \"Oh dude that was yours? Well you left the cap off the soda, so I replaced it and then decided to drink the soda as a reward for not letting it go flat. It's ok though man, I'll owe you a drink some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked horrified as he grabbed the bottle, twisting off the cap and looking down deep into the plastic center. \"Dude this isn't good, Josh was in that cap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody feigned ignorance as he turned away from Tyler. \"Dude no... that's stupid. Why would you put our boss in a soda cap? I don't believe you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put a hand on Brody's shoulder and tried to turn him around. \"Dude, I swear it's the truth. It was just supposed to be a joke, and right now he's probably burning in your gut, man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you are serious, bro.\" Brody said turning to look at Tyler. \"Bet you feel really stupid for trapping him in that soda cap!\" Brody laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this isn't funny.\" Tyler said panicked. \"He could die if we don't get him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody laughed again. \"Nah dude, it's pretty funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked angrily at his co-worker and nearly shouted. \"How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody lifted up his finger and pointed over to the counter. \"Because bro, he's right over there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned quickly around looking over the counter as a tiny speck scurried across the surface. Tyler walked over and looked down, seeing Josh laughing and waving up at him. \"It was a joke?\" Tyler said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody walked up behind him and slapped him on his back. \"Yeah bro, and you fell for it hook, line, and sinker!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked angrily at Josh and gave Brody a quick jab to the gut as he turned away from them, walking toward the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy bro!\" Brody said, rubbing his stomach. \"Josh could've just gotten knocked around in there!\" He said calling after Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shut the door behind him without saying a word. Josh looked down, feeling a little bad. It was just supposed to be a joke after all, the thought. Not to mention their joke was a lot less dangerous than Tyler's was! In yet Josh couldn't help but feel a little bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked down at his dejected boss as he stilled chuckled from Tyler's tantrum. \"Why such a long look boss?\" Brody asked. \"He got what he deserved, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the giant hunk and tried to smile. \"Yeah but you can tell he was pretty worried. So I can't help but feel a little bad. Even if he deserved it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too soft boss.\" Brody said leaning down to eye level. \"But it's something we all admire about you, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at Brody's enormous face. It did make him feel a little better, but a part of him did want to go apologize to Tyler, then again maybe it was good for him to get a taste of his own medicine for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bro, what are you gonna do?\" Brody asked, eyeing his tiny boss.    </span></div></div>",

Quickly he turned and looked to find Tyler standing there laughing and walking over. Still in shock, Josh didn't have time to react as Tyler grabbed him and held him in a head lock, giving him a noogie in the process. Finally, he released the smaller man and walked away, still laughing at his disheveled boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Josh said aloud as he put the bucket on the ground. walking away from the doorway, Josh started to walk toward his office, still confused about his encounter as he saw Brody running out over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro!\" Brody called as he stopped just in front of his boss. \"Uhh bro? Did you go for a swim or something?\" He asked confused as to why Josh was dripping wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Tyler filled a bucket of water and poured it on me when I came back into the park, then he ran off laughing like a little school girl.\" Josh said starting to get a bit pissed about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Dude, that's pretty classic.\" Brody said putting a hand on Josh's shoulder. \"Guess it's war now, huh bro? How you gonna get him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him back?\" Josh asked flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure bro. You can't just let him win.\" Brody said now standing beside Josh, pulling him close under his arm. \"Right now he's out there proud of himself that he just got the last laugh, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at Brody from the side, almost sticking his face in his armpit as he tried looking past Brody's huge arms and chest. \"You're right...I think...\"    </span></div></div>",

I catch him napping on the sofa a lot at this time. So I think I'll sneak in tiny and undetected and draw on his face.\" Josh said finally, as he slowly thought out his plan in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty classic dude, make sure to draw a dick on his forehead too!\" Brody added with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Josh said happy to have Brody's assistance. \"Let's grab a permanent marker from my office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked into the office finding a marker, a large one used for charts and posters. Josh put the marker in his pocket and started to smirk to himself. He could't wait to try and get back at Tyler again. Brody laughed at the plan, saying he couldn't wait to see what I put on Tyler's face later as he left to head to his post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh sat at his office chair, figuring he can kill some time waiting for Tyler's break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon I'll get back at that jerk.\" Josh said twiddling his thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by and Josh noticed Tyler should be on his break by now. Leaving his office, he started to walk toward the break room. Slowly he opened the door and looked out into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay off into the distance Josh could see a pair of feet sticking off the couch, clearly someone laying on their back. Josh took one of his conveyor belts over closer and saw it was in fact Tyler, his eyes covered by his hat as he breathed softly in through his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, he's already sleeping.\" Josh said as he rode an elevator down next to the couch. Knowing he had to scale the couch, he tried to pick a good spot where he could easily grip the fabric. Grabbing each tuft was difficult but the fabric was strong and made it easy to hold, letting Josh take breaks occasionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Josh made it to the top, pulling himself up he now saw a wall of tan skin before him. Sighing, Josh knew it was time to get climbing again. Grabbing a bit of skin, Josh started to pull himself up slowly up Tyler's side as his body rose and fell with each breath he took. After a few minutes Josh made it to his next destination, the vast plains and valleys that was Tyler's abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there!\" Josh said aloud, not worried about waking Tyler up at his size. Josh started his walk between Tyler's abs, his sight's set on the face.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring down the massive valley that ran down Tyler's abdomen, Josh knew his journey was long from over. With a little spring in his step Josh set off. Taking in all the noises of Tyler's body as he walked along his smooth stomach, Josh couldn't help but feel slightly elated by his secret mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh reached the end of the hilly abs, and looked up at his next obstacle. Tyler's mountainous pecs. Figuring the fastest way would to just go between them, Josh started heading uphill through the massive ravine. Looking to either side of him, all Josh could see was walls of skin as the whole landscape lifted and fell with each of Tyler's breaths. Josh couldn't help but stop for a moment to listen to his heartbeat, the sound which was both loud yet slightly calming to the little adventurer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the neck was Josh's next venture. Seeing as how Tyler was lying on his back, Josh only needed to scale the bottom of the chin. Josh looked up at his final climb, figuring it was now or never, he grabbed a good tuft of stubble on Tyler's chin. Each step up he made, made Josh all the more excited about his plan. After a few minutes, the climb was finished and Josh had a good look at the landscape he'd be defiling with his marker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, Josh worked his way across the chin and around the side of Tyler's lips. Starting in the center just above the top lip and below the nose Josh pulled out his marker and started giving it broad strokes toward the edge of the lip. Working all the way down the side of Tyler's face Josh ended the graffiti in a nice curly q. Next, Josh repeated the same artwork on the other side of Tyler's face, creating a perfect curly mustache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...\" Josh thought to himself as he moved up to Tyler's eye. \"Now to draw a nice sun around his eye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracing his marker quickly and carefully around the out side of Tyler's eye, he made a perfect circle. After that job was done, he added little lines around the outside to make it look like a cartoon sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally for the coup de grace.\" Josh thought as he made his way up under Tyler's hat more, on to his forehead. Taking out his marker for a final trick, Josh started to trace a nice long line across the surface, making sure loop it around at the end, coming back to just below where he started. Feeling creative, Josh added a pair of balls at the starting end, and making his way back to the tip, he added a slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Josh thought as he squinted to see his masterpiece. Knowing Tyler would probably wake up soon, Josh quickly slide off the side of Tyler's face. Landing softly on the plush couch, Josh looked back to see nothing more than the side of Tyler's head. Working his way down the couch, Josh tried to be a little more careful, knowing a fall here would hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh reached the bottom, the whole couch shook as Tyler started to wake up. Josh looked up as Tyler swung his legs around and started to rub his eyes. Not wanting to get caught, Josh quickly retreated away from the couch toward the elevator, making it there just as Tyler was standing up to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rode the elevator back to the balcony and quickly ran into the park, giggling to himself about his successful prank. Walking back to his office, Josh figured he should just sit there for awhile, trying to act inconspicuous when Tyler' finally figures out what happened to his face. Still beaming with delight, Josh started to rifle though some paperwork.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours went by, and the park was getting close to being closed. Josh was a little surprised that Tyler hadn't come bursting in angrily, or even that Brody hadn't come in laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda would have figured I'd get anything out of that joke...\" Josh said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh's words finished, there was a knock at the door. Yelling for them to come in, a young man entered. One of Josh's lifeguards, Luke. He was 23 years old and was 6'3\" with buzzed blonde hair and greenish eyes. He had a typical \"surfer's body\" but only slightly more buff than your average surfer dude. He also had a tattoo of some kind of a bird on his back, in the center between his shoulder blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke greeted his boss casually, \"What's up boss! Brody sent me to get you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Josh wasn't sure why Brody didn't just come himself. \"Oh, what does he need?\" Josh asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants you to come to break room, as soon as possible dude.\" Luke stated flatly. \"Didn't say for what though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thanked the surfer hunk and Luke left the office with a smile and a thumbs up. Meanwhile Josh leaned back in his chair. Still unsure of why Brody didn't just come here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well better go see what's up.\" Josh thought as he got up and walked toward the door. Turning the corner Josh made his way to the break room door. Opening the door Josh looked out into the room finding... </span></div></div>",

I started cracking up and he had no idea for like hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked out further on the balcony closer to Brody. Looking up at the black haired hunk, Josh smiled. \"I'm glad it worked! Lemme tell you it wasn't easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody scratched the back of his head and laughed some more. \"It was a sweet idea bro. But hey that's not why I had Luke come get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Josh figured he'd bite. \"Yeah, why did you have him come get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody knelt down, trying to bring his face a little closer to Josh. Still towering way above the tiny man, he smiled. \"Well, you had a rough day today. So I wanted to swing by your favorite burger place and treat you, bro. Plus I did almost kill you so...\" The handsome man added as he rubbed his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a little taken aback by the offer. Nobody's ever treated Josh to something like this. \"That's fine by me! But you didn't almost kill me. Tyler did. You saved me and for that I'm treating you too. How's a 100$ bonus this week sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody waved his hands back and fourth. \"No way bro that's way too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then no burgers.\" Josh said turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody sighed loudly, \"If that's what it'll take for you to let me treat you, then ok bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned back around and smiled at the colossal man. \"Alright then, let's get going.\" Josh said walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking confused, Brody stopped and looked at his little boss. \"Uhh don't you wanna grow back to normal size first, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. \"Nah, besides I trust you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody let down his hand, allowing his tiny boss to climb aboard. Lifting Josh up to his shoulder, Josh stepped off onto the broadly muscled surface. Brody stood up and smiled. Looking at his boss out of the corner of his eye he said. \"We're off, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody walked out of the back door, leading out behind the water park. Walking to a near by parking lot he pulled some keys out of his pocket and clicked a button. A pair of lights flashed in front of them on a sporty red convertible. Opening the door, Brody reached over to his boss on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this car sure is nice, Brod.\" Josh said impressed as he got on Brody's hand once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at the driver's seat Brody blushed a little. He lowered his boss down into the passenger seat and looked down to see the little man sit in the center of the black leather seat. \"Well my parents are pretty well off. They got it for me, bro. I just don't like to brag about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat back in the comfortable leather. The seat was warm from the sun, but very tolerable. All the while Josh watched as Brody started the car with push button start and fasten his seat belt securely across his bare chest. Still, Josh couldn't believe how modest the giant adonis was about his family's wealth. While Josh was busy admiring him, Brody sped out of the parking lot, making for a near by fast food burger place. As the two stopped in the drive through, Brody quickly asked the little man what he wanted, a simple order of just a cheese burger and some fries. Brody on the other hand piled on a few burgers and a large fry just for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two pulled the car up to the window Brody gave the cashier some money. The young girl at the window blushed at the black haired shirtless hunk as she gave him his change. After a few minutes she reappeared, giving him a large bag of food, nervously thanking him multiple times for his purchase. Brody smiled and took the bag, laughing casually as she repeated herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody pulled away from the restaurant while dropping the bag on the seat seat, just behind Josh. Josh couldn't help but smell the tantalizing aroma coming from the bag as Brody drove down some streets, heading home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Josh even realized, the two pulled into a drive way of an impressive looking home. Looking like it could fit a large family, Josh was curious if Brody lived with his parents. A little nervous that he'd be surrounded by people he didn't know while being so small, he figured he should ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you have such a big house. Is this your parents?\" Josh asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro. I live on my own in here most of the time. Occasionally, I have an old buddy or two I used to play sports with in high school spend a few weeks here though. But right now it's just...\"          </span></div></div>",

Josh climbs aboard and gets carried back to his muscled shoulder again. \"Sorry, bro. Need both hands for the grub and my keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh understands and feels no implication to complain. He watches the big guy reach down on the seat and lift up the big bag of food. It looks much too big for someone to carry with two hands alone - but Brody holds it up with one! \"This guy is strong,\" thinks Josh. With his free hand, Brody reaches for the keys in his lifeguard shorts. The fumbling to find them took more than a minute or two, but to unlock the door took much less time. It opens to reveal a nice-looking living room which lacks much of the modesty the big guy had with Josh on their ride here - a large flat-screen TV, leather couch, and fancy ceiling fan above a cheaper coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody puts his keys back into his pocket before holding out his palm once more for his tiny passenger. \"Make yourself at home, bro.\" Josh hops off his shoulder into the waiting hand, which ferries him all the way to the coffee table. As he climbs off to the wooden surface, Brody slips and slams the bag of burgers down at the far end of it. The earthquake rattles Josh to the core as Brody frowns \"Sorry bout that, bro! You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reassures the big guy. \"I'm fine.\" He watches as Brody slips off his lifeguard flip flops before jumping onto the couch. \"Man, I'm starvin, bro.\" He fishes through the bag and pulls out the cheeseburger and fries for his tiny boss. \"Hold on, bro!\" He carries them off into the kitchen before bringing the meal back on a paper plate in one hand, while holding a cold sports drink in another. \"It's all yours, bro,\" he says as he sets down the plate before sitting back on the couch to eat his gargantuan meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh climbs onto the plate and tucks into the burger. He always enjoyed these and with one all to himself, there's no risk of being accidentally eaten by one of his lifeguard workers. And yet all the time he enjoys himself, he can't help but watch Brody chow down on the burgers in the rest of the bag. Maybe he does it slowly, or it just seems like it to Josh. After unwrapping each one, it seems like he tries to stick as much as he can into his mouth before he started chewing. Josh watches the big guy's jaws go to work on the burger, then his neck bulge as each mouthful gets sent deep inside his body. He can faintly hear Brody's stomach lurch to life as it begins digesting each burger he eats one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet after each one which would take forever for tiny Josh to eat, Brody reaches in for another one and does the same routine. It must have been five or six before he moves onto the large fries, still eying them like he just started to eat. Josh can't help but stare as his muscled hand reaches in and grabs half the fries in the box before downing them like the burgers. He washes all of them down with his sports drink, leaving half of it full when he finishes to wipe his face. It's hard for Josh to tell how full Brody got, since his muscled torso hasn't changed. But when he rubs his hand over his abs and groans in delight, he could tell he's reached his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some good burgers, bro,\" Brody says as he leans back into the couch, rubbing his stomach. \"Stomach's full, bro. I'm stuffed.\" For five minutes he watches his tiny boss eat. \"I'm sorry,\" says Josh as soon as he makes eye contact. \"At this size it takes me a while to eat something this big. Don't mind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, bro,\" Brody shifts in his seat again. \"I'm just gonna...\"</span></div></div>",

I guarantee I won't even be close to done with this burger by the time you wake up!\" Josh grinned as Brody yawned and stretched out across the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, bro.\" Brody shut his eyes. \"Wake me up if you need anything, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Josh answered, not sure if Brody even heard him now that he wasn't really paying much attention. Refocusing on his burger, Josh smiled as he enjoyed spending time away from Tyler's potential mischief with Brody for a change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Brody to fall asleep. Josh could easily tell by the deafening snores coming from Brody's mouth. At times Josh even had to cover his ears just to block out the obnoxiously loud noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea he was such a loud snorer...\" Josh said to himself as Brody breathed in deep with a loud rumble. Josh now was content with his burger. Having made his way off the plate he could do little more than observe Brody from across the gap between the coffee table and the couch. Josh sat, a little annoyed by the snoring and also a little bored, knowing he could't really go anywhere or do anything without risking being lost to Brody once he wakes up from his noisy slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then without warning, Brody's arm stretched out, bridging the gap as his rest his hand gently on the coffee table, not far from where Josh sat. Josh stared at the arm, curiously. It was like a perfect bridge of flesh and muscle, leading from his boring perch on the coffee table all the way across to Brody's much more interesting, albeit noisier body. Josh bit his lip, wondering if he should risk letting his curiosity get the best of him. Josh stood up deciding he wanted to...</span></div></div>",

Josh laughed it off knowing Brody wouldn't care if he woke up with Josh his body somewhere as he made his way to the other side of the arm, getting closer and closer to the deep obnoxious snores. \"Though I don't think he'll be up anytime soon..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way onto Brody's shoulder now finally, Josh took a nice long look all across Brody's magnificent body. From the sweaty hairy pits below him, to Brody's impressive chest in front of him, Josh stood agape for a few moments. With a loud snore, Josh snapped back into reality as he walked out to the top of Brody's chest, looking from his neck in front to all the way to his rolling abs as they seemed so far away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling adventurous, Josh prepared his journey toward Brody's...</span></div></div>",

Grabbing a sesame seed, Josh munched on the piece of food as he awaited Brody's return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReappearing at the doorway, Brody walked into the room carried two enormous looking weights. Josh watched in awe as the giant man carried one in each hand as if they were made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Glancing at the actual weight as Brody walked by to reclaim his spot on the sofa however, Josh noticed they in fact weighed a whopping 45 pounds each! Josh watched wide-eyed as Brody sat down and dropped the weights as gently as he could on the floor. However the massive weights did little more than create yet another earthquake for the tiny man to experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bro!\" Brody said as he watched Josh almost fall off the top of his burger. \"Man, I don't mean to keep making all these quakes for you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh readjusted himself on the burger. Admitabely, it was starting to get a little obnoxious. After all he figured Brody would be a little more sensitive about his size! Regardless, Josh brushed it off. Brody was being polite about it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, Brody.\" Josh said smiling at the handsome lifeguard. \"It's not like you're doing it on purpose.\" Josh added, hoping maybe that would entice him to b a little more careful in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure, bro!\" Brody said as he lifted one of the weights up off the ground and started to do a few bicep curls with it. Josh couldn't help but stop and watch the handsome stud as he muscles bulged and relaxed with each passing rep. As the finished the set, Josh watched as Brody very slowly lowered the massive weight onto the ground. Although the floor still shook a tiny bit, Josh couldn't help but appreciate the effort Brody put into lessening the tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" Josh said smiling as Brody lifted the second weight with his other arm, smiling as he started to do reps with that one too. After finishing that set as well Brody didn't even bother dropping the weight as he just grabbed both and walked around the other side of the coffee table and faced away from Josh. Josh turned and watched the massive man face away from him. He couldn't help but blush as he examined Brody's strong looking back and shoulders, not to mention his perfectly round bubble butt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh gawked at the massive man, Brody started to lift the weights in unison, performing a tricep fly. Josh nibbled on the sesame seed once more, transfixed by Brody's physical prowess as the massive muscle stud started to rise the barbells above his head with retaliative ease. Josh continued to watch as Brody kept going and going, working up a sweat doing more and more reps. His back starting to sweat worse, Josh watched as beads of the salty substance started to trickle down to his perfect ass, before disappearing into his red lifeguard shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip watching the attractive man work out. But just as Josh was really starting to enjoy the show, Brody went to lower the weights. He let them drop out of habit and the tremor they caused was much larger than the ones Josh had experienced a few minutes ago. Tumbling backwards Josh lost his grip on the burger and started plummeting off the food down to the plate. Closing his eyes and rolling with on stoppable speed and falling for what seemed like forever, Josh finally opened them to see that he was...              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the tumble didn't seem to hurt him in anyway, but regardless it was still quite the precarious position to be in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Josh started to take in his new surroundings. He could see Brody's massive sandals a few feet away from him as well all the entire underside of the sofa. Turning around he looked under the coffee table before the floor started to shake again. All Josh could see was Brody's massive bare feet stomping toward the opposite side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that wasn't too big of a quake...\" Brody thought as he walked carefully over to the coffee table, looking down to the plate. Examining the burger closely, he could see his tiny boss was no longer on top of the bun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably hid inside of it because he knew I was going to drop more weights...\" Brody thought to himself a little upset. Deciding he didn't want to disturb his boss anymore, Brody walked over to his weights and grabbed both of them in each hand. The massive black haired stud then proceeded to carry them out of the room. As he dropped them off in the other room he wiped the sweat off his forehead. The workout, although short, was enough to get him a little worn out and tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll grab a shower.\" Brody said to himself as he left the room to head to the bathroom. Figuring he'd leave his tiny boss at peace for a bit, he didn't bother heading back to tell Josh the plan. Instead he walked straight over to the bathroom and turned on the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did he go?\" Josh wondered a lot as he saw Brody stomp off with the weights, and not returning. All he did was look at the table and walk away! Josh sighed as Brody's thought process started to piece together for him. He probably felt bad about the quakes and decided to leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great if I wasn't stuck down on the floor!\" Josh said staring up at the impossibly tall sofa and coffee table. Figuring the best possible thing to do would be to get in a spot where Brody will see him, Josh started to weigh his options. The leather sofa indeed looked tall, but the sticky heat outside did seem like it would offer a decent grip for climbing up to the cushions of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Josh looked over at Brody's sandals. Sure he figured they must stink a bit, but if anything Brody would look to retrieve them at some point or another. Figuring he wasn't so small that Brody would never notice him on them, it seemed like the easier option than climbing the sofa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering these options Josh went to...    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His name's Vinny, he's a good guy if you meet him, bro.\" Brody said casually, as he lowered his hand down next to Josh to once again lift him up to his shoulder. As Brody grabbed the bag of food and started to exit the car Josh started to think about what he learned about Bordy. Obviously, he's a lax bro, but not only that his parents were pretty well off which means he probably went to bordering school too. Either way if he met this \"Vinny\" then, he must be a pretty decent guy... and also probably a bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped back to reality as Brody walked up to the front door, unlocking it and letting himself inside. Josh was in awe of his gigantic surroundings, looking out into the clean entry way, as well as looking up at the massive stair case leading to the upstairs. Brody however, walked past the stairs toward the back of the house. As Brody made his way past a few rooms, he pointed out places like the living room, lounge and a few others. Finally they made their way into the kitchen, which was surprisingly clean and also very spacious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brody went over to the kitchen table, setting down the bag of food. Reaching his hand up to his shoulder, he offered Josh a ride down to the table. Josh gladly got back into the massive palm once again, smiling at Brody at he gently lowered him down. Once on solid ground, Josh took in his surroundings some more, but the one that stuck out the most was the massive stud that's been carting him around. Josh looked up at Brody's toned body, trying not to make himself too obvious about how much he admired his physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody winked at Josh casually and turned away to the refrigerator, pulling out a yellow sports drink. \"Yo, bro you want anything?\" He called out with his head in the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just water is fine!\" Josh yelled back, hoping his small voice would reach the giant hunk. Josh sat down, looking at the giant bag of food once more as Brody carried over his drink as well as a little bit of water poured into what looked like a shot glass. Brody then went into a drawer, pulling out a few pads of paper, and piled them on top of each other to create a make-shift stair case for Josh to reach the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking Brody for his generosity, Josh decided to make use of the stairs while Brody unpacked the food. Josh easily traversed the steps, making it to the top of the tiny glass, cupping his hands down into the water, Josh took a drink. Relieved, he headed back down the stairs, seeing that Brody had already unwrapped Josh's burger as well as poured out his fries onto the open wrapper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody grabbed the rest of the bag and watched as Josh climbed up onto the wrapper, staring up at his giant burger. \"All yours little dude! I promise I won't take a single bite, so have at it, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was entranced by the aroma, and based off Brody's words he knew he could be as reckless as he wanted with how he took in the burger both as a meal and as an adventure. Scaling the side, Josh was determined to make his way under the bun, right in where all the juicy meat was. As he climbed his way in he couldn't help but get stuck a little to the cheese, but he was able to free himself by just pulling it off thankfully. However now was the time where he decided to descend under the bun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Josh was busy with his burger Brody watched as he saw the little man crawl under the bun. He couldn't help but chuckle to himself as he unwrapped one of his own burgers. \"Must be neat exploring giant food like that.\" He thought to himself as he took a huge bite out of his own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody quickly finished off his first burger, moving on the the second as well as eating away at his fries. Occasionally, he glanced over at Josh's burger just to see if the little man would emerge from the juicy depths. He was interrupted however by the sound of the front door being opened, then shut closed. Brody sat quietly for a second until he heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Brod! I'm home!\" The voice yelled from the front of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Vinny!\" Brody called back, trying to to draw too much attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny however had other plans. His nose smelt food and his stomach wanted it, so he came barging his way into the kitchen. Brody looked up at his buddy. He was wearing a pair of loose grey sweat pants and a sweaty white tank top, showing off his impressive arms yet hiding his well trained physique. He was the same age as Brody and only slightly shorter as well. He also had buzzed light brown hair and blue eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood up to greet him, putting out a hand and pulling his buddy in for a bro hug. However Vinny's gaze quickly changed to the burgers on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you got me dinner? That's classy of you man.\" Vinny said walking over to Josh's burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody panicked for a second, stopping his friend. \"Yo man, don't eat that one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny stopped and turned to look at Brody. \"Why bro, were you gonna eat that one next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure if he should reveal Josh quite yet to Vinny, Brody had to think...</span></div></div>",

Grabbing one of the still wrapped burgers though, Brody handed it to Vinny. \"Take this one bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny gladly took the burger, quickly unwrapping it and taking a bite out of it. Sitting down in front of where Josh's burger used to be, he then helped himself to a few of Josh's french fries. Brody watched his friend stealing his boss's food all the while though he kept tabs on Josh's burger out of the corner of his eye. Figuring this wasn't the ideal time for him to emerge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the shot glass, bro?\" Vinny asked, picking up the little glass and gulping down the water in one sip. \"Oh it was just water.\" he said bringing it over to the sink, then grabbing a full bottle of water out of the fridge. Brody couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if Josh fell in that shot glass, the idea of it made him swallow his next bite of his burger nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny continued to tear apart his burger, finishing it a lot faster than Brody finished his. Taking a sip of his water, he started to eye the untouched burger sitting next to him in front of Brody. Meanwhile, Brody tried to finish his burger as slowly as possible hoping Vinny was satisfied and would leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny watched as Brody took smaller and smaller bites of his burger, all the while his gaze would snap back down to the fresh one just sitting there begging to be eaten. \"Yo Brod. If you're getting full I'll take the last burger.\" Vinny asked finally. \"I'm still hungry bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody was afraid of that but still he was determined not to give up Josh's treat that easily. \"Bro, I already gave you one for nothing. Just lemme eat my food, man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, Vinny stood up. Taking another long gulp of his water he looked back down at the burger once more. Just then...  </span></div></div>",

Jumping back as Brody got up Vinny held the burger to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Stop!\" Brody called, putting his hand out nervously looking at Vinny. Normally he would have just tackled his buddy, but he didn't want Josh to go flying somewhere and get hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, why? You weren't gonna eat it.\" Vinny said bringing it closer to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not yours bro.\" Brody said trying to plead with his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny lowered the burger, putting on a guilty face. Brody relaxed a little, thinking that Vinny was going to give it back. However, Brody guessed wrong as Vinny snapped the burger back up to his face, taking a huge bite out of the burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now!\" He said with a full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody had enough at this point, he grabbed Vinny's arm and forced the remainder of the burger out of his hand. \"Look dude, you gotta spit that out.\" Brody said unsure if his boss was in that bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny continued to have other plans. Without chewing for more than a second, he swallowed the whole piece down practically whole. \"Nah dude, that's a waste of food.\" He said smiling at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody turned away from Vinny, disgusted. He put the burger on the table and quickly pulled off the bun, searching for his tiny boss somewhere amongst the wreckage. Meanwhile Vinny laughed at his buddy and walked away. Making his way up stairs he pulled off his sweaty tank top, revealing his chiseled torso. Walking to his room, he threw the shirt on the ground and pulled down his sweat pants. Now just in his underwear he searched through his drawers, locating a tight white spandex shirt as well as a loose pair of black running shorts. Pulling the clothes on, he admired his huge chest and rippling abs as they showed through the tight white shirt quite easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunky bro jogged his way down the stairs and looped back around to the kitchen to find Brody. \"Yo, Brod. Wanna go for a run with me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brody... </span></div></div>",

He didn't even hear Vinny's question as he continued his futile search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not...\" Vinny said to himself turning away from the kitchen. Walking out the front door and grabbing his water, he just didn't understand what the big deal was about the dumb burger. Turning off the cap of the water he took another big gulp of it down as he started his jog. Little did he know, that the gulp of water  he just drank took the same path that a tiny man traversed just moments ago. Shortly, that measly pool of water that Vinny already forgot he sent down, was going to enter his cavernous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the sphincter opening, as a small flood of water came bursting in. It was cool as it washed by Josh as he held on for dear life to the half chewed piece of burger floating in the man's stomach. Once the water settled with the rest of the chamber's contents, it started to become humid and uncomfortably warm once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do to deserve this?\" Josh asked himself as his mass of land bobbed up and down in motion with Vinny running. Trying to stay positive, Josh closed his eyes. Just hoping that Brody would come to his rescue any moment now and save him from this smelly sack of digesting food. Until then, Josh could only watch as the seas of water mixed with acid splashed up and down as well as the walls of the massive belly churned back and fourth, occasionally making an unpleasant growling noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to go by, and once in a while the stomach would bob faster or slower. Occasionally another flood of water would come crashing down, giving Josh much needed relief. Eventually though the humid air started to get to the little man as he started to lose his grip on the half digested burger. Slowly drifting into unconsciousness and with one last bounce from the chamber, Josh slipped into the bubbling surface of acidic water. Without the energy to tred water, Josh had no choice but to succumb to Vinny's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny rounded the block for the last time. Fresh out of water he headed back home. Making his way inside he wiped some sweat from his forehead and looked for Brody. Walking into the kitchen, he found him there on the floor. He looked like he was trying to find something, but Vinny wasn't particularly interested. Turning around he walked back up stairs to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching as he entered the spacious room, he peeled off his sweaty spandex shirt. Casually, he tossed the shirt on the floor with his tank top from earlier. Now however he was way more interested in cleaning himself up from a sweaty day at work followed by a sweaty run around the neighborhood. Leaving his room he walked out into his bathroom and shut the door. The handsome man turned on the shower and clicked on the fan, then turned his attention to the mirror. Taking a close look at himself, he couldn't help but admire his solid abs as they glistened with sweat. Rubbing his hand down his chest to his stomach it rumbled a little. Frowning, he gave his stomach a good pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could have ate that whole burger.\" He said to himself as he pulled down his shorts and continued to look at his reflection. Little did he know that in that one bite he did get a little more meat than he thought. And although Vinny never met Josh, Josh on the other had got to know Vinny very well. However he ended up a lot closer than he ever intended to. </span></div></div>",

Where is he? Bathroom or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody pulled off the rest of the bun, revealing the cheese filled surface of the burger. Stuck to the partially melted cheese and barely visable was in fact Brody's tiny boss, Josh. \"He's right here, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny rubbed his eyes and looked closely down at the tiny figure waving up at him. A part of him couldn't believe what he was looking at, but then it just hit him where Brody worked after all. \"Right dude, I forgot you worked at that Shrink and Swim place.\"Vinny said looking over at his buddy before looking back down at the tiny man on the burger. \"Sup little man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at the man, glad he was able to be greeted so casually despite his rather diminutive size. \"Hey Vinny! Nice to meet you!\" Josh yelled back up at the man happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smiled back when suddenly his stomach gave off a very audible grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Groooooaaaan*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast!\" He said rubbing his stomach roughly. Josh frowned, feeling bad about hogging a big burger all to himself when he figured he'd offer it to the hungry new hunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme just get off this burger and you can have it, as long as you don't mind I've eaten off it that is!\" Josh called cheerfully up to Vinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks tiny bro! I would've eaten it even if you were still on it man! So don't worry about it!\" Vinny said excitedly as he watched the little man crawl carefully off the burger. As soon as the coast was clear he quickly grabbed the bun and took a huge bite out of the juicy morsel. Josh watched as the ruthless giant tore apart the landscape he was just resting on, still a little leery about the comment he made about eating it even if he was still on it. The thought made Josh shiver, but he was glad that wasn't the case. All the while Brody sat there behind Josh, still munching away at his own piles of burgers before he finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had extra, you didn't have to take Josh's like that, bro.\" He said pulling out a few burgers from the greasy bag beside him. Josh looked up as he watched Brody's massive arm move what seemed like mountains of wrappings on to the table across from him with extreme ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Brody.\" Josh decided to chime in. \"I offered, and besides I've had my fill anyway!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked down at the tiny man sitting just a few inches away from his black treasure trail and sighed with a smile on his face. \"You're lucky Josh is a nice guy, bro.\" He said looking over at Vinny as he swallowed down the last bite of his burger. Brody chuckled as he grabbed one of the still wrapped burgers and tossed it to his buddy. Josh watched as the huge mass of meat soared far above his head before being caught what seemed like miles away by Vinny, who quickly unwrapped the food and took another huge bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dudes!\" He said with his mouth half full looking at Brody and Josh.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio sat there for some time as Josh watched the two colossal men devour burger after burger, never ceasing to be amazed at how much the titans could eat. One after another the piles of burger diminished until finally the two men had their fill. Josh turned around looking at Brody's slightly bulged stomach while it still showed off his attractive 6 pack quite well. Brody looked down at the little man and smirked. \"You must be bored of watching us eat, huh boss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed, in truth he found the two attractive men eating to be very entrancing, however he'd never admit it. \"Its no big deal, don't worry about it.\" Josh said hiding his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know what I wanna do!\" Vinny said standing up suddenly rubbing his gut. \"I feel like I just gained five pounds. Let's go for a jog, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody frowned and crossed his arms. \"Dude, the boss doesn't want us to ditch him and go for a run. Why don't we just chill by the pool out back for a bit and swim or something.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could bring him with us, bro. It would probably be pretty epic!\" Vinny said looking down at Josh trying to gain his support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to you boss.\" Brody replied, still keeping his arms crossed.

All the while Brody stood up and looked down at his miniature boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got my suit on already, so why don't we head outside boss?\" Brody said as he lowered hand down to carry Josh. Without a word Josh climbed onto the massive hand. Gazing out across the palm Josh realized it was very long ago he was just riding in the same hand before, except now the landscape differed ever so slightly with the presence of grease and tiny otherwise unseen food particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody lifted the tiny man up to about chest height, unintentionally giving the tiny man a fantastic view of his enormous pecs. The two tuned to leave out the back door, a sliding glass door right out the back side of the kitchen. Josh had to shield his eyes from the bright sun, and as he did so he saw Brody's other muscular arm pass by him briefly before he saw a pair of gigantic sunglasses flash by him to be placed on Brody's face. \"Sunglasses my size would be really nice right now...\" Josh thought to himself looking up at Brody's handsome face, a little envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody slowly worked his way over to the pool's side and carefully lowered himself and his tiny boss onto a lawn chair. Laying back, he stretched out his full stomach and slide his tiny boss off his hand and onto his abs. Peeking across his body he watched as the little man got his bearings and situated himself between his still very prominent abs. Leaning his head back he closed his eyes for a second and put his hands behind his head, showing off his magnificent arms pits with sleek looking black hair inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as this massive man, practically a god compared to him right now, leaned back to take a breather after a long day. Sweating a little Josh tried to make himself comfortable but the bright sun was making it difficult as he felt like he was practically cooking on the attractive man's stomach. Giving up, Josh resigned himself to just looking up across the literal manscape that was Brody's body, just in awe of how huge it was and how insignificant he was compared to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Josh was finally getting a little more comfortable on the firm muscle, but still couldn't help but brush away the sweat from himself as well as large bead forming around him being made from Brody's body. Slipping a little from the slickness of the sweat Josh was startled by a sudden noise as he heard...               </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody's stomach started to rise and lower with a much more rhythmic pattern as he drew in and let out breaths. Josh tried to look across the moving landscape all the way up to Brody's face and couldn't really make anything out until a deafening sound erupted to Josh's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HHHHNNNOOOOORRRT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh covered his ears as noise came out of Brody's apparently hanging open mouth. Trying once more to adjust himself on the sweaty stomach, Josh wasn't sure if he was entirely safe resting on a sleeping and sweating giant. Slipping to his feet finally he thought he should make his way off of Brody's slick abs and onto a more sturdy surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna slide right into his belly button at this rate unless I got on his chest or something...\" Josh said aloud as he looked back to the deep hole that was Brody's naval. Shaking his head, he thought for sure Brody wouldn't find him trapped especially since his thick black hair was taking up part of that particular landscape. Sighing, Josh started to practically crawl his way through the sweat as Brody's stomach raised once again. This time it actually worked to Josh's advantage as he slide his way down the stomach toward Brody's massive chest. However once again Brody's deafening snore pierced Josh's ears as he screamed and tried to cover them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat seemed to pool less closer to Brody's chest, as Josh thought. \"Man his abs are just... soaked...\" Josh said looking back at Brody's stomach as it lowered back down to a normal resting position. He couldn't help but stop and admire how the glistened so brightly in the sun though before looking ahead of him to the two huge mountains that made up Brody's chest. Sighing once more, Josh started to hike his way between the valley, which was now also pooling sweat from the intense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Vinny had finished changing and made his way down the stairs to the pool. Quickly he looked over at the chair to see Brody laying there. Shaking his head, he figured the big guy was sound asleep and just made his way to the pool. Before climbing down the ladder, he quickly tightened the cord on his olive green board shorts. Satisfied with his granny knot he lowered himself into the pool, wincing slightly as the cool water rushed up against his solid six pack. Finally,he dropped himself in, making a quiet splash and wetting his head before resurfacing and standing on the slick floor of the pool. The end of the pool was pretty deep for your average person, but Vinny and Brody had no problem standing in it, even letting the water wash up against his round pecs without needing to straighten his back or posture at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny decided if he wasn't going to get to run off his meal he was going to swim it off instead. So he started to do laps around the pool for a little while. Working up his heart beat he pushed himself to keep going. After his final lap, he stopped a little ways across from where Brody laid. Vinny rolled his eye as he heard Brody's trademarked snore. \"Bro... How can you fall asleep this fast in this sun!\" Vinny said to himself looking up quickly at the sky. Sighing, he got out of the pool and started to drip everywhere. He walked over to a picnic table and grabbed one of the spare towels he left out from another day and wiped his up and down his solid body before tying it around his waist. Shaking his head again, Vinny walked over to Brody and looked down at his muscled friend as he laid there passed out... that is until something small caught his eye. Vinny squinted as he noticed a tiny speck crawl it's way across Brody's left pec, right into the center near the nipple. Leaning down he looked a little closer at his friends chest before he finally noticed it was in fact the tiny man that is Brody's boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up tiny bro!\" Vinny whispered to the now shocked Josh. Josh jumped as he never even noticed the massive man's approach! He was working so hard to hike up Brody's chest that Vinny's appearance was a total surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny! Hey! How long have you been out here?\" Josh asked, still a little shook up over being snuck up on by a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got done swimming laps around the pool, bro. Have you been stuck on this sleeping moron this whole time?\" Vinny asked covering his mouth and pointing a finger at Brody's knocked out face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked back, covered head to toe in sweat at Brody's face. His mouth was hung open as he continued to take in deep breaths. Josh figured he must be a heavy sleeper to stay asleep in this heat... \"Yeah... I don't think he meant to fall asleep though.\" Josh replied finally looking up at Vinny's handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be boring for you tiny bro. I'm gonna grab a drink and chill on the picnic table over there.\" Vinny said pointing at the table in the distance. Josh could see the glass table, complete with an umbrella and what looked like plenty of shade, however to him it looked like it might as well be on the other side of the planet given his size. \"You wanna join me tiny bro?\" Vinny asked now staring at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh yes please, Vinny! The shade sounds great right about now.\" Josh said enthusiastically as he leap to his feet, almost falling over in the slick sweat in the process. Vinny smiled as he stood up to his full height, showing off his ripped torso to Josh before lowering his slightly wet hand to onto Brody's pec. Eagerly Josh climbed aboard as he was lifted away and he looked back to see Brody still laying there, unaware of anything that's happened over the past couple minutes. Turning his attention to Vinny now Josh watched as he was carried over to the shady table and laid gently down on the glass surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gotta be kinda uncomfortable bro. I'll grab you a napkin or something to sit on.\" Vinny said as he turned to leave and go back into the house. All the while Josh didn't care. The surface was hard sure, but not worse than the solid muscle of Brody's body not to mention the table wasn't sweating up buckets of liquid either! All that matters to Josh right now is that there is shade, and plenty of it. At Josh's size, it might as well have been 30 degrees cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny reappeared at the door as Josh watched him wander over to the table holding a bottle of water and a plush looking napkin. As he approached Josh couldn't help but bite his lip as he watched Vinny's pecs bounce slightly with each step, and his abs clench and flex as he walked over. It's not like Josh didn't get to see muscled men whenever he wanted at the park, but something about Vinny's almost foreign physique peeked Josh's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny sat down at the table with a smile. His stomach remained at around the height of the table as he situated himself in the chair. Finally he set down the massive napkin next to Josh and watched as the tiny man scrambled on to it and start to enjoy the comfy new surface. Meanwhile Vinny twisted the top off the water bottle and took and long chug from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! That hit the spot, bro. Here have some.\" Vinny said as he poured a small amount into the cap of the bottle and sat it down next Josh on the napkin. Resting an elbow on the table he continued to watch Josh as the speck of a man made his way to the cap and barely got into the cool water. Vinny took another long drink out of the now half empty bottle as he watched Josh climb out of the shallow cap and back onto the napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Vinny!\" Josh said with a huge smile looking up at the attractive man. These accommodations were much more to Josh's liking than slipping around in sweat in the blistering sun after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, tiny bro I have a question.\" Vinny asked still looking at the little man curiously. Josh laid there and shook his head, happy to answer whatever while in this much more relaxed bliss. \"What's it like being so small, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a little taken aback by the question. It wasn't that outlandish considering it's not exactly normal, but he also forgot this is probably Vinny's first time seeing a shrunken person. \"It's a rush really. Seeing everything so big like this table, or napkin or even this bottle cap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or me?\" Vinny interrupted putting a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you...\" Josh continued. \"But it's not just that. Since I'm so small simple things can seem way more exciting. A bird flying by suddenly seems like a jet plane crossed paths with me. Oh or exploring the burger earlier. That was invigorating!\" Josh said proud of his description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny laid his hand back on the table and lowered his head slightly. \"So do you like being small, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed. Now this question was one he was more embarrassed about. \"I suppose you could say that, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smiled even more as he heard the answer. \"I know of a simple thing that would probably be really exciting for you tiny bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tilted his head a little nervously. He wasn't sure if he liked where this was going... but he figured he'd bite. \"What's that Vinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating is something pretty simple right? Shove some food in your mouth, swallow it down, forget about it. Right? Well bro, ever since I saw you on that burger I couldn't get the idea of eating a tiny man out of my head.\" Vinny said with a serious look on his face. Josh winced slightly at the words. He was a little worried that's what he was alluding to but as Josh looked up at the handsome man's face and down his body to his attractive six pack, he was lying if he said he wasn't at least curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think that would be exciting...\" Josh said nervously. \"I-I just don't know if it's such a good idea, I mean it'd be dangerous to say the least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like deadly, bro.\" Vinny said leaning back and stretching out his muscled stomach. \"What food goes into Vinny, stays in Vinny.\" He said giving his stomach a solid smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed hard. The words... the actions... all of it made him suddenly WANT to be eaten by the massive stud. But he knew it would mean the end of his life.\"I-I'm not food though, Vinny...\" Josh said trying to be a little defiant despite his nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're even better though, bro! I want to know what a person tastes like, feel them squirm and struggle as my body does all the work. Besides, its all just food to my stomach, bro. It's cool though, right tiny bro? Vinny replied with a wink as he rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-what about Brody?\" Josh asked with a stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been asleep this whole time. I'll just let him think he rolled over on you during his nap or something.\" Vinny said sitting forward once more still rubbing his stomach. \"So does this mean we're doing this tiny bro? I'm so game for this right now dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved his arms in protest as the giant man started reaching down toward him. \"Wait wait! I haven't made up my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny stopped and dropped his hands, disappointed. He folded them across his chest, resting them softly on his huge pecs as he looked down quizzically at the indecisive little man. \"Come on dude, you said you love the thrill of being so small! Think of it as an adventure, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Josh watched as Vinny grabbed his water and poured a little bit in his mouth, leaving it open for Josh to see. Slowly he swished the water around before swallowing with a very audible gulp and then proceeded to trace the water's path, down between his enormous pecs until his finger reached his ripped abs and stop. The massive hunk proceeded to poke at the spot for a few seconds before glancing up at Josh, who was blushing a bright red from the show he just put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh fell to his knees and looked at the massive stud before him deciding...              </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's do it...\" Josh said softly finally looking Vinny in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny pulled his arm back in excitement and gave a quick \"Yes!\" before looking down at the tiny man once more. \"One more thing tiny bro. Well two actually!\" He said rubbing the back of his neck as he leaned in closer to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh confidently looked up at Vinny, trying not to be distracted by his hairy pits as this new smell washed over him. \"What's that?\" He asked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok bro. First, I want you to ask me to eat you. Not just ask, practically beg alright?\" Vinny said with a cocky smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. It was bad enough he was agreeing to be eaten by this meat head, now he wanted him to beg for it? \"Do I really have to beg you to do it?\" Josh asked a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some incentive tiny bro.\" Vinny said as he pushed his chair back and ran his hand down his torso, carefully caressing each muscle as he lowered his hand. Next, he removed his hand and started posing to the left and right, showing off his massive biceps before coming to a rest and making his huge pecs bounce up and down a little. All the while he just stared at Josh or his own body, shaking his head up and down with an arrogant smile. \"Just think, you'll be part of this, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was blushing like crazy. This giant man just gave him the flex show of his dreams. His body truly was a work of art and begging to become a part of it didn't seem all that bad at this point. \"Alright, what's your second thing, Vinny?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny sat down at the chair again and crossed his arms over his chest. \"This is easy tiny bro. I want you to walk into my mouth. Not just that, bro. Once you're in there I want you squirming. I wanna feel you go down, bro. Once you're in my stomach too I want you to pound on those walls a little too, got it? I bet I won't even feel you, dude.\" He said looking down at his chiseled stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that, then what's the point?\" Josh rebutted, crossing his own arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny put his hands up and looked down at the little man. \"Hey feel free to prove me wrong then, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a little peeved about the challenge, it's not like Vinny was throwing away his life! \"Fine, I will. But you have to do something for me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Vinny said leaning back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped for a second to look at the giant man, shocked. \"What?\" He asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't negotiate with food, bro. Now start begging.\" Vinny said leaning forward once more and looking straight down at the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe what he was hearing, but then again Vinny did have a point. Why should he listen to Josh at all? He could just as well feed him to a dog somewhere if it suited his fancy. \"Vinny... I...\" Josh started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Vinny.\" He interrupted the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh restarted. \"Master Vinny. I want you to eat me...\" Josh said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Vinny said leaning back and putting his hands behind his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed, trying to pour out his feelings. \"Because you're so huge, and sexy and perfect. I want to struggle as I get pulled down your massive throat and get digested by your powerful stomach so I can hope to become part of your amazing body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job tiny bro!\" Vinny said giving him a thumbs up, suddenly acting like much less of a jerk. Next thing Josh knew a hand was coming down and inviting him aboard. Not wanting to delay Josh climbed onto the giant man's finger and rode it straight up to his handsome face. Vinny smiled at the little man as his mouth started to open and the tongue came out to invite Josh in. \"Now get in, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked forward off the tip of Vinny's finger into the cavernous mouth, jumping down on the slippery tongue. It was hot, and sticky. Much like when he was sliding around on Brody's abs earlier but much darker... and more dangerous. Josh also couldn't help but notice the smell. The faint scent of burger wafted up the lax bro's throat straight into Josh's face. The very burger Josh sat upon earlier was still stewing deep withing Vinny's body. \"Guess I'll be joining it soon.\" Josh said as he continued his way forward taking in his surroundings some more. Vinny's white rows of teeth sat perfectly side by side as Josh walked on the tongue making his way to the dangling uvula swaying gracefully at the saliva covered back of the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh suddenly lost his footing as Vinny closed his mouth and tipped his head back. Before Josh knew what was going on he was being swished around to every which corner of the cavern. His head spinning Josh finally came to stop only to hear a faint \"Mmmmmm\" noise coming from the back of Vinny's throat. Suddenly and almost violently Josh found himself being pulled straight back to the throat. Barely having enough time to see the dangling uvula as he was forced down the throat. The slimy flesh was now everywhere as Josh found himself surrounded... completely engulfed in Vinny. As hard as he could, Josh started to struggle and squirm for the giant man's pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny stood up as he swallowed, putting a hand on his throat he did in fact feel a tiny speck traveling down inside him. Pressing his finger right up against the little piece of food he felt faint movement as the tiny man struggled and squirmed in his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" Vinny said, licking his lips and the little man did actually have a distinct flavor he found enjoyable. Not sure what it was but he figured the tiny guy still had some burger taste on him that gave him a little bit of a meaty kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny continued to feel the little struggles go down his throat, slowly tracing the little man's movements as he went deeper and closer to the lax bro's awaiting stomach. As the speck reached his chest however he lost track of it completely as he sat there with his hand just above his stomach trying to be very still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" He said still trying to find the little man. Moving his hand a little lower he positioned it right over his stomach, feeling as best he could hoping the little man would be pounding away on the walls of his belly. After a few seconds... still nothing. Vinny gave his gut a loud slap followed by a quick belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurp, I knew he couldn't do it...\" Vinny said a little disappointed. \"Tasted good though.\" He finished to himself before grabbing his water and taking a long chug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was thrown across the chamber as Vinny slapped his stomach. Per Vinny's request he was pounding on the wall like crazy, hoping to get the giant muscle man to feel him. \"He better have felt that.\" Josh said as the pressure in the stomach changed slightly as Vinny's burp released some air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's head spun a little as the lack of oxygen made him a little sleepy. He knew he did the best he could to please the giant man and not to mention his excitement that soon his body would be used to nourish the sexy titan. As Josh started to pass out a torrent of water came crashing down into the chamber, washing Josh in a spiral to his imminent digestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny finished off the bottle of water and let out a sigh. He looked down at his body, impressed at his own physique he flexed his abs a little. \"Bet he can feel me flexing my abs, but I can't even feel him in there, bro.\" He said still a little disappointed. \"Ah well. My tiny bro is gone now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny scratched his head. In all honesty he couldn't even remember the tiny man's name that he just convinced to be eaten by him. He got so used to just calling him \"tiny bro\" that it never even crossed his mind what his name was. \"Doesn't matter, he's just food now anyway.\" He said shrugging and heading inside to throw out his water bottle. After tossing the plastic bottle in the trash he looked outside to see Brody sitting up, rubbing his hands up and down his sweaty body. Vinny cracked his knuckles and walked outside, confident in his plan to trick his bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Brod.\" Vinny said walking over to the frazzled black haired stud. \"Have a good nap, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, man.\" Brody said looking all over his body, chest, and shorts included. \"I didn't mean to fall asleep and now I don't know where Josh went!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh...\" Vinny started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody turned and looked at the muscled stud. \"My boss? I left him here on my stomach before I fell asleep, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight...\" Vinny said now realizing his tiny morsel's name was Josh. \"Well I'll help you look for him bro. He might've fallen off of you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you step dude.\" Brody said still sitting up in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked for about a half an hour before giving up. Vinny convinced Brody that Josh must've fallen off or snatched up by a bug or a bird or something. Much to Brody's dismay he felt completely guilty about losing Josh and left to go inside and take a shower to try and straighten his head on the whole situation. Vinny however watched as his friend went inside the house and turn the corner to go upstairs before he started to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dumbass!\" Vinny said clutching his stomach, already forgetting about the little man being processed in his gut.        </span></div></div>",

Josh watched as Vinny's arrogant smile went to a look of pure disappointment. Josh sighed as he figured he'd know Vinny wasn't about to take no for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bro! You gotta do this for me! Not to mention you gotta do it for yourself! Think of the thrill bro!\" Vinny shouted almost standing up in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved his arms at the antsy muscle man hoping to calm him down. \"Look I'm sorry! I just can't do it Vinny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to back up as he saw Vinny's hand descend at him. \"You have to do it!\" He yelled at the little terrified man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh closed his eyes and hid his head as the hand almost made it to him before a different voice crossed his ears. \"Have to do what, bro?\" Came Brody's voice from right behind Vinny. Josh opened his eyes to see the man standing next to Vinny who quite possibly just saved his life. \"Why are you reaching down for him like that? also how'd he get over here in the first place, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny stood there frozen reaching for Josh. He never even heard Brody get up and walk over behind him, but he knew one thing is that he could never tell Brody he tried to convince his boss to be his dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he has to uhhh...\" Vinny said retracting his hand and turning to Brody. \"W-well I just sorta brought him over here because I thought he'd be more comfortable?\" Vinny said in a questionable tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice of you, bro!\" Brody said slapping his friend on the back. \"You should have woke me up though, if I hadn't heard you talking to him over here I would've never known where he was, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny chuckled awkwardly as he rubbed the back of his neck and looked back down at Josh who had his arms folded, looking furious. Vinny gulped nervously, never thinking someone so small could seem so intimidating. \"Helps to have Brody likely on his side though...\" Vinny thought to himself as he turned at looked at his slightly larger and more muscular friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you having Josh do, bro? I hate being left out!\" Brody said while putting his arm around his buddy and looking down at Josh, who still looked very pissed off. \"Better not get him angry, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He uh... just needs to come with me for a minute and help me decide what to wear to this party tonight is all.\" Vinny said looking at Brody before looking down at Josh and mouthed the words \"I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh unfolded his arms and sighed heavily as he shook his head before replying. \"Fine...\" He said eventually hoping he wasn't going to regret this decision. Just then Vinny lowered his hand slowly and waited for Josh to climb aboard. Reluctantly, Josh scaled the side of the stud's hand making his way safely to the center of the palm before Vinny raised his hand to about stomach height and turned to go inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh silently rode the man's hand upstairs before he turned into a room and closed the door. Josh looked around the enormous room. It was much neater than he expected. Some clothes were laying around and the massive queen sized bed remained unmade but otherwise there wasn't too much terrible clutter in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny crossed the room casually and lowered his hand onto a small desk across from the bed and let Josh off. After jumping off the hand Josh turned and looked up at the muscle jock, hoping to find out what he really had in store for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell Brody I tried to eat you.\" Vinny said looking down at the man with a serious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't go--\" Josh started to say before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you do, I swear I will find you, sprinkle you on some salsa, microwave it and pour it on some chips, give the chips to Brody, slap them out of his hands and watch him vacuum it up and then light that vacuum on fire!\" Vinny said without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's pretty specific for a hypothetical...\" Josh said a little shocked at the description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me, bro.\" Vinny said crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I wasn't going to anyway.\" Josh said sitting down and turning his head, still in disbelief as to how he's being treated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny's tone suddenly changed as he leaned down a little, \"That being said, if you do change your mind about me eating you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was in disbelief over the comment. How could he just threaten someone then go and bring that up? \"Screw you! You just threatened to light me on fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! Just the vacuum, you pussy. Either way fine I see how it is tiny man.\" Vinny said turning away from Josh and pulling off his shorts to reveal his hairless bare ass. Josh watched as the giant man reached into his drawers and bent over to grab a pair of underwear and pants before pulling the clothes on. After zipping up his pants he went into his closet and grabbed a clean looking black tank top and slipped in on over his impressive torso, letting it tightly hug his massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he strolled back over to Josh's position and lowered his hand. \"I'm just gonna bring you back to your precious Brody, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as Josh approached the massive hand, Vinny turned it over and slapped the table right next to where Josh was standing. \"Oh for a second I thought you were a bug. Well accidents do happen.\" He said with a cocky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh simply shook his head, knowing Vinny wouldn't have the balls to do anything right now. Vinny turned back over his hand and Josh climbed aboard the massive palm once more. a little nervous, Josh just tried to look forward as he rode the hand back down the stairs to Brody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood in the kitchen still sweating and shirtless from the pool, waiting for Josh's return. As he heard Vinny come down the stairs he turned and looked to the doorway as his friend came into the room holding his tiny boss. Vinny walked over and let Josh off on to the kitchen table before turning to leave out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch you later, tiny bro!\" Vinny said enthusiastically and he clicked his tongue and pointed at Josh. \"Check you later Brod. I'm out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched as Vinny walked out the front door and shut it behind him. Meanwhile, Brody walked over and smiled at Josh while taking a seat at the kitchen table. \"I'm glad you two got to be friends, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's certainly something alright.\" Josh said crossing his arms while looking up and Brody's sweaty body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody smiled, not catching Josh's sarcasm. \"Well sucks he had to leave like that, bro. Guess its just you and me for a little while huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Josh said under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that bro?\" Brody said leaning his ear in closer to hear Josh better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... said... so what do we wanna do till Vinny gets back?\" Josh replied nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody lifted up his arm pit and took a quick wiff. \"Phew! I know what I need to do! Take a shower! You cool with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second. Brody's sweat was pretty attractive, he was curious what kinds of things they could do while Brody's body glistened in the salty sweat. Then again, the day has been kinda rough... maybe he should just left Brody shower and the two and wind down a little... Josh spoke up saying...     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah go ahead! I'll wait here.\" Josh said thoughtfully, not wanting Brody to have to be uncomfortably sweaty any longer. Brody stood up, glad to get his boss's seal o approval. Before leaving however, Brody grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and brought it over to the kitchen counter. Taking off the top, Brody set it down beside Josh and poured a little into the empty cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, bro.\" Brody said as he placed the bottle down next to the cap. \"In case you get thirsty or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thanked Brody for his thoughtfulness as he watched the huge stud walk off out of the kitchen and turn to go up the stairs. Josh sat there for a second, listening to Brody stomp up the stairs. Eventually, Josh heard the sound of running water as it seemed Brody started the shower. Josh sighed as he walked over to the cool cap of water and drank some before splashing a little on his face. At the very least his interactions with Vinny before game him the chance to clean himself off. Although Josh still had mixed feelings about keeping this secret from Brody, overall it seemed like it was for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down on the kitchen table Josh watched as the heat started to make the water bottle create condensation on the outside. Watching the beads of water run down the slick surface of the bottle seemed almost entrancing for awhile until Josh snapped back to reality when he head the shower shut off from upstairs. Josh stood up and looked over to the entrance to the kitchen. Waiting patiently for Brody's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Brody's massive form finally did reappear through the doorway. Rubbing his still wet black hair, Brody greeted Josh on his way into the room. Josh couldn't help but notice the new clothes he changed into. He wore a grey tank top showing off his strong arms as well as a pair of loose looking navy blue sweatpants with lacrosse sticks embroidered on the side as well as the number 8. Brody pulled his sweatpants down a little briefly showing off a tight pair black compression shorts hiding underneath. Finally Josh looked to the man's feet as he approached. He was in fact not wearing any socks as he showed off his massive bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set, bro! You clean up too?\" Brody asked standing directly in front of Josh, obscuring his view entirely with his huge muscled body. Josh stared up at the handsome giant, barely being able to see his face looking down over his round pecs being clung tightly by his grey tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I feel a lot more refreshed now, thanks a lot Brody.\" Josh said blushing slightly as he gawked at the giant man. Brody smiled as he crouched down to be more at eye level with his tiny boss. Finally at face to face with the little man he decided to come up with something to do while Vinny was out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bro. I was thinking maybe we could watch a movie together or something?\" Brody said looking anxiously down at the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed in relief. He definitely welcomed the idea of a relaxing movie after the day he's been through. \"That sounds great, Brody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood up back to his full height and extended down a hand for Josh to climb aboard. Josh quickly scurried onto the giant man's hand, working his way into the middle of the massive palm for good measure. All the while Brody made his way into the spacious living room complete with surround sound and a huge wide screen TV. Josh looked out into the massive room with awe in just how insanely large everything was. It might as well been the world's largest movie theater to him! Brody slowly walked over to a reclining chair and sat down in the cushy looking leather. Brody reclined the chair and placed Josh right on his stomach, much like when they were outside. Josh tried to make himself comfortable on Brody's shirt, which was certainly a lot easier on the soft fabric rather than directly on Brody's muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody grabbed a remote nearby and flicked on the TV before swapping over to Netflix to find a movie to watch. \"You have any preference, bro?\" Brody asked politely as he flipped through the movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you pick.\" Josh said, not really caring what they watched. Brody smirked as he flipped around before settling on some comedy movie he hasn't seen. All the while the two laid back and started to watch the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by however...       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh's eyes started to feel heavy as he was barely listening to the movie. The noises most prominent to him were the occasional groans and glorps coming from Brody's gut right beneath him. The rhythmic sounds from Brody's body slowly but surely lulled Josh to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around him. Everything seemed hazy as he rubbed his eyes, trying to adjust to his surroundings. Everything was so big around him, but nothing seemed like it came in plain view. Finally a giant face come in front of him. It was Vinny, with an arrogant smirk on his face. Suddenly, a giant hand started falling slowly down at him. Josh tried to move his legs but he couldn't it was as if he was paralyzed. He looked around, trying to call for help but his voice kept cracking like he couldn't speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance another person seemed to be there. Squinting Josh could see it was Brody, but the giant man appeared to be sleeping. With all his might Josh tried desperately to call to his friend for help just as Vinny's hand came crashing down on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-what? Who?\" Josh exclaimed as he woke up finally from his deep sleep. Josh looked around, rubbing his eyes. \"It was just a dream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked below him, it would seem he was sleeping on some sort of soft cushiony substance. Pulling a piece off he looked a little closer, and determined he was in fact in a folded up tissue. Josh smiled for a second, glad that Brody didn't wake him him and took good enough care of him while he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're finally awake, bro.\" Josh heard the familiar voice. Although it wasn't the person he was expecting as he looked up to see Vinny looming over him. Josh gawked at the giant man's body for a second as he was shirtless, showing off his impressively muscled frame. He also seemed to be wearing a similar pair of sweatpants that Brody had, except with the number 10 instead. Vinny seemed a lot less modest however about letting his pants hang low as his black and red pair of underarmors were in full view down halfway past his enormous ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny?!\" Josh exclaimed as he backed away from the giant man slightly. \"Where's Brody?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act so surprised, tiny bro.\" Vinny said while putting his hands on his hips. \"He left for work. Said he wanted to leave you here and give you a day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe Brody would just leave him here like this! Especially alone with Vinny! \"No, I want to go to the park. Please Vinny, just take me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny crouched down putting his massive chest at about Josh's eye level. \"No can do tiny bro. Brody told me you're staying here with me for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to sweat. Brody had no idea what he's just done to him. He sighed as he now regrets not telling Brody about his distaste for Vinny. Vinny meanwhile started to notice Josh's discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, look. I think yesterday we started off on the wrong foot. I didn't mean to be so pushy to you, tiny bro.\" Vinny said with a fairly genuine look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to eat me, then threatened to kill me if I told anyone...\" Josh said, crossing his arms and trying to to play out the situation in his favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna lie, bro. Still kinda wanna eat you.\" Vinny said with a smirk. \"But I didn't mean to push you or threaten you. Besides I've been here this whole time you were sleeping. Could've easily pulled something then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. He was right after all, he could have easily not woken up this morning if Vinny had no self control. So at least there's that to be grateful for. \"Alright fine, I guess you got me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny stood up and stretched his arms out to his sides. \"See? Vinny isn't such a bad guy after all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head and laughed as suddenly he found the tissue he had been sleeping on get picked up. Josh watched as Vinny carefully lifted the makeshift bed up to stomach level and hold it in front of him. Josh blushed a little as he looked back at the wall of muscle that was Vinny's abs right beside him. Meanwhile, Vinny made his way out of Brody's room and down the stairs toward the kitchen. Finally, Vinny placed the tissue on the table and stood before Josh once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did Brody convince you to baby sit me today anyway?\" Josh asked. Curious if Brody did in fact have to pull any strings to get Vinny to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the day off, bro. I work in construction and our project just finished yesterday. So I thought it would be cool to spend some time with my tiny bro today!\" Vinny said happily as he turned away to go over to the refrigerator. Josh couldn't help but stare at Vinny's ass as he turned around. His sweatpants were doing little to nothing to hide his underwear clad butt as Josh could see each subtle bounce and flex his ass made with his compression shorts hugging his perfectly round ass tightly. Staring the whole time as Vinny grabbed a soda out of the fridge  before he quickly turned around. Josh averted his gaze but not before he was pretty sure he was caught staring. Josh tried to focus his attention elsewhere, such as the clock that read 12:07 pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I slept that late?!\" Josh thought to himself as Vinny approached him with an arrogant smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you checking out my glutes?\" Vinny said as he set down his drink next to Josh and loomed over him with his massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just...\" Josh tried to think as he looked up at the giant man. \"I...\"               </span></div></div>",

I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry tiny bro. I didn't know you had any interest in my ass.\" Vinny said turning his body to position his enormous butt directly in front of Josh. Josh stared directly at the two round cheeks. Vinny's black and red underwear tightly wrapped them perfectly showing off their flawless shape. Vinny quickly turned again, facing josh with the front of his sweatpants once more as he leaned down with an almost friendly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, tiny bro. You could be a little explorer while I chill and play some Madden.\" Vinny tempted with a soft sounding voice. \"You don't think I forgot our little talk did you? I know you like the thrill of adventure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned red as he looked down at the ground. He'd be lying if he said he didn't want to explore Vinny's massive glutes while he laid there casually playing a video game. Josh let out a deep breath, figuring there was no denying it. \"You're right I do. Plus it should be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smirked as he lowered his hand to allow Josh aboard. With his free hand he grabbed his soda and the pair walked out into the living room. It was the same room Josh fell asleep in the night before with Brody, in fact. Vinny strode out in front of the tv and set his can of soda down on the ground. Next the shirtless stud grabbed a pillow from the sofa and tossed it on the floor near his soda. Finally, he grabbed a near by Xbox controller and clicked open a cabinet revealing the slick gaming system. Turning on the tv, Vinny strode his way toward the pillow and slowly lowered himself to lay on his stomach with the pillow to support him. after making himself comfortable, with his free hand Vinny reached down to his sweatpants and pulled the navy blue elastic all the way down past his tightly clothed butt. Looking down at Josh, he simply gave the little man a nod as he brought him down to his backside, plopping him down directly between his mountainous cheeks. Turning his attention forward, Vinny powered on his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked to his right and left and all he could see was black with an occasional red highlight for as far as the eye could see. There was a slight pungent smell coming from directly below him, Josh guess Vinny must have not showered yet today. But the musky scent made Josh all the more excited as he started to scale up the side of the slick surface of the compression shorts. Josh climbed the smelly muscled surface as well as he could, hoping to catch a view of Vinny's glorious butt crack from the side. Finally reaching the top, Josh admired his progress as Vinny's musk enveloped him completely. Sweating, he couldn't believe the effort it took to make his way out of that gigantic canyon below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything shifted slightly as Josh found himself tumbling back down into the sweat gorge he just worked so hard to climb out of. Laying on his back, Josh watched as if in slow motion Vinny's butt cheeks started to slowly clench together. Josh screamed as the tense muscle started to slowly envelope him. Josh laid motionless as he opened his eyes only to see black. It was very tight and hard to breath, but it seemed like he was ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Touchdown!\" Vinny called as his cheeks started to unclench. Josh quickly made his way out of the lowest part of canyon as he worked up, toward Vinny's back. Sighing, Josh made it to the edge of the underwear and looked down to see the arc of Vinny's butt being partially exposed. Josh rubbed his chin for a second, he could easily squeeze under Vinny's compression shorts and be even closer to his immaculate ass. Josh prepared to lower himself into the gap in Vinny's compression shorts and...         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh jumped in surprise as he saw Vinny's body slightly contorted to see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Vinny! How's your game?\" Josh asked nervously as he tried not to look too conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, bro. Hey I noticed after I ran that ball I might've been clenching my ass a bit. You ok?\" Vinny asked, genuinely concerned. Josh stared at the giant man's face. He couldn't believe he was actually showing concern for him like that. After what the two of them have been through Josh couldn't help but smile as he grew a new appreciation for Vinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trapped me pretty good, but I'm ok.\" Josh said turning a little red as the giant man smiled at him. Suddenly, Vinny reached down and quickly pinched tiny Josh between his fingers and transported him to the floor in front of him. Vinny crossed his arms and rested his chin on one of his hands as he observed the tiny man closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\"m glad to hear it, tiny bro.\" Vinny said with a decent sized grin across his handsome face. Josh stood nervously in front of Vinny's massive face and laughed causally as he rubbed the back of his neck. This was the closest he's been to Vinny's face before and he really couldn't help but take in Vinny's attractive features, complete with his sharp blue eyes and slight stubble strewn across his rugged looking chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny bro?\" Vinny asked with an upward inflection. Indicating it was a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Josh responded as he continued to take his Vinny's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hate me for this, but Brod said your name once. Then after that all he did was call you boss.\" Vinny started to say as he shifted slightly on his stomach. \"I forgot your name, tiny bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he put a hand on his stomach. Much to Vinny's annoyance he reached out a finger and purposefully whiffed a playful poke at the tiny man. \"It's Josh. You can call me Josh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny grinned, glad to finally know the little man's name in more than just passing. \"Probably still gonna call you \"tiny bro\" though, Josh.\" he said with a toothy smile showing off his perfect white smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you can remember with that tiny brain of yours!\" Josh jabbed at the giant playfully. Vinny laughed, causing Josh to fall off his feet from the sudden gusts of air coming from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking, pint sized!\" Vinny said perking up one of his eye brows as he watched Josh struggle to get to his feet. Standing up Josh smirked at the arrogant giant. \"I was thinking, tiny bro. You should take a week off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week off? For what?\" Josh asked, puzzled by the sudden proclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To spend with me, of course.\" Vinny grinned as he tilted his head to one side. Josh scratched his head. It was true, he really did feel like he was connecting with Vinny, not to mention it would be nice to have some time off. Josh shook his head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think that sounds great. Where would we go?\" Josh asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smiled as he opened his mouth to answer...          </span></div></div>",

Sure his ass was an incredible journey, but now Vinny was offering up his entire body for Josh to vacation on? Josh scratched his cheek, thinking that Vinny must really be starting to like him if he's offering to give him such a unique vacation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you have my attention. Where does the vacation start?\" Josh asked eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny waved his hands quickly, trying to get Josh to slow down. \"Whoa tiny bro. I know you can't wait to start chilling on his paradise island, but we gotta make sure you tell Brod first. He probably wouldn't believe it if it came from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head in agreement and Vinny lowered his hand, allowing Josh to get on the gigantic surface. Vinny stood up quickly as Josh watched most of his body rush by, making him a little light headed in the process. Reaching into his pocket Vinny pulled out a smart phone and pulled up Brody's contact, calling the number. Raising the phone to his ear, Vinny nodded to Josh as he heard Brody answer the phone. Josh listened carefully as he barely heard Brody's voice asking how he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing good, bro. But he wants to tell you something. Here, I'll put the mic right up next to him.\" Vinny said as he lowered the phone to his other hand, right next to Josh. Looking at the hole he suspected was the mic Josh spoke as loudly and clearly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody can you hear me?\" Josh asked the enormous phone looming over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro. What's good?\" Brody's voice replied a large distance above him from the speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take the week off. Vinny came up with a cool vacation idea and I really think I could use the time off. Could you just let Tyler know he's in charge?\" Josh asked politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he's gonna think you're hiding from him, because of the pranks? Right bro?\" Brody's voice called back. Josh shook his head, he had actually completely forgotten about that silly prank war! Regardless, he just wanted the time off at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell the idiot he won. That should satisfy him.\" Josh replied back, putting a palm to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, have fun boss.\" Brody quickly answered as he hung up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny moved the phone out of hand with a smile. Putting back in his sweat pant's pocket he looked back at Josh again. \"Gonna be a fun week, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled brightly as he looked up at the handsome lax bro. Vinny really did seem genuine after all. Josh was confident than Vinny must be past this whole treating him like a toy thing. Watching as Vinny walked out of the room and into the kitchen Josh noticed the giant man searching through a drawer. Finding a roll of tape, Vinny sat down at a chair by the kitchen table and propped up one of his feet. Taking a small piece of tape, he handed it to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that nice and good around your body, tiny bro.\" Vinny said with a grin. Trusting Vinny, Josh pressed the sticky tape directly to his body and waited as Vinny pinched him up and brought him over to his foot. Josh started to sweat nervously as Vinny pressed his frail body just below the big toe, sticking him in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny moved his foot off the table, and back to the ground and slowly stood up. Making sure he wasn't actually crushing the tiny man under his unwashed feet, Vinny relaxed as he felt faint squirms as he set down his foot on his full weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First stop on Vinny Island! My foot!\" Vinny called down to the tiny man struggling under his toe. He laughed to himself that the little man was so eager to let him spend a week doing whatever he wanted with him! Stretching his arms, Vinny walked out of the room, determined to give the tiny man his fill of feet on his first day of vacation. Looking outside a window, Vinny noticed it was a nice sunny day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could go for a jog...\" Vinny thought looking down at his feet. Near his feet, however he looked at his sweatpants, remembering how much he didn't want to get out of his comfy clothes and just have a lazy day, Vinny thought maybe he could just prop up his feet and mess with his little \"friend\" that way instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a decision, Vinny figured he'd...          </span></div></div>",

Josh looks back towards Vinny's head, but the man is completely involved with the game. So Josh takes a deep breath and crawls in to the small opening in the cave. The first thing he notices is how hot it is. The walls are slightly moist and the smell is a lot stronger in here then on the outside. After a few steps you feel the earth shake and you look back to the opening. You're completely shocked as you see it getting smaller. Then you notice the tip of Vinny's finger on the elastic as he pulls the band up to his waste and makes it snap shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear him laugh on the outside. And he says, \"Bad move going in there tiny bro. I call it my cave of no return. But tell you what, if you can crawl through all the way I'll let you escape down my leg. Just be carefull, 'cause there's boud to be a few traps along the way.\" You swallow the lump from your throat and figure that you'd better follow his advice. Slowly you crawl forwards. trying to keep yourself from slipping in to deep by stretching your arms and legs as wide as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumbling noise makes you stop for a few seconds as you try to find out what it is. Then a distinct sound fills the cae followed by a rancid smell. You gasp for breath but instead get a lung-full of Vinny's gas. You try to stay conscious and wait for the worst to pass. From the outside you hear Vinny call, \"Carefull tiny bro, there's a gas trap in there somewhere.\" And he laughs. You feel strong enough to continue again. And crawl a bit further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that suddenly the crack doesn't lead up any more but starts to decline. You reach the middle. Going down will be easier you think. However this overconfidence turns out to be your down-fall, literally. As you move along your hand suddenly slips on a moist patch and you fall forward, the cave walls are smooth as you slide down them head first one arm in front of you till suddenly you reach the bottom, but your arm slides into a hole of some kind and is stuck. The moment you reach the whole you hear Vinny utter a soft moan and the walls suddenly close in really tight for a few seconds before relaxing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, tiny bro, I didn't expect you to want to take your dungeneering trip so seriously, you found the heart of my dungeon all right.\" These words fill you with fear, you know where you are and you try to pull your arm out the tight anus, but you can't you actually only manage to pull your upper body farther down. due to your struggles the walls around you close again. as you're pleasuring Vinny it appears.</span></div></div>",

But as help doesn't come you realise you forgot one thing. You're stuck in the ass of a guy who wants to eat you. And you actually voluntarily entered his shorts. This actually doesn't look good. From the outside you hear a bell ring and your world shakes, quakes and compresses around you as Vinny gets up. This sudden move presses you deeper into his crack till your smeared against the skin, wedged deep between his moutainous glutes. One of your arms still stuck in his sphincter and your face pressing against it. As Vinny starts walking you feel the cheeks roll around grinding you down deeper and swaying you from the left to the right with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the door and you hear him greet a guy named Jake, not someone you know. Apparantly he invited Jake to come over for a day of gaming, which he forgot to tell you about when he woke you up. You hear Jake jokingly say that if Vinny wants to play he'd better put on some clothes first. The two of them move inside and seperate as Jake goes into the livingroom and Vinny goes into his bedroom. Suddenly you hear Vinny whisper to you. \"guess what tiny bro, you're in luck. Seeing as you like my glutes so much you get to spent the rest of the day in there. I just hope I don't forget to get you out after Jake leaves. But guess what, now that I where you've been, I don't think I'd like to eat you anymore. Besides you feel really good down there tiny bro.\" Suddenly it becomes darker as he pulls up a pair of pants and soon he starts moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel flattened with every step you let out a sigh of relief as Vinny finally stops walking, a bit too soon as suddenly you feel that he's sitting down. His cheeks clench together around you and effectively lock you in like a straight-jacket, Your face pressed against his smelly unwashed anus. From the outside you hear the guys talk about the games and shout at each other. Every point Vinny scores is pure torture for you as he jumps up and down a little. Putting a lot of strain on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever the two guys finally get up and Vinny shows Jake to the door. As the door closes you feel Vinny walk back in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess what Brody just texted me he's spending the noght out. So it's just you and me tonight. I told him I was doing a great babysitting job. But now I'm gonna go to bed.\" Great Josh thinks, he's finally gonna get me out. However as Vinny keeps moving he suddenly sits down and Josh feels him lying down. \"Tight night, tiny bro, I'm so happy right now I didn't eat you. You feel a whole lot better down there than you would have in my stomach.\" josh heasr the rustling of the blankets and it starts to get even hotter than before. No he isn't, Josh thinks to himself, but after a few minutes you notice his breathing slowing down and even later he starts snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine you think, so he's sleeping Josh thinks to himself as his surrounding start to become more humid. And the smell starts to make him queasy. Josh realises this could actually be a good thing. Josh softly tries to wiggle his arm and notices that the muscle of Vinny's anus is a little less tight. However as the arm moves it reacts and squeezes a bit tighter again. If I wait a little longer I might be able to pull free after all, Josh thinks. A few more tries end without succes. but Josh is dedicated to come out of this eventually. All of a Sudden Vinny turns over on his stomach and at the same time Josh gives a strong pull on his arm and it slips loose. Freedom, he thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I should wait till he turns over again and use gravity to slip out to the shorts and crawl along them out of here. Josh thinks it's a pretty good plan untill suddenly the anus twitches a little and with a loud explosion Vinny farts right in Joshes face. The stench is unbelievable and Josh can't breath. He tries his best to stay conscious he needs to get out.</span></div></div>",

He faints right between the ass-cheeks of the monstrous Vinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh has no idea how long he's been out, but as he wakes he actually feels quite refreshed. He feels warm and even though he suddenly realises he's still stuck in Vinny's ass, he notices the cheeky flesh is even more relaxing and form-fitting than memory foam. As he feels around he notices Vinny has turned to his side, Because there's a muscled dent in the wall to his left. And to the right the wall simply closes. This position makes the cheeks rest upon each other, but apparantly leaves a small cavern right next to Vinny's hole. Josh feels upwards and downwards and notices he is actually trapped in a small fold cave with no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though this is very dark  and still smells strongly of Vinny's farts and sweat, Josh isn't really terrified. Yes he'd rather not be here. And he really hopes Vinny turns soon. Slowly waiting for something to happen Josh starts to feel sleepy. Being passed out apparantly isn't the same as taking a nap. And before Vinny turns he does fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wakes up as the world sees to end, everything shakes, quakes, tightens and moves.

The space he is in is still tight, however there's a little more wiggle-room. You hear Vinny let out a sigh from above and suddenly he says: \"Kick me once for yes and twice for no.\" a few seconds pass, \"you still alive?\" Josh kicks once. Vinny giggles. \"Ah, good. I hoped as much. I guess you're in luck that my ass is tight and the compression short kept you from sliding out. Don't you agree.\" Josh kicks once. Apparantly there's no more questions for now as Josh hears the TV getting turned on. All he hears are sounds of cartoons and crunching as if Vinny is eating something. After a while he suddenly leans to the right and a sliver of light enters Josh's prison as Vinny's hand moves in to get him. Scooping him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Josh is free from the dank prison he gulpes in a few breaths of fresh air as Vinny takes him up to his face and a wide grin welcomes you. \"You look fine, tiny bro.\" He places a piece of cornflake on his palm and Josh grabs hold and starts eating. Soon he is satisfied and looks back up at Vinny who has been eyeing him the whole time. \"Good, see, I'm not a bad guy, I fed you, Tiny bro. Can't have you starve to death.\" Josh smiles at Vinny, \"Thanks, I needed that.\" Vinny grins. \"Need to keep up your strength. Because tiny bro, I think you're gonna need it if you wanna survive down there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gasps, \"What do you mean?\" Vinny smiles, \"Well, tiny bro, now that you've been in my ass, I'm not gonna eat you any more. So there's probably only one use I'm gonna get out of you and that's keeping you back down there. Don't worry, you'll learn to love it. I know I do. Having something squirming in my butt feels good. And I know you like my butt. So it's a win-win.\" Without waiting for your response Vinny closes his hand on Josh and lowers him back down. When the hand opens Josh sees the dark abyss of Vinny's crack hover over him agains and the hand gently but firmly presses him op in it. Josh treis to scream and squirm but Vinny presses him in deeper and suddenly pulls his hand back and the compression short close with a snap. Vinny rolls back down and Josh is trapped once again in the massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above Vinny starts to talk again. \"You know what Tiny bro, these short are made of a nicely breathing bamboo fibre. It'll let in enough oxygen for you to keep going and I can even shower while wearing them, they almost dry instantly. Just imagine. I only have to take them off to go to the bathroom. And you only need to get out to be fed. The rest of our lives you can just live in there. Dosn't that sound wonderfull?\" Josh tries to kick Vinny twice, but he only gets off one. \"Wow, tiny bro, that makes me happy to know you like it in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm hungry how about you?\" Josh said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starved, tiny bro\" Vinny said putting a hand on his stomach and rubbing it for the added effect. Josh couldn't help but to blush as he was reminded about Vinny's tempting offer from yesterday. \"I've got some burger meat, I'll grill us up some Vinny burgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh chuckled to himself that Vinny named a burger after himself, but it was still charming to say the least. Vinny took a chug from his soda and went back over to the refrigerator. Opening it up, he pulled out two pre-made burger patties and put them on a plate. Next he reached under the counter in one of the drawers and located a spatula.  Finally, the giant man walked out the back door with his ingredients and utensils and disappeared from Josh's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Vinny reappeared at the door to the kitchen with an empty plate. He quickly strode over to the sink and dropped the plate in it an cleaned it off with some warm water. Next, Josh watched as the giant man pulled out all sorts of condiments and a pack of buns and laid them carefully out on the kitchen counter. Finally, the giant man slowly came over to approach Josh as he grabbed his soda once more, taking another long gulp from the fizzy drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuurp! Ahhh, just a few more minutes there tiny bro.\" Vinny exclaimed as he rubbed his gut and placed his can back down on the kitchen table. Josh turned a little red as Vinny belched before as he looked down at him. Shaking any thoughts from his mind, Josh watched as Vinny left the kitchen once more to grab the burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the clock once more. The digital clock read 12:24. So he figured the burgers just have to be done by now. Almost as if on cue, Vinny reappeared at the door holding the plate with two freshly cooked burgers on them and walked them over to the kitchen counter. Josh watched as the huge stud started to add all kinds of toppings and sauces to the burgers. The smell that wafted over was absolutely out of this world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we have it!\" Vinny said placing the plate down in front of himself as he took a seat near Josh. \"Two Vinny burgers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh applauded as he walked over to the plate, but not before being stopped. Vinny pulled off a tiny piece of meat off the burger and squished it right in front of Josh. Josh looked down at the pathetic piece of meat, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't one of those for me?\" Josh asked politely looking up at the gigantic lax bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What so you can crawl around in it, bro? That would be a waste of my skills.\" Vinny said as he took a huge bite out of one of his burgers, chewing it thoroughly before he swallowed. \"Guess you're missing out though, this is some top shit bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed his arms. \"I don't want to miss out though. Come on Vinny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny took a drink from his soda and gave off a sigh. \"Not unless you want me to eat it while you're on it, tiny bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the huge burger as his mouth watered... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Vinny put up a finger as he chewed, indicating to Josh to give him a second. The massive lax bro took his time as he chewed the bite well before swallowing it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally got to you didn't I, tiny bro?\" Vinny said with a bright new smile. Josh simply shrugged his shoulders and sighed at the comment. \"Don't deny it little man!\" He added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't deny anything.\" Josh started to say as he walked closer to the burger. \"I suppose I did just need time to think about it though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smirked as he set down his burger. He really was hoping it would come down to something like this! \"Just so we're clear, tiny bro, you do remember this is a one way trip right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. A little nervous, he did know it would mean his end. But something about Vinny really did reach out to him, practically driving him to want to consumed by the arrogant jock. Josh watched as Vinny quickly removed the top bun of the second burger, revealing the greasy toppings and delicious smelling cheese underneath. Josh flinched a little when suddenly Vinny's forefinger came crashing down in front of him, welcoming him aboard. Eagerly, Josh climbed up the tip of the finger as Vinny transported him up and over to the now open burger. The immaculate smell of the food started to really wash over Josh as he closed his eyes and breathed in deep. Vinny simply turned his finger over and let Josh fall into the intense aroma of the burger. Landing with a splat in some sort of sauce, Josh really started to take in the taste of the burger as well as the slippery grease of the messy food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny watched as Josh started to enjoy himself in the bliss of the burger, but also in the meantime grabbed the one he was still working on and took another huge bite. After swallowing the food down he only had a single bite left for the first half of his meal, so he simply tossed the morsel in his mouth and finished it off. Grabbing his can of soda, he took a hefty sip and rubbed his stomach. He definitely had room for more, and this time he was happy to see he'd have an extra little something on his burger. Rubbing his hands together, he figured it was time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck tiny bro. Try to avoid my teeth or whatever.\" Vinny said as he took the bun and covered it over the burger, not even giving Josh time to respond or reconsider.  Josh however didn't care either way. He was totally prepared and waiting in anticipation to be eaten by the gigantic stud. Squirming his way forward, Josh hoped maybe he could make it in the first bite, but he figured Vinny was going to avoid him on purpose at first, given his nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRows of giant white teeth suddenly came slicing through the burger, mere inches in from of where Josh redeposited himself to. Josh's heart started to race as he nearly had been scooped up in the first bite. Inching forward even more, Josh somehow managed to poke his head just outside the burger in time to watch Vinny swallow the first bite down with a deafening gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his food, Vinny smirked for a second. Sure enough poking out of his food was the tiny man he was about to consume with it. Vinny simply raised his forefinger and pushed the little man back inside. Taking his finger, he put it in his mouth and sucked off the juices from the tasty burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny bro, don't be so antsy!\" Vinny said as he held the burger tightly in the hands. Turning the burger to a different side, he figured he'd torture the impatient man a little by eating around him a little more. After a few bites all that remained was only small morsel, ready to be popped into Vinny's cavernous mouth and processed in his gut. Out of curiosity, Vinny peeled the bun off slightly only to catch a glimpse of a tiny wriggling passenger trapped in the meaty mess. Replacing the bun, Vinny popped the bite of food in his mouth and started to slowly chew. Knowing he's sealed the tiny man's fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally broke free of the sticky cheese holding him in place. Vinny holding the burger so tightly caused him to get stuck, but luckily he was able to break free just as a massive building sized molar came crashing down right where he was just positioned. Josh sighed in relief as he found himself in the middle of the tongue as he watched Vinny's massive teeth started to break down the burger he was just on. Squinting in the darkness, Josh barely could react as the now masticated goo of burger came sliding down on top of him. Somehow, Josh considered himself lucky as he managed to avoid being trapped beneath, but rather stuck to the side like an unchewed piece of meat. Turning, Josh watched as Vinny's massive tongue started to rise, preparing to swallow it's food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh barely got a glance of Vinny's huge uvula as the massive blob of food slicked it's way through Vinny's saliva to the back of the throat, before disappearing completely down the esophagus. Josh closed his eyes and tried to listen to Vinny's rhythmic heart beat as he emerged deeper and deeper in the pitch black darkness. After a few seconds Josh reopened his eyes as a squelching noise signaled the opening of the sphincter leading to the stomach. With a wet plop, Josh and the glop of food he was in dropped directly into Vinny's humid stomach. Wiping various liquids from his face, Josh tried to view his new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting through the dark, Josh was able to make out the walls of Vinny's enormous stomach. He watched as the rippled walls contracted and churned its meal. A meal Josh happily became a part of. Smiling to himself, he laid back in the chewed mush of food that brought him to his new home. Closing his eyes he listened the various groans and growls emanating from the depths of Vinny's impossibly large body. There was a slight change in pressure in the chamber as the walls closed in slightly, followed by a distant sounding burp coming from far above Josh's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he enjoyed his Vinny burger.\" Josh thought to himself as he saw himself as some sort of super secret ingredient in the meal. Judging by the rubs and shifts form the walls of the stomach, Josh figured the giant jock must have enjoyed it as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in there somewhere.\" Vinny said to himself as he gave his gut a good rub. He tired to imagine for a second if the little man made it down whole, or if he pulverized the little squirt with his teeth. Standing up, he grabbed his plate and brought it over to the sink. \"Doesn't matter either way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing off his plate the giant lax bro quickly forgot about the meal stewing away in his gut. But rather he tried to think about other more important things like what he was doing for the rest of the day and eventually come up with some half-assed lie about how he lost the little guy when Brody gets home. <br>\r\n                    </span></div></div>",

As much as he likes the comfort Vinny has presented as opposed to wading across Brody's sweaty body, his roommate is just too new for him to place his trust. \"I'll be fine here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny shrugs. \"Suit yourself, bro.\" He walks away from Josh's view though the back door to the house. It takes a while, but he returns with a can of something - hard for the tiny man to discern since his hand obscures the label. He heads for the shade of the umbrella as a loud crack signals the opening of his drink. Josh watches him relax, slouching in the outdoor chair as he sips again and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turns his attention back at Brody. Now on top of his left pec, he has a good view of the big guy. His eyes are still shut and his mouth hangs open as he snores. His tongue rattles with each snore. He can even see Brody's uvula in the back of his throat, which vibrates on its feeble perch in the back of his mouth. He still covers his ears the whole time in desperation to drown out the noise, but all this snoring isn't just loud. Brody's pecs vibrate up and down, forming a miniature muscle earthquake with each breath in and out. Josh falls over onto the surface, which is not as sweaty as his abs. But when his ear hits the skin, he hears something else besides Brody's lungs hard at work. He can hear and feel a low, but very powerful rhythmic pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Josh says to himself. \"I'm above Brody's heart!\" He's not a doctor, but the big guy heart sounds strong and healthy to him - strong like Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground quakes again. This time, the snoring falls silent. The entire Brody-scape flips completely to an incline. Above him, the giant stirs. He stretches off his sleepiness and unleashes an epic yawn. It's as if the entire world for tiny Josh came to life. Gravity takes over and beads of sweat start flowing like little streams off of his skin. From his face and neck down to his chest, the streams become rivers. It's too slick for Josh's little hands to grip the surface of Brody's pecs and now he succumbs to the downward slide of his sweat beads...</span></div></div>",

Now at his pecs, they fan outwards along the muscle curvature and get funneled in the gaps between the muscle masses. For tiny Josh, he faces a waterfall. A large drop of sweat hits him in the face. He tries to ignore it - the heat from Brody's body and the saltiness lingering in his mouth and nose. But the drop hasn't finished its encounter with the tiny man. It still has some ways to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's hands lose their grip in the falls and now he surrenders to the sweat stream and its journey down the Brody-scape. It sweeps along from Josh's hold to the very bottom of Brody's left pec. Now more streams merge with it and funnels down from his topmost abs into the valley between the muscle mountains. The current is now too strong for him to oppose as he struggles to grab hold of something. He gets carried by gravity and the current to a large pit, where the sweat waterfall slows its pace and force. Now Josh can grab hold of a wrinkled, fleshy surface. Above him, tall stalks of hair surround the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat that Brody had covering his body while he slept in the sun has carried Josh from his pec down to his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit,\" thinks Josh. He tried to avoid this spot from the beginning. Now he is smack dab in the pit, sheltered under the canopy of tangled black hair. Around him, the landscape is littered with large soggy mounds of dead skin. \"Well, I guess I didn't expect him to wash this area that well.\" At the very bottom, Josh can feel the organs beneath the flesh - Brody's digestive tract hard at work. The rumbling forms small tremors as food gets its final treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the tremors worsen as Brody's navel turns from pit to cave. \"The big guy must've gotten up on his feet again,\" Josh hopes Brody is looking for him, even if he's now just a speck inside his belly button...</span></div></div>",

Satisfied from his excellent nap the muscled lifeguard walked straight inside and and into the kitchen. Looking down at his body he could tell he was absolutely drenched in sweat. Laying out in the sun so long certainly did open his pours as he rubbed his hand down his chest and across his abs, inches away from where his tiny boss laid trapped in his belly button. Still a little groggy, Brody decided to reach into his refrigerator and grab a soda. Popping open the can, the gargantuan man figured the caffeinated beverage would do nicely to wake him up after his long nap. Pressing the can to his lips, Brody took a nice long slurp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" Brody stood there refreshed from the cool carbonated drink. The attractive man turned around and started to head for the stairs, leading up to his room. All the while he bobbed up and down up the stairs while taking a periodic sip from his soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was starting to feel motion sick from the lurching up and down. Brody really has forgotten he was on his body and seems like he's just going about his business now! Josh tried to sit at the back of the dirty naval, hoping Brody would remember him at some point before he vomits from the sweaty stench and constant movement. All the while Josh's only only distraction was loud gulping noised followed by a fizzy burgle coming from Brody's gut. The groans and gurgles were certainly unsettling, but Josh figured if he just closed his eyes and listened to the sound it might settle his own upset stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody made his way to the top of the stair and finally turned to enter his room. The large bedroom wasn't that untidy. A few pairs of socks and some dirty underwear laying about, but otherwise it was mostly clean. Either way, Brody walked over to his night stand next to his bed and set down his drink. The gigantic man yawned as he looked pit the window, looking out the front of the house into the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for a run right about now.\" Brody said to himself, rubbing his stomach as it seemingly felt much less full as most of the food had been digested while he was napping. As he pulled his hand away he noticed it covered in sweat. Frowning, he rubbed his hand on his swim shorts trying to get the greasy sweat off of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just take a shower instead...\" Brody thought as he looked down at at his insanely sweaty body. Thinking for a second, the massive man decided to...          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"CANNON BAAAAALLLL!\" Vinny shouted as he ran past Brody and Josh to jump into the pool with a triumphant splash. Brody jerked awake, nearly falling out of his chair as a mass of water flew out of the pool and landed on him. Sitting up Brody yelled to his buddy. \"Dude! What the hell? You just soaked me bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny laughed as he swam in place. \"Whatever man! It's hot! I think you're fine bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shook his head and laid back down, closing his eyes once more. Little did he know the splash of water and his subtle movements caused his boss to find himself in a precarious situation. Off to the side of the chair, Josh found himself washed off Brody's stomach and next to his side barely clinging on to the chair itself. Luckily he was able to pull himself up beside Brody, but looking up at the massive man's side he realized he would be in for quite the climb to make it back to where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Josh said as he examined the soaked skin he somehow had to climb. Sighing, Josh figured he'd at least have to wait for Brody's abdomen to dry off a little before he could attempt the climb. In the meantime Josh looked up and down the side of Brody's body. Like a massive fleshy wall it seemed to span for miles until it ended at the soft red fabric of Brody's board shorts. Feeling curious Josh started to walk down toward the board shorts. Being that it was closer than Brody's head, he figured it was worth a little exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slowly worked his way down beside Brody's massive ass and he couldn't help but take in it's perfect bubble shape as it rested so casually on the fabric of the lounge chair. Upon closer examination Josh noticed a fair amount of Brody's underwear sticking out toward his butt. It was a sort of grey color and seemed very slick to touch. \"Some sort of compression shorts? Under armor maybe? Makes sense he's an athlete after all.\" Josh thought to himself as he rubbed his hand against the cloth, feeling the solid muscle of Brody's glutes on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody finally felt his body seem to dry off a little, but the sweat did make him hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll go for a swim too.\" He thought to himself with his eyes still closed. slowly he took off his sunglasses and squinted as he lifted his head up a little. Looking down his torso he examined his abs closely for the tiny speck of a man. \"Boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response came as he started to look further down on his shorts, then as best as he can on his own chest and arms. Panicking a little he lifted himself up on one side and looked on the edge of his abdomen before lowering himself back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gasped as the sudden shift in Brody's body caused him to tumble under the shadow of the giant man's massive ass. Josh watched in terror as all he could see is the round cheek with underwear partially exposed clung tightly around Brody's butt slowly came down. Pressing Josh under all its weight against the lounge chair. Thankfully, the chair was a little slack, otherwise he would have been crushed to a pulp right away, but Josh squirmed barely able to move or breath under the lax bro's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air, Josh tried his best to create any kind of movement. Barely able to think all he could do was hope that Brody would get up and save him before it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny!\" Brody called out to his buddy in the pool. \"You gotta help me find Josh! I think he ended up somewhere after you splashed me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny sighed, hoping Brody couldn't possibly be serious. \"Really dude? You're gonna make me get out of the pool just to check your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just get out and check. I'm trying to sit still here.\" Brody called to his friend. Hoping he could just find his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny shrugged and replied... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Making sure every part of him was mostly dry he stretched up his arms and rubbed his bare abs. Letting his arms down he set the towel back on the table and started to walk over to his motionless buddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful dude. He might have fallen off the chair too!\" Brody said as Vinny stopped in his tracks a few feet away. A little more annoyed now Vinny took each step, half-assedly looking at the floor as he went. \"It's not that I don't care about the little guy...\" He thought to himself. \"I just wish Brody didn't have to be such a little bitch about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it it Brody's side, Vinny knelt down beside him and started examining his friend's body thoroughly. From between his treasure trail all the way up to his chest and arm pits, Vinny checked carefully and thoughtfully much to his own displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not on you bro.\" Vinny said as he stood back up and straightened his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, keep checking he's bound to be somewhere.\" Brody said still trying not to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gasped for air less and less as he felt his lungs start to collapse. It was already dark and he couldn't hear anything outside of muffled voices. All he knew was his head was spinning from lack of oxygen and his entire body was numb and broken. There was nothing he could do. Too tired to go on Josh came to terms with his end. Untimely as it was to be crushed under the magnificent ass of one of his workers.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Vinny convinced Brody to get up. Much to his disagreement the hunky lifeguard sat up before carefully turning his Body and standing up next to his buddy. Stuck his right ass cheek on his underwear laid the broken body of his boss. Not that Brody knew as he unconsciously pulled up his shorts, covering his ass. The two continued their search on the chair and around it. Hoping to find any sign of the little man before finally giving up hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bad, Brody went inside. Walking up to his room he pulled off his shorts and underwear before throwing the sweaty clothes into his dirty hamper. As the naked giant left to take a shower he'd never know Josh's body was lost in the mess of sweaty clothes he just contributed to.       </span></div></div>",

In truth it did seem a little dangerous, but he figured it would be good to live a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, bro! I gotta go change!\" Vinny said hoping out of his chair and turning to go upstairs to his room. Josh turned and looked and Brody, who started to stretch his arms up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Brody?\" Josh asked politely as the enormous hunk lowered his arms back down. Brody simply smiled and reached up his swim shorts quickly and pulled something back with a snap against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already wearing compression shorts under these. Just gotta slip some shoes on, bro.\" He said casually as he walked over to a nearby closet and pulled out a worn looking pair of running shoes. Quickly pulling on his shoes, Brody stood up as he heard Vinny pounding down the stairs. Josh looked at the huge man as he reappeared. He was wearing a tight white spandex shirt, which was barely hiding Vinny's impressive muscular physique. On his legs he merely wore a pair of black compression shorts, the tight spandex fit tightly around his legs, bulge and ass, leaving very little to Josh's imagination. Finally, he sported a cleaner looking pair of running shoes, in stark contrast to Brody's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny scratched his head. Looking over at Josh, something finally just dawned on him. \"Yeah... so where do we put him, bro?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shook his head, pretty much knowing this would happen. \"Bro, this is why I thought it was a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could ride in the back of my spandex!\" Vinny said turning his ass and snapping the spandex loudly in Josh's direction. Josh started to sweat, hoping Brody would interject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's disgusting.\" Brody said with an unamused look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill bro, I was only joking.\" Vinny said trying to defend himself. \"He could ride in my collar. We can even grab some tape or something to keep him in place, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked over at Josh, waiting for Josh's reaction. Josh piped up, figured it was better than Vinny's first idea. \"Yeah that works. I'll make sure to hold on tight too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny smiled as he reached down to Josh, carefully pinching the little man before bringing him up to his chest. Slowly, Vinny pulled his collar out, allowing Josh to grab the front of the stretchy material while letting his legs hang down toward the inside. Carefully, Vinny pulled the collar back, letting it sit snugly against his lower part of his neck. Josh held on on he felt his legs being pressed up against Vinny's skin, and in truth he felt fairly secure in his new location. Looking out he saw Brody's face, a little concerned for his boss's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Josh smiled at Brody's worried face. \"I'm pretty secure, we don't even need tape!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody nodded before looking back up at Vinny to his face. \"Be careful with him, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny patted his friend on his bare shoulder, Trying to reassure him of his new responsibility. Brody smiled, glad Vinny was treating Josh with such respect even though this is the first time they've met, the circumstances being so usual included. Josh took a deep breath and the pair headed out, ready to jog about outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt the warm sun hit his face as Vinny made his way outside. It was still great weather even though it was a little later in the day. Vinny's body started to bob up and down as Josh knew the jog had officially begun. It didn't seem like he was running very fast, in fact Josh felt the pace to be quite comfortable. Enjoying himself, Josh took in his surroundings, looking at all the nice houses in the pristine neighborhood as well as occasional nice cars that drive by. To his side, Josh saw Brody, starting to drip a little sweat as their pace started to pick up. Looking up, Josh could only make out the scruff of Vinny's chin however he did notices a small amount a sweat starting to form around his position as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held on tight as the run continued. Vinny's sweat was starting to build up a little and the slick liquid did actually make holding on a bit of a challenge. Josh could feel small beads of sweat run down his legs, before disappearing deep down Vinny's tight shirt. Keeping his grip as best he can Josh eventually...           </span></div></div>",

Holding onto the sweaty collar as best he could, Josh was glad to see the pair of men start to slow down and walk toward the enormous house. After unlocking the door, Brody turned quickly, looking and Vinny's collar. Josh Looked at the man's sweating face as he found himself being pinched up and taken out of his holding spot. Now in Brody's glistening palm, Josh looked up at his sweaty torso in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty fun!\" Josh said with a genuine smile as Brody and Vinny looked down at him casually. Josh watched as Vinny started to peel off his tight shirt, and reveal his slick and muscled body underneath. Blushing slightly Josh tried not to stare as the man unintentionally put on a bit of a show. Dropping his shirt to the floor, Vinny started to wipe his chest a bit with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man <i>now</i> I need a shower, bro!\" Vinny said with conviction. Josh simply watched as the handsome man turned away and pounded back up the stairs once more. In the mean time, Josh looked back to Brody, who stood there scratching the back of his neck a bit and inadvertently let his sweat arm pit smell waft toward Josh. Covering his nose quickly, Josh tried not to gag at the intense smell coming from the man's pits. Thankfully, Brody lowered his arm as he walked Josh back into the kitchen and smiled as he let the little man down back down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you had fun, bro by the way.\" Brody said as he sat down in front of Josh. \"I'm just happy I could make up for earlier!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled happily at the huge man. \"I already told you, that was Tyler's fault. You saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody simply grinned before looking up as he heard the sound of the shower stop upstairs. Sure enough a few moments later Vinny reappeared, wearing a pair of well fitted jeans and a black tank top. Sitting down at the table he slipped on a pair of black socks and started to talk to Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Brod?\" Vinny said as he pulled on his second sock. Brody simply looked at him and raised his eye brows, indicating he was listening. Vinny sat up as he finished his statement...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bro, wasn't there something you wanted to ask him, regarding this weekend?\" Vinny asked making sure to lead Brody on to the correct subject. Brody blinked for a second trying to recollect what he was talking about before his face showed he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss!\" Brody said turning and looking and Josh excitedly. Josh looked up at the muscled giant, prepared to answer his question. \"This weekend I thought it would be cool to invite all the guys from the park over for a costume party. You know bro, for Halloween.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded happily. \"Here? That sounds like a great idea! You didn't need my permission for it though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody rubbed his shoulder, blushing and looking away for a second. \"Well Vinny and I just wanted to make sure it was cool with you, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Vinny this time, questioning why they only want to invite guys from the park. \"What about you Vinny, didn't wanna invite any people from your work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny shook his head with a frown. \"Nah, bro. They're all douches. Besides I met most of the guys Brody mentioned he was inviting anyway. I'll get along fine, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to make friends fast anyway.\" Josh said with a bright smile as he looked up at the handsome man. Vinny simply chucked as he sat back and rubbed his chest lazily. Laughing back, Josh turned his attention back to Brody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah it's a costume party, so make sure to come in a costume, bro!\" Brody said as he stood up and looked directly down at his tiny boss. Reaching down Brody laid his hand next to his boss, motioning for him to climb aboard. Without delay, Josh climbed onto the hunks hand and awaited for what was next. \"We gotta get you back to the park, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head. After all it was getting late, and he was certainly looking forward to getting home. Heading to the front door, Josh and Brody prepared to depart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at the party, tiny bro!\" Vinny called out as Brody shut to door behind him. Josh smiled as he waved back at the house. Getting back into Brody's fancy car, Josh couldn't stop his mind from racing with ideas for an awesome costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving back at the park, Josh had Brody fetch a spare key hidden in the park's nearby shed. Making his way over to the break room, Brody opened the door and flicked on the light. Walking across the empty room, he dropped off his minuscule boss on the balcony leading to the park and leaned in to exchange a few words before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell the guys about the party tomorrow, bro.\" Brody said with a delighted grin. \"Thanks again for chilling with me, it was fun, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed happily as he replied, \"Thank you too Brody! And great, I'm looking forward to the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody rubbed the back of his neck as he smiled, but also caught a wiff of his sweat drenched pits this time. Josh covered his nose as the handsome man chuckled. \"I really need a shower, huh bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed as he waved good bye to the muscled giant as he made his way out, locking the door behind him. Happy about how things turned out, Josh headed into the park ready to be regrown and head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went on as normal and soon enough Josh found himself sitting at his desk at the day of the party. Fiddling his thumbs he sat there deep in thought. Laying his head down on his desk he couldn't believe the situation he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do I go as?!\" Josh yelled to himself in the privacy of his office. He had all week to think of a cool costume, and here he was a few hours from closing time and he had nothing. Looking around the room he started to panic, hoping an idea would fall out of the air. Looking his his closet he noticed some spare lifeguard shorts and a tee shirt. Josh quickly closed the door with a sigh. \"The guys will never let me hear the end of it if I go as a lifeguard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to pull at his hair a little as a sudden knock came from the door. \"C-come in!\" Josh yelled as the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been avoiding me long enough!\" A huge voice boomed as Josh turned to see his huge friend come barging into his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh simply sighed and looked up at the tanned hunk confused. \"What are you talking about? I've been here all week, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head in frustration, \"First you hid from me at Brody's, then you side step all my traps all week? I swear it's like you aren't even trying in this prank war anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down, confused still, before recalling what he was talking about. \"Oh right, I forgot that was happening.\" Josh puttered much to Tyler's displeasure. \"Look Ty, I have bigger concerns right now. I still don't have a costume for the party tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler relaxed his shoulders and laughed at his boss's misfortune. \"Real dude? Clock's kinda running out on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he looked away from his idiotic friend for a second. \"Well what are you going as?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler raised a hand and wagged his finger in front of Josh's face. \"It's a surprise. Besides. I've decided to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh almost leap, glad to hear Tyler forgot so easily about the silly prank war to help a friend in need! \"Thank you Ty! I dunno what I'd do with out you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up and quickly under his breath whispered, \"Don't thank me yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Josh asked, not catching Tyler's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just coming up with an idea, dude.\" Tyler said while he walked beside Josh and put his arm down over Josh's shoulder. Needing to squat a bit to be more on Josh's level, Tyler started to brainstorm. \"Ok, bear with me on this. You should go, as a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over to his side, Tyler's face just inches away from his own. \"A bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah with like a little shell and feelers and junk. Here's the best part. You go shrunk.\" Tyler said, pulling Josh even closer to his muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned his face from Tyler's a little skeptical at this point. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down even more Tyler smiled. \"For the prize of course. Didn't Brody tell you best costume gets an awesome prize. Dude's loaded so it's probably something sweet. If you go shrunk you'll have the most authentic costume there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stroked his chin for a second, deep in thought on the idea. It was certainly starting to sound like a pretty solid idea. \"What do I have to lose, let's do it!\" Josh said happily as Tyler stood back up and patted his small friend on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, dude!\" Tyler chuckled slightly as he started to look around the office. Opening up Josh's closet he quickly found the supplies he needed. Josh had an old brown shirt and black shorts stored in the back, which Tyler pulled out and tossed at Josh. Next he found an old circular plastic sled that was used in an experimental downhill water skimming ride. Finally, he located some black and brown colored duct tape. Using what he had, Tyler taped around Josh's front of his body, connecting the sled to Josh's back. Even going as far as to cover the back in duct tape for the added color effect. Finally, using an old black hat and some pencils, he used more of the duct tape to make \"feelers\". Handing the hat to Josh, he tried it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at himself. He was absolutely covered in the duct tape. Reaching toward his back he could not even get his arms very far, but he figured it wouldn't really matter. With a smile he looked at Tyler for support. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave Josh a thumbs up and replied, \"Like a bug!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, happy his costume was coming together. Suddenly however, he found something in his face. Tyler moved forward, holding him still as he started to color on his face using some sort of marker. Closing his eye, Josh couldn't do anything but let his huge friend go to work coloring his face. Tyler stepped away, admiring his work. \"There, now the illusion is complete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his face, the marker seemed to have already mostly dried. \"This isn't permanent is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler fumbled the marker back into his pocket and lied, \"What? Nah dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as his good friend made his way out of his office, promising to pick him up in the break room after work. \"We'll go together, dude!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy he finally had a costume, Josh stood by his desk and continued his work. \"Little inconvenient I can't sit down or take it off...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew by and Josh was on his way to the party. Tyler made Josh swear to keep his eyes closed as he picked him up in the break room so as not to ruin the surprise of his costume. Safely in the palm of his friend's closed fist now however he could only make one determination. \"He's wearing fingerless gloves...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler made his way to Brody's house, excited to himself over the plans he had in store for his tiny friend. Knocking on the door, he was greeted by his co-worker Brody. Tyler looked at him up and down. Smirking to himself he was surprised in the lack of creativity in his costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you just threw on your old lacrosse uniform?\" He said laughing at the man dressed in a jersey, gloves, helmet, gray uniform pants and cleats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? My uniform is slick, bro.\" Brody said, pounding his chest with his thick glove. \"Weren't you bringing Josh with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled to himself as he tightened his fist a tiny bit...            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually dude, he could make it.\" Tyler lied as he held his disguised boss down in his hand. Brody frowned, a little taken aback by Josh's absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's too bad, bro. He seemed like he was looking forward to this.\" Brody said as he walked back inside with Tyler. Tyler simply shrugged as he made his way into the dimmly lit room and scoped it out. Nodding to his fellow co-workers as he made his way in, Tyler quickly located a snack table and sauntered toward it. As inconspicuously as he could, Tyler released his tiny boss on the table, before grabbing a can of soda that was in a cooler under the table. Turning his back to Josh, he made his way off into the party to mingle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around his new environment. Beside him were tall bowls filled with who knows what kinds of food. There was also a clear punch bowl sporting a delicious looking red punch as well as some turned over cups. Crossing his arms however, Josh watched as Tyler quickly ditched him to go socialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't hear him correctly.\" Josh said to himself. Tyler's voice was muffled due to him being stuck in his closed fist, but he could have sworn he heard Brody ask where he was, and he was even more sure he heard Tyler tell him he wasn't coming. Tapping his foot on the table, Josh hoped this was some sort of joke. Sighing, Josh figured in the mean time he could at least check out the party and see all who came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhat dark, but Josh saw Tyler turn and laugh as he joined up with a group of guys. Finally, Josh got a look at Tyler's costume. He actually couldn't help but smile to himself as he looked checked out Tyler's button down blue with green trim shirt, green/lime green trimmed fingerless gloves, as well as a pair of loose looking jeans. Finally, on his head he wore a white and red hat, with an unmistakable emblem on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, are you Ash from pokemon?\" Asked, a person Josh recognized as Vinny. Tyler nodded his head and unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his ripped torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm Ash after he learned to hit some weights!\" Tyler said heartily as he looked up and down at Vinny's costume. Josh wasn't sure if he was anything in particular as he looked at the costume. He was wearing a black warm up jacket and was shirtless underneath. On his legs he had a pair of black tight swimmer's pants that fit perfectly around his well trained ass. He was also barefoot, and as well on his head he had a pair of swimmer's googles propped up on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice bro. I was gonna dress up as a lifeguard to laugh at all your asses, but Brod told me a swimmer would be just as funny.\" Vinny said putting a hand on his hip as he looked down at his body and tight pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lifeguard would have been hilarious if it was you, Vin.\" Tyler said with a laugh. Meanwhile, Brody walked up to the pair still looking a little disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, bro?\" Vinny asked his lacrosse clad friend. Brody simply shrugged and tried to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little disappointing the boss couldn't make it, bro.\" Brody said trying to talk over the music they had playing. Vinny started to look a little disappointed now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny bro isn't coming? That sucks.\" Vinny replied as he crossed his arms. Tyler simply cracked open his soda and took a sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned, it was pretty unmistakable what he heard now. Nobody but Tyler even knew he was here. What's even worse they don't even expect him to show up at all. \"I should try and take off this dumb costume before someone gets the wrong idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tugged at the tape for a few seconds before he realized just how tightly bound the duct tape was. Giving up, Josh tried to remove his hat. Even more unfortunately, Tyler had secured it with a clip in the back to his head and thanks to the massive shell on his back he couldn't reach his arms back there to pull it off. Giving up, Josh sobbed a little to himself. He couldn't believe he was here in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a huge group of four guys walked over to the snack table. Josh nearly screamed as he ran and hid from his employees and he tried to make out who they were. Off the bat Josh recognized two of the giants. First, was the park's resident pretty boy, Brett. Brett is 22 years old and 6'5\" with mid length shaggy brown hair and blue eyes. He was also a pretty solidly built with lean muscle and he sculpted his body extremely well as he often showed off his vintage 8 pack on his long abdomen. Brett also had a tattoo of some Japanese symbols on left pec. \"Courage\" and \"Strength\". Josh looked at the man as he wore a hooded silky looking black robe, showing off his muscled torso and ripped abs, and a pair of red boxing shorts. On both his hands he wore red boxing gloves as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, Josh gawked as he saw the next giant, Blake. He is 21 years old and is 6'7\" with semi curly short black hair and brown eyes. He is very well built and has well defined thick muscles covering his body beneath his costume. He was a very helpful guy, but his biggest flaw was in fact his size. He was pretty clumsy and forgets his own strength a lot. Not to mention he was more of the \"strong silent\" type. His costume was also fairly simple. He wore what looked like a black and red beanie and a tight looking red and black plaid shirt. He also sported a semi tight looking pair of jeans that covered his long legs. In his right hand he held what looked like a plastic ax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least were two other giants pushing each other, seemingly uninterested in removing their masks for snacks right now. They were simply dressed in full body spandex suits of Spiderman and Deadpool. The two looked about the same height, although the one wearing the Spiderman costume looked slightly taller. The difference was more in their builds. The one in the Spiderman costume was clearly a leaner build than the one wearing the Deadpool costume, who's thicker muscled popped out slightly better in the tight spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh cowered as Blake and Brett grabbed plates of food, ready to devour the mass of snacks easily. Brett pulled off his boxing gloves and tied them together and hung them around his neck as he picked out what he wanted. However, he quickly got annoyed by the shoving and giggling going on behind him. \"Matt! You and Luke better cut that shit out or I'll put you both into the ground!\" He yelled as Deadpool was holding Spiderman in a headlock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man.\" The one wearing the Spiderman costume pipped up as Josh recognized the voice as Matt's. Josh realized that made sense for Matt to submit so easily to Brett's demands. He remembered the 22 year old 6'4\" short haired blonde surfer dude getting hired right before Brett and they mentioned they were old high school buddies. Josh watched as Luke however had other plans, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't afraid of you, Bretty-boy.\" The one in the Deadpool costume said as he bumped his chest into Brett's back. Josh couldn't help but laugh a little, Brett and Luke were always going at it with each other. The buzzed blonde haired, 6'3\", 23 year old goofball never really got along with Brett, who constantly tried to belittle the man. Expecting a fight to break out, Josh watched intently as Blake stepped in, nudging Luke back next to Matt without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, big man.\" Luke joked as he put his arm around Matt and the pair trounced off to a different part of the party together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to do that, man. I would've crushed his ass.\" Brett said looking up at Blake. Blake simply smiled as he continued to put food on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys fight too much.\" Blake said finally as they started to walk off together. Josh sighed in relief as the giants walked away. He was glad to see Blake being the voice of reason in that scenario at least. Coming out from hiding, Josh looked out into the party once more. Eyeing Tyler once again, Josh glared a little in his direction as tried to make out who he was talking to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men, Josh immediately recognized as an old underclassman turned employee of his, Markus. Markus is a 21 years old, African-American giant. Standing at 6'9\" he towers over almost everyone in the park. He has a very handsome face, with dark scruff covering his chin, as well as perfect white teeth and an extremely well trained body. Also, he sported an impressive looking tattoo that spanned across his chest onto his shoulder's and biceps of some odd looking pointy pattern. Being a year ahead of Markus, Josh never really knew him up until he started working for him. For his costume, he wore a white towel around his waist and blue and white stripped towel tied around his neck. In his hand, he held a bottle of old-spice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him was another man quite a few inches shorter dressed all in black with a mask. It was a pretty bare bones looking ninja costume, but Josh appreciated it none the less. Josh thought for a second, he figured this final man had to be none other than Ross, the newest recruit. Ross is 20 years old, 6'4\" he has black hair buzzed short. His face seemed to always be covered in stubble along his prominent jaw line, at least from what Josh could recollect when we wasn't wearing a mask. He was a leaner guy, but had very well defined muscles hidden under the shadowy garb he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with making a note of everyone at the party, Josh walked a little more out in the open of the table. Looking around, he nervously thought it was time to try and make contact with someone. As if on cue, Josh watched as...                          </span></div></div>",

Josh stood firm as the huge man set his soda down right next to him with an enormous thud. Tyler bent down, trying to make it look like he dropped something under the table. All the while his attention was actually directed at his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, little buddy?\" Tyler asked with a devilish smile. Josh shook his head angrily at the handsome giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What if someone actually thinks I'm a bug!\" Josh snapped back at Tyler's face with as much force as he could muster. Tyler simply chuckled slightly and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill dude, half of the guys seem drunk off their asses. They probably won't even notice you.\" Tyler said, somewhat reassuringly. Josh shook his head, still nervous at the chance someone discovered him and mistook his identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you lied and told them I wasn't here, you think this is a joke?\" Josh asked, still fuming at his best friend. Tyler simply nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's exactly a joke. Game's still on, dude.\" Tyler said standing up straight and starting to ignore Josh as he took a big gulp out of his soda. Josh looked at Tyler's huge body, dumbfounded. Without warning, Tyler angled his face straight down at the table and let a disgusting sounding belch waft down into Josh's position. Covering his nose and gagging at Tyler's sudden behavior, Josh angrily stamped his feet more. He couldn't believe Tyler did all this because of that stupid prank war! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked as he moved aside and grabbed a plate of food, licking his fingers as he placed several pieces on the foam surface. Josh simply watched angrily as Tyler would occasionally peek in his direction and chuckle to himself. Turning away from the huge man, Josh couldn't bear to see his friend act like such a jerk any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, was that you?\" Vinny called out as he ran up to Tyler and patted the tanned man on the back. \"That was a sick burp, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dude.\" Tyler said with an arrogant smile as he peeked down at Josh's position once more. Vinny simply turned his back to Josh's position, resting his massive ass down on the table. Thanks to the extra weight, the table shifted slightly. Unaware of the shift he just caused Vinny continued to chat with Tyler, continuing to talk to the enormous meat head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your boss say why he couldn't come, bro?\" Vinny asked, hoping to see Josh again after only meeting him for such a short time before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled as he watched the tiny speck start to slide down the table, directly toward Vinny's ass. Turning his attention back to Vinny however, he tried to come up with a lie. \"It's funny dude. He couldn't think of a costume idea so he didn't want to come and be embarrassed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's lame, bro! Nobody would have cared if he didn't have a costume!\" Vinny replied, a bit surprised that was really the reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down Josh tried his best to stop himself as the black clad butt of Vinny loomed ever closer. Sliding down fast and faster Josh realized it was way too late. Bracing himself, Josh slammed face first into Vinny's muscular ass. Looking around, Josh realized he was right in the middle, in the crack of Vinny's butt. Pulling on his legs, he realized they were stuck and by extension, so was he. Pushing off on the rubbery surface of Vinny's swimmer's pants, Josh knew he wasn't going to get unstuck on his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler! Please help!\" Josh called out, knowing it was his only hope to getting unstuck from beneath Vinny's huge ass. However Josh knew the attempt was futile sp he continued to try and dislodge his legs, all the while looking up at Vinny's ass as it loomed menacingly over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking around, Tyler witnessed Josh as he disappeared under Vinny's butt. Chuckling to himself slightly, he tried to imagine how terrified the little man must be. Figuring the situation wasn't too dangerous, Tyler thought it would be more fun to just let it play out. \"Anyway, dude. I'm gonna eat this and head over to Brody's TV. Ross and Brett have Madden going on over there and I wanna watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny simply waved to Tyler as he headed off. Moving his butt off the table, Vinny looked down to see...    </span></div></div>",

Scratching his head, he wondered what Tyler was doing over here before since it almost looked like he was whispering to someone. Shrugging it off, Vinny decided he was imagining things. Looking over at the buffet he and Brody laid out, he figured it was time to indulge himself a little in their hard work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe his bad luck. Not only had his legs been trapped under Vinny's ass, but to top it all off his legs were small enough to fit right through a slightly loose stitch in the pants! Hanging upside down by his legs between Vinny's ass cheeks, Josh started to feel a little dizzy from Vinny's occasional swaying coupled with the blood rushing to his head. Reaching up to his legs, Josh pulled himself up for a moment, trying to level his head a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt either side of Vinny's glutes rise and lower with each step he took. The motion was a little sickening as Josh had to try not to get motion sickness from this wild ride. Thankfully, at one point Josh noticed Vinny stop as he heard something slap down on the ground. Curious, Josh hung back down upside down, trying to get a better look. Suddenly, Josh found Vinny's ass lowering quickly down toward the ground as he squatted down to pick up whatever it was he dropped. As Vinny's cheeks separated slightly, Josh looked down at the floor. Reaching down it seemed to close, until Vinny stood back up quickly. The sudden spread and closing of Vinny's ass caused him to get a slight wedgie as Josh found himself sucked directly in between the muscular butt cheeks. Nothing but his hand stood out as Josh tried desperately to catch his breath in the huge jock's ass, hoping there was someway he could pull himself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny put the piece of candy he dropped back on his plate.

Vinny strolled his way over to one of the seats and set down his plate. Next, Vinny...         </span></div></div>",

Looking closer Vinny tilted his head as he looked down at what appeared to be a bug. Sure enough as the creature moved, Vinny could make out a brown shell and some feelers coming off its head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was he talking to a bug?\" Vinny thought to himself as he was pretty sure he saw Tyler over here hunched over and talking to someone. Shrugging, Vinny turned away from the little creature and reached over for a plate. Figuring he could indulge himself in the buffet he and Brody laid out, Vinny started to fill his plate with various foods at his leisure. Curiously, Vinny peeked back over at the insect he just ignored. Oddly enough the creature looked like it was watching him. Unsure if it was making a funny plan about getting in the food, Vinny figured he'd better just deal with the pest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down, Vinny was about to smash the little creature until he noticed something... off. \"Why is it standing on two legs?\" Vinny wondered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to pluck the critter up instead, Vinny finally gave it a closer look. It only had four appendages and as Vinny saw, it only actually used two for standing. Squinting even closer in the darkness, he looked at it's face as he heard it speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny!\" Josh called hoping the giant man would recognize him. With a couple blinks then a sudden widening of his eyes, Vinny realized what the bug was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny bro?\" Vinny asked the miniature man carefully. As Josh nodded, glad to see the huge man somehow recognized him. \"Wha? Bro? I thought you weren't coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head as Vinny set him down on his plate beside a mess of pasta as well as a few wrapped up pieces of candy. \"No, this was all a stupid joke by Tyler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got you to dress like that? How?\" Vinny asked raising the plate up closer to his face, trying not to look too conspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were having this dumb prank war, and well... he got me.\" Josh added woefully as Vinny chuckled with a friendly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty solid prank, bro.\" Vinny said, giving Tyler credit where credit was due. Josh looked down, saddened by Vinny's approval of the joke. Vinny noticed the little man's glum response and tried to remedy it. \"Hey look, tiny bro. We can still make this right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at the handsome man before weeping at him, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy bro, all we have to do is...\"    </span></div></div>",

Without hesitation Josh almost lost his balance as Vinny turned his whole body and started to walk over to a near by table. Looking over at the men sitting at the table Josh noticed the inhabitants to be Blake, Matt, and Luke. Josh nearly felt his heart leap out of his throat as Vinny quickly lowered the foam plate he was still standing down on the table. Josh looked up at Vinny, a smile forming on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo bros!\" Vinny said to the four men as they crewed their food casually. The three men turned and acknowledged Brody's roommate as they swallowed their food to reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny my man! How's it hanging dude!\" Luke replied enthusiastically with a smile as he had his mask pulled up slightly revealing his mouth, yet still hiding the rest of his face. Likewise, Matt also had his mask in a similar fashion as he replied as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Vinny?\" Matt said as he continued to shovel more food into his mouth. Blake simply nodded with a smile as Vinny sat down, likely glad to have other company other than the goofs that were Matt and Luke. Vinny continued to smile, excited to carry out the plan he carefully orchestrated in his mind to not only keep up the act, but also get Tyler to end it himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bros, while I was grabbing food I found something interesting.\" Vinny grinned, speaking loudly enough for Tyler to hear him on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh -eah? hwat's -hat?\" Luke spouted, spitting out tiny bits of food from his mouth as he spoke with his mouth full. The three men watched as Vinny reached down on his plate, quickly lifting up a little speck between his fingers. Squinting, they were confused as to how this speck was \"interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you find a crumb?\" Matt said with a chuckle as he nudged Blake in the shoulder. Blake shook his head as he looked at the speck again for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bug, I think.\" Blake mumbled as Matt and Luke leaned in closer to look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo, bro!\" Vinny practically yelled, continuing to try and get Tyler's attention. \"I found it right behind me after I got done talking to TYLER!\" He yelled Tyler's name with emphasis, finally getting Tyler to turn his head. Looking over at Vinny, Tyler was curious why he just said his name so loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about it, dude?\" Matt questioned, still pretty uninterested as he unwrapped a piece of candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only got four legs, bro! Also, it only uses two of them to stand!\" Vinny said excitedly. The three men simply looked at him. Blinking in confusion over his excitement. Meanwhile, Tyler listened intently as Vinny laughed at the men's expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Luke said, resting his hand on his chin as he leaned his elbow down on the table, looking bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Vinny said with a toothy smile. \"Dare me to eat it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's expression suddenly changed from bored, to excited. \"Hell yeah I do, dude! Now <i>that's</i> interesting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply shrugged as, Matt gave Vinny a thumbs up. Vinny looked over as Tyler stood up, walking toward the table. With a smirk, Vinny figured now was when things go interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?\" Josh yelled at the man as he was simply ignored. He couldn't believe playing along with Tyler's game some how translated to \"eat Josh\". Struggling as best he could, Josh watched as Tyler ended up at the table, right across from Vinny. Josh looked at the man, arms crossed as he looked at his direction. Josh knew Tyler wouldn't leave him out to dry! He is his best friend after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Tyler! Come to see me eat this little pest?\" Vinny said with a knowing smile at Tyler. Tyler suddenly smiled back, as if he knew Vinny's ploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, do it up.\" Tyler said still smiling confidently. Josh's jaw dropped. How could Tyler knowingly give this behemoth permission to eat him? This had to be some sort of nightmare, Josh thought. There's no way things should have ever turned out like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up then, bro.\" Vinny continued to speak with conviction. Moving his fingers up to his lips, Vinny opened his huge mouth. Josh looked on in disgust as the huge jock's breath washed over him like putrid meat. Gagging on his own vomit, Josh didn't have time to prepare as he was suddenly dropped in the dark cavern. Shivering with fright, Josh gazed upon the huge strands of saliva dripping from the roof of Vinny's mouth. Behind him, walls of massive teeth started to come crashing down, closing Vinny's mouth and sealing him inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream Josh was quickly whisked away to a location he knew not. In the total darkness, Josh only knew he was surrounded on all sides by moist and slick muscles. The area seemed rather tight, wondering if Vinny did swallow him Josh tried to take in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" Vinny thought to himself as he quickly stored the tiny man beneath is tongue. For now he figured it was a good place to hide the little man while he continued to keep up the ruse. Looking at Tyler in the eye Vinny smirked once again with confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice trip, tiny bro.\" Vinny added purposefully, rearing back his head as he saw Tyler ready to speak up. Lowing his arms Tyler opened his mouth and said...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Go for it dude, swallow the little guy.\" Tyler rooted as he looked at Vinny's somewhat shocked expression. Quickly changing his face to a frown instead, Vinny continued to rear his head back and gave a very audible gulp as he pretended to swallow the little bug. Raising his arms arrogantly to his sides he looked around at the guys, eyes stopping on Tyler last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, it's gone bro.\" He said giving his solid abdomen a quick pound with his fist. Tyler simply smirked as he quickly congratulated the man as he turned away, wanting to go back to to watch Ross and Brett continue their game. Vinny watched as Tyler turned away, still shocked the huge man didn't intervene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dude!\" Luke yelled giving Vinny a pat on the back. Forcing a smile, he felt Josh jolt around a little in his mouth after Luke smacked his back. Worried he was going to swallow the tiny man for real this time, he figured it would be best to find an excuse to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back, bros. I gotta take a shit.\" He lied as he put a hand on his lower abdomen, trying to fake the need to go now. Luke simply laughed as the saw the lax bro turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that bug went right through you, dude!\" He joked as he watched Vinny walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real mature, bro!\" He called back with a smile, glad that wasn't actually the case for the tiny man he held captive in his mouth. Turning the corner to head upstairs, Vinny pounded his way out of the party and made his way up to his room. Sighing as he entered the room, he flicked on his light and closed the door behind him. Pursing his lips slightly, he worked up a little bit of saliva and dripped the little man out of his mouth with his spit into his hand. Looking in the sticky saliva he saw the tiny man start to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say.\" Josh said finally as he stood up in a puddle of Vinny's spit. Looking down, he couldn't believe Tyler didn't save him from what all he knew was just a half assed bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he knew I was bluffing, tiny bro.\" Vinny said, sitting down on his bed, looking down at the tiny man confidently. Looking up at Vinny's face, Josh wiped some of the excess saliva that still hung on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Josh asked cautiously. Vinny simply nodded his head and looked back at the door. Josh looked back down again, the thought made him feel a little better, but the feeling was incredibly bitter-sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still shitty of him though, tiny bro.\" Vinny said with a hint of anger. \"I mean, you're his friend after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, it was a nice sentiment. But it didn't really impact Josh's mood all that much. Josh simply sighed as he made his way out of the puddle of saliva to find a drier part of Vinny's palm. Josh almost fell off his feet as Vinny's hand moved to the side suddenly as it landed on a near by night stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here for a bit, tiny bro.\" Vinny said to Josh as he watched the little man drop off his hand onto the wooden surface. Josh watched as Vinny stood up and turned his back to him. Putting a hand on his hip, Josh stared directly at Vinny's ass as he lifted up his warm up coat slightly. He couldn't help but peek at the form fitting material as Vinny spoke once more before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be safe here, tiny bro. Once people clear out I'm going to get you home.\" Vinny said as he walked away from Josh to the doorway of his room. Josh watched as the man flicked off the light and made his way out of sight. Blushing brightly, he couldn't believe someone he met once was showing him such kindness, while someone he's known for years was treating him so badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just goes to show you sometimes...\" Josh said to himself as he leaned up against an alarm clock. Closing his eyes for a second, it was all it took for Josh to drift off into a quick nap after everything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour went by and the party was as lively as ever. Games were played and many drinks were had, in fact quite a number of the jocks started to become pretty intoxicated. One such was the goof dressed up as Deadpool, Luke. The lumbering man made his way up the stairs, trying to seek out the bathroom as it was described to him moments ago by Brody. Flicking the light on to the room he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a bathroom.\" He noticed slowly as he looked around the room. \"It's a bedroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly snapped away as the light turned on. Expecting to see Vinny and getting ready to go home, Josh looked over with disappointment to see none other than Luke, sporting his tight anti-hero costume. Expecting the muscled drunk to leave the room Josh looked away, instead the man had other plans. Looking around the room, Luke forgot his need to use the bathroom and instead decided snooping would be more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh froze as the huge man worked his way over to the night stand, looking directly down at his position. Hoping he was looking at something else, Josh tried not to move to attract the giant's attention. Before he could react, Josh found himself pinned between Luke's thumb and fore fingers. Looking at the massive masked face before him, the huge giant's voice boomed out...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Trying his best he struggled with all his might, hoping the spandex clad giant might accidentally set him free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Vinny would pussy out like that!\" Luke practically yelled at what he thought was just some weird looking bug. \"He's gonna be pissed when I show you to him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked at the huge man, surprised at how dumb any of that sounded. However, against his will Josh found himself being carried away from his once safe haven back down into the mess of muscular men downstairs. The lighting made it hard for Josh's eyes to adjust at first as he and Luke turned the corner back down into the party room. Looking around however Josh noticed the pace of the party had changed dramatically. Off the bat, he noticed Blake completely asleep with his head down on one of the tables. Josh couldn't help but laugh that the huge guy might actually be a light weight after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his attention elsewhere he saw Matt, still clad in his spiderman costume, dancing by himself in the middle of the room. Meanwhile, a few of the other guys huddled around Brody's huge tv, likely still playing games of Madden. Finally the last two Josh noticed were in fact Vinny and Tyler. Shaking his head, Josh couldn't help but notice the two men ditched their jackets each. Dressed only in their leggings, the two sat at a table having an arm wrestling match. Josh jumped as Luke's loud voice erupted above him, making Josh remember he was still captive to the huge man.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Vinny!\" He called over as Vinny just successfully turned over Tyler's arm, winning the match. After a quick gloat, he stood up and turned toward Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, my man! What's happening, bro?\" He called out a little loudly. Josh tilted his head as he looked at the man's face as he obviously had quite a few drinks in the time they were separated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's happening is you're a big old gaping vagina!\" Luke taunted at the shirtless giant with a slight sway on his feet. Looking a little taken aback Vinny looked down to see Luke was holding something between his fingers. Lifting his hand up in front of Vinny, Luke continued his mocking. \"I found this little bugger up in your room! You pussy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vinny could defend himself, Tyler stood up and walked behind him, slapping him on the back. \"Dude, you didn't actually eat it? What a little pansy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny looked at Tyler, annoyed at how quickly he could react to the situation and make him look bad. He was full well prepared to lie and say it was a different bug, but now he realized he was in a bit of a hole. \"Actually eating it would have been gross, bros. I just wanted to put on a show.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed as he slapped Vinny on the back once again. Vinny grimaced as he realized Tyler wasn't going to let this go. \"Dude, don't be such a bitch! Be a man and eat it for real! Unless there's some reason why you're being such a little girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny looked down at the words. He was suspicious of Tyler the whole time, but that practically confirmed it for him. Smirking, Vinny was ready to turn the tables. \"Alright bro...\"  </span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes and smiling, Vinny started to tilt his palm into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny no!\" Josh called out desperately as huge man's mouth opened wide, ready to deposit him in the stinky cavern once more. Just based off the conversation Josh really wasn't sure what Vinny's plan was this time. Now that they were caught once, Josh couldn't help but feel like his new friend was really going to give in and swallow him. Tearing up from the bitter smell coming from Vinny's mouth, Josh could do little more than gag as he pinched his nose while hoping to avoid choking on the giant's thick breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed silently in his head as he fell fast, plunging down into the middle of Vinny's enormous tongue. Trying to stay above the surface of a small pool of saliva, Josh took a deep breath in from the dank cavern, much to his immediate displeasure. Coughing, Josh looked around the familiar mouth as he started to watch the massive rows of teeth converge together, closing the slimy cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered nervously for a moment, wondering if Vinny was prepared to hide him under his tongue once again. Unsure of what was going on, Josh did notice that Vinny's huge tongue had in fact started to shift slightly. Hoping it was to place him in a safer spot, Josh closed his eyes calmly, waiting for anything to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head back, Vinny positioned the tiny speck in his mouth. Ready to swallow the little man for real, Vinny smirked once more at Tyler as he swallowed hard, making an extremely audible gulp. Putting a finger on his throat, he felt the tiny man start to struggle and squirm on his undoubtedly terrifying trip down to his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, bro. It's gone for real now.\" Vinny said as he took his finger off his throat, still feeling faint squirms as they made their way down deeper toward his chest. Tyler simply shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up, dude. I don't believe you.\" Tyler said to Vinny who simply shrugged. Opening his mouth wide, Vinny allowed Tyler to look inside as he moved his tongue around, indicating he didn't stow the little speck anywhere for later. Just as Vinny felt the faint struggles end toward his abdomen, he felt a little pressure come from his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUURRRRP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny ripped a disgusting sounding burp directly in Tyler's face as the he quickly reared his head back. \"Dude!\" Tyler yelled as Vinny shut his mouth with a proud look on his face. \"That's gross, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug's just sending it's regards to you from my stomach, bro.\" Vinny smirked as he started to back up away from Tyler, rubbing his solid abs pompously. Turning away, Vinny slapped his ass quickly over his tight swimmer's pants. \"By the way bro, kiss my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny laughed as Tyler simply turned away, disgusted. Luke however, walked over beside Vinny. Smiling through his mask, Luke looked to Vinny's face excitedly. \"I knew you weren't a pussy, dude!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro.\" Vinny said looked down at his sculpted six pack. Luke smacked Vinny on the back as he excused himself in search for the bathroom for real this time. Vinny laughed at the man as he gave him very specific directions to one by the kitchen so he wouldn't get lost upstairs again. Putting a hand on his hip, Vinny watched the spandex clad man wander off. Suddenly, with a loud gurgle, Vinny felt his stomach rumble at him.

Removing his hand and walking forward to the snack table, Vinny gabbed a hand full of chips and started to shove the food in his mouth while he thought silently to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I care?\" Vinny thought as he chewed up the chips quickly. \"I barely knew the dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the mouth full of chips Vinny grabbed another hand full as he walked away from the table and popped a few in his mouth as he looked around the party. Things seemed pretty dead as most of the guys were either passed out or playing video games. Shrugging as he put more chips in his mouth, Vinny walked out of the room and decided to head upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny swallowed once more as he turned the corner to his room and went inside. Closing the door behind him he quickly stripped off swimmer's pants and pulled up a pair of underwear and pajama pants to sleep in. Yawning and stretching as he sat down on his bed, he rubbed his stomach once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler didn't care, why should I?\" Vinny said to himself as he gave his stomach a quick slap before he laid down on his bed and pulled his covers over him. Closing his eyes the huge man started to fall asleep after a long night of partying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinny!\" Josh yelled at the top of his lungs. It had been awhile since he found himself swallowed down by the massive lax bro, but he still believed the kind man would have some sort of plan to get him out. After all he seemed like he interested in looking out for him. Josh kept telling himself that whenever he felt doubtful, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shivered with fear as he continued to look around the humid chamber. Some food made it's way down Vinny's throat not too long ago as Josh heard the squelching sound of Vinny's sphincter squeeze the chewed up globs down. It was a little unsettling that he continued to eat after he swallowed him, Josh thought. What was even more strange was how the stomach seemed to be positioned now. Everything tilted to the side like it was flipped slightly, which caused quite a fuss for Josh as he tried to avoid being engulfed in Vinny's powerful digestive fluids as the stomach shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting hard to breath...\" Josh said to himself as he struggled to draw breath. He looked down at his hands as he vision seemed to get fuzzy. Truth was by now he could barely even feel his legs or his hands as Vinny's stomach acid inevitably began to break his body down. The only sensations Josh could feel was the gradual burning on his body coupled with the nauseating spin in his head from lack of oxygen. Falling face first into the squishy ground, Josh's body finally gave up and submitted itself the the colossal digestive chamber it unfortunately found it's way into. Vinny's stomach simply churned casually, not even noticing the life it just extinguished within it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Vinny sat up stretching his body and rubbing his eyes as he yawned. Smiling he stood up as he made his way out of his room and crossed the hallway to the bathroom. He couldn't help but feel like eh slept exceptionally well as he washed his hands after doing his business. Casually strolling down the stairs he saw some of the party goers still floating about, most of them still asleep. One such person who was awake however was Tyler. The groggy looking man spotted Vinny as he made his way over to him to wish him a good morning.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what happened last night?\" Tyler yawned as he followed Vinny into the kitchen to grab a bit of breakfast.  Vinny smirked as he full well remembered what he did, but figured it would be better if Tyler didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, bro. The party of sweet though.\" Vinny lied as he took out a few bowls for cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that much I can remember, dude!\" Tyler said happily as he grabbed one of the bowls and started to chow down on some cereal Vinny set out. Vinny shook his head and laughed to himself as he reached into the refrigerator to grab milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dunce.\" Vinny thought to himself as he set the milk on the table and rubbed his stomach once more, thinking about how the tiny bug man was long gone.   </span></div></div>",

Tyler reared back a little, surprised by the sudden challenge. Luke on the other hand practically jumped with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Tyler never backs down to a challenge! He'll show you, no matter how gross the little pest is!\" Luke said enthusiastically as he looked at Tyler, already attempting to hand him the bug without getting any confirmation. Tyler merely blinked as he looked down in his hand, bug already in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Tyler replied, confused as to what just happened. He wasn't expecting Vinny to turn this around on him after all. Vinny simply smirked as he back away from Tyler and crossed his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, bro. Unless you wanna be a bitch like me?\" Vinny mocked as Tyler looked down at the speck in his hand with a frown. Tyler simply shrugged as he lifted his hand up to his mouth and dumped the little speck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed at the top of his lungs as he plunged down into Tyler's dark mouth. Closing his eyes out of fear, he came to a stop finally as he landed in the center of Tyler's slick and sticky tongue. Trying to get his bearings, Josh looked around in disgust. It was bad enough he had to spend time in Vinny's mouth earlier, but now Tyler's too? Wiping some strands of spit off his face, Josh tried to gain some sort of balance as he looked at Tyler's teeth behind him as they started to come crashing down, closing the moist cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he doesn't know it's me?\" Josh shivered as he thought of his best friend swallowing him down without a second though, thinking he was simply some bug. As if on cue, Josh found the answer to his question. Finding himself sweat to the side and quickly tucked under Tyler's massive tongue, Josh realized it was the same as what Vinny had done earlier. Calming down, Josh heard a tremendous sounding gulp reverberate deep down Tyler's massive throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wiped his mouth casually as he finished his act. \"There, I'm not a pussy like you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny uncrossed his arms and walked up, right in Tyler's face. \"Let's see the inside of your mouth then, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler fretted for a second as he opened his mouth, making sure to keep his tongue flat. Vinny looked confidently around the man's mouth before looking up at Tyler's eyes. \"What about under your tongue, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler winced as he slowly started to lift up his tongue, revealing the struggling speck hidden underneath. \"Ah ha! I knew it bro! There something you wanna say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply closed his mouth. Leaving Josh trapped inside, he knew he didn't have much choice at this point if he didn't want to lose face. Positioning his friend in the center of his tongue, Tyler reared his head back and swallowed once more. Opening his mouth, Tyler lifted his tongue, showing nothing remained in his mouth finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I have to say you're a little pussy.\" Tyler said with an arrogant smile, staring directly into Vinny's eyes. Neither man moved for a moment until Vinny backed away, disgusted with Tyler that he'd rather eat his friend than look like an idiot for a few minutes. Triumphant, Tyler nodded his head as he watched Vinny walk away. Placing a hand on his stomach however, he figured it wouldn't be best to leave his friend down there for long. Turning away, Tyler silently excused hiself as he made his way out of the room and...        </span></div></div>",

Swallowing nervously, Josh hoped the two would spot him and rescue him from this terrible plot of Tyler's. Finally reaching the table, Josh looked up in amazement as the two men's crotches were just at the table height. Both of their costumes greatly detailed their impressive muscled bodies behind the tight colored spandex. Josh shook his head as he tried to stop staring, and instead starting waving frantically at the two, hoping to be noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man all this food looks so good, dude.\" Matt said as he rubbed his hands together. His joy was short lived however as he noticed a tiny brown speck sitting near the snacks. \"Gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked around at the food, confused. \"What is dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt simply pointed down at the little speck, before crossing his arms in disgust. Luke laughed as he quickly pinched the little speck between his huge fingers. \"What is Spiderman afraid of a little buggy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop dude, bugs are gross.\" Matt said looking down at Luke's hand. Meanwhile, Luke had other plans. Raising his hand with the little speck, he started trying to shove the little pest into the mouth of Matt's masked face. Unflinching, Matt stood there confused at what his friend was doing. \"Dude what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke pulled his hand and the speck away from Matt's mouth. \"What? You're a spider. Spiders eats bugs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt punched his friend in the shoulder and replied angrily. \"Spiderman does not eat bugs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke held his hand down and laughed. \"Well excuse me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head, grabbing a plate before figuring out what food he wanted. Deciding to grab a roll and a hot dog he moved his way off to the condiments while Luke took a closer look at the bug. Looking through the spandex covering his face he couldn't make out too many features. It had a hard shell, four flailing legs, and feelers. Smirking under his mask, he closed his fist around the bug. After learning his buddy had such a hatred for the little pest he figured it was only appropriate to have some fun with it.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grabbed a plate, filling it with a few snacks a bit faster than Matt before making his way over to a pair of chairs near a table. Deciding to have a little fun, Luke set down his plate and waited for Matt to come over while he...   </span></div></div>",

Turns out the cage was nothing more than a small locket that was part of a necklace, either way Josh looked on in terror as his captor lifted him up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I caught, huh?\" Tyler said proud of himself as he dangled the chain in front of his face. Turning to his side he made sure to thank his partner in crime for his efforts as Luke came out of the corner to see his captive boss dangle from Tyler's hands. \"Nice work, Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, didn't know if he'd fall for that!\" Luke said eyeing his tiny boss as he swung carelessly from Tyler's hand. Tyler laughed as he pulled the chain around his neck and let the little cage lay right between his huge pecs. Luke smirked as he watched the little guy struggle in the cage.\"What are you gonna do with him, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flicked the little cage back and fourth as he walked away from Luke. Debating his plan he wasn't actually sure what he wanted to do with his tiny boss now that he captured him. \"Not sure dude.\" Tyler said as he put his hand over the cage, pressing it hard against his chest. \"Probably just toy with him for drawing on my face.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed as he watched Tyler lift the little cage up to his face and drop it into his mouth and start to suck on it. Rolling the little cage around in his mouth, the muscled lifeguard made sure to swish the little cage around as much as he wanted in his closed mouth.  \"Mmmmmm\" He made the satisfied noise as he pulled the saliva covered cage out of his mouth and let it rest back between his pecs.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas dude?\" Tyler asked as he flicked the cage against his chest some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke scratched his head trying to think when he came up with the idea to...</span></div></div>",

Quickly, the giant man noticed a little speck traveling across his abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what he's up to.\" Tyler thought to himself as he closed his eye again and arrogantly started to smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Josh continued his trek, finally reaching past the valley that is Tyler's pecs. Winded from his journey, he never noticed the giant man catching on to his little adventure. However, Josh still remained determined. He looked up at Tyler's neck, laying back he saw he needed to scale the chin before finally reaching the face. Figuring it was now or never, Josh started to walk across the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt the little man starting to cross his neck, on his adam's apple. He quickly swallowed a glob of saliva, causing his adam's apple to bob. He smirked again to himself as he felt his boss tumble over and lose his footing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was shocked at the force of the swallow, however it never occurred to him that it was on purpose and tried to ignore it as he walked across the neck once again. Finally this time he was allowed to reach the chin, he looked up and grabbed a bit of Tyler's stubble and started pulling himself up. After a few more minutes of climbing Josh was just about ready to collapse. But he knew he still had one more thing he had to do. Walking across the top of the chin Josh made his way toward Tyler's lips. They were closed as Tyler continued to breath through his nose, still Josh through he should be cautious and walk around the out outside of the lips rather right across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around Josh made his way to the edge of Tyler's top lip and started to walk toward the center toward the nose. \"Let's start by giving this asshat a nice curly mustache!\" Josh said as he found himself in the middle of Tyler's top lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even pull out the marker suddenly Josh found himself pinned to the lip. It took a moment for Josh to realize it, but the thing pinning him was Tyler's tongue! Josh struggled to break free as the massive muscle started to pull him slowly into Tyler's mouth. Josh wasn't much of a match for the huge tongue as it easily swept Josh into Tyler's cavernous mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh found himself sliding down the slick tongue, nearing the back of Tyler's throat faster and faster. Thinking Tyler was asleep, Josh said his prayers, knowing this was the end. Suddenly, everything stopped as the mouth seemed to level out and Josh slide to a stop somewhere in the middle. Josh shivered as he wondered why everything stopped so abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice boomed out over Josh, making his ears ring. \"LOOKS LIKE I CAUGHT YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized now that Tyler was sitting up and must've been on to him this whole time. \"Damn... I was so close too.\" Josh sighed to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tyler stood up and stretched his arms and torso. Keeping his mouth shut he slowly walked over to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Opening his mouth he let the light flood in as he searched for the tiny intruder. Strands of saliva glistened as he looked around, finally locating the little speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well!\" Tyler's voice boomed out once again. \"What do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh uncovered his ears as he tried to stand up and respond. \"Real funny! You caught me, now let me out of here! It stinks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler closed his mouth again and this time swished his tiny boss around in his saliva before reopening it and looking at his little boss struggle to find his bearings again. \"Maybe I will if you just admit I won.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe the words he was hearing. He was trapped in a mouth and all Tyler could think about was winning or losing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow up!\" Josh spat back at the giant stud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way, dude.\" Tyler said as he closed his mouth. Slowly, he began to inch Josh closer and closer to the back of his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to swallow me?!\" Josh yelled out as he tried to move his way toward the front of the mouth with little to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will if you don't admit I won!\" Tyler taunted with his mouth staying shut afterwards, focused on moving Josh closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as he could make out Tyler's uvula, dripping in saliva come into view. He knew that meant he was very close to the drop that would lead him to Tyler's stomach. \"He wouldn't dare... would he?\" Josh thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he had to make a choice now...           </span></div></div>",

He was in high school, and his football team was just lead to a victory in tough game. Him and a few of his buddy's went to one of their houses to celebrate. They started getting kinda rowdy and some bets got made. In particular, one of his buddy's bet him five bucks he couldn't swallow the pet goldfish, then bring it back up alive. Since Tyler knew he walked away five dollars richer that day, he was successful then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure last I heard that fish is still alive\" Tyler thought to himself. Finally snapping back to reality he realized he could do the same now. If anything he knew it would scare the shit out of Josh, then he'd finally have to admit defeat. Waiting for a second for Josh, one last time Tyler realized Josh wasn't giving in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably thinks I won't do it.\" Tyler thought to himself. \"Well then, he's in for a rude awakening.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tilted his head back even more, feeling the tiny man slide dangerously close to his throat before addressing Josh one more time. \"Last chance little buddy!\" He taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not hearing an answer for a second time, Tyler figured it was time to make good on his threats. Lifting his tongue, he pushed the little speck all the way back and gently swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe it, his best friend just swallowed him. He watched as what little light from the mouth started to fade. He realized he was quickly descending down Tyler's throat, on his way to the stomach. Josh tried as hard as he could to grab on the slick surface, with out any luck. All he could do was listen to Tyler's ever growing heart beat as he went deeper and deeper into the dark pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Tyler the action was simple. After swallowing his tiny boss, he simply left the bathroom and slowly walked out into the kitchen. He grabbed a small bucket out from under the sink, knowing he'd need it in a few minutes. Pressing a hand to his chest, he could feel the faint struggles of his friend just on the other side, slowly being pushed down into his awaiting belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just like when I felt that fish go down... only smaller this time.\" He said to himself rubbing his chest. Deciding to speed up the process a little, Tyler grabbed a glass out off the shelf and filled it up with some tap water. Then he quickly downed the water in a few swift gulps. Putting the glass in the sink, he reached for his chest with his free hand. This time he felt the little speck get washed down. Gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, now I'll give him a minute to think.\" Tyler said aloud as a little pressure formed in his gut. \"Uuurrrp...\" He patted his stomach after letting out the casual burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torrent of water easily rushed Josh away, before he could even realize what was happening he found himself being dumped into a large dark chamber. At this moment Josh wished his eye's hadn't adjusted to the dark, because all around he could see was a gigantic cavern with gently churning walls and worst of all, no escape. Josh was in a little awe at his size, Tyler's stomach could easily inhabit a good portion of the water park. Josh snapped back to reality, knowing this wasn't the time to marvel at his size. He was in much more danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUUUURRRP....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was deafening, followed by an instant change in pressure. Josh realized there was still some air trapped in the stomach though, as he situated himself on one of the fleshy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think he was holding back...\" Josh said aloud as the walls of the stomach started being pounded forwards and backwards. Holding on to his position Josh was determined to stay strong, despite what seemed like his imminent death.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put a hand on his abs, poking them softly. Trying his best to see if he could feel his tiny boss clinging on somewhere in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I feel him!\" Tyler said aloud with his hand on his stomach. \"No more struggles though... better let him out now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Tyler shoved his fingers down his throat, gagging himself just like he did that one time for the fish. He clenched his stomach tight, trying his best to force up the contents into the bucket. After a few seconds, a spew of water came rushing out. Tyler quickly examined the puddle in the bucket, not before noticing a speck of tiny movement. Moving his finger under the speck he lifted it up and out of the water to his face, looking at his tiny boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat there on the finger, shivering and scared at what torture Tyler had in mind for him next. As Tyler's face appeared his fear quickly turned to anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that!? You could have killed me!\" Josh yelled as loud as he could at the smirking man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't, dude.\" Tyler said smugly. \"Either way, I win dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't believe this game could still be going on after he was just eaten and regurgitated, but he wasn't about to give in either. \"Well technically, I never gave in. So it's still on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tyler said as he lifted Josh back over his mouth. \"You sure?\" He said sticking out his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please! Wait!\" Josh squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lowered Josh back to face level, closing his mouth. \"I wouldn't do the same trick twice in a row anyway. Once is enough for now. So you'll have to wait, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he was safe now, Josh figured it was a good opportunity to taunt the behemoth. \"Well I knew you would let me out anyway, so it's not like I was ever worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked. \"Oh yeah? Just like I'm sure you \"knew\" I would never swallow you in the first place, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh clammed up. He was right after all. He never in a million years would have guessed Tyler would purposely eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed at Josh's silence as he let him down on the balcony back to the park. \"Who knows dude. Next time I wouldn't be so sure what I would or wouldn't do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood up straight, and rubbed his stomach while staring at Josh with an arrogant smirk on face. Josh couldn't help but be annoyed with Tyler, but something about seeing the abs he was just on the other side of get stroked so pompously made him a little excited. Shaking off the thought, Josh turned away from the massive hunk and decided to walk back into the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way back to his office Josh sat down. Feeling defeated he leaned back at his chair hoping the day would just end. After a few minutes, there was a knock at his door and Brody came through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro what happened? I just saw Tyler and he didn't have a dick on his forehead.\" Brody asked his disappointed looking boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't work Brod.\" Josh said flatly. \"He caught on before I could start drawing and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood there for a second waiting for Josh to finish before asking, \"Well what, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he sorta ate me...\" Josh admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody started to laugh, clutching his stomach. \"No way bro! He goldfish tricked you? That's awesome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by Brody's reaction Josh simple said, \"I don't see how it was too \"awesome\" for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stopped and apologized, \"Yeah bro, must've sucked for you but for him I gotta give him kudos bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Josh's desk Brody looked down at his boss seriously. \"You gotta come up with something to top that bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned away from him, not sure if he even wanted to keep this prank war going. \"Maybe I should just give up. Tyler said he might do that to me again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody pushed himself back into his boss's view again trying to motivate him. \"No way bro! You gotta show him who's boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little weary Josh decided...               </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok let's think how could I possibly one up that?\" Josh said looking at Brody with a tired face. Brody put a hand on his chin and stroked it casually as he looked off to the side in thought. Finally, he looked down at Josh with an interesting grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flubsy.\" Brody simply stated as he looked Josh dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked a few times while staring back at Brody's unnerving gaze. \"Our rejected mascot?\" Josh asked finally as the muscular bro gave him a thumbs up. Josh sat there puzzled, Flubsy was a failed mascot idea he came up with when the park was still new to try and draw in more guests, but after making the costume he simply stored it away since the park was doing fine anyway. Looking back at Brody, Josh waited for an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll use his own trick against him. Dress you up in the Flubsy the fish costume, get him to think you're a real fish and swallow you down. Then after he pukes you up, BAM you jump out of the costume and laugh at his dumbass!\" Brody rattled off quickly with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... sounds kinda unsafe.\" Josh said to Brody, who's face didn't change at all to Josh's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a bet for five bucks that he couldn't swallow \"the fish\" down and throw it back up. He'll be all nervous and shit, bro! It'll be hilarious. Then when you come out you can be all, \"It was me all along!\"\" Brody said still smiling at his idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed. He just escaped Tyler's stomach, he wasn't quite sure if he wanted his prank to involve going back into that smelly pit. The more he thought about it the more he thought it might get on Tyler's nerves if they pulled it off right. \"He did say he wouldn't do the same prank to me twice in a row. So this might rub it in he face that I'm not afraid of his little scare tactics.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're talking, bro!\" Brody said looking very enthusiastic. \"This let's him know you're not afraid to \"Goldfish\" yourself, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Brody talked, the more it started to sound like a pretty genuine prank. Getting up, Josh turned to his old closet in the back of his office and started digging through a bunch of old junk. Brody walked over, pressing his chest into the back of Josh's head, as he started reaching for things higher up in the messy storage. The two searched diligently for a few minutes before Brody pulled the orange fish costume off from one of the top shelves. Backing up the two of them admired the goofy looking costume as Brody held it. It had an orange body with cartoony looking scales on it, coupled with yellowish looking fins and two large pop-eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody handed the suit to Josh. It was actually his size after all. Josh designed it in mind that he could advertise for the park himself, back when he wasn't sure how the park would do financially. Brody looked at Josh as he held the little costume. \"Tyler is still on break right, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should be.\" Josh said as he reached a hand into the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't put it on yet, just in case anyone sees you when you walk to the interview room.\" Brody said as he started to lead Josh to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why the interview room?\" Josh questioned as he was being rushed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stopped before he could open the door back out the park. \"I've gotta sneak into the break room to grab a glass and a little water, if he saw you hop in the cup right after I got it he might think something's up, bro. At least this way I can get him to think I won you in a game outside on the boardwalk or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good thinking Brody.\" Josh said blushing a little that Brody's plan was so well thought out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the room, Brody clicked his tongue and patted Josh on the back as he went around to the front of the park. Luckily for Josh, the walk to the interview room from his office wasn't a very long one. Trying not to draw too much attention to himself, Josh tried to walk at a regular pace and hug the costume close to himself so nobody would see it. Reaching the door, Josh opened it up to the empty room and shut it behind him quickly. Sighing, Josh started to slip on the Flubsy costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting all the fins and the wacky eyes on top, Josh stood and waited for a second before the giant door on the other side of the room opened up. Brody walked in holding what appeared to be a shot glass with a tiny bit of water in it. Strolling his way over to Josh he looked down with a grin at the little man in costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it's Flubsy the fish!\" Brody said excitedly as he bent down a little to get a better look. \"Bro, he was in the gym with Luke. So I snuck in and out without being seen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled behind the face of the costume at Brody's success as he lowered his hand down for the little man to climb aboard. Brody carefully lifted the disguised tiny man up to the rim of the glass, before slowly lowering him down into the water. He smirked as he watched Josh started to swim around on the surface of the water like a tiny fish. Ready to commence the prank, Brody left the room and turned into the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door to the room, both Tyler and Luke emerged from the gym drenched in sweat from their work out. Brody smiled as he approached Tyler's sweat dripping frame. \"Bro! Ty! I was looking for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up dude?\" Tyler asked as he wiped a torrent of sweat off his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about your prank war with the boss. You goldfish'd the little guy?\" Brody asked, trying to look like its the first time he's heard of the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What he come crying to you, dude?\" Tyler said as he raised a fist for Luke to bump. Luke simply laughed as he exchanged fists with Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, Ross told me! I just wanted to see you do it again, bro. So I got this fish from the store!\" Brody said lifting the little shot glass up with the little orange speck swimming around in it. Tyler took the shot glass and looked down at the pathetic little creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it so small?\" Tyler asked looking closer at the goofy looking critter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno bro. It was 5 cents. So I got it.\" Brody quickly lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it swimming on the surface like that? Is there something wrong with it?\" Tyler asked looking at Brody with a disgusted look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, stop being such a pussy and just drink it.\" Brody taunted, trying to get the ball rolling. \"I'll give you five bucks if you can puke it up alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ty, just down that little bitch!\" Luke said putting his hand on Tyler's sweaty shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, calm down dudes.\" Tyler said as he lifted the shot glass to his lips. Brody watched as the little orange speck slid out of the glass and into Tyler's mouth. With an audible gulp, it completely vanished as Tyler's adams apple bobbed slightly. \"There, it's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww dude! Do you feel it squirming?\" Luke said slapping his buddy on the back. Tyler put a hand on his glistening chest and rubbed it slightly with a distorted look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, man. Pretty pathetically small fish you got though Brod.\" Tyler said smirking at Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, bro. Just puke it up.\" Brody said getting a little impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta give it a second to get all the way down, dude. What are you worried about anyway, it cost you a nickel.\" Tyler said as he rubbed his sweaty abs, indicating that he believed the tiny creature made it's way into his massive stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five bucks man.\" Brody said casually, as he reached into his pocket to pull out a five. Tyler shrugged as he walked over to the sink and started to put his fingers in his mouth when...                    </span></div></div>",

Luke looked at the man's face and simply laughed as Tyler clutched his stomach dramatically. Brody bit his lip as Tyler searched through the first stream of vomit, finding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, dude. It doesn't wanna come out.\" Tyler groaned as he rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, bro. Keep trying.\" Brody urged the man as he walked up and put a hand on his sweaty back. Tyler quickly turned to him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for ten bucks I will...\" Tyler mumbled as Brody rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, bro. Ten bucks if you puke up a fish.\" Brody said with a slight smirk as he patted Tyler's back. With new found determination, Tyler stuck his fingers back down his throat, expelling a bit more vomit from his stomach. Finally, this time, Tyler fingered through the lumpy mess and found a tiny struggling orange speck. Standing up straight, he looked over at Brody who was starting to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, bro. But I promised you ten bucks if you puked up a fish.\" Brody said with a smirk fleshed out on his face. Turned and opening the door to leave, Brody left Tyler and Luke with one lest message. \"Take a closer look at your \"fish\", bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude wait!\" Tyler yelled as Brody left the room with a laugh. \"That bastard didn't pay me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile looked down at the struggling speck in the vomit, trying to look a little closer like Brody said. \"Dude, maybe you should look closer at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed as he reached down into the sink and pulled out the tiny fish from his pools of vomit. Rinsing out the sink and running a little water over the fish, Tyler looked a little closer at the creature in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, Josh looked out of the costume to see he ended up out of that mess and was thankfully in the hand of his friend, rather than in his stomach. Smiling, he reached for his back and tried to undo the zipper of the costume. After a few seconds, Josh...  </span></div></div>",

Blinking a little, he reared his head back and looked at Tyler with a frown. Meanwhile, Tyler scratched his head as he watched the little critter crawl around and flop from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" Luke said finally after a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to get dude? Brod tricked me into eating it, and then got me to puke it up for kicks.\" Tyler said simply as he watched the little fish twist itself around, looking like it was dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ass.\" Luke said simply as he put his arms behind his head. \"That's kinda unlike him though to pull something like that though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing dude.\" Tyler said with a frown, still staring at the little fish in his palm. \"I bet Josh put him up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Luke replied with a smile, knowing all about the prank war Josh and Tyler were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now I gotta think of a way to get back at the bastard... maybe even Brody too.\" Tyler said, looking away from the little fish in his hand in thought. Luke, however looked back down at the little orange speck, curious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude what are you gonna do with the fish?\" Luke asked, lowering his arms and point a finger down in Tyler's hand. Tyler looked back down at it and simply shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, dude. Why you want it?\" Tyler replied, moving his hand closer to his buddy. Luke reached down, carefully pinching the little fish from it's tail and held it menacingly up to his face. \"What are you gonna do with it, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna eat it!\" Luke said with a toothy smile as he moved it closer toward his mouth. \"First step at getting back at Brody and Josh is we gotta eat the old joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled, thinking he should have just done that himself after Brody walked out. Deciding Luke should do it however, Tyler was very appreciative of his enthusiasm. Tyler watched as Luke opened his mouth and held the little critter facing down into the cavern below. Tyler rubbed his chin as Luke's antics actually gave him an idea, one involving getting Brody to drink the fish by mistake.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler shrugged, deciding to just let Luke do what he wanted with the fish. After all Tyler was just glad to see he had an ally as enthusiastic as Luke in this prank war. Considering Josh had Brody on his side, Tyler knew he'd need all the help he can get. Regardless Tyler refocused his attention to Luke, just as he dropped the tiny little fish from his fingers straight down into his gaping mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed, still trapped in inside the tight mascot outfit. Landing with a wet splat, Josh squirmed and flailed, barely realizing what was happening after he was finally freed from Tyler's reeking stomach. Based off what the giants were talking about, Josh guessed he was being eaten yet again, this time by Luke instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Luke! Brody! Ty--\" Josh was cut off almost immediately as he was easily swished to the back of Luke's massive mouth. Thanks to the costume, Josh could barely see what was going on as all he could really do was listen as the sounds changed from moist saliva swishing to a terrifying gulp. Now sliding downward, Josh knew he was in for a third journey into someone's digestive system today. Josh knew there was no use in struggling by now. It was sad to say, Josh knew the drill by now, he was completely helpless whether it was Tyler or Luke, he knew he couldn't escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at peace with the situation, Josh tried not to panic as he was finally deposited in the massive cavern of Luke's stomach. As if by some sick irony, Josh noticed the zipper to the costume had finally dislodged, allowing him to take of the Flubsy costume at last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of good that does.\" Josh said to himself, a little depressed as he pulled his face out taking in a breath of Luke's foul stomach air. Trying to take what little good was coming out of this though, Josh merely sat in the shell of the costume, separating himself from whatever disgusting half digested sludge was below him. Josh looked up as Luke's stomach started to churn, moaning loudly with faint gurgles surrounding him. Josh shivered, hoping someone would miraculously come to his aid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda weird how small that fish was.\" Luke said to Tyler, having just finished swallowing it moments ago. Luke rubbed his bare abs softly before resting his hands behind his head with a smile. \"I don't think I've even seen a fish that small actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was like a baby or something?\" Tyler shrugged, not really caring too much about the dumb fish he was tricked into puking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well now I feel a little bad, dude.\" Luke chuckled as he looked down at his abs. \"You think it was just a baby? I mean it had to be, it was soooo small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't feel too bad, bro. It was like as big as Josh. We should've kept the fish and fed Josh to it!\" Tyler joked, wondering if the fish was in fact the same size or not as Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro that wouldn't be cool, how would we get him out?\" Luke wondered. \"I mean you eating him earlier was fine. You're not a dumb fish and knew you could puke em up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was just kidding, dude.\" Tyler chuckled, patting Luke on the shoulder. \"I wouldn't want to put him in any <i>real</i> danger, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, alright dude.\" Luke chuckled as he looked back down at his stomach. \"Besides I doubt that little squirt is gonna last much longer even if we wanted him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, we'll come up with something funny.\" Tyler winked with a smile. \"For now why don't we...\"    </span></div></div>",

I wanna find Josh and Brody and tell them how lame their fish is.\" Tyler smirked as the two men made their way out of the break room and went to turn the corner back to the park. Sure enough, Brody still hadn't gone back inside yet as he was still outside, seemingly enjoying the nice weather before going back in. Tyler nudged Luke with a smile as the approached Brody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brod!\" Tyler called to Brody as he turned with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Mr. Gullible. Like that fish?\" Brody taunted, not knowing yet what happened to it. \"Bet it gave you a real earful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you consider flopping around looking like it's dying an earful... then yes.\" Luke laughed, not understanding what Brody was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Brody answered, not sure what Luke meant. \"So wait what did you do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care, didn't you say it cost you a nickle?\" Tyler crossed his arms, raising his eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so confused, bro.\" Brody frowned. \"He took off the costume right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Costume?\" Luke tilted his head looking at Tyler as both men looked confused. \"Is this part of your prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, bro. I'm dead serious what did you do with that fish?\" Brody said sternly, looking very seriously at Luke and Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate it.\" Luke answered plainly, like it wasn't a big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you have to puke it up.\" Brody started to panic, looking Luke dead in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? So you can trick me, like you did Ty? No thanks!\" Luke gloated proudly nudging Tyler in the side before leaning on his slightly taller friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro that fish is Josh! He was wearing a costume to fool Ty. That was supposed to be the prank.\" Brody tried to explain. \"He must've had trouble getting the costume off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Tyler simply looked at each other, very skeptical. \"That doesn't make any sense, dude. Why would he want me to eat him again?\" Tyler asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was supposed to be a prank, like he wanted to fool you into it and make you look dumb!\" Brody continued to explain, with little avail. \"Look bro, there's just no time, Luke you have to puke him up or else he's gonna be toast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, dude. You're lying.\" Luke frowned, despite the urgency on Brody's face. \"You're not tricking us twice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit dude. It's... fishy.\" Tyler chuckled a little at his own pun. \"Do you have proof?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody fidgeted for a moment. There wasn't any way he could think to prove it was Josh stewing inside Luke's stomach besides actually getting the little guy out of there. \"Bro the proof is in Luke's stomach. Just puke him up. I swear you'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked unwavered. As Brody shoved his hand into his pocket, pulling out his wallet. Handing Luke a crisp new 50$ bill, Brody folded back up his wallet and looked at Luke seriously again. \"There, paid up front. Puke him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked at Tyler and shrugged. \"Well prank or not, 50$ is 50$.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke made his way over to some grass and knelt down into it, shoving his fingers down his throat, starting to gag. Brody bit his lip as he listened to Luke gag and spit as Tyler stood there, crossed arms with an unamused expression on his face. Minutes passed and finally Luke stopped, fishing through his vomit before he retrieved what appeared to be a tiny almost limp speck. Looking at the unmoving speck for a moment, Luke definitely recognized it as Josh before thankfully the tiny man stirred, shaking his head as he regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit.\" Luke stood up and walked Josh over to Brody and Tyler. \"I thought he was dead for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good he's ok. Plus he got that costume off!\" Brody smiled as he looked at Josh struggle laying there trying to find his bearings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler walked over and looked down at Josh in Luke's hand with a smirk. \"Well looks like your prank backfired a second time buddy.\" He said arrogantly to Josh as the tiny man finally sat up and looked at Tyler. \"Can't wait to see what you try next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler motioned to Luke that they were leaving. Luke simply handed Josh over to Brody, feeling a little bad that he nearly killed their boss, but shaking it off as he went to follow Tyler. Josh laid his head back down in Brody's huge palm, covering his face as sun shined down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do, Brody?\" Josh asked the huge dark haired giant as he walked them back into the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno bro. You seem seem like you've had kind of a long day.\" Brody said, looking concerned at his sullen boss. \"It's lucky they ran into me. Plus I had to give Luke 50$ to get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Josh frowned. \"I'll pay you back. It's my fault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, bro. I'm just glad you're safe!\" Brody smiled as Josh stopped slumping and sat up to look at Brody's handsome face. \"So what are you going to do now, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come up with a different prank, I guess.\" Josh shrugged, knowing if he gave up now he'd never hear the end of it from Tyler. \"Things can't get much worse than being eaten three times in one day, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You're probably used to it by now, bro!\" Brody added, trying to add light to the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess it's gotten to the point where it's more thrilling than scary.\" Josh answered honestly. Knowing as long as he had someone looking out for him he didn't have anything to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, that gives me an idea!\" Brody smiled as he looked at Josh excitedly. \"Fair warning though, it involves you getting eaten again, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Josh shrugged, feeling lit it wasn't a big deal at this point. \"Just keep an eye on me ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise!\" Brody answered with a thumbs up. \"Alright bro, here's the plan. This time we have Tyler watch you get accidentally eaten by...\"       </span></div></div>",

Josh nodded his head. It made sense. Out of any one else in the park Brett definitely liked seeing Luke squirm more than anyone else. Josh wasn't entirely sure why Brett had such distaste for Luke, but Brody was right. They could use it to their advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll have to find him. I'm sure he'll be on board.\" Josh smiled confidently, wondering what the next step was after they got Brett. \"I'll get him to meet us in the interview room, like we did earlier.

Sure enough, Josh sat on the tiny side of the balcony to the room with Brody sitting in the interviewee's chair before Brett came through the door walking up beside Brody. He was 6'5\" with mid length shaggy brown hair and blue eyes. The 22 year old stud had a lean and ascetic build compared to Brody's more bulky lacrosse build. He truly sculpted his body extremely well as he often showed off his 8 pack on his long abdomen. Brett also had a tattoo of some Japanese symbols on left pec. \"Courage\" and \"Strength\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this all about?\" Brett asked as Brody stood up and looked over at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bear with me Brett.\" Josh started out, knowing Brett was typically more of cool and serious type of guy. Not much of a joker. \"But Tyler and I are locked in a bit of a prank war... and he kind of been turning the tables on me at every turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? A prank war?\" Brett shook his head. \"Honestly boss. I wasn't expecting this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was harmless stuff at first. But Tyler kept figuring me out, on purpose or not. And well...\" Josh started to say before feeling like it sounded stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got eaten by Tyler twice. Plus Luke ate him once too.\" Brody finished for Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke?\" Brett's eyes lit up like a fire was suddenly ignited, totally ignoring the fact that Josh had been eaten three times and somehow survived. \"He's involved in all of this?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah him and Tyler have been working together.\" Josh elaborated, hoping it would inspire Brett to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good on you boss.\" Brett smirked egotistically. \"You came to Brod and I for help and not that moron Luke. Clearly you wanted the top minds on your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, glad to see Brett was willing to help as Brody turned to Brett with a happy grin. \"Bro, you think I'm smart, Brett?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Brod.\" Brett grinned at Brody. \"Then again we're comparing you to Luke and Tyler right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're definitely not the sharpest pair.\" Josh added, knowing his best friend was definitely pretty dull witted sometimes and Luke was more hyperactive than he was a thinker. \"Brody on the other hand, has a plan. Specifically said we needed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bro.\" Brody started to explain. \"So our little buddy here has found himself in some... well... stomachs. So my plan is to have Josh tell Luke and Tyler that he \"gives up\" and they he bought them a pizza or something as a reward. I'll tell them myself so they're extra suspicious. Meanwhile we'll have Josh planted on the pizza. Then just as Luke and Ty come in to see the pizza they'll probably be pretty leery about it. That's where Brett come in \"stumbling\" across the pizza and intentionally grabbing Josh's slice making sure for Luke and Tyler to see Josh on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Brett nods his head. \"Then I pretend to eat Josh. Then one of two things happen. They try to stop me or they let me do it. Either way, jokes on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I knew you'd be the right man for the job, bro!\" Brody patted Brett on the shoulder proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pretty devious plan.\" Brett smirked. \"Good job, Brod.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, feeling like everything was going to come together. The three men nodded, knowing their roles as they prepared for the prank to finally get back at Tyler and Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by as Josh found himself sitting on a slice of pizza. Josh certainly felt the irony, seeing as he bought a pizza for Tyler earlier today, and now here he was sitting on a different pizza waiting to be \"eaten\". Josh sat in the closed box, knowing Brett was just outside, waiting for Luke and Tyler to inevitably show up. The warm air made Josh feel a little sleepy, but he tried to to doze as he continued waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brett sat at the table legitimately feeling hungry with the smell of pizza next to him. Yawning as he waited for the two dummies to show up. Eventually...        </span></div></div>",

His eyes perked with interest as he recognized it as a cute girl he met the other day. It wasn't unusual for the devilishly handsome stud to get call from cute girls, but Brett figured it was worth walking away for a minute to answer. Just going over to the gym and headed in deeper to the locker room, Brett figured he was close enough to come back in to the break room as soon as he was finished with his call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the warm air had completely gotten to Josh by now. The day had been long for the tiny man as he easily drifted off to sleep in the cheesy smelling pizza box. Finally however, Tyler and Luke made their way into the break room, looking for traps or buckets that may be part of some lame prank Josh and Brody concocted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over at the kitchen table seeing just a lone pizza box sitting on the table. \"I don't buy it, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think he did to it?\" Luke asked Tyler as he cautiously approached the box. Tyler walked past Luke up to the box, slowly and quietly opening it up before looking down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Tyler puzzled. \"I dunno doesn't smell funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing weird on it.\" Luke checked the pizza carefully scanning over Josh's sleeping body as he nestled deeper into the warm cheese in his nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Maybe he really has had enough.\" Tyler thought aloud to Luke. \"That doesn't explain why Brody was acting so suspicious about it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, dude.\" Luke shrugged, looking down at the pizza still, feeling really hungry. \"Maybe the boss was just too embarrassed to tell us in person, but Brody wanted to make us worry as one last jab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right.\" Tyler nodded his head in agreement. He felt silly for being worried over nothing as he looked down at the delicious greasy pizza. Both men looked at each other, mouths watering as they couldn't help but hover over the pizza any longer. Both grabbing a slice, they simultaneously devour it almost instantaneously before grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stirred from his cheesy sleep, finding he couldn't really move much now that he was settled in the warm sticky substance. Blinking briefly Josh looked up seeing the handsome face of Luke. His gorgeous green eyes and shaved blonde head were unmistakable as they got closer and closer. Quickly, Josh realized he was actually fastly approaching the stud's mouth, being shoved in with the pizza before he even had a chance to scream. Josh squirmed in fear s Luke chewed up the pizza with an incredible pace. However, the huge man clearly was more interested in getting more food in his mouth than he was letting it just sit there to be chewed as he pushed it to the back of his throat in a tremendous gulp, sending Josh in a total plummet down Luke's gullet once again. Josh couldn't believe his bad luck. It was official. Tyler and Luke had both eaten him twice in one day, making a total of four trips into these men's stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's four times too many!\" Josh cried aloud as the half chewed pizza was plopped down into Luke's hungry belly. Still stuck to the cheese, Josh could do nothing more than stay where he was, listening to Luke's laughter and loud chewing and gulping noises come from above. Josh was truly at a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did Brett go!?\" Josh called out into the darkness. A faint glorping noise called back to him. It seemed Luke's stomach wasn't too interested in Josh's worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brett...             </span></div></div>",

Much to his surprise however, he saw both Tyler and Look hovering over and empty box of pizza, licking their fingers as they easily finished it in no time. Brett nearly dropped his phone in shock as he saw the two, looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, this wasn't supposed to happen.\" Brett could barely say as he looked from the box to the two buffoons before him. \"Ok, both of you sit the fuck down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... since when do you give me orders Brett?\" Tyler asked trying to push his authority over Brett. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. Sit. Down.\" Brett said menacing as both men looked nervous and pulled out chairs and looked back to Brett. \"Ok. Good. Now who ate the piece set between 2 and 3 o'clock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Luke and Tyler bother muttered looking at each other as Brett rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one in the top right facing the door to the break room.\" Brett elaborated, forgetting who he was dealing with for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we remember.\" Tyler argued. \"We just ate, dude. Besides what's it matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, that was the piece I was supposed to pretend to eat in front of you guys. It had Josh planted on it.\" Brett explained, feeling a little bad the whole prank was ruined now. \"But now... yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of us ate him?\" Luke laughed a little. \"Again? Oh my god he must be so pissed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I hear three failed pranks?\" Tyler gloated as he gave Luke a fist bump. \"So wait where were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... had to take a phone call.\" Brett rubbed the back of his head embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't know who's dumber. You walking off or Brod phoning in the other prank before Josh got that suit off.\" Tyler laughed loudly to himself as he nudged Luke in his side. \"Seriously you guys make this shit too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real, dude!\" Luke laughed with Tyler. \"He sucks at picking people to help him prank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett fumed, angry he was being chastised by literally the two dumbest guys who work at the park. \"Screw both of you! I'm out of here. Just one of you puke him up. That's all I care about. I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett walked out of the break room, clearly flustered by Tyler and Luke's mocking. The two pizza stuffed studs couldn't help but laugh a little more to themselves as the door shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, he didn't even stick around to make sure we got Josh out ok.\" Tyler said, wiping a tear of laughter from his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, dude. Let's just get this over with.\" Luke shrugged, dreading needing to both vomit to figure out who accidentally ate their tiny boss. Tyler sighed, knowing Luke was right. They couldn't just leave Josh, no matter how funny it was. Thankfully the break room had sinks and buckets for the men to use. Doing what they were used to at this point, Luke and Tyler started to throw up once again, knowing one of them had to be harboring a little extra meat in one of their bellies. Finally, Luke noticed a squirming speck among his gruesome looking vomit, signaling to Tyler to cease his own vomiting. Luke pulled Josh out, bringing him over to the kitchen table and setting him down as him and Tyler sat down in front of him, arrogant smirks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is strike three.\" Tyler said looking down at a sullen looking Josh. \"You can't keep this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I?\" Josh spat back at Tyler, not knowing he was suddenly giving a set number of strikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine dude. Don't give up. With your current track record I guess you'll end up in my stomach next.\" Tyler mocked Josh leaning back and putting his hands behind his head. \"I can save you the trouble and just eat you right now if you'd like? I'm kinda starting to enjoy this shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna be a huge asshole if I give up then?\" Josh asked sheepishly, hoping his friend would go easy on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that.\" Tyler smirked as he leaned forward again. \"In fact if you give up Luke and I win. So I'll decide what we get if you do pussy out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laid on his back, exhausted. He knew he had to make a choice. He was corned without Brody or Brett to help him. Josh knew however he had to...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh started to stand up and walk away from the too hysterical giants. He was sick of the two of them acting so entitled after all. Josh's retreat would be fairly short lived as Tyler lowered a hand in front of Josh, blocking him from any direction other than back at himself and Luke. Josh stopped, turning around to look at Tyler, rolling his eyes, knowing the two of them hadn't had their fill of mocking Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're going somewhere?\" Tyler leaned into Josh in a condescending tone. \"I told you I'd save you the trouble, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a jerk about it.\" Josh crossed his arms. \"Just let me go so I can come up with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm not being a jerk.\" Tyler retreated his hand, putting it on his chest and fake looking like he was offended. \"I'm just trying to help you out, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah boss!\" Luke chimed in with a goofy smirk. \"At this point I'd even help you out! We could go three for three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great you too Luke?\" Josh sighed, disappointed both men were really enjoying Josh's failures today. \"Come on guys, let me go. This isn't fair. I'm being ganged up on right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we aren't ganging up on you.\" Tyler lied. \"I'm just trying to save you the trouble of coming up with a ridiculous plan that's just gonna wind you up in one of our stomachs.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, it's like your plans always involve you wanting us to eat you!\" Luke smiled and laughed a little. \"It's like you have a thing for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just been bad luck!\" Josh blushed, feeling like Luke wasn't completely wrong as it was kind of thrilling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" Tyler shrugged, being honest about it. \"Not gonna lie, after the first time I swallowed you I've been wanting to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you did...\" Josh reminded Tyler, back when he was dressed as a fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't know it was you!\" Tyler retorted. \"And neither did Luke either time he did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude! I thought you were a fish too. Plus the second time actually was an accident!\" Luke added with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it matter?\" Josh looked at the two, dumbfounded that they were really pointing out small details about Josh has or hasn't been eaten by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it matters because it determines which of us is gonna eat you up next.\" Tyler replied, looking at Josh like he was dumb. Tyler turned to Luke and ignored Josh's pissed off expressions. \"So how are we going to decide this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should just go for it, bro!\" Luke smiled at Tyler, offering up Josh like a piece of food. \"I can always just eat him next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sweet!\" Tyler gave a passionate looking smile at Luke as he put a hand on his heart. Tyler reached down for Josh, who immediately tried to squirm away with absolutely no avail. Tyler easily closed his hand around Josh and felt him squirm inside his closed fist. \"That's cute, he thought he could get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Doesn't he realize by now how small he is?\" Luke mocked Josh as he feebly continued to fight inside Tyler's fist. Luke watched as Tyler held Josh up toward his mouth, opening his fist and looking down at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRPP!\" Tyler ripped an enormous burp right on Josh just before popping the tiny man into his foul smelling mouth. Tyler swished him around a little with a smirk as Luke couldn't help but chuckle at Tyler's burp. Tyler kept his lips shut and pressed his fist against them as he did a closed mouth burp with Josh feeling the full force inside. \"Man sorry dude. Just trying to make room down there for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh dazed, all the burps and the arrogant actions. He wasn't sure if he should be furious or not. But part of him actually found the whole experience extremely exciting. Josh slipped and squirmed on Tyler's tongue, knowing there wasn't anything he could do to fight his giant friend's powerful mouth. The fact that he was so helpless actually made the experience all the more invigorating as Tyler swished Josh around a little closer to the back of his throat, clearly the giant was enjoying if not more than Josh himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Josh knew Tyler didn't care if he would give up or not. He knew his giant friend wanted to swallow him, and the funny thing was Josh wanted to be swallowed by his friend at this point. Josh waited with baited breath as Tyler motioned him closer and closer to the back of his throat before finally lurching his tongue, gulping Josh down with absolute ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pressed a finger against his throat, knowing he just sent his friend down very deliberately down it. Having enjoyed every moment of it, Tyler leaned back in his chair, relaxing and closing his eyes, trying to feel Josh squirm his way down into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Luke asked, looking at a very satisfied Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, dude.\" Tyler replied opening his eyes and looking from Luke down to his ripped abdomen. \"There's something really satisfying about just eating him like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky, dude.\" Luke looked at Tyler with jealousy. \"What do I do when you bring him back up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to you dude.\" Tyler shrugged, not really feeling like bringing Josh up for awhile. \"He'd probably be pissed if you ate him right away. But all the more power to you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I probably will, dude.\" Luke smirked leaning back and stretching out like Tyler. \"It'll be the first time I do it, knowing I'm doing it too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty sweet dude.\" Tyler smirked, putting a hand down on his stomach and patting it softly a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men continued to talk back and fourth, laughing and joking about Josh being trapped within Tyler's stomach.

For some reason it really made no intention of causing Josh any harm as it barely made any notice that Josh had slipped inside the gigantic chamber. It seemed like it was mostly just recovering from Tyler throwing up just minutes earlier for the third time today. Josh chuckled, feeling like it was kind of amusing that the mighty Tyler's stomach seemed like it was finally tiring out. Faint gurgles and churns erupted around Josh as Tyler's stomach started to contract, a motion Josh was almost all to familiar with at this point that he was going to be thrown up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\" Josh said out loud, almost disappointed he had to leave the warm almost safe feeling interior of his friend. The contractions got more and more violent as Josh felt himself being push out of the stomach, up Tyler's throat. Horrible gagging noises from above sounded almost painful as Josh continued to rush upward until finally light broke to Josh's eyes as he was flowing almost like down a very fast river into a puddle of disgusting mushed food and vomit. Josh looked up just as it looked like Tyler was going to throw up more on top of him before his eyes locked on the tiny man, weakly pulling him out into the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you throw me up soon?\" Josh asked, as he was legitimately enjoying the rhythmic churns of Tyler's stomach. Tyler made a silly expression and double took down at Josh for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dude?\" Tyler chuckled. \"You were supposed to be all pissed and shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, jokes on you. I enjoyed it.\" Josh crossed his arms proudly feeling like he finally got Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude, jokes on you <i>I</i> enjoyed it.\" Tyler argued wanting Josh to be the one to get pranked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... so if you enjoyed it and I enjoyed it...\" Josh fumbled. \"Then who got pranked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of you, dude.\" Luke added in, standing beside Tyler now as he came over to be part of the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what? It's not really as funny if you like it, dude.\" Tyler mumbled, kind of upset it wasn't as torturous to Josh anymore.Josh shrugged, feeling like it wasn't his fault he started to enjoy something so absurd.  \"Well either way, I'm done for today dude. My throat hurts like hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine's fine!\" Luke chimed in excitedly as he looked over at Josh. \"Plus I've got room for you, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that we wanna do though?\" Tyler looked away from Josh to Luke. \"I mean, he literally likes it when we eat him now. The prank's kind of lost it's charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just forget about the prank war, bro. Besides you and I won it pretty handily.\" Luke gloated as he looked down at Josh. \"I'm sure the boss would be pretty happy about that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, dude. But he did seem pretty determined to get back at us.\" Tyler conversed with Luke without looking at Josh at all. \"I guess we could let him off easy and let him spend some time in your guts, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound so sure, dude.\" Luke frowned, not wanting to just do it because it was some half ass thing they wanted to do. \"We can set the little guy free and let him try and prank us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be pretty funny.\" Tyler smiled, wanting to see Josh's next pathetic attempt to prank the two superior giants. \"But I guess the prank war is getting pretty old too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you sound so tired.\" Luke laughed a little looking at Tyler's semi-exhausted expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine dude!\" Tyler smiled, perking up and trying to work up a little energy. \"But I guess we could just pick this shit up fresh tomorrow too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke slanted his jaw slightly, feeling like he should make a choice. \"Alright dude, let's...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Between Tyler losing his edge and tiring out, to the both of them realizing they were into this whole being eaten thing, Josh was mostly just in a bit of a daze. \"Guess being eaten like five times in one day will do that to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat back, not really sure what do do but start thinking about what he could possibly do for another prank. After all every prank so far he's done has been some kind of collaboration with Brody or Brett. Thought's clouded, Josh could merely just think about what being inside Tyler's stomach right now would be like. Snapping Josh back into reality, Josh looked up as the break room door opened up again as Josh saw the familiar form of Brody enter the room. Josh watched as Brody somehow spotted him over on the counter as he made his way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh how'd it go, bro?\" Brody asked casually as he pulled over a chair and sat in front of Josh at the counter. \"I saw Luke and Ty leave. Ty seemed a little exhausted, bro. I haven't seen Brett at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Brett made a little mistake and Tyler and Luke happened to come in at just the wrong time.\" Josh tried to explain as Brody sat quietly, wanting to hear the story. \"Luke ate me by mistake just as Brett was coming back. Then they must've done something to upset him because he wasn't here when they got me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Brett.\" Brody turned his head a little. \"I'm sorry bro. I should've checked in sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not all...\" Josh started to say as Brody looked at him intently again. \"Tyler kind of just grabbed me afterwards and ate me again right away. Said he'd save me the trouble of getting myself eaten again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody chuckled slightly. \"I'm sorry bro, but that is kind of classic Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was fine. At the risk of sounding weird, I almost feel like I don't mind this whole getting eaten thing.\" Josh decided to admit to Brody. \"It was scary at first but under controlled circumstances I think it's kind of neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody nodded his head in understanding and laughed. \"Too bad I didn't actually eat you way back when the prank war started then, huh bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too Brody!\" Josh looked at the lax bro with a little concern as he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries bro! I'm on your side!\" Brody laughed as he waved his hands in an apologetic manner. \"Though this all gives me an idea of how we can finally turn this around on them tomorrow, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You have a plan?\" Josh asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, actually, bro.\" Brody held up two fingers. \"One is that we dress a safety dummy up like you and get one of them to eat it thinking it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, brilliant, so that way when they don't get \"me\" up they'll feel really guilty and stupid.\" Josh understood the plan easily. \"What's the other plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little more risky, bro.\" Brody crossed his arms. \"We get them to think they ate you, but really you'll be in my stomach face timing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, then I \"die\" in their stomach and disconnect and send them into a panic.\" Josh caught on to both ideas with ease. \"But meanwhile you'll be able to get me out safely without them even knowing better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a smart one, bro.\" Brody winked at Josh handsomely. \"So yeah, I mean you can pick whichever plan you want, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh crossed his arms in thought as he head Brody trail off quietly under his breath, \"I know what one I want you to pick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say Brody?\" Josh asked, barely catching the giant's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that I'm good with whatever you pick, bro!\" Brody smiled as Josh kind of got the impression that's not what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in thought again, Josh decided he wanted to go with the plan involving...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh pondered for a moment. The idea of being eaten by Brody certainly interested him, seeing as he's only been in the stomach of his enemies. Being within his ally might actually make the plan work. Not only that, but Josh also couldn't help but look up at Brody's magnificent body and could only scarcely imagine being inside his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we have me face time them from your stomach?\" Josh tried to ask casually as Brody looked momentarily very excited before composing himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sweet bro. I like that idea too.\" Brody stumbled a little over his words. \"So what's the plan, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you meet me in the interview room, like we did with the fish costume.\" Josh offered as an idea. \"I'll plant some doughnuts in the break room or something. Knowing them they wouldn't be able to resist and figure I'd be in the food somewhere anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea, bro!\" Brody gave Josh a thumbs up. \"You can spy on them and see when they start eating, I'll just wait in the other room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Josh smiled up at Brody. \"Then I guess I'll see you tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro!\" Brody patted his abdomen with a smile. \"This time you've got a date with <i>my</i>  stomach, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well I look forward to it!\" Josh smiled, honestly a little excited. Heading home, Josh figured tomorrow couldn't come soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Josh whispered to himself. Everything was in place exactly how he envisioned. A fresh box of doughnuts sat on the table in the break room, complete with a little note from Josh to Tyler and Luke. Now Josh laid in wait as he stood on the balcony, shrunk, near the entrance to the tiny side of the break room, waiting for a pair of giants to come through the door and see the box. Sure enough, as if on cue, Josh heard the loud footsteps, and familiar loud laughter of Tyler as he made his way through the door, followed by and talking to Luke. Josh smiled, as it didn't take long for the men to spot the box of doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Tyler and Luke, you guys are the best, love Josh.\" Tyler read the note in a higher pitched voice in an attempted to mock Josh. \"How much you wanna bet he's in the box, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I ain't taking that bet. I think it's a given!\" Luke laughed as he opened the box, seeing a few rows of different doughnuts. \"Well we don't wanna disappoint him, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro!\" Tyler laughed as he grabbed a doughnut, shoving over half of it in his mouth and nearly swallowing it in one gulp. \"Mmmpf, I hope he was in that bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got and moved finally, figuring it wouldn't take them long to devour the sweet breakfast. Making his way over next door to the interview room, he saw Brody there, ready and waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss.\" Brody greeted him. \"You ready, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be!\" Josh smiled as he watched Brody pop a few things in his mouth before taking a large chug of water. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Just tums and water, bro.\" Brody smiled at Josh. \"I didn't really eat this morning, so I figured it'd make my gut a little less dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea!\" Josh smiled at Brody, glad he was one of the smarter members of his crew. Josh watched as Brody finished off his bottle of water and wiped his mouth. Now the giant turned his attention of to Josh with a smirk as he lowered his hand and let Josh climb aboard. Nervously, but excited, Josh climbed on as rode the hand up past Brody's ripped abdomen and perfect chest before arriving at his smooth gorgeous face. Brody smiled a white toothy grin as he opened his mouth up a little and let his tongue out a bit before tilting Josh onto the pink slippery surface. Josh could do little more than watched as he was drawn into the mouth before Brody closed him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to have too much fun in there, bro!\" Brody's voice boomed over Josh as he took out his phone. Josh started up the camera, briefly admiring the life proof case he got last night on his phone as it held up perfectly against the moist interior of Brody's mouth. Josh Started to record a video, with his small but bright light as he was drawn into the back of the throat. Getting every detail, Josh remained silent as he recorded himself slip down Brody's throat in a large very audible gulp. Still recording and starting to pant a little, Josh shone his light all the way down, even when he was finally deposited with a wet splash into Brody's enormous stomach. Closing the video recorder, Josh couldn't help but smile a little to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet I'm the first person in history to record themselves being swallowed by another human...\"  He said to himself in excitement. Swapping now to face time, Josh sat back on the edge of one of the walls to Brody's stomach, hoping the light from his phone would catch a lot of detail. The phone rang loudly for a moment, before Tyler picked up. Josh could see Tyler clearly in his phone as he was ready to lay it on thick to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler! Oh good I'm so glad you picked up!\" Josh belted out his rehearsed line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you, dude?\" Tyler's eyebrow rose as he tried to make out Josh's weird looking surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in your stomach, dumb dumb! Or Luke's! I have no idea! It all happened so fast!\" Josh spoke quickly, trying to sound like he was in a panic. Tyler's response was to simply laugh as now Josh could see Luke's face in the video now as well. \"It's not funny! I don't know why this keeps happening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the shitty plan this time, boss?\" Luke chuckled as Tyler still laughed a little. \"We just assumed you wanted us to eat you, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You see Brody was supposed to pop in and 'eat' me and you guys were supposed to notice and try and stop him. He must be running late.\" Josh made up the false plan as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that is a bad plan.\" Tyler came out finally from his laughter. \"We would've just let him eat you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well clearly we didn't even get that far.\" Josh argued with Tyler, as if it was the actual plan. \"Look can you guys just figure out who ate me and get me out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You seem fine.\" Tyler mocked Josh, all according to Josh's plan. \"I wanna know who it is though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took a free hand an started slapping Luke on the gut a little and looked back to his phone for a reaction from Josh. Josh did nothing, as he bit his lip, not planning for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not Luke huh? Must be me then!\" Tyler said triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you always get to eat him!\" Luke looked a bit disappointed. Tyler merely smiled as he looked back to his phone at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tyler burped loudly, Josh shook around his phone a little and acted like it was making a big ruckus in the stomach, despite Brody's stomach being nothing but peaceful and calm. Tyler rubbed his stomach while looking at his phone. Looking closely at Josh Tyler...         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler's eyes narrowed as he looked a little closer at Josh, feeling like the reaction was far too scripted. \"Yo Josh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Ty? Please just get me out of here! My skin is starting to itch!\" Josh lied, as the water and tums Brody took seemed to make his stomach perfectly habitable for seemingly a long period of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do me a favor and tell me how many times I tap my stomach?\" Tyler smirked as he kept the camera focused on his face before moving his arm down off camera to his abs. Josh waited a moment as he stared at Tyler's face waiting for some kind of cue. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four times!\" Josh took a wild guess, hoping somehow it was right. Tyler simply chuckled and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try zero, liar.\" Tyler smugly laughed, figuring Josh out. \"What did you make a little setup to look like a stomach, is that a green screen or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, he's probably at home hiding under a blanket!\" Luke laughed as he tried to peek at Tyler's phone. Josh bit his lip and started to panic a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely hear you guys! It's so gurgly and gross in here! Please you have to help me!\" Josh tried to plead, hoping Tyler's soft side might show. Josh was disappointed as he words were only met with laughter. Josh quickly acted like Brody's stomach started churning violently and covered his phone and screamed. \"Oh god the acid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hung up the cal land sat still for a minute, waiting for the buzz of his phone or a call from Tyler in some way. Nothing but the gentle gurgles of Brody's stomach to give him any sounds, Josh felt like he should give up, knowing Tyler and Luke were actually too smart and figured it out. Josh sighed as he pulled up Brody's name on his phone, sending him a text to let him out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think it worked, bro?\" Brody asked as he finished coughing up Josh, watching the tiny man dry off a little on the balcony of the interviewing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... he thought I was in front of a green screen or something.\" Josh responded, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, bro? I figured it would look so real, considering it was.\" Brody laughed a little, giving his stomach a little rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't the problem, I think. More so he was doing stuff like burping or patting his stomach and he could see my acting wasn't very believable.\" Josh clarified, watching Brody stretch a little in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, bro.\" Brody responded, kneeing down now and trying to be at eye level with Josh. \"I guess the next question is, what do we do now, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I probably have to go face Tyler and Luke...\" Josh sighed, knowing that it was something he'd have to inevitably have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw that, bro.\" Brody waved his hand in disagreement. \"They're just gonna make fun of you. You should just stay with me, bro.  We can go to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh was today your day off?\" Josh suddenly realized. \"Wow, I'm a lousy boss making you come in on your day off for a prank...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you owe me then, bro!\" Brody laughed, clearly joking. Josh couldn't help but smile as he looked at Brody's handsome face. The offer to just leave was tempting, but Josh knew he'd have to face Tyler and Luke eventually.

I almost feel bad after all the hanging out in work we've been doing lately that we haven't done any out of work, bro!\" Brody continued to smile, making Josh feel a little bad he never asked to hang out in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I feel bad...\" Josh looked down a little. \"You've been so good to me lately coming up with plans too. Plus coming in on your day off and everything. You even wore your uniform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, I had to be authentic in case I ran into Tyler or Luke, bro!\" Brody rubbed the back of his head with a smirk. \"Like I said you, owe me one, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I absolutely do! I don't know if hanging out with you is exactly proper payment though!\" Josh joked, feeling like he really did want to owe Brody something at some point later in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a start, bro!\" Brody chuckled as he reached down and snatched Josh into the palm of his hand. Sitting in the giant palm, Josh felt like he was really starting to feel accustomed to being handled by giants at this point. Josh sat still as he watched Brody walk out the back door, having an amazing bird's eye view of walking out into the big open world. The pair made their way to an expensive looking convertible, which Brody unlocked and got inside, setting Josh down on the seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I nearly forgot Brody came from a wealthy family...\" Josh thought to himself as Brody put on a sleek pair of sunglasses and grabbed a tank top out from his back seat to throw over his bare chest. Josh didn't know where to stare, from the side angle of Brody's handsome face with his sunglasses to his huge biceps sticking out of his loose tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buckle up, bro! We're gonna make a quick stop on our way to my place.\" Brody peeked down at Josh with a smile as he started up the engine. Just then Josh heard a different growl, coming more from Brody than from the car. Brody chuckled as he rested a hand on his stomach. \"It's for food, I'm starving, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, that's another thing you did for me that you didn't have to...\" Josh said, unsure if Brody could hear him from this distance or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, bro? Engine is kind of loud. Plus the wind.\" Brody remarked as he stared driving and the sound of the wind blowing was pretty loud in the convertible. Brody pulled into a McDonald's and ordered a few egg muffin sandwiches before pulling into a parking spot and opening the bag and proceeding to stuff one of the sandwiches into his mouth. \"Now what were you saying, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just, you skipped breakfast for me on top of coming into work when you didn't have to.\" Josh shifted a little in the fibers of the cushy seat. \"I could've at least paid for your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro I ain't worried about money or waking up or anything.\" Brody laughed as he swallowed his food. \"Plus it was kind of neat having you be essentially part of my breakfast this morning, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that was pretty cool!\" Josh smiled, having recently started liking the adventurous idea of being swallowed by a giant. \"I'm glad you don't think it sounds weird, like I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's understandable, bro!\" Brody replied as he took a huge bite out of a second sandwich. \"Like you're always in control being the boss, but you're so small so it's super easy to do stuff like to you if any of us wanted to, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I never actually thought of it like that!\" Josh replied, interested. \"I just thought it was cool, like an adventure. But now that you mention it is an interesting role reversal with you guys from a boss-employee point of view!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro! Eating my boss is something I'd do most days!\" Brody swallowed down the rest of food before grabbing his third sandwich. \"Not that you're a bad boss, bro. Like I wouldn't wanna leave you down there, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's funny you say that. I forgot to mention it, but I recorded myself going down into your stomach earlier, if you wanna see your boss struggle down helplessly!\" Josh laughed, but also blushed a bit, feeling embarrassed about doing the recording in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, that sounds awesome! You have to send it to me!\" Brody leaned over to Josh like he was going to look at a phone, before forgetting how small Josh was. Josh pulled out his phone and attached the video to his conversation with Brody, waiting for it to send before watching Brody pull out his own phone and watch the video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, it's all shaky right before I swallowed! Were you nervous?\" Brody laughed as he watched Josh travel down his own throat before landing with a satisfying plunk into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was probably a little excited, guess I was shaking a bit!\" Josh laughed nervously, not realizing how obviously excited he was in the video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, bro. I just didn't want you to be nervous with me.\" Brody smiled, having finally finished his last sandwich. Josh watched as Brody rested his hand on his stomach and gave a casual burp. \"Ahhh so much better. More filling than what I had earlier too, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet! I don't think that even qualified as a snack earlier!\" Josh laughed, fine with putting himself down for Brody's entertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like when a little tiny fruit fly flies in your mouth and you accidentally swallow, bro.\" Brody leaned over to Josh as he started up his car with a smile. \"Little dude just doesn't stand a chance and he's got like no nutritional value, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed, knowing now that Brody was driving again he couldn't hear him if he wanted to talk. Instead, Josh just enjoyed the view of Brody, arm stretched over the wheel with his massive arm flexing every now and then. He couldn't help but feel like he was having a much better time with Brody and his casual teasing than he would have with Luke and Tyler and their more aggressive bullying. Relieved he didn't have to deal with it, Josh watched as Brody pulled into a massive driveway in a nice neighborhood not far from his own to a spectacular looking house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're here, bro! Home sweet home!\" Brody smiled as he reached down from Josh, scooping him into his hand again and holding him up a bit so he could see more clearly. Josh looked around at the massive front yard, noticing there were a pair of other cars, not as nice looking as Brody's convertible in the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those your cars too, Brody?\" Josh asked, kind of curious if he just owned a few spare cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro. One of them is my housemate's, Vinny. He's a cool dude, we went to prep school together and placed lax. The other is another dude's Vinny and I played lax with too, his name is Lyle, bro.\" Brody smiled, remembering that Lyle was staying with him and Vinny for a little bit. \"They're both pretty much living with me for the company, bro. Sucks having a big house all to yourself sometimes, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh swallowed, now a little nervous. He thought he'd just be spending time with Brody, not a few other guys he had never met before. Making their way inside, Brody looked around and the two men noticed that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Like explore and take a nap without being worried about being digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be cool, but I don't know if it's possible.\" Josh admitted, though he hasn't thoroughly researched it yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shrugged as he set Josh down on the kitchen counter and walked over the the refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of water. \"Just a thought, bro. The tums and water were a decent idea though, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh definitely, just from my experience in Tyler or Luke's stomachs. Yours was so much calmer and there wasn't acid all over trying to eat me.\" Josh tried to laugh, thinking about how much less terrifying Brody's stomach was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that, bro.\" Brody winked at Josh as he took a sip of his water. \"I've got more tums too, bro. But I kinda want my meal to settle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's no rush, besides like you said you're the one in control! Not me!\" Josh smiled as Brody walked up close to him at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and don't forget it, bug bro!\" Brody answered in a bit of an arrogant tone. Josh shuddered slightly as Brody's slight tone shift was actually quite enticing. \"If you aren't careful you could end up like those fruit flies I mentioned. Lost and forgotten in my belly, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed as he looked up at the giant, continuing to sip water as he looked down on him. \"Oh my god...\" Josh whispered to himself, barely able to contain himself over Brody's pure sexiness. Speaking up, Josh looked up to Brody. \"Yeah I wouldn't stand a chance for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, right bro. Sucks, because now I really do wanna eat ya again, bro.\" Brody shrugged as he walked away from Josh and looked outside. \"Maybe I'll...\"   </span></div></div>",

Brody laughed and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep apologizing and you and nap with me in my stomach, bro!\" Brody joked as he walked up close to Josh. \"Man I just sounded like Tyler right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you do need a nap then!\" Josh joked back, feeling like the comment was pretty Tyler-ish. \"I'll be fine, I'll just hang out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I feel bad, bro. You got like nothing to do.\" Brody thought for a moment before he turned and rummaged through some cabinets. Pulling out a plate and a few pieces of candy, Brody arranged them on the plate like a little play ground, even breaking open a milkyway so it's insides would be snack accessible. Brody set the plate down next to Josh and also took the cap from his water bottle and filled it with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, bro. Both a snack and and a playground! Plus some water!\" Brody looked down at the creation with pride. Meanwhile Josh felt kind of like he was a gerbil or something without the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Brody!\" Josh thanked the man, happy regardless of how he felt. \"Just have a nice nap okay? I'll call you if I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have to call a few times, bro. One I'm out I'm out, bro.\" Brody gave Josh a fair warning as he yawned again making his way out of the room. \"See ya in a bit, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely out of sight now, Josh sighed, feeling like hanging out with Brody wasn't going very well. Looking at the pile of sugary treats Brody laid out for him, Josh figured he could at least indulge a bit in them while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda cool looking.\" Josh admired as a piece of chocolate was used like a bridge going up the milkyway complete with a small marshmallow under neath like a landing pad. Grabbing a little candy and deciding to sit on the softness of the marshmallow, Josh relaxed as he pulled out his phone, scrolling about in a little boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by as Josh sunk into the marshmallow a little before he heard footsteps. Perking his head up, Josh looked as he saw enter the kitchen...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Easily having a good 5 inches on Brody's already impressively tall form, this guy also had muscle to show as he sauntered into the kitchen wearing only a pair of navy blue sweatpants with lacrosse sticks embroidered on the side as well as the number 20. Shirtless however, the giant showed a huge pair of pecs, bouncing with each step he took with tufts of blonde hair poking out between them trailing down to massive deep cut abs with hair fitted around his lower abdomen. Trailing down he clearly showed his underwear poking out, a bright red spandex in contrast to the navy blue as he sweatpants sagged quite significantly showing off a massive bubble butt as he walked past the counter and Josh. In awe, Josh looked up at the man's face, covered in blonde stubble with stern looking but with a wide mouth and happy expression leading up to a pair of bright blue eyes and finally a shaved on the sides head with a bit of hair messily scruffed across the very top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah this guy is massive!\" Josh tried to measure the guy up, but couldn't even begin to scarcely imagine his hieght. Josh could simply sit and watch in awe as the man went over to a coffee pot and add some grounds and turn it on. Josh couldn't help but to particularly stare at his massive ass, clad in red as if some kind of focal point. Josh shook a little as the giant spoke, in a deep relaxed and attractive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooo... I can't believe Brody and Vinny ain't up yet...\" Lyle said to himself as he yawned waiting for the coffee to brew. Shifting and bouncing a little impatiently, Lyle turned away as he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's Lyle.\" Josh guessed since he mentioned Vinny. Josh swallowed as the massive man was now looking right at him, or more accurately the pile of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this candy for?\" Lyle asked out loud walking toward the counter and grabbing the piece of chocolate, causing Josh to scream as he nearly knocked over the marshmallow. Lyle popped the candy in his mouth as he looked down and shrugged. \"Whatever, bro.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, meanwhile, did not feel safe in his current position. While lately he's been interested in the idea of being eaten, and while Lyle was particularly attractive, Josh wasn't so sure on being eaten by an unaware giant he didn't even know. Noticing Lyle was still looking down at the candy, Josh...    </span></div></div>",

Josh waved his arms from his perch on the marshmallow, yelling out as loud as he can to the oblivious massive muscular man. Josh watched Lyle's eyes squint a little as they seemed to narrow in on his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lyle said under his breath as Josh continued to wave frantically. \"That's a weird looking bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no bug!\" Josh yelled at the top of his lungs as Lyle looked away for a second, noticing his coffee was done. Josh put his arms down as Lyle turned his back, in the process of filling up a coffee cup before turning back around and setting the steaming cup down on the counter, taking a sip of it black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\" Lyle sighed as he looked again at the bug squirming about on the marshmallow. \"Thought to coffee would make it look less weird. Still kinda looks like some weird tiny person...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a tiny person!\" Josh yelled, reaching for his phone, tempted to call Brody to his rescue.

Sure enough as he brought Josh closer to him, he could plainly see all the makings of a tiny human. Head, 2 arms and legs, torso. Setting his cup down his eyebrows rose a little in shock as Josh waved at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa bro. It is a tiny person!\" Lyle's deep voice boomed out over Josh, the strong smell of coffee washing over him. \"Are you waving to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I'm so glad you noticed me!\" Josh called out to the giant with a happy grin, glad he wasn't going to have to frantically call Brody now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, bro. You can talk too?\" Lyle asked, as Josh felt like it was kind of a dumb question. He was human after all. \"Do you have a name little fella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh it's Josh!\" Josh tried to remain upbeat, despite the fact that Lyle was initially treating him like some sort of tiny animal rather than a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Josh, bro? Like Brod's buddy Josh?\" Lyle asked, raising an eyebrow as he took another gulp of his coffee. Josh however was a little surprised, he didn't know Brody talked about him at home, let alone considered him his bud. Josh couldn't help but smile at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Brody has told you about me?\" Josh asked, curious what Brody had said, now blushing a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro. He said he was real excited helping you out with a prank war.\" Lyle took another sip of his coffee while he looked up in thought trying to see what else he could recall. \"Said you use the park's shrinking whatever to be small more often than not, bro.  Then tried to prank some dude named Tyler? But he said you were accidentally eaten or something? Makes more sense now that I see how small you are, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that about sums it up. Tyler accidentally ate me once, deliberately he ate me twice though. This guy Luke accidentally ate me twice though too.\" Josh crossed his arms, now recalling all the times he's been sent screaming down Tyler or Luke's throats. Lyle simply chuckled a little as Josh gave away the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke. That's the other name I couldn't think of, bro. Shit's crazy though bro. You really went through all that?\" Lyle asked, once again taking a sip of his coffee while curious over this whole story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was kinda scary at first, but after while we tried to work it into the pranks.\" Josh tried to hide a little blush as it inadvertently ended up in his favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that you were gonna get fake eaten by Brod, right bro? How'd that go?\" Lyle asked, reaching around and grabbing another piece of chocolate and tossing it in his mouth. Slightly distracted by the action, Josh tried to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no he really ate me. We wanted it to be authentic when I called Tyler claiming he ate me. But he didn't buy my act. So instead I just had free trip into Brody's stomach for nothing.\" Josh tried to act disappointed about the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that sucks, bro. This is still wild though bro. I can't believe you're not scared of me. Especially sitting on a piece of food like that, bro!\" Lyle chuckled as he set the marshmallow down finally and scratched his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I guess I'm just used to it by now! Once you've seen one giant I guess you've seen em all.\" Josh lied, as he was quite entranced by the handsome stud. Suddenly, Lyle stood up, giving Josh a spectacular view of the giant as he tiled back the last of his coffee into his mouth, stretching back his abs and letting his pecs bounce gently as he lowered his head back. Josh couldn't help but stare as Lyle turned and once again gave him a magnificent view of his massive red clad bubble butt as he went and dropped his cup into the sink before making his way back to the table, standing in a looming fashion over Josh. Josh could do nothing but stare up in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so small all the way down there, bro.\" Lyle chuckled again with his deep voice. \"If I didn't know better I'd just eat the marshmallow. Could've been round seven or something for you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could've been!\" Josh yelled back up at him, almost disappointed it didn't happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have known though, bro.\" Lyle rubbed a hand on his huge abs. \"Would've been your last trip, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my phone with me actually. I just got a life proof case too since this has been happening to me so much lately!\" Josh tried to retort, feeling like he didn't want Lyle to think so lowly of him that he'd go out without a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's smart micro bro.\" Lyle yawned as he took his seat back down, making the view he was giving Josh much less intimidating but still very overwhelming from his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm not microscopic!\" Josh huffed a little at the sudden nickname. Lyle simply smiled and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you prefer something like crumb? Probably more fitting considered how many times people ate you, bro.\" Lyle crossed his arms over his massive chest as he chuckled. \"Besides I still called you smart, even though it's pretty dumb to end up in someone's stomach, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only on purpose once with Brody! Oh wait twice... with the fish suit...\" Josh trailed off. \"But yeah the case is supposed to survive anything. So far that includes stomach acid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, bro. That's sweet.\" Lyle lowered down a finger next to Josh. \"Can I see it? I just wanna see if I can even see it on my finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgment, Josh hesitated for a second. But Lyle seemed like a nice guy. Placing his trust in the massive man, Josh put it on his massive finger before him as he watched Lyle bring it up close to his face, squinting. Just then, Lyle... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Josh meanwhile stood by in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... did you do that?\" Josh asked, still in a little shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see if it would end up really being life proof, bro!\" Lyle smiled attractively. \"We can see if it still works when I shit it out, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to work...\" Josh barely said loud enough for the giant to hear. \"We'll never find it, you couldn't even see it on your finger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bro.

With relative ease, Lyle stuffed the whole marshmallow in his mouth, closing it inside as she let the sugary treat start to dissolve on his tongue. Feeling the food soak down into mush, Lyle cared very little about what it must be like for little Josh in there, if he had any oppositions he should have voiced them far sooner. After a few seconds the mush turned more into sugary liquid as he tilted his head back slightly and swallowed. Feeling the food disappear down his throat, Lyle simply shrugged, feeling like it wasn't very different from any other time he's ever eaten anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took far too long as Josh struggled and squirmed against the melting marshmallow until it became little more than a swimming pool of melted sugar. Feeling like an eternity went by in the massive man's mouth before the deafening sound of the gulp finally struck Josh's ears. He was used to it at this point, truly. But it didn't stop it from being any less thrilling as suddenly his world was sent in a spiral downward deeper, darker, and past the thumping heart of the massive hunky athlete. Josh could barely think as excitement was the only thing running through his mind. Swirling down finally being deposited into Lyle's stomach, Josh took a deep breath of the foul air as he tried to find some place to be safe for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It reeks like coffee down here!\" Josh couldn't help but exclaim. It really was hot and steamy and filled with coffee that the giant had just drank. Other than that it was fairly empty. Thick fumes obscured Josh's vision as he found it hard to focus, let alone locate his phone. Josh started to look at the massive lake of coffee and other liquid as he wonder how exactly he was going to accomplish this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even make a plan... he didn't even tell me he'd let me out.\" Josh was starting to realize, but the excitement of knowing he might not make it out despite Lyle being well aware of what he did was quite thrilling. \"Maybe he won't even let me out. I'm practically nothing down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bit his lip at his idea. It was both an incredible feeling and utterly terrifying at the same time. He truly was insignificant as the massive stomach churned and growled, undoubtedly unsatisfied with the meager meal Lyle has prepared for it so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle's stomach growled loudly just then as he sighed, thinking about how aside from Josh and a few pieces of candy, he had eaten nothing yet this morning. Frowning, Lyle made his way over to the refrigerator, reaching inside and grabbing out a few eggs and some slices of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he won't mind if I eat some actual food.\" Lyle said to himself, trying to affirm in his head that it didn't matter if he ate on top of Josh. Turning on the stove and grabbing himself a frying pan, Lyle started the process of cooking his food, convinced that Josh wouldn't mind. Cooking the food without so much as an additional thought, Lyle simply turned on his phone, playing some music at a decent level as he bobbed up and down to the beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that music?\" Josh asked nobody. There was the faint muffled beat of what seemed like some obnoxious rap music coming from the other side of  the fleshy walls, but it hardly mattered to Josh. It wasn't like he gave the giant any instruction, any guidance. Nothing. Not even his number should he manage to find the phone, which as time went on seemed less and less likely. Scared to venture too deep into the murky brown liquid, Josh timidly would fish around under the surface for a moment before pulling his hands out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... no...\" Josh fairly easily convinced himself. There was no way he'd find it unless it miraculously lit up and showed him where it was. But it was so early, nobody was going to call him. \"I'll just have to wait until he lets me out I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle's body shifted around a bit as Josh braced himself against the wall. Hearing a clatters and scraping noises, Josh was curious what was going on. Moments later his question was answered as hot mounds of chewed up food were being squeezed into the stomach from far above at the entrance of the massive cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like a waste to eat all that if he's just going to puke me up...\" Josh said to himself, feeling confident that Lyle wasn't about to just leave him down here to stew with the meal he was eating. \"Well maybe he figures he won't puke all of it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last bite of his meal, Lyle sat back, burping as he rubbed his stomach gently. He did think about Josh inside his stomach, but it wasn't of his upmost concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the shrinking made him like invincible or something.\" Lyle tried to rationalize. \"Like how else did he get out of everyone else's stomachs? It's not like they all puked him up, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his rationale, Lyle resigned to the fact that he would have to wait several hours before letting Josh out the other end. It was no big deal to him, he just had to let what came natural after all. Washing his dish and standing up, Lyle made his way out of the kitchen, figuring he could blow off some steam in the gym and waste some time before he had to worry about Josh. As he made his way to Brody's basement door to go down to the gym he had, Lyle...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Pulling his phone out of his pocket and setting it on a table by a mini fridge, Lyle pulled up his sweatpants a bit as he made his way over to the bench press. Putting on the appropriate weights, Lyle laid down and started his workout, slowly lowering the bar to his chest before lifting it up high with a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh screamed as Lyle's stomach shifted and turned in different directions. It was still so dark and he hadn't quite gotten his bearings straight yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on up there!?\" Josh cried out in confusion, finally settling down after Lyle's stomach stopped shifting so much. Josh tried to listen hard, but all he could hear among the gurgles and churns of Lyle's stomach was... grunting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyle!!\" Josh called out, realizing the giant never actually told him his name. Trying to find refuge on the breakfast the giant had eaten, Josh started to sweat nervously as he skin started to tingle and burn. \"I have to get out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" Lyle sat up after racking his weight. Wiping his sweaty brow as he got up and made his way to the mini fridge and grabbed a water. Chugging it down, Lyle curiously looked down at his phone, grabbing it and pulling up google.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does it take for food to leave your body?\" Lyle spoke the words as he typed them into his phone. \"Six to eight hours?! Bro, that's like half the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle chuckled as he set down his phone and patted his slightly sweaty abs. \"Sorry micro bro, but it sounds like you've got a long time before you get out!\" Lyle put his his arms behind his head and stretched his torso and abdomen a bit. \"Well if you've been eaten as many times as you said, I'm sure you're used to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, confident with his logic, Lyle made his way over to a yoga mat, deciding he wanted to do some sit ups and crunches, hoping the ab exercises would help move Josh along through his body a little quicker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrown around in the mess of digestive fluids and breakfast, Josh didn't stand a chance during Lyle's ab exercise. Easily knocked unconscious and digested in the massive man's stomach, Josh was both a little content with his end if not felt it was deserved for not going in with a plan or explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle meanwhile, was excited the rest of his day, waiting for hours to go by wondering when he was going to have the pleasure of embarrassing the tiny man by shitting him out. Time went by though and the only things to come to pass were a minuscule, yet still functional phone and the shattered remains of a teeny tiny skeleton.    <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Deciding to wait, Lyle turned the corner and was greeted by his friend and housemate, Brody. Wearing similar looking sweatpants and no shirt like his friend Lyle, it looks like they all had matching pairs from when they all did lacrosse together. Brody yawned and ruffled his hair as he saw Lyle peeking up the stairs at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoooo, morning bro.\" Brody smiled at Lyle as he made his way to the bottom of the stairs and fist bumped his friend. \"What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to go in the basement, bro.\" Lyle flexed a little. \"Gotta get my gains going, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! If I was a little more awake I'd join you, bro.\" Brody yawned as he walked past Lyle toward the kitchen, looking quickly at the plate seeing the candy had been mostly eaten. \"Uhhh bro, you didn't all that candy did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle followed Brody back into the kitchen and waved his hand, as if to indicate not to worry. \"Don't worry bro, I met Josh. He asked me to eat him, so it's all good bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Where is he now, bro?\" Brody asked, a bit concerned with potentially how long ago Lyle ate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here with the rest of my breakfast, bro!\" Lyle patted his stomach. \"How long did it take you to shit him out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you have to puke him out! How long ago did you eat him?\" Brody started to go from concern to panic. \"He won't make it going all the way through you, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't?! Bro, he never told me that!\" Lyle turned a tiny bit red, feeling a little embarrassed. \"Uhhh I swallowed him maybe 15 minutes ago? I ate breakfast on top of him though too, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you don't think he got crushed under your breakfast?\" Brody worried, knowing just how tiny and feeble Josh was. \"Bro, you have to puke him out!\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay!\" Lyle went over to the sink, putting the stopper in the drain and sticking his fingers down his throat. Moments later, Lyle started upchucking chunks of his breakfast he just carefully prepared, seeing streams of brown liquid form his coffee as well and even chunks of white from the marshmallow. Coughing and spitting, Lyle and Brody looked through the disgusting mess for a few minutes before they saw a small wriggling speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rubbed his eyes, adjusting to the light as he breathed in fresh air, relived as he laid his hand down next to him, colliding with a teeny tiny phone he was so desperately searching for inside Lyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go figure.\" Josh could barely muster as he grabbed the phone and slid it into his slimy shorts pocket, now looking up at the faces of Lyle and Brody as he was being scooped out of the vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! Is he still alive? He's not moving!\" Lyle looked down into Brody's hand at Josh laying motionless. Josh slowly sat up, feeling like he had been just through a washing machine filled with food. \"Bro! Why didn't you tell me to puke you up! If I didn't run into Brody I was gonna leave you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I just froze up before you ate me.\" Josh rubbed his head. \"I guess I also just never mentioned it. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, with the apologizing again?\" Brody frowned. \"All's fun and all, bro, but you could've died. So don't apologize. It's my fault for not just staying with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro, it's my fault for not asking you. I just assumed, bro.\" Lyle chimed in wanting to take a share of the blame. Lyle's stomach gave off a loud growl just after his apology. \"I also ate on top of you, which wasn't cool... but now I'm a little hungry again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but laugh at Lyle's stomach growling, thinking it a bit ironic and funny now he was safe. Brody and Lyle also smiled, glad to see Josh was in good spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd offer myself up as breakfast, but I doubt I'd fill up what you just puked out!\" Josh tried to joke, wanting to make the men feel a little better about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not, bro!\" Lyle smiled, glad to see Josh was seeing humor in this. \"By the way, now that I've eaten you and almost digested you, I forgot to tell you, I'm Lyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured, Brody told me about you a bit.\" Josh smiled, feeling like this was the weirdest way he's ever been introduced to someone before. Lyle smiled as he stopped leaning into look at Josh and rubbed his stomach, hungry. \"You guys should have some breakfast!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just napped off my breakfast, bro. But I guess I could go for seconds!\" Brody stood next to Lyle and nodded before carrying Josh over to the kitchen table. \"I'll grab a little water so you can wash off, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by as Lyle and Brody made some fresh breakfast, eating and chatting with Josh as he cleaned himself off with water from a bottle cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! How is Vinny still sleeping?!\" Lyle looked down at his phone seeing it was almost 11am. Leaning back and rubbing his perfect abs, Lyle burped, satisfied with his breakfast. \"Oh bro, glad I don't have to puke this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for that too! Oh by the way I forgot to mention, I found my phone too!\" Josh just remembered as he reached toward his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, bro!\" Lyle squinted, still not able to see the tiny device. \"So it was a successful mission into the depths of my stomach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody meanwhile merely looked confused. \"Uh, why was Josh's phone in Lyle's stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swallowed it. I wanted to see if it was really life-proof. But I didn't think about the fact that we'd never find it once I shit it out.\" Lyle explained, not making a big deal about his spontaneous decisions. \"I ate him so he could go in and find it, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bro, that makes sense. I though little Josh was just going for a joy ride.\" Brody laughed, knowing Josh was becoming a bit of a fan of the thrills behind being eaten alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy ride?\" Lyle questioned. \"That was scary when I thought I killed him, bro. I don't see how that's a joy ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's not the first close call I've had.\" Josh chimed in, wanting to throw in his two cents. \"Under controlled circumstances I think it's actually really cool getting eaten. It's like a water slide, and the inside of the stomach is both breathtaking and terrifying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle looked down at Josh with a raised eyebrow for a second before Josh turned bright red, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! That probably sounded really weird!\" Josh tried to apologize, knowing Brody didn't care but he wasn't sure if Lyle would judge him or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, micro-bro. I'll let you go for a joy ride again if you want.\" Lyle leaned back and laughed, patting his stomach. \"I'll have to have you sign a waiver next time or something though, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, alright sounds good to me!\" Josh smiled, glad Lyle didn't think he was a creep or a weirdo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men relaxed, as each Lyle and Brody eventually took showers and got ready for their day. Laughing over how Vinny was still sleeping, the three decided it would be best to do something without him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we wanna do, bros?\" Lyle asked, wearing a loose white tank top that exposed his sides as well as a pair of black shorts, looking like they didn't fit over hiss ass very well as his butt stuck out revealing a similar looking to before red spandex underwear. Lyle had also styled his hair a bit now from the messy bedhead he had before.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stood now, wearing a more normal black tank top, a little tight around his chest, but nothing terribly revealing like Lyle's, as well as navy blue shorts, also sagging them slightly but again not as bad as Lyle was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, bro.\" Brody leaned on the table, ass against it beside Josh looking from down to Josh, to up at Lyle. \"It's nice out, we should at least go out back or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna send micro-bro on a joy ride at some point.\" Lyle rubbed his abs under his tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! So do I bro. You can't hog him you know.\" Brody leaned slightly closer to Josh, as if he's staked his claim on the tiny man already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we settle this with a competition, bro?\" Lyle cracked his knuckles and stepped forward a bit. Josh gulped a little nervously, wondering what Lyle could have in mind as he approached his smaller friend, Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Try me, bro.\" Brody stood from his lean on the table, having to look up at Lyle a little as he stood a full five inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we let micro-bro pick?\" Lyle peeked around Brody, seeing Josh sit there nervously on the table. \"My votes are a flex off slash work out competition, or we see who can do the banana sprite challenge faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you'd pick things you're good at, bro.\" Brody continued to look at Lyle's face like they were getting ready for a MMA fight. \"My votes are either a lacrosse shoot out against each other, or a cook off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking eye contact with Brody, Lyle addressed Josh. \"Well, micro-bro? What will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt a bit on the spot, but he could tell the two men were determined. Thinking for a moment, Josh realized if he chose one of Lyle's option there probably a greater chance of him winning, and likewise for Brody's. Thinking carefully, Josh decided to go with...        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Umm I guess the workout competition would be the most interesting!\" Josh decided, not wanting to specifically mention the flex off, though it was by far the part he was most interested in. \"You guys could see who can do the most sit ups, or push ups, or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea micro-bro! We'll have three events, sit ups, push ups, and then the flex off!\" Lyle made sure to flex a little in emphasis of \"flex off\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it's on then bro!\" Brody smiled, still right up in Lyle's face. Lyle didn't flinch as he continued to be in Brody's face, just smiling his perfect white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It almost looks like they're going to kiss.\" Josh thought to himself, looking at Lyle's face dangerously close to Brody's. Josh watched as the stared at each other for a few moments more before both men broke away from each other, laughing. Josh watched as Brody turned, scooping him up into his hand as the three made their way out back to Brody's huge back yard. Setting Josh down on a glass patio table, Brody opened the umbrella above it, giving the tiny man some shade. Josh watched as Brody and Lyle went out onto the fresh cut grass, both men pulling off their tank tops and tossing them aside as they went out into the sun. Josh leaned forward, transfixed at both hunks as they started doing push ups beside each other, keeping pace with one another, doing 10... 20.. 30... 40... even 50 in a row as it seemed like neither man was tiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Josh watched as Brody's arms gave out, collapsing to the grass as Lyle continued on strong. Josh watched as Lyle helped Brody off the ground as both mes stood there, already glistening in sweat. Josh bit his lip as Brody laughed, wiping a little gross off his chest and abdomen as he conceded the first challenge to Lyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I wasn't gonna outlast you, bro. But let's see how well you do with sit ups!\" Brody said to the man as neither of them acknowledged Josh, which made the situation even more thrilling for the little man as he truly felt like he was being fought over right now, and being ignored was making it even hotter. Continuing to watch closely, Josh saw both men lay on the ground as they started doing sit ups... once again keeping a rapid pace with one another. Slowly but surly, Josh watched as Lyle started slowing down his pace before fully laying on his back as Brody looked over at him an smirked. Getting off the ground, Josh watched as both men, drenched in sweat and a bit dirty with grass and dirt came back over to the patio table, now hovering over him like two glistening muscle gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're tied, micro-bro.\" Lyle panted as he stood over Josh with his hands on his hips. \"So you'll have to break the tie with the flex off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could barely contain himself as he watched Lyle, kneel down and start flexing his abs, clearly they were already pretty tight from sit ups, but with the added flex, Josh could barely look away. Brody, noticing Lyle had already started and was now completely hogging Josh's view, pushed himself in front of Lyle, sticking his ass in his friend's face as he made Josh stare all the way up at him as he did a classic double bicep pose while staring up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle, shoved Brody's ass out of his face, quickly re-obstructing Josh's view as he leaned his chest in chose, making his pecs bounce to a seductive rhythm as Brody regained his balance and smirked. Making his way to the opposite end of the table, Brody tipped the table toward him, causing Josh to slide away from Lyle before crashing into Brody's abs. Josh felt the sweat of the huge bro's body as he started up at the man as he smirked and nodded arrogantly as he flexed his abs intensely, letting Josh feel them as he clenched them hard as rocks. Lyle stood up and shook his head laughing as he saw Josh pressed against Brody's abs. Noticing how fixated Brody was on Josh, Lyle made his way over, quickly pinching Josh off Brody's abs and carrying him away in his palm as Brody dropped the table. Now Josh found himself at ab height of Lyle, staring up at him as he did a single bicep flex, swapping to a tricep, before ending with more flexing of his chest. Josh gawked at the giant before he found himself engulfed in darkness, as he turned and saw Brody pressing his own body against Lyle's as Josh was trapped now, in Lyle's hand between Brody and Lyle's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay!\" Josh called up at the giant, as he didn't think he could take anymore before he'd burst from over stimulation. It took a moment before the mes stopped flexing, acknowledging Josh's words as Lyle brought him back over to the patio table. Bright red, Josh looked at the two men as they stood the in front of him, both still casually flexing here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bro?\" Brody flexed his bicep. \"Who's the winner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave a much better show, and you know it, micro-bro!\" Lyle gave a smug sexy look as he put his arms behind his head, flexing his triceps and stretching his abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um...\" Josh was thoroughly embarrassed as he knew he had to choose. Swallowing his pride, Josh looked at the two colossal sweaty hunks and chose...                      </span></div></div>",

It really was a hard choice, especially since he knew he was going to eaten by whoever he picked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Brody, but I think I have to go with Lyle.\" Josh felt bad picking Lyle, over Brody. Especially with how helpful Brody has been to him recently. But Lyle truly went above and beyond with his performance and his sheer size certainly gave him an advantage. Lyle put his arm up in victory and did a quick jog around Brody in a circle before going up to Josh and kneeling down in front of him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd pick me, micro-bro!\" Lyle winked at Josh, breathing a bit heavy from the hot sun and dripping with beads of sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did my best! No hard feelings, bro!\" Brody smiled as he put a hand on Lyle's shoulder. \"What was the determining move, boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... probably when he grabbed me after you tipped the table. Something about being scooped up like that just sealed the deal.\" Josh tried to recount the exact moment he felt he was swooning over Lyle more than Brody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's all good bro!\" Brody gave Josh a thumbs up. \"I'll get you next time though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for right now, micro-bro. You're mine.\" Lyle leaned in close to Josh, scooping him off his feet and holding him next to his abs. \"Ready for a joy ride into my stomach, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stared up at the muscular abs, all the way to Lyle's chest, before seeing his face, looking like it was miles and miles away. \"Yeahhh...\" Josh swooned. \"Oh what about that waiver?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle lifted Josh up closer to his face, as Josh now looked at Lyle's handsome face and scruffy chin. \"We can call it a verbal agreement, micro-bro.\" Lyle flashed his beautiful white teeth with a smile. \"You're responsible for whatever goes on in your trip. I am not liable for any injuries associated with patting my stomach, burping, eating food, drinking, or accidental digestion. Do you accept these terms, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" Josh smiled eagerly, hoping Lyle was just kidding about the accidental digestion part. Lyle started to lean Josh in closer to his now opening mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me! Enjoy your trip!\" Lyle rolled his tongue out, depositing Josh into his mouth and turning it toward Brody, making his eyebrows wiggle up and down as he smiled and closed his mouth. Brody laughed as he watched Lyle swish Josh about a little bit in his mouth as he walked over to his friend, just as he gulps a loud exaggerated swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! I heard that!\" Brody fist bumped Lyle, impressed. Brody watched as Lyle rubbed his chest as he felt Josh feebly go down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, I should've like tied a string to him or something. I don't wanna puke again!\" Lyle just realized, having once again acted a bit spontaneously without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out in a minute, bro. First you should take some tums and drink a little water. He told me it made my stomach a lot more safe.\" Brody patted Lyle on the shoulder as the two walked back inside, still shirtless and shiny with sweat. Once inside, Brody offered Lyle the tums, which he quickly took with water, hoping to make his stomach a little less caustic for the tiny explorer he had within him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sloshed about in a mess of liquidity digested food. It tingled his skin to be in the disgusting chyme, so after being deposited in the massive organ, Josh tried his best to find the edge of the stomach, so he could be in relative safety. As Lyle's stomach churned and groaned, Josh could hear the digested meal being sucked into Lyle's small intestine, with a sickening slurping sound followed by loud groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Lyle's body is amazing...\" Josh admired the sheer size of the man's stomach, in complete awe of the simple process of digestion being taken place around him. Josh looked up as heard a squelching noise, as he noticed something be deposited into the chamber. The smell was familiar for when Brody did it, it was tums! Couple that with the sound of torrents of water, Josh watched as a dark stream poured into the center of Lyle's stomach, like he was watching a great underground lake be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible...\" Josh witnessed the events in the dark before he felt a buzzing noise come from his pocket. Pulling out his phone, Josh immediately felt dumb for not recording the flex off earlier, or his ride down into Lyle's stomach! Never the less, Josh saw the name was from Brody as he picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brody! I totally forgot I even had my phone with me!\" Josh spoke into his phone has he heard a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, micro-bro! It's Lyle. I didn't have your number, so Brod let me borrow his phone.\" Josh heard Lyle's voice on the other end, but also could somewhat hear it muffled coming from above as well. \"And what do you mean you forgot you had your phone?! You didn't record anything, micro-bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I forgot!\" Josh responded, feeling bad as he more so than anything else wished he had the whole flex show on video. \"I'll take pictures in here though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, micro-bro. I wanna know what it looks like for you in there!\" Lyle spoke casually, making it seem like having Josh in his stomach wasn't a big deal. \"I took some tums and drank some water, so hopefully it's chill in there, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw! I watched the water pour in from a safe distance. It was incredible.\" Josh recalled the event in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh did you record that?\" Lyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I forgot...\" Josh sounded disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine! I'll drink more! Don't miss it this time!\" Josh heard Lyle say as he hung up the phone. Meanwhile, Josh looked where he was positioned and saw the water was pretty close now to washing him in to more of the center of the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea... he might flood me in here.\" Josh pulled up Brody's name and started trying to call Lyle back. The phone rang a few time and after a few second...     </span></div></div>",

Why don't we just figure this shit out tomorrow.\" Luke shrugged his shoulders as he looked from Josh to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. I like it when you eat me too Luke.\" Josh added, as he looked at Luke's fantastic body. Luke seemed slightly taken aback by the comment however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is a dangerous hobby you got going on now, boss.\" Luke chuckled as he patted Tyler on the shoulder. \"I think I'm all set for now though boss. Maybe some other time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke gave Tyler a solid wack on the back before he turned away, feeling like it was almost getting to be a little too weird for him. Tyler however, looked down at Josh, tired looking but still very interested. Josh watched as Luke left before looking right up into his best friend's beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is dangerous.\" Tyler said to Josh seriously for a moment. \"But it's something about you... my best friend... helpless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way.\" Josh gazed up at Tyler longingly. \"It's like it doesn't matter what happens to me. I just feel so close to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't get much closer than being literally inside me!\" Tyler laughed smiling down at Josh. \"But I also couldn't bear the thought of losing you, dude. So as much as we both like it, maybe we should stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to think about it from Tyler's point of view. It was hard though for the tiny man to even imagine however. \"I guess my life is at risk, but really what do you have to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, dude.\" Tyler rose an eyebrow. \"I just told you I could lose you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess.\" Josh stuttered, not really have thought about it like that till Tyler bluntly pointed it out. \"I guess if roles were reversed, I would never want to lose you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would never happen.\" Tyler laughed heavily. \"I'd never allow it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't like it anyway.\" Josh shivered at the thought. \"It'd be weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding!\" Tyler smiled. \"But back to what I was saying. I don't think I can eat you anymore bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ty!\" Josh tried to retort, as Tyler shook his head adamantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but's.\" Tyler stuck a finger out. \"If you died in my guts I could never forgive myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we took safety precautions?\"  Josh offered as a possible solution. \"I-I could build something. A suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyebrows rose in interest at the idea. \"Could you really pull something like that off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I could!\" Josh said confidently. \"I mean I built a shrink ray for goodness sake, I could build a stomach acid resistant suit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt a bit of confidence well up in his chest for Josh, but he still couldn't help but feel a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach, the exact place he was worried Josh would make his final resting place should this suit fail.

Looking at the name on the caller ID, he figured he had to take it. \"Bro, I have to take this! Get that fish up, man!\" Brody said as he pressed the answer button on his screen. \"Yo! What's good?\" Brody said as he walked out the back door. Tyler rolled his eyes as he started to put his fingers back down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait dude.\" Luke spoke up as he came over to Tyler's side. \"I'll give you six bucks if you keep it down, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's face lit up for a second. To be honest he didn't really feel like making himself vomit twice in one day, especially not a second time over some stupid tiny fish. \"I'll take that bet, dude. I don't think that little fish is worth puking up anyway.\" Tyler said as he rubbed his stomach, thinking about the little creature he just swallowed. Meanwhile, Luke pulled out his wallet and gave Tyler six dollars to complete his end of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so too man. Did you see how it was just floating like that? You're probably doing it a service by ending it, dude.\" Luke said eyeing Tyler's sweat covered abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much of a service considering it's gonna be in my shit.\" Tyler laughed as him and Luke started to walk toward the exit to the break room. \"Dude, what about Brody. He's gonna pissed I kept his dumb fish down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke opened the door and looked out into the lot behind them. He could see Brody with his back turned a little ways out from where they were. \"He's not looking, dude, let's book.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair quickly worked their way out of the door way and made their way back to the entrance of the park as they chuckled to each other over how they didn't get noticed by Brody. \"Wonder why he really wanted me to eat that fish.\" Tyler said to Luke as they prepared to be shrunk and enter the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno man. The boss probably tried to get Brody to get you to do it as part of his next prank or something.\" Luke said as the two walked into the park<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're right, dude. I mean did you see that thing? Eyes all popped out, struggling to swim. I bet Josh thought it would gross me out.\" Tyler said giving his stomach a solid smack. Luke laughed as Tyler mocked the pathetic creature he ate some more, even deciding to burp obnoxiously as they walked past a few park guests, much to Luke's amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any minute now.\" Josh thought as he had peeled off the Flubsy suit what seemed like forever ago. Josh listened as Tyler's recent belch caused the walls of his stomach to vibrate violently. His skin started to tingle as he itched at the urge be released from this stinky prison. Josh looked around him, Tyler's stomach swayed and churned as if it didn't have a care in the world, showing no indication of distress or need to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so long?!\" Josh yelled as he started to panic, making his way to a drier patch of stomach as waves of deadly acid started to wash up near him. There's no way they would think that it would take this long for him to reach Tyler's stomach. Something had to have gone wrong. Josh started to breath heavier as he listened to Tyler's distant laughter coupled with the sounds of his stomach digesting a meal nearby. Josh shivered despite the humid climate of his friend's belly, but he was coming to terms with the fact that he wasn't going to be rescued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler! Brody!\" Josh called in desperation as he looked over to see the Flubsy costume get dragged into the onslaught of stomach acid. Clinging onto the wall of the mucusy stomach, Josh was suddenly launched from the safe perch as a sudden jolt from the outside caused him to land directly in a sea of acid. Josh cried as he slowly was drug under the surface ready to be processed in Tyler's behemoth belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tyler and Luke continued to go about their day, avoiding contact with Brody who they hadn't seen since the initial bet was made. Heading home, Tyler scratched his head as he expected Josh to pop out at some point during the day in an attempt to get back at him. Shrugging it off, Tyler went home content that overall he was the better pranker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can't beat the old goldfish trick.\" He said to himself rubbing his abs as he ultimately believed he scared his boss into not retaliating.             </span></div></div>",

Standing up, he grabbed his plate and now empty liter of soda and walked it over to the kitchen. Quickly he rinsed off the plate and placed it neatly on the drying rack, then he proceeded to toss out the bottle in the recycling bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied for cleaning up someone else's mess, he looked up at the clock. \"Still got like 20 minutes left on my break, bro!\" He said to himself excited returning to his seat in the lounge to continue watching the game. Flopping back down in his chair he felt his stomach shift slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUURRRRPP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a moderately loud burp and patted his stomach proudly. \"That was some good pizza!\" he said smiling, refocusing his attention the the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Josh the trip was practically instantaneous. One second the sea of brown he was in was calm, the next it turned into a raging river carrying him away out of his plastic prison, deep into a much more dangerous one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the rapids finally ceased, Josh rubbed his eyes, adjusting to his surroundings. He was dripping wet with soda, knelt down in some sort of... yellow-ish mush from what he could gather. The darkness was overwhelming to him but it didn't take long for Josh to realize, he was in a stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to the rhythmic heart beats in the distance as well as the muffled groans and moans he could hear all around him, it was evidence enough. \"How could this have happened...\" Josh thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody must've finished off the soda..\" Josh thought. \"Damn it! This is all Tyler's fault! I wouldn't be here if he didn't play his childish games!\" Josh steamed stomping on the soft ground getting his foot stuck. \"Great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the walls of the stomach dropped. Josh managed to avoid flying up toward the top of the belly due to his stuck foot, when suddenly a deafening sound flooded the chamber, followed a large change in pressure. Josh had to cover his ears since they felt like they were about ready to explode when he dropped to his knees at the definite lack of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air Josh could hear a few large smacks coming from one of the walls of his prison. Followed by the last words he'd hear before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS SOME GOOD PIZZA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody's voice echoed out as Josh fainted in a pile of mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost 20 minutes had gone by and Body looked up at the clock. \"Almost time to head back to work...\" He thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging finally from the work out room stepped a sweaty Tyler, who immediately headed over to the kitchen table as he heard Brody's voice come from the lounge, \"Sup brah!\" The man called to his superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for the bottle cap, or even the pizza that was left Tyler quickly got concerned, walking into the lounge to confront Brody. \"Dude, did you eat my pizza? And what about the soda... and the cap.\" He added rubbing the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Brody thought. He had no idea it was Tyler's food! He didn't wanna piss off the higher ranking lifeguard so he quickly came up with a lie. \"What pizza, bro?\" He asked feigning ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a pizza, and soda on the table, back in the kitchen.\" Tyler said now coming up with a lie himself, \"I was uh.. saving it for when I was done with my workout.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from Tyler, Brody continued to lie, \"Table was empty when I came in, brah. Someone must've taken your food before I came in.\" He finished casually. \"Anyway bro, I gotta get back to work.\" he said extending his fist out and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBumping his fist to Brody's, Tyler replied. \"Alright, thanks man. See ya Brod.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Brody, he was glad he could dodge a bullet for getting in trouble with Tyler. He knew that probably wouldn't gone over well if he knew he ate the pizza. \"I was hungry though...\" He said rubbing his abs as he walked back around into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tyler searched the trash, the recycling bin, the kitchen table, and the floors. Never finding his tiny boss. Feeling guilty over losing his boss he was just so puzzled over where the little man could've ended up. Little did he know his unconscious body was being digested in the belly of the man he just let walk away.    </span></div></div>",

You were just joking around, and I over reacted.\" He said pleading to the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boss, it makes me so happy to hear you say that.\" Tyler said in a condescending tone. \"Apology accepted. I'll let ya out now little fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached down and slowly turned the bottle cap on its side, watching closely as Josh walked out onto the table. Josh tried his best to avoid looking at Tyler's face, fully expecting there to be a smug grin across Tyler's lips. Josh started to walk toward the edge of the table, knowing there was an elevator that could bring him back to the balcony there when suddenly a massive elbow crashed down in front of him. Looking up all he could see was a mess of under arm hair far above him as he looked back to see Tyler leaning over the table toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know boss.\" Tyler said moving his elbow, now that he had the puny man's attention. \"I still feel a little sad about how you yelled at me. How's about making it up to me?\"  Tyler said trying to give Josh puppy dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his fingers to his forehead Josh figured his over sized employee wouldn't take no for an answer. \"What do you have in mind, Ty?\" he asked hoping to get this over with so he could go back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its real simple, trust me.\" Tyler said winking. \"All I want you to do is...\"       </span></div></div>",

Josh shivered thinking about how comfortable Tyler was with the idea of accidentally crushing him just a few years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember you threatening to crush me if I couldn't do those push ups ad sit ups!\" Josh tilted his head and looking intently at Tyler, hoping he wasn't about to relive this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't crush you!\" Tyler smiled, as if it was somehow all ok because of that. \"Either way I wanna do that again! Come work out with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But no push ups or sit ups.\" Josh sighed, not wanting to go through that hell again and figuring it didn't really give Tyler too many options of things he could make him do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine! I had other ideas anyway!\" Tyler smiled excitedly as he reached down, scooping Josh up into his hand without much warning. Josh shook his head, a little dazed by being picked up so suddenly as he looked up from Tyler's waist level, all the way up to his still smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's not grumpy anymore...\" Josh said to himself under his breath, a little relieved Tyler was quick to change his mood a little. Trying to relax, Josh found Tyler was carrying him into the gym he had off the side of the break room. It wasn't anything that impressive, a few machine and weights that the guys used in their free time. Tyler brought Josh over to a small table in one of the corners of the room and set him down before putting his hands on his waist and looking down at his teeny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dude! Get pumped up!\" Tyler flexed a little as he stared down at Josh. \"For your work out challenge today you'll be doing...\"  </span></div></div>",

Josh merely blinked at him as he stood there with his arms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what? It's not like I can get my hands around a pull up bar.\" Josh answered, looking down at his little hands likely unable to fit them around almost anything at his minuscule size. Tyler lowered his arms and scratched his chin for a second, actually not thinking this far before lowering his hand down toward Josh and extending his pinky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" Tyler asked as Josh looked at the enormous pinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just continued to stare at the appendage, clearly seeing it was several times thicker than his whole body, let alone the amount he could grip with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly, no.\" Josh stated simply as he stared up at Tyler's handsome face with a cocked eyebrow. Tyler retracted his pinky before giving Josh a look and walking off toward his locker. Losing sight of Tyler for a moment around the corner, Josh saw him come back, holding a tooth pick. Setting it down in front of Josh, he looked down at it still a little overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like the size of a tree trunk. How am I supposed to grip that?\" Josh asked, looking at the huge tooth pick like it was in fact a fallen tree. \"Why do you even have tooth picks in your locker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler picked up the tooth pick and started using it to pick bits of food out from between his teeth. \"Clearly for it's intended purpose, dude. Hold on that gives me an idea!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rushed off a second time, tossing the tooth pick in a garbage can before making his way to his locker. Josh crossed his arms impatiently before Tyler reappeared, this time holding a floss pick, twirling it in his fingers as he walked over confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, bro! It's literally string. You should be able to hold on to this!\" Tyler lowered the pick down to Josh as he looked at the floss suspended between the two points like a massive tight rope. Seeing the string now in front of him, Josh reached for it and was able to get his hands around it. Seeing Josh grip it, Tyler slowly lifted it off the ground as Josh started to hang in the air for a moment before panicking and letting go, falling a little hard on his butt as Tyler looked down at him disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you have to hold on to it.\" Tyler ordered Josh feeling like it was no fun if Josh didn't even try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'll try.\" Josh got back up and grabbed the string once again. Tyler slowly lifted the string from the ground and watched as Josh struggled to pull himself up before giving up and letting go a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I think you need a little motivation!\" Tyler smiled as he lowered the string for Josh to hold onto again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked, a little nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just start by holding on to the string, dude. I'll work you through it.\" Tyler smiled as he watched Josh grab the string again. This time, Tyler slide his hand under Josh as he lifted him up, not letting his feet off the ground for more than a second as he carried Josh over to the flat bench used for lifting weights in the middle of the gym. Josh just held the string as Tyler carried him over before lying down flat on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Ty?\" Josh asked as his feet still touched the ground of Tyler's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just getting comfortable. Now, just focus on keeping your grip!\" Tyler said as he suddenly removed his hand from under Josh, lifting him high above his body moving him over to his face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler!!\" Josh screamed as he hung high above Tyler's body and soon right over his face as he laid flat on the bench. \"I'm gonna fall Ty! It's so high!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let go, dude!\" Tyler said to Josh as he held him over his mouth before opening it up wide, letting Josh look straight down past his sticky saliva coated tongue down into his deep dark throat. \"If you do you're in for a ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gripped the string with all his might. So this was what Tyler meant by \"motivation\". Josh couldn't help but look down as he hung over Tyler's mouth. Head spinning from the height and the just depth of Tyler's throat, Josh just tried to shut his eyes and focus on holding on. Noticing Josh struggle a bit Tyler couldn't help but smile as he lowered the floss pick a bit lower part way into his mouth and started breathing a little heavier on Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes after he felt a definite change in temperature, Josh looked as he saw rows of teeth from the underside as he hung now somewhere in the middle of Tyler's mouth. \"Tyler!!\" Josh tried to yell. \"Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You 'ave 'to 'oo 'en 'ull 'ups!\" Josh heard Tyler's voice boom around him as he tied to speak without closing his mouth. Josh sighed as he held on to the string, trying to keep his grip firm as he tried his hardest to do at least one. Struggling, Josh went limp again, his only motivation was to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even do one!\" Josh yelled to Tyler desperately as he found himself being lifted up higher out of Tyler's mouth, but still suspended too high for his liking. Josh looked down, Tyler' mouth still hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either you do ten, or you fall in and join the rest of my lunch in my stomach, dude.\" Tyler spoke quickly with a smirk before licking his lips and opening his mouth up again and resting his head flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler! Let me down!\" Josh kicked his legs a little, arms getting tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down is into my mouth. All you gotta do is let go, dude.\" Tyler mocked Josh shifting his tongue back and forth and opening his throat with deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh struggled to hold on, arms getting severely tired. A few minutes passed and Josh tried with all his might to pull his body up half way, hoping his could hang from his under arms instead, when...   </span></div></div>",

Josh squirmed and struggled, trying to claw his way up, but the slipperiness of Tyler's saliva coated throat was too much as he slipped down until finally being pushed through a massive sphincter being deposited without a second thought into the titan's stomach. Scrambling to find solid ground, Josh luckily was able to find some refuge on some partially digested pizza from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god he eats so much!\" Josh yelled out into the spacious organ, feeling like Tyler's appetite was working to his advantage for once. \"Tyler!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's cries were only met with the rhythmic churns and gurgles of Tyler's stomach as it peacefully digested it's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Josh felt useless and defeated.

Taking a deep sigh and flexing his abs, Tyler couldn't help but shake his head and laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he didn't try to grab on to anything or nothing.\" Tyler chuckled as he cleared his throat and rested his head back down while gently resting his hand on his stomach. Giving it a light scratch, Tyler yawned as he rested his other hand behind his head. Sighing again and making a noise with his lips, Tyler ran his hand up and down his stomach a little impatiently. \"Maaan, I reaally don't wanna throw him up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his arms off the side of the bench in distress, Tyler rolled his eyes a little. \"Uuuuughhh...\" Tyler blurted out before peeking back over at his abdomen, perfectly flat with deep cuts in his abs as if nothing had made a dent in it despite how much he had eaten, Josh included. Reaching into his pocket, Tyler pulled out his phone and pulled up Josh's name, calling it and holding it up to his ear. A few seconds passed before it ended in voicemail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, he left it in his office... again.\" Tyler sighed again as he put his phone back in his pocket. Lazily sitting up, deliberately using his abs in a sit up like motion, Tyler stood off the bench and shifted his shoulders a little as he put his tongue in his cheek while looking down at his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuurp!\" Tyler let an accidental yet somewhat longish burp. \"Oh whoops. Sorry dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his hands on his hips, Tyler bit his lip, feeling a little weird about talking to his stomach. \"Man this is weird, I wonder if he can even hear me in there.\" Tyler rested a hand very gently on his stomach and stood still for a moment as he faintly swore he could feel something squirm. \"Whoa... that's cool...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled, always having this weird desire to try and eat his friend one day. Always hanging around his food, and having close calls in the past, he couldn't help but feel very powerful having his friend trapped behind his muscular abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave him in there though...\" Tyler whispered, almost a little disappointed. \"I mean it's not like he'd make it out the other end...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler moved his hand from his hip to his ass, thinking about Josh somehow poking his way out there. But even he wasn't so much of a bonehead to know that wasn't possible. Tyler sighed as he walked out of the room, making his way to a sink and plugging it up as he leaned over it, begrudgingly sticking his finger's down his throat. Gagging and spitting, Tyler threw up chunks of food almost violently as he expelled the pizza he had greedily devoured earlier. Digging through his own vomit, Tyler eventually locates the pale squirming speck that is his friend. Laughing as he plucked the little man out, Tyler noticed Josh seemed... </span></div></div>",

Tyler had always had a fascination with swallowing his best friend and now that it had happened he was almost a little disappointed that it was over so quickly. \u201cMaybe I could\u2019ve left him in there a little longer?\u201d he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Josh was cleaned up and dry Tyler felt the urge to ask what he thought of the whole experience, he needed to find out why Josh wasn\u2019t angry, or showing any real emotion at all.<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me boss?\u201d Tyler asked, \u201cI let you fall from that stick, into my mouth, and I swallowed you, I think I\u2019d be pretty mad if the roles were reversed dude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole thing happened so quickly, one second I was trying to do a pull up, the next I\u2019m plummeting down your throat towards your stomach, I didn\u2019t really have time to think to be honest, but once I landed in your stomach and got my bearings I thought that you might not have realised that you\u2019d swallowed me, you really did make me part of your lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued to explain, \u201cIt was both terrifying and amazing at the same time, seeing a stomach from the inside, but also having a bloody good idea of what it could do to me if I stayed in there too long, I actually thought that it could\u2019ve been the end for me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was a little taken aback when he heard Josh saying all of this, turning away from his boss for a moment, \u201cman, I could\u2019ve actually left him in there\u201d he muttered to himself  \u201che didn\u2019t realise I knew that I\u2019d swallowed him\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was puzzled by Tyler\u2019s reaction, He didn\u2019t hear what the titanic lifeguard had muttered to himself. What Josh didn\u2019t know was that all sorts of thoughts were going through Tyler\u2019s head, he\u2019d had a small taste of his best friend and he enjoyed it, he loved the feeling of power that he had when Josh was in there, completely at his mercy. Surely Josh wouldn\u2019t mind having another trip down there, just for a little longer? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tyler was conflicted, if he sent Josh down there again, would he bring him back? Would he want his best bud to stay in his stomach to be digested and be a part of him forever? \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to my best friend!\u201d he thought. \u201cSwallow him, digest him and shit out what\u2019s left in the morning? Looking down at his puzzled looking friend he thought \u201cCould I really do that to him?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Tyler!\u201d Josh shouted, are you ok man? You\u2019re kinda freaking me out!\u201d Which seemed a bit crazy since Josh had just been on a trip that would\u2019ve freaked anyone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Tyler scooped Josh up in his head and brought him up to his handsome face, those dark eyes looking down at him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest dude, when I swallowed you I knew what I was doing, I just couldn\u2019t help it, I\u2019ve always wanted to send you down into my stomach at some point, either by accident or on purpose, I had such a feeling of power that I couldn\u2019t help - I\u2019m sorry. Part of me even wanted to keep you down there, I even felt my ass, imagining you coming out of there in the morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn\u2019t know what to say, this was crazy surely! His best friend had basically just told him that part of him wanted to digest him together with his lunch! But Josh had always had such strong feelings for Tyler, they\u2019d known each other for so long, been thorough a lot together. If Josh was going to sacrifice himself to anyone, it would\u2019ve been Tyler. Strong feelings were brewing up inside Josh now, part of him wanted to go through with this, something he\u2019d fantasised about for a long time, but never had the opportunity to act upon. He\u2019d always try and be near Tyler when he was eating, watching that Adam\u2019s apple bob up and down whenever he swallowed something, sending it down to his cavernous stomach to digest. Maybe this was his destiny, to become protein for his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler brought Josh right up to his face, his palm level with his mouth \u201cWhat are you thinking bud?\u201d Tyler asked, \u201cdo you hate me, are you going to fire me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had decided what was going to happen now, it didn\u2019t matter if he wasn\u2019t thinking straight, this was what he wanted right NOW. He walked right up to Tyler\u2019s closed mouth and just rested on his lower lip, wanting to see what Tyler would do, would he resist, or send Josh on a one way trip through his digestive tract?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but chuckle as he saw Josh struggle to reach for a little bit of cheese and sauce on the huge slice. Looking over at the clock afterwards though, Tyler sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for my shift, dude.\" Tyler said smiling at his little boss. Tyler stood up, rubbing his full stomach while still addressing the tiny man. \"Thanks a lot for buying me lunch, boss! We should do this again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned to start to leave as Josh called out, \"Wait! Make sure to leave a note or something. I don't want someone coming in here and grabbing my slice with me on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped, turning to grab a sheet of paper and pen out of a drawer. He shook his head briefly as to why he didn't think about that. Leaving Josh like that with out any indicators would have been kinda dangerous. After writing the note, Tyler went over and set it next to Josh's plate and gave the little guy a thumbs up before turning to leave for real this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he watched Tyler head out. He was glad that his employee was so diligent about his shifts after all, even if he does act like a goof some of the times. Returning his attention to the pizza, Josh continued to chow down, even deciding to scale the pizza's side to get at some of the better parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Josh sat atop the pizza. mostly full and content. Taking a break Josh looked around as he heard the sound of someone coming into the room. The door swung open as Josh recognized one of his lifeguards walk through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant who just entered the room was none other than Markus. Markus is a 21 years old, African-American behemoth. Standing at 6'9\" he towers over almost all the other lifeguards in the park. He has a very handsome face, with dark scruff covering his chin, as well as perfect white teeth and an extremely well trained body. Oftentimes Josh found himself peeking at at Markus's perfect bubble butt or his bare feet while he often propped them up at his posts. He also had a tattoo spanning across his chest onto his shoulders and biceps of some sort of wavy pointy pattern. Finally, he actually went to the same high school as Josh. However, being a year ahead of Markus, Josh never really knew him up until he started working for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he watched the younger man walk into the room. It was always nice to see Markus around, since they went to the same high school and all. Although they never knew each other in high school, Josh felt he had some sort of special connection with him now. Josh started to wave as the gigantic man walked into the room, but was briefly thrown off balance by a gust of wind coming from the open door. Josh was powerless as he watched the note Tyler write blow helplessly to the floor, under the table. Turning, Josh saw Markus start to come toward him, and he finally noticed cords coming down from his ears as he was listening to music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww yeah! I did smell pizza!\" Markus yelled from across the room. Walking over to the table, he took in a  deep wiff of the cheesy air, hoping he can snag a piece from whoever left it here. Opening the box, he noticed it was empty. His eyes quickly zoned in on a lone piece, sitting very temptingly on a plate. Josh tried to yell at the man, as he watched his dark brown eyes spot the pizza. However, Josh's voice must have not reached the giant's ears past his ear buds as he reached down to the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Markus...     </span></div></div>",

The tiny boss was screaming at the top of his lungs for Markus and tried to move but his feet was stuck in the cheese that seemed to hold him in place like quick sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c M-MARKUS! HEY! ITS ME JOSH! \u201c He frantically yelled waving his arms as he stood on top of the pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus had already plopped down on the couch, stretching out his long legs. One of his size 22 bare feet brushed against a paper which caused him to immediately look down. Turning his attention to that instead he reached down for the paper and read it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Hey before you eat that slice, make sure Tiny Boss Man isn\u2019t on there! I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be angry if he ended up in your stomach! HAHAHA! Tyler. \u201c Markus read out loud as he made a confused face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed with relief as he heard the massive skyscraper deep voice read those words, his palms were sweaty and his heart was basically pounding out of his chest. His world shifted as the plate was lifted, he gasped once he saw a single deep brown eye staring at him. Josh waved happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c H-Hey Markus! Do you mind helping me out? I\u2019m stuck!? \u201c Josh pointed down at himself, the gooey cheese was up to his ankles and he could not budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus took out his earphones and raised a brow, \u201c Yo man I could\u2019ve ate you! Are you okay? Looks like you\u2019re stuck...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh face palmed himself since he went unheard the first time, he watched as Markus took his pinky finger and used his nail to softly break Josh free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c So since I\u2019m basically saving you from the cheesy quick sand of death, can I eat this pizza now? I\u2019m starving...! \u201c Markus dumped Josh into his other hand and held the teeny tiny man up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just stared and took in just how enormous Markus was now, he was the tallest guy at the park and he felt incredibly tiny. If Markus was any taller Josh would definitely have a hard time communicating with him. From Markus\u2019 point of view he could barely make out Josh\u2019s facial expression let alone features, the man was outright just a teeny tiny bug to him. He was holding his boss in the palm of his hand for the first time and nobody knew about it. No one was around if he decided to get playful and tease Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I uhhh sure! You can eat the pizza Markus! Also can you place me near the office? I need to get this greasy cheese off of me...!\u201d He grumbles with a gross look, turning his attention back to Markus who was showing off those huge pearly whites of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You know what Boss, I have a report that\u2019s due for class and was wondering if you could help me out? \u201c Markus basically inhaled the slice of pizza, it stood no chance against the 6\u20199 male. \u201c I mean you owe me after all, that could\u2019ve been you on the pizza. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched as Markus devoured the pizza within seconds, watching it travel down his throat. He shivered at the though of still being stuck on it and falling into the darkness of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c W-what do you need help with? I mean I don\u2019t mind! I\u2019m here to help you guys in any areas I can! \u201c Josh tried to focus back on Markus, staring his thick plump lips then up at his perfect shaped nose. His chocolate brown skin was clear of any acne, Markus took pride in his hygiene and self care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Well it\u2019s a bit silly, I have to get someone to follow me around and capture my day to day living. From the time I wake up till when I sleep. It\u2019s for a film class and I need to pass or else I won\u2019t be able to play basketball this season. \u201c Markus slowly lowered Josh down, to place him on his knee. Staring down at him while he placed a hand behind him to block him from flying off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second, Markus did just save him... And he seemed responsible..... Also caring? Plus he wanted to get to know him a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I guess I can help! Just take me back to the office so I can shower and grow back! \u201c Josh cupped his hands yelling up at the skyscraper of a man. Staring at his nice defined abs and pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus smiled happily, \u201c Hey hey can you just stay that size? I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be more thrilling and exciting if it came from your point of view! You can shower or take a bath in a bottle cap at my place! You can use your phone to film me. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn\u2019t process any of this, being the person that he was. He just agreed with it. \u201c Sure! Just tell Tyler! He can be boss for a day! I don\u2019t mind helping plus my phone has insane battery life! \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his shift Markus was jogging up the stairs to his apartment with his tiny boss in his closed fist. Opening the door he walked to the kitchen and placed Josh down on the counter top as he opened the fridge to get some food out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus\u2019 two roommates were home and they greeted him in the kitchen. They all played on the same basketball team and did everything together. Daniel was 6\u20197 weighing 230lbs, he was mixed with Hispanic and African American. Rocking a head of curly hair. He had a nice build, similar to Markus.  Kendrick was 6\u20198 and weighed 260 lbs, he was a bit more on the thicker side but still athletic; he was also African American. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stared up in awe at the three massive skyscrapers as they talked and joked around. Markus glanced down at Josh every once in a while, Kendrick\u2019s eyes followed and made a gross face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Dude a bug! Let me squish it! \u201c He was about to slam his hand down when Markus quickly grabbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Yoooo! That\u2019s not a bug! That\u2019s my boss at that water park! \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new friends blinked and lowered their huge faces down to get a better look at Josh who nervously waved up at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Yooooo he\u2019s tiny! Sheesh I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t misplace him! \u201c Daniel chuckled. While<br>\r\nStudying Josh. \u201c Man it must be crazy being that size, I must be like a god to you man. It\u2019s okay I\u2019ll protect you. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was relieved when Daniel offered the protection, there was a ring at the door and Kendrick rushed to open it. Carrying back three bags of food, he placed out the take out Chinese. The three giants was too zoned out on the food and setting up everything that Josh was now being blown around by the force of the objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c G-GUYS! \u201c he yelled out but he couldn\u2019t be heard over their loud deep voices as they joked around and was fixing their plates of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one styrofoam plate swinging open, Josh was blown with force and landed into the bed of rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up and saw it belonged to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You got a death wish or something?\" Markus scolded Josh, as if it was the tiny man's fault he kept ending up in food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, second time?\" Daniel asked Josh, again with a slight chuckle. \"Markus never looks at his food, dude. You'll need me to keep an eye out for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks!\" Josh stuttered as he spoke to the handsome dark skinned giant. \"It has been just really bad luck on my part though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus looked down at Josh, feeling a little bad. It wasn't like the tiny man was trying to get eaten. \"Sorry, bro. I'll try and be a little more careful too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, really!\" Josh smiled at Markus. \"I guess I owe you and Daniel now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude! Don't mention it!\" Daniel gave a handsome smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Danny. Weren't you the one with the biology project?\" Markus asked, knowing they weren't in the same class but feeling like that why he brought it up before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah bro.\" Daniel looked at Markus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if Josh feels like he owes you maybe he could help with it. I'll help too, since I kinda owe you too for stopping me from eating him.\" Markus gave a bright white smile. \"He's super smart bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well sure bro. But honestly I thought the Honey I Shrunk the Kids parody sounded like more fun. We could do that for your film project!\" Daniel offered the idea as a way to not feel like the two owed him anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Nahhh dude.\" Markus shrugged the idea off as he went back to eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what were you gonna do for the project?\" Kendrick asked, wanting to be involved in these plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just gonna film my day tomorrow. Just following my daily routine from his point of view.\" Markus answered, feeling like that should be good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's boring, yo. Do the parody. I can help too!\" Kendrick offered. \"He's already shrunk too, it's a perfect idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Danny's bio project?\" Markus asked. \"He's gotta pass bio just as much as I need to pass film.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, I can just write a report. It doesn't have to be fancy.\" Daniel retracted, feeling like he didn't need anything flashy like Josh could provide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, what do you think, dude?\" Markus looked down at Josh, asking with deep sexy voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um...\" Josh thought about it. It was a good way to repay Daniel, but then he'd have to \"projects\" to help with. Meanwhile if he did the Honey I Shrunk the Kids thing, he imagined he might be able to get home a little sooner and avoid any more incidents that might happen following Markus around all day tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought on it for a second and decided...  </span></div></div>",

Besides, it sounded like everyone wanted to help with it!\" Josh offered his opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'd probably get a better grade.\" Markus mulled on it for a second. \"Sure why not. How we doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'd just come up with some kind of script, maybe make fun of the stuff they did in the movie.\" Daniel started coming up with ideas. \"Could make fun of how fake ass all the props looked like back in the day. Besides we don't even need effects when we have the real deal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have shots from out point of view and shots from his view where he's trying to get our attention.\" Kendrick added to Daniels ideas. \"Then just have him get in more and more crazy situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love it dude!\" Daniel stood up in excitement. \"Markus your project is gonna be amazing, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, we don't have to go through all that trouble.\" Markus waved his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be too much trouble. We'll do it in one take and splice it all together later.\" Daniel disregarded Markus's concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time went by as the three men cleaned up a bit and set up a few props. Daniel had offered Josh a few lines to say, and told him roughly where they'd be moving him and when. Daniel placed Josh down on the ground in the living room of the three giant's apartment. Remembering the plan, Josh pulled out his phone and started recording after the three men left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Markus is going to film Kendrick and Daniel as they go along with the script...\" Josh reminded himself as he started his own recording and took a deep breath, ready to attempt his acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened? Where am I?\" Josh asked out loud with a little drama in his voice. \"I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore, Toto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh said the quote as he panned his camera to a large protein bar wrapper that Daniel had placed near him. \"I don't think I'm in the food chain anymore, Dorothy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked by the wrapper as Daniel instructed him, making his way toward an overturned water bottle with a little water spilled out on the wooden floor. Josh approached the puddle, which to him looked like a massive lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a lake doing on this floor?\" Josh asked aloud. \"Wait... it's not a lake. It's just a water bottle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few second went by and Josh heard the front door open as he watched as Daniel and Kendrick walked into the apartment, feet pounding on the ground like earthquakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EARTHQUAKE!\" Josh yelled as he watched Daniel approach, panning his camera to make sure he didn't get Markus in the shot as he filmed with his phone. \"No worse, GIANTS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh filmed Daniel as he walked in his direction, stomping on the water bottle with a mighty crunch, Josh flinched as the sound was incredibly loud from his point of view. Josh could see Markus scanning to floor, silently directing Daniel so he wasn't actually stepped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What did I tell you about picking up your garbage?\" Daniel said to Kendrick as he took his foot off the bottle and reached over for the wrapper. Josh panned his camera, watching Daniel as he picked up the wrapper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get them to see me!\" Josh said dramatically as he ran toward the water bottle just as Daniel had reached down for it. Daniel held his hand down for a second longer was he watched from the corner of his eye as Josh wedged him onto the underside of his finger between his skin and the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, man wipe yo shit up!\" Daniel acted as Kendrick rolled his eyes and walked over with a paper towel to clean up the tiny puddle. Markus made sure to get a shot of the tiny puddle, showing how tiny and insignificant it was compared to Kendrick, hoping the shot from Josh's point of view made it look massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held on to Daniel's finger as the giant dropped the bottle into the garbage before resting his hand on the kitchen counter. Josh jumped off the hand onto the counter, now panning the camera to show Daniel and Kendrick as the two giant's talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, my bad bro.\" Kendrick apologized. \"Sometimes I take a shot to practice and I bank hard off the rim of the garbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendrick did a shot with a water bottle he had in his hand, swishing it into the garbage perfectly. He gave a cocky smile and shrugged his shoulders. \"See, practice make's perfect, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you should actual practice that seriously!\" Daniel dropped the corny joke as Kendrick laughed and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure whatever man!\" Kendrick said as he walked out of the room. Josh panned up to Daniel, who loomed over him like a massive mountain. Daniel shook his head as he walked slowly away from the counter. before disappearing the same way as Kendrick. Josh turned his camera as he saw Markus follow after them, instead looking at a massive box of cheerios that sat on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these cheerios are the sizes of trucks!\" Josh exclaimed as he approached a few Daniel had deliberately laid out on the counter. \"I guess I can snack on these while I wait for them to come back. I have to get one of those guys to notice me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reached up and showed the massive size of the cheerio before digging his hand in and trying to grab a bite. Josh could hear the pounding of feet behind him, knowing the next part of the plan as he faced forward at the cheerio before turning dramatically to look up at a massive, now shirtless Kendrick. Josh swallowed, he didn't know Kendrick was taking his shirt off for this this part of film but he was truly a sight to behold with his massive wide and thick muscle complete with a thick looking six pack and huge pecs. Josh forgot his line as he simply gave off a surprised gasp as he watched Kendrick grab the box of cereal and start pouring it into his bowl. The giant deliberately let a few cheerios fall onto the counter, as Josh watched them drop near him like massive falling doughnuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You making a mess on the counter too, bro?\" Josh heard Daniels voice as he rejoined Kendrick in the kitchen. Josh panned from Daniel to Kendrick as the huge man rolled his eyes and set the box down before taking his hand and sweeping it off the counter into his bowl. Josh screamed as he was swept along with the cereal and crashed into the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude. Just a little clumsy. I'll eat it.\" Kendrick smiled as he reached into the fridge to grab some milk. He giant poured the milk into bowl as Josh found himself in the center of a cheerio, purely by chance as he stayed afloat, holding his phone above the surface trying not to get it too wet. Josh held the edge of the middle of the cheerio and he tried to continue to get good shots up and out of the bowl and he heard the plunk of a spoon drop in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, hurry up. Eat and get changed! We have practice!\" Daniel continued to act as he stood there in basketball clothes, motioning to Kendrick's half dressed self as he only wore shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you're being so pushy today bruh.\" Kendrick responded with a raised eyebrow scooping into his cereal, deliberately missing Josh a few times. \"I'll eat fast, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh saw there wasn't much left the bowl as the spoon scooped under him this time. He found himself being raised up to Kendrick's mouth as he could see Markus recording the moment, clearly with an eye on his as he approached the giant's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat me!\" Josh yelled out his line. \"Nooooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went silent as Kendrick closed his mouth around him. Part of the plan was to have it seem like the tiny was actually eaten as part of the parody, just as Daniel had planned. What Josh didn't know was Kendrick misunderstood the direction, lurching his tongue and swallowing the cereal and Josh. Josh screamed, having no idea what was going on as he was sent down into the titanic athlete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuurrrrpppp!\" Kendrick set the bowl down and patted his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, dude.\" Daniel gave a genuine complement as Markus cut the recording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, guys! That went exactly to plan!\" Markus said excitedly as he looked down at the time of the recording. \"We just need Josh to send us his side of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I gotta let him go all way down first, yo.\" Kendrick rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, dude? Did you actually swallow him?\" Daniel looked at Kendrick with surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I not supposed to?\" Kendrick asked, honestly not sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... bruh...\" Markus answered, a little frozen in his tracks. \"Well maybe this could work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so, Kenny has to puke the little guy up.\" Daniel crossed his arms, feeling like this was a bit of a setback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if he leaves him down there for a minute, maybe he'll get a cool footage or something.\" Markus tried to shed a little light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's true I guess.\" Daniel tilted his head. \"Still though, he's probably tweaking. This wasn't part of the plan I told him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus thought for a second before thinking...         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Daniel! Markus! Someone!\" Josh yelled as he looked over at Daniel who was completely engrossed in his food. Just as Josh turned back from looking at Daniel, Josh noticed darkness start to surround him as Markus had shoved the spoon finally into his mouth, closing Josh in and sliding off the utensil and into the the moist pink cavern. Tossed about in the mess of rice, Josh screamed as Markus has started chewing the already small grains of rice into even smaller pieces. Josh curled himself up, desperate not to be mashed to bits by Markus's perfect white teeth. Screaming as he was tossed about in a mess of saliva and mushed rice, Josh found himself somehow slammed against one of Markus's teeth, having the wind knocked out of him as he collapsed face first into Markus's tongue as the massive giant started to situate the food to the back of his throat. Squinting with pain in his eyes, Josh looked up to see a massive pink uvula fade in and out of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Josh struggled to say as he clenched his chest before he was interrupted by a deafening gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This rice is delicious, dudes.\" Markus commented as he opened up another take-out container and dumped a ton of chicken, beef, and veggies on to his plate with the remainder of his rice. Kendrick and and Daniel looked up at Markus as he stood up and made his way over toward the fridge. \"You guys want anything to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beer me, bro!\" Kendrick called to Markus, as he tossed a beer across to his friend, catching it and cracking it open with a swift motion. Markus pointed at Daniel who had a piece of chicken sticking out of his mouth, which he quickly swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water, dude!\" Daniel called over to Markus, who tossed a water bottle at his friend before grabbing one for himself as well. Markus opened his water as he walked back to the table, taking a chug of it as he sat back down and stuck his fork into a piece of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" Markus said aloud as he filled the bottle cap with water and set it on the table. \"Yo, boss. I promised you could wash off in a bottle cap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus looked around on the table, expecting to see movement come from around where he left Josh before they grabbed their food. Markus paused his eating as he looked around the table as Kendrick and Daniel continued to chow down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" Markus asked again looking a little closer, turning over a few napkins and lifting up his plate and tipping Daniel's slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're gonna knock my food onto the table.\" Daniel complained as he grabbed his plate from Markus before he accidentally tipped it completely over. \"What are you doing anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys forget about my tiny boss already?\" Markus moved a few more things around the table as he looked. \"Yo, what if we accidentally knocked him on the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got up and walked to the fridge. Do you think you stomped him like an ant?\" Kendrick joked, still feeling like the tiny man was barely anything but a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't say that!\" Markus looked concerned for a moment. \"Look just help me look for him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro what if we accidentally squash him while we look for him?\" Daniel offered his concern, not wanting to accidentally hurt the tiny guy. \"Maybe we should finish eating, then carefully leave the room and let him go to a spot we can spot him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo further illustrate his point, Daniel took a napkin and set it on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, little dude!\" Daniel called out across the ground. \"If you're on the ground, get on this napkin so we can find you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, my man!\" Markus looked at Daniel optimistically. Following his buddy's lead, Markus set a napkin on the table. \"Yo, Josh! Same deal on the table. Laid a napkin here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down, Markus nodded at his friends, figuring this was as much as they could do for now. Finishing their food the three men agreed to very carefully leave the table making their way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boss! The place is all yours! We're going to the gym!\" Markus called out to the empty apartment. \"Don't forget you have to help me with that project, so no hiding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thrashed about, trying to stay at the top of the mushed up and watery food. Josh thanked his lucky stars he wasn't chewed up before he got swallowed, and he even had momentary bursts of freshness as water entered the mammoth stomach. But Josh knew none of that was going to save him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Josh cried out to no one in particular. \"We avoided this earlier! Why did it have to happen anyway?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Josh felt it was fate that Markus was going to have eaten him. What with the close call earlier, it seemed like the universe just delayed the inevitable. Depressed, Josh found his way to a fleshy wall as he could feel some of Markus's movement, seeming like he was swaying side to side like he was walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've just ate me earlier if it was going to happen anyway!\" Josh punched the side of the squishy wall, feeling a little bad after he did so. \"I've got to do something. I can't just stay in here and wait to be saved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh renewed his determination, he was once again met with other plans. Markus body had started bouncing up and down now, like he was running. Being tossed in the mush of half digested food, Josh stood no chance as he was easily swept up in the chaos. Sunk beneath the horrid sludge, Josh breathed his last as Markus's belly began to digest his feeble body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChurning happily, Markus's stomach knew not of the tiny life it had just snuffed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why's your tiny boss helping you with a project, dude?\" Kendrick asked as the trio had just started to arrive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I saved him from almost being eaten on a slice of pizza earlier!\" Markus recounted part of the story. \"Poor dude was stuck. If I didn't notice, he could've been in for a nasty trip to my stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, that's crazy. Good thing you saved him.\" Daniel said as he opened the door to their apartment and walked carefully up to the napkins, looking for the tiny man. \"He's not here, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he ended up on one of our plates earlier when we were eating?\" Kendrick shrugged. \"He's so tiny we could've eaten him by mistake like Markus almost did earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't say that!\" Markus looked at Kendrick upset again. \"If that were the case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro he'd be long gone.\" Daniel frowned, figuring it has been quite awhile now since they lost him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just keep looking, dudes.\" Markus thumped down on the ground, looking carefully at every tiny speck or pebble on the ground, hoping somehow Kendrick wasn't right.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Josh is the owner of a new water park called Shrink and Swim, where everyone and everything in the park is shrunk to fit in the sturdy glass box! You follow Josh as he manages his park, meeting many of the hunky lifeguards he has on duty along the way! Josh's day consists of checking up on the lifeguards and inspecting the rides, hiring new employees, and just relaxing in the break room out back. The break room is actually attached the the park and has space for shrunk employees and full grown employees to share. Most of the lifeguards prefer going through the parks exit and being grown before going into the break room, but Josh prefers to stay shrunk which allows for some giant and tiny antics! Also, when interviewing new employees he likes to stay shrunk to meet them, mostly because he doesn't have time to waste growing and shrinking just to meet someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf note people who are shrunk are about 1/4 of an inch tall compared to normal sized people. See an example of how small that is here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/item_id/2208743-Size-Comparison\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/images/item_id/2208743-Size-Comparison</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's enough giantess stuff out there so I want this story to be strictly male as far as giants go. Sure there can be women guests in the park or in the surrounding areas but all the lifeguards and staff are all male. As far as macro themes, I try to keep it mostly clean with focus on unaware, humiliation, crushing, oral vore, ect. I try to shy away from things like having interaction with characters under the age of 18, scat, or anything to do with frontal nudity. If you would like to add a chapter I would ask that you please use proper spelling and sentence structure and try to follow my general guidelines.
