I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I grinned.  \"Ok, for my turn, I'll play snatch steal to gain control of your red eyes... Then I activate Final Ritual of the Ancients.  This allows me to sacrafice red eyes, and the Kuriboh in my hand to summon Reshef the dark being,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReshef: 2500 atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Next, I discard a spell from my hand to activate Reshef's effect, and gain control of your alligator sword.

A grand total of 7300!\"  Joey was silent for a moment.  \"Erm... I only had 1500 left... dontcha think dat was a bit much?\"<br>\r\n       I scratched my head, then smiled, \"Sorry... got carried away... Well, good game!\"  Joey grinned.  \"Yeah... Almost had ya near the end!  That reapa thing saved ya,\"  Joey gave me a thumbs up, and coming from someone who could almost compare with Yugi Motou, that ment alot.<br>\r\n       \"Hay, let me see your cards,\" Tea Garner said.  She'd been watching mine and Joey's lunch time duel.  Before I could even reply, she was leaning over the table, and putting some \"parts\" right in my line of sight.  She stayed there, leaning over the table like that, and I began getting red in the face.<br>\r\n        I'd only been at Domino High a couple of days, and I've already have been having some dirty thoughts about Miss Garnder... Ofcourse, what teenage boy at this school hasn't?!  I mean, geeze!  It's just part of being a guy... Science proves that most men think of sex atleast five times a minute... I'm not a pervert or anything... If I was, I'd probably pretend to reach over to shake Wheeler's hand, and then \"accidently\" brush up against her chest, but I ain't that kind of guy...<br>\r\n        \"Well... Lunch is almost ova, an I gotta geo test today...\" Joey stood up and gathered his deck, then gave me a friendly wave, and left.  Tea finished reading Reshef's effect, and stood up straight.  She giggled a bit, and it might have been at the slight nose bleed that I'd just aquired.  \"See you at lunch tomarrow,\" She waved, and followed Joey out of the cafeteria.  I just put my hand to my cheek, and waited for the color to go back to normal.<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

You know, the girls that dress in the bikinis with the see-through silk skirts, and sway their hips back and forth... Hay!  Don't judge me!  What have YOU thought about her?  Huh?!  I bet its ten times worse then Tea as a belly dancer... I wonder if I can convince her to go as a belly dancer next holloween...<br>\r\n        Gah!  What am I talking about... I barely know her, and she seems to have a thing for that Yugi kid...  I talked to him once at lunch, but we don't have any classes together.  Also, yesterday he stayed home sick or somthing.  Oh, well I guess its about time I introduced myself.  My name is John.  I'm part of a student exchange program that put me here for atleast a month or two.  I'm living at the Taylor's house in a sleeping bag on the floor of Tristan's room.  Lotta clutter here... Reminds me of home.<br>\r\n        Sometimes, I get to IM my friends from back home, and chat about the goings ons of here and home... Thats kinda what I was doing when I woke up from that dream...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap: Yo Mike howzit hangin?<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Gah!

She's on that issue of duelist weekly, standing next to Joey in the back ground of Yugi's photo?<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Tea?  Yeah... wait...<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: DUDE YOU LIKE TEA?!?<br>\r\nSnap: So?  You like Hex!<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Johnny's got a girl friend *sings*<br>\r\nSnap: ...<br>\r\n**DMG_Gurl has been added to the coversation**<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Aww shizzle<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: Mike, did you block me?<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: *hides*<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: I know where you live Mike<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Curse you John<br>\r\nSnap: You made me<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: JOHN LIKES TEA!<br>\r\n**Machineknight48076 has left the conversation**<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: *giggle*<br>\r\nSnap: I DO NOT!  I just fantasize about her dressed as a belly dancer...<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: Ever fantasize about me?<br>\r\nSnap: You're gunna hurt me when I get home no matter how I answer that, huh?<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: yes, so y/n?<br>\r\nSnap: y... You were getting eaten by a croc cause you got in one of meh dreams...<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: Was it a kinky croc?<br>\r\nSnap: NO!!!!!!!11!1!!!<br>\r\n**DMG_Gurl sent you a nudge**<br>\r\nSnap: Stop or I'll block your ass<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: You said that last time<br>\r\nSnap: I don't care<br>\r\n**Machineknight48076 has joined the conversation**<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: wha'd I miss?<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: Nothing<br>\r\nSnap: You're both weird, its late, I'm tired, and I just got this to say... Screw you guys, I'm going home.<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: *Kills cartman quote*<br>\r\nDMG_Gurl: Screw you too! <br>\r\nMachineknight48076: *feels left out* :(<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I logged off, and turned around.  Tristan was standing right behind me, and was snickering.  \"You read that all, didn't you...\" I spoke in monotone, and kinda already knew the answer... \"Yeah, and its kinda funny... You like Tea?\"  <br>\r\n\"No, I just fantasized about her dressed as a Belly dancer...\"<br>\r\n\"Well your a bit late... I think she already likes Yugi,\"<br>\r\n\"Well shes still hot...\" I mummbled.<br>\r\n\"Heh... I'm gunna tell her you said that!\"<br>\r\n\"No!  Hay!  Dude!  C'mon!  That ain't cosher!\"<br>\r\nTristan jumped into his bed.  \"Well, get some sleep lover boy!\" he made some sick smooching sounds, and I chucked my shoe at his head.  We were already fighting like siblings, and I'd only been there three days... If you don't count saturday...<br>\r\n      As soon as I heard Tristan's snoring rev up like a chain saw, I slid into my lil' blue sleeping bag.  I then started talking to myself in my head...<br>\r\n      'I might have a shot with her... I'm 6'3, can lift 236 pounds... gotta fairly nice tan...'<br>\r\n'Heh... not a chance... Got a honking monobrow... I weigh 237... she's really cute... can't compete with the king of games...'<br>\r\n'WAIT!  Thats it!  Maybe if I can beat Yugi in a duel, Tea will fall for me!'<br>\r\n       My rational thought and the optomist within me now agreed on somthing. 'Yes!  There's a tournament next saturday... Maybe if I beat Yugi, then I can get a date from Tea...' <br>\r\n       I kept on scheming till my brain wouldn't let me think, and put me to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Musta hit him hard, cauze I called him up, an he sounded all weak an frail...\" <br>\r\n\"Poor Yugi,\" Tea sighed, and stared up at the ceiling.  \"So, on a seperate and totally unrelated note... Are you entering that tournament saturday?\" I really didn't care... I just wanted to know what I was up against.  \"Yeah, me an Yug both!  Why John? You goin' too?\"  I smiled and nodded a yes.  \"Well, I'm gunna work on my deck so I can actually beat Yug this time,\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, you'll have to get past me first,\" I said proudly, and according to the look on his face, I had brought up a memory of his crushing defeat at my hands yesterday.  He nodded, and shrugged at the same time, \"I'm sure dat win yesterday was dumb luck...\"<br>\r\n\"More like dumb skill,\" I added, trying to sound slick.  <br>\r\n      Joey stood up, and disposed of his empty lunch tray.  Almost everyone had left already, and classes were going to start any minute... \"See ya guys!\" Joey left, and I gave a quick good bye wave.  \"Well, I should get going too...\" Tea had finally peeled her eyes away from the ceiling, and her thoughts off of Yugi.  As she started walking away, I stood up suddenly, and blurted out: \"W-wait a moment,\"<br>\r\n       She looked back at me over her shoulder, and said \"yes?\"  I could tell my face was red... My arm was gittering, and I probably looked like I'd puke blood.  I didn't know what to say... so I did what I do when reading a presentaion to the class: I wing it.<br>\r\n        \"Ummm... I heard that there was an arcade in town... I was... Ummm... wondering...\" I scratched the back of my head, and tried to get at my brain with my fingers so it'd think faster.  \"You see, I don't know my way around here, and I was wondering if you'd show me around,\" My voice cracked towords the end, and I felt like such a loser for even speaking to her in the first place.<br>\r\n         She gave me an \"Aww... thats so cute!\" smile that people give you when they can tell you like them.  She winked and said; \"Its a date\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         I stood there frozen for a long period of time after she left... I blew off gym class too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Dude, you got a date with her?!<br>\r\nSnap: No... I lied... She's just going to show me around town...<br>\r\nMachineknight48076: Oh... well... HA... I don't care.  So g2g!  But before I do, I'm just gunna let you know that I'm coming to Domino high next week... I'm getting relocated for tossing some stuff out the window... They really get mad when you hit the principal's car with a chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         I chuckled as I logged off.  I knew he was lieing, and was probobly becoming an exchange student also... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Well, I got into my sleeping bag, threw in a pair of ear plugs to drown out Tristan's snoring, and fell asleep...</span></div></div>",

The lunch bell rang, and we headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Tea and I went into Domino. \"Don't blow it.\" I thought, \"This is your only chance to make a good first impression, so don't blow it.\" We came to the Arcade, and there stood the owner, President, and CEO of Kaiba Corp., Seto Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't one of the 'Nerd Herd'. Where's the rest, and what's this, someone new decides to join?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's go,\" said Tea to me. \"No, it's alright,\"<br>\r\nI said. In retrospect, what I did was probably foolish,<br>\r\nbut I was a man on a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really?\" asked Kaiba smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I said with a newfound confidence. \"Kaiba, I challenge you to a duel!\" \"Uh, John, this isn't necessary,\" said Tea. \"Actually,\" I said. \"With you cheering me, win or lose, to me, I'll be a winner. \"How sweet,\" mocked Kaiba. \"I would almost shed tears, if I had any tears to shed, that is,\" \"Enough talk,\" I said, activating my duel disk. \"Let's duel!\" Kaiba then did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn LP: 4000<br>\r\nKaiba LP:4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first, if you don't mind,\" I said, drawing a card. \"I activate the spell card, Terraforming, to place one field spell card into my hand, and I choose Pandemonium. Next, I'll activate Pandemonium. Then, I'll summon the Pandemonium Watchbear in defense mode.<br>\r\nNext, I'll activate the ritual spell card, Contract with the Abyss, to summon any dark-type monster in my hand to the field, as long as I tribute a monster with as many stars as that monster or more. And I choose the Summon Skull to summon Terrorking Archfiend in attack mode. Finally, I'll place one card face-down and end my turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" said Kaiba. \"I thought that would never end.\" \"I activate the the Fiend-Sancuary spell card, which places one Metal Fiend token on the field. Then I activate the Cost-Down spell card. Finally, I tribute my Metal Fiend token to summon my Blue Eyes White Dragon. And now my dragon, attack his Terrorking with White Lightning.\" \"I counter with Wobaku,\" I said. \"This trap reduces all battle damage to zero for the duration of the turn.\" \"Fine,\" said Kaiba. \"I'll place one card face-down, and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My draw,\" I said. \"I activate Card of Sanctity, which makes it so we both have to draw till we have six cards in our hands. Then, I activate Pot of Greed, to draw two more cards. Next, I summon Infernalqueen Archfiend in attack mode. Then, I activate Hammershot, to destroy the monster with the highest ATK on the field, so now your dragon is no more. Next, I activate Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy your face-down card. Then, I activate my Queen's special ability, to increase the power of one Archfiend on the field by one thousand, and I choose itself. Then, I'll switch my Watchbear into attack-mode, and they'll all attack you for,\" I did some quick addition in my head, <br>\r\n\"4200 LP damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting attacks were enough to bring Kaiba to his knees. Slowly, grunting with the effort, he got back to his feet. \"Hrrgh, this is impossible,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"How could an amateur like you take me down?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea then ran over and gave me a big hug, which I'd have to say was about the happiest moment in all my 17-year old life. \"I don't believe, I don't BELIEVE it!\" she said ecstatically. \"You actually won, I don't BELIEVE it!\" I happily accepted her hug, placing my hands on her shoulders. I figured anything lower than the small of her back would have ruined everything, besides the moment I mean, and I didn't want to tempt myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked to her home together, hand in hand, talking about my victory. When we got to her home, it was starting to get dark. She smiled at me and said, <br>\r\n\"Goodnight John, I'll see you tomorrow at school,\" lightly kissing me on the cheek. She then went in. On the way home that evening, there was a definite spring to my step. I felt lighter than air, like all my troubles were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad I seen the shadowy figure in the next alley over as I entered Tristan's house, however, I would have said that my real troubles were just beginning.</span></div></div>",

The sky-blue coat she wore, lined with white fluff, covered whatever shirt she was wearing underneath and wrapped around her slim form. A long white skirt flowed out from under the coat and ended just above her feet, over which were navy, soft, malleable shoes. Pale hair, colored like sun-bleached sand, fell to her waist. Her skin, as he saw from part of her face and her fingers, appeared to be completely white (which of course was impossible - she probably had some kind of skin disease). The only part which I was unable to see, as she had not brushed back all of her hair, were her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you'll pay for what you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she so mad at me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you defeat Lord Seto, then you mock him!

Your dad and your brother are usually home before now. A quick search tells you that neither of them are there. Now feeling really confused, you sit down and open the envelope. Inside is a single Duel Monsters card and a piece of paper. \"WHOA!!\" you exclaim. It turns out that the card is a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. \"No way!!!\" You remember the guy at the card shop telling you that there were only 4 of these in the whole world. This will be the PERFECT addition to your light deck! Then you decide to read what's on the paper. Nothing could have prepared you for what was written there. You read in shock:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Duelist:<br>\r\nWe have your family. We will only release them on one condition. That is, you come to the KC arena tonight at midnight and bring your dueling deck. We think that with the enclosed card, you just might stand a chance against our champion.

Adam was a graduate from duel academy and the youngest as well, and his father was and expert. Adam was a mixed deck user, but mostly had his dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel was intense, Joey and Adam were tied at 300 lp points each. Adam played a card called Foolish Burial which sent one card from deck to the grave and had a little dragon named Decoy Dragon with a measly 300 atack points on the field while Joey had his Reds Eyes Black Dragon with 2400 attack points. Joey chuckled at the little dragon, but he didnt know its deadly ability when Joey sent his attack with Red eyes black dragon's Black Flame attack. Adam activated it's ablity to summon any dragon in his graveyard to take its place, which he picked the card that he just sent to the grave, Tyrant Dragon, with 2900 attack points to destroy Red eyes and win the duel. Adam got up and put out his to be a good sport.<br>\r\nAdam: That was a good duel, Joey.</span></div></div>",
