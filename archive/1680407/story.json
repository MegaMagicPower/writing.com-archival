With the Stay Puffed Marshmallow man blown up and the Natural History museum now back to normal . New York was becoming more welcoming of the Ghost Busters, to the point they needed to hire another Ghost Buster. But there was really just me applying and as Miss Melnitz , or Janine was interviewing me . Mr. Zeddemore, or Winston , came over and Janine said I was it and he shock my hand and I was off and running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201c All right young Blood , I remember the first day I was here . As long as it pays the bills I would believe in anything, well lets just say the stuff have seen will make you turn white!!\u201d .Winston told me as we went down stairs to the containment area. He also told me that the whole Fire house has been rebuilt , after some dickless prick turned off the containment field . The whole ghost grid blew up and that\u2019s how the city became over run with ghosts. Since then it has been steady but more activities has been springing up lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You must be our Rookie? Welcome aboard I am Eggon. For now we will have you catalog and look up all of our more dangerous Ghosts.\u201d Eggon said as he pointed to the back of the basement. \u201c Um do you think I should be handling all of them, its my first 10 minutes here.\u201d I said not really sure what to expect , but at the same time the most dangerous stuff is right here. I don\u2019t want to breach the containment field , like that dickless dude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Not to worry , we have most of them under lock down and you will be primarily studying our newest acquisition . It\u2019s the \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They told of the artist trying to create a simple design that encoded the secrets of lust control over females, both human and ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the instructions and tried to comprehend them, as it said I had to cum on the painting. I felt like I was playing with fire, but Egon said that most artifacts were harmless and besides, I always wanted to be irresistible to women, both living and dead. I recorded a few fake findings and pulled my pants and boxers down. I began pumping my cock over the painting as I focused on the painting. It seemed to be swirling, with lustful images playing in my head. Suddenly I came hard as my seed was ejected upon the painting, and a flash of pink light knocked me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke later to the sounds of knocking on the door, as I put my pants back on.

I thought you guys caught her at the museum already ?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You see the boy is a natural , he already knows about what ghost we have bagged and not. Maybe he can also was the Ecto-1 when he is done.\u201d Dr. Vankman said as he came down the stairs covered in Slim. \u201c I take it the Sedgewhich Hotel , was active ?\u201d Eggon said as Dr. Vankman shook my hand \u2026.Yuk first day and I already have slime on my hand. \u201c Yeah and I had the other Rookie with me , the one that really I\u2019ll be honest all I ever see of him is the back of his head.\u201d As another new Ghost Buster came down stairs , he had field goggles on and was kind of quiet. \u201cSo After I catalog the new Painting where do I put it ?\u201d I had to ask seeing there was no place really around the basement, and the others were caring on with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell with most artifacts they are dormant, so you could actually hang it up some where if you want .\u201d Ray said taking the portrait of the Librarian out of the box, she was dressed in a vintage purple Liberian dress.

Hmmmm I didn\u2019t realize she had her hands crossed , I thought her left hand was behind her back. He thought to himself , as he reviewed the log he just finished it did reveal her hands crossed in front of her. \u201c Oh man I need a coffee , I wonder if the guys will pick me up one on there way back .\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was exiting the Basement , he brought the painting with him . The Portrait of Eleanor Twitty didn\u2019t give off any PK\u2019E Readings and seemed safe enough . As he came up from the basement Janine was busy answering the phones, and doing her nails . She had four phones going , one with her friend, one with the mayor , and one with a client. <br>\r\n\u201c You finished or what ?\u201d She said to the rookie who was about to walk up to the second story. \u201c Well are ya ?\u201d She said again , \u201c Oh your talking to me . Sorry I thought you were\u2026\u2026.yeah I am done with the portrait.\u201d The Rookie said realizing she was busy and took time to stop and acknowledge his presence. Where to put this thing ? He thought to him self , he dare not ask Janine she might actually kill him he thought. Looking at the lower level , there was really only one space on the this Portrait could go . It was next to the huge tarp , but it would look nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Rookie brought over the ladder , Janine asked \u201c Do you need some help with that?\u201d The portrait could fall as he brought it up to the spot, but did he want to chance Janine getting pissed off with him? \u201c If you have a free moment I would really like some help .\u201d As he positioned the ladder , and found the hammer with nails in the locker next to the entrance. He heard in the back ground \u201c Hold on , I have to help out the new one. He is so hansom and has a great butt.\u201d Janine told her friend almost whispering, to her and placing all the other phones on hold. The rookie was put at easy with that , and couldn\u2019t help but check out Janine as she walked over . She was wearing a nice knee high skirt and a button down blouse which was actually form fitting. The rookie thought she was attractive before , during his interview but she had such a thick New York domineer he would of never thought to look below her eye line . Let alone actually check her out , as she walked over to the ladder. \u201c Thanks again I don\u2019t want to drop this on my first day, its not heavy but just in case.\u201d Janine\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do you want me to do?\u201d She said with her hands on her hips , and the Rookie\u2019s mind now entertaining a few ideas . But he wanted to keep it cool , \u201c Oh um if you could just hand me the Portrait once I am up there . Its not heavy , and I am pretty sure this should be a breeze.\u201d He said as he climbed up the ladder , Janine like the view from the ground . As she handed him the Portrait , the rookie couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was under the tarp? But soon enough he would probably have to catalog it as well , and then find out the hard way. He mounted the Painting , as he was about to start coming back down a gust of wind hit the ladder . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHHHOOOOSH !!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Portrait sent out a wave of energy along the wall , and hit the tarp . As the rookie fell to the ground he grabbed Janine and made sure he landed first. <br>\r\n\u201c Wow I thought you were going to squash me .\u201d Janine said as she laid on top the rookie, both of them looking deeply into each others eyes. \u201c I want to make sure I didn\u2019t.\u201d The rookie said back noticing how beautiful Janine really was under her glasses , \u201c You know I haven't been with a guy in \u2026.\u201d Before Janine could finish , the Rookie Noticed what was under the tarp . \u201c What the Hell is that doing here ?\u201d As he made his way up to his feet , and took Janine with him . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rookie Recognized the huge portrait that was under the tarp . It was the source of all evil in the museum , it was \u201cVigo the Carpathian\u201d. A painting that had a ghost trapped inside it , and want to take over a infant child\u2019s body and rule the world. \u201c Actually that has been here ever since the museum took down the whole wing , especially the painting of the ghost busters. As a matter of fact that is what this was of , I wonder when it changed back?\u201d Janine asked as she rushed over to her desk , the Rookie quickly grabbed a PKE detector .

I mean if you are no threat to us why did the guys cover you up ?\u201d Janine was also surprised by this Portrait now speaking , so the rookie knew this wasn\u2019t a common accuracy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201c I was to weak to speak , and much to weak to even think begin my rise to power.\u201d Vigo said , as he stretched his head in the painting . \u201c Yeah but I have been here everyday and never seen you, what\u2019s that about ?\u201d Janine fired back at him , \u201c the departure hour is late for you . I spoke after the late hours to them \u201c Vigo said , which means that Eggon and Ray had to of been talking to him after midnight.

Either way after all the logging and the fun on the ladder the rookie was ready to get settled in. \u201c Hey Janine I don\u2019t think he is going any where , and the guys should see this when they get back.

But if she gets pushy I'll make sure the guys stop by my Aunt Edna's before they head over there.\" She hung up the phone and called the Ghost busters on the two way . As she finished she quickly logged in the next appointment and dropped her pencil , as she bent down to pick it up . RING RING RING , BOP !! Janine smacked her head on her desk . Ahhh She let out as she rubbed her head , and grabbed the phone\" Ghost Busters how can I be of service?\" Janine said still rubbing her head , \" SHHHHH\" She heard from behind her , she then realized why she bonked her head the phone was never that loud before and the ring startled her. .................</span></div></div>",

But Janine could feel something going into her mouth , MMMM Hulmppppp she said as she felt something going down her throat . Pushing her back against her side desk , Janine was almost gagging grabbing on to her throat . She then felt a force rush down both of her arms and into her hands, it felt like her limbs were asleep . The sensation continued down her body , she couldn't feel her legs and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Yes your fate is what all of Vigo's enemies will soon feel , these ghost busters will be next. Vigo thought as he could only watch the horrific event take place, and enjoy every moment of it. Janine's body lay motionless for a few moments, unable to see her from his vantage point on the wall Vigo could only speculate as to what was going on. Then a flash of light emanated from behind the desk , a purple glow start to pulse from where Janine was. As Vigo watched he knew some kind of sorcery struck the woman Ghost buster , but not the extent. Janine's body then floated up , as if she was a puppet on strings. Her hands lay flat along her sides , her head was still down . With a quick jerk her head looked up , with a glow of purple in her eyes. She was then gentle lowered to the ground , and stood on her own two feet. Vigo was in awl of this sight , what did that witch of a ghost do ? She didn't kill his enemy , as a matter of fact this reminded Vigo of something.  But what was it ? Every thing was becoming a haze , he was going back into the abyss from which he came from . Back to the cold emptiness from which the rookie summoned him, But then he started to hear a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world,They resound with God's own heart.Oh let the ancient words impart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVigo Awoke with more power than his last awaking, and with the faint ability to move inside his painting. \" Finally Vigo is free!!\" He said with out realizing what had just happened. He looked around and saw Janine smiling up at him , and holding the Church of Gozar Song Book. \" You? You are the servant of Vigo now ? \" Before Vigo could finish Janine put her index finger to her lips, and said \" SHHHHHH . You mustn't think so small any more ,otherwise the destroyer will not approve.\" Janine said to Vigo as she looked back down into the book , Vigo squinted his eyes at her and knew something was not right . He remembered something similar to this but he couldn't figure it out , it was like his memory was blocked. \" What sorcery is this ? You are no mage , you are but a peasant compared to Vigo----\" Before he could continue with his bold declaration , Janine turned quickly and said \" SHHHH. We must prepare for the return or the destroyer .\" She said as she flipped the page , a strange pulse over came her body . A flash of light was all it took to remind Vigo of what he had lost, he didn't have any memories of his death at the hands of the ghost busters. But in that flash he saw the Vision of Eleanor Twitty , faint and transparent over Janine's body . She didn't kill the woman , she possessed her . But why ? Vigo thought he was also frustrated at the fact that she kept telling him to be quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ah here it is , the Gosspil I have been chartered to find and sing.\" She said looking at Vigo , and smiling almost gitty with excitement. Janine smiled as she began to sing ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words of Life, words of Hope Give us strength, help us cope In this world, where e'er we roam Ancient words will guide us Home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sang the last part while the Fire station shock, and closed the Gozar Song book. She clutched it closely and gave it a hug, still not fully aware of what had just transpired Vigo looked around . He noticed the trustee's in the other painting were gone, also slimer was gone . Janine pulled her head back , and licked her lips. \" Now you can use your indoor voice.\" She said as she looked over to Vigo , she walked around to were Janine normally sat. \" Release me at once , or suffer my rath !!\" Vigo scolded not liking the fact he was the only ghost still trapped in a painting.  \" You will be at the time of the return of the destroyer.All of your enemies will know your revenge.\" Janine said placing the Church of Gozar song book on her desk , and then zapping all other materials off of it. \" You have my attention for now , what of the woman you inhabit?\" Vigo said smirking about Janine now being possessed. \" She is the vessel that will house me until , the return----\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The return of what  ?\" The rookie said from the stairs , with his PKE detector fully deployed and his proton pack charged locked and loaded. With a blink of her eye's Janine sent the rookie flying to the wall were Elanor Twitty once was. She walked over to the Rookie and said \" The return of GOZAR The destroyer, Gozar the Gozarian, Gozar the Carpathian!!\" As she finished he last line she looked towards Vigo , and Vigo realized why he was left there. The rookie was flung around the room as Janine sat at her desk, and smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I died all alone in that foul lower area of the Library, they never  found my skeletal remains . How could they of just written me off for dead , and not even properly searched . <br>\r\n <br>\r\nEleanor never thought about how she died, or how she was forgotten . It wasn't until the weird Gozar Exhibit went up that she even realized what she was, or who she was. She would of haunted the library forever , with out even knowing why . She would be what Egon would describe as a residual haunting , similar to a recording. Just an action played over and over again . With no thought or concessions behind it , thats what Eleanor Twitty would of been before Gozar came back . Even when Gozar sent Zule and Porthos free to bring fourth the destructor , the energy wasn't enough to bring Eleanor back to concessions thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor wasn't even aware she was a ghost until her painting came into contact with the Church of Gozar song book , and it needed to be sung by someone in order to work. Which still makes Eleanor wonder who sang the first song before the painting was mounted? As she looked up to see the Rookie now in the hep of boxes and junk off to the right , she had some time to kill. Vigo was fuming with rage realizing he was going to be a pawn in someone else's game. \"Shhhhh\" Janine said , as she sang another passage from the book of Gozar. Vigo was out raged but his rage fell on depth ears. She had silenced him in his portrait, and he could only move about in it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...As long as I have this body, I might as well make myself at home in it...\" Janine smiled at herself in the computer Monitor. Slowly she  unbutton the top button on her jacket, positioned just between her breasts. She felt them push out as she slide the jacket off, noticing that the only thing she had under it was a tight top that really didn't leave much to the imagination, with a plunging neck line .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Janine, you're such a naughty secretary...\" she said in a very sexy voice as she gave her breasts a squeeze, tossing the jacket into a corner. Eleanor stood up to get a better feel on Janine's leather skirt.she felt how tightly the leather  gripped her body, and squeezing her breasts is really arousing her. She Slowly kicked off her shoes into the corner where her jacket was. She could feel her heart racing, She hadn't been alive for so long and she felt alive again. . She fumbled with her shirt, and finally, after much squeezing and erotic moaning, slide it off of her fine body. Eleanor looking into the glass gasped as she saw her new breast, nice and full, with only the lower half covered with a tight black bra, just like her shirt.<br>\r\n\"I  really like these clothes...But I like my new body even more...\" She said softly in her voice. With  a little bit of effort, she began sliding her tight leather Skirt off, feeling her ass being squeezed as she tugged it Down .<br>\r\n\"Oh Deer...I'm really wet...\" She  muttered as She succeed in getting Her skirt off. She tossed it into the corner with the rest of Janine's clothes. She was left in nothing but a half bra and a very revealing set of undies. She smiled, pushing her new chest out. \"Yeah...thats it...I'm such a naughty Secretary, ohhhh...please, I want you sooo bad...\" she moaned, reaching up with one hand and squeezing herr breast as she reached around and fumbled to un-clip her bra. Eleanor couldn't help it she was alive again and had a smoking hot body to play with, she went into the back office of Peter Vankman and.............</span></div></div>",

True he had just been in prisoned by her but he was still a man , a man who was very turned on. As Vigo looked around he noticed the Rookie wasn't even moving yet , he could still see his feet twitching . But it was clear the rookie wouldn't be of any use to Vigo , or could he be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few minute Eleanor emerged from the back office , much to Vigo's dismay be was fully dressed. Not only was she fully dressed but as she walked around the back partition wall that separated Vankman's office from Janine's , Vigo was able to get a better look at her. Looking at her feet which were now in leather stiletto's , and had panty hoses running all the way up her legs. Why would she of cover those legs? Vigo thought, continuing up her body he noticed she found another skirt in the back .This one was not as short as the leather one she was wearing before but still was very appealing. Eleanor also found a frilly Blouse in the back and tucked it into her skirt, which was fastened by a wide leather belt. True her shirt was button all the way to the collar she also wore an ass cote , to complete her wardrobe. Also Vigo Notice she had new glasses on that differed from Janine's Sleek rimed glasses she was wearing. She was now wearing a wide framed version of her glasses, and paused only to gather up her old clothes from the corner. \" I simple must get ride of these Drury garbs, and organize them\" Janine said placing them on her desk. She took out the Church of song Book of Gozar once more , and sang a passage.  As She sang the passage Vigo started to see she was glowing again , and this time with a green glow around her. As she finished her song , Janine's Clothes were also glowing the same green glow . They lifted up from the desk into the air , as if they were worn by an invisible person. Eleanor's eyes glowed brighter as she Vomited out a green glowing slime at the clothes hovering above .\"BlaAAAHHHmMMGG\" as she convulsed and spud out this green glowing slime which became a mist around the clothing, and slowly dissipated from her mouth. As she wiped a thin trail of slim from her mouth and straightened up her clothes , Eleanor looked up along with Vigo at what was a faint ghostly version of Janine now in her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine looked out of it almost like she was unconscious , Eleanor in Janine's body opened up the Book again . This time as she sang a song , Janine's Ghostly image opened her eyes . Gone were her Brown  eyes , and replaced by a glowing green pulses. \" What are you doing to me?\" She said as Eleanor continued to sing , and pay no attention to Janine's request. As a matter of fact the song was much longer than normal ones , Vigo couldn't make out the words clearly but saw that this song was similar to the ghost busters proton packs. It lassoed Janine as Eleanor continued to sing the same song over and over again , as Eleanor made her way closer to the wall. Vigo could see Eleanor Twitty's Portrait was now glowing on the wall , and Janine was getting closer to it . \" There has to be a spirit in that portrait in order for me to keep my body .\" Eleanor said , it was the only thing Vigo could under stand out of all the singing . Poor Janine was helpless as her spirit was flung into the vacant portrait on the wall . \" VROOMMMPPP\" was all Vigo could hear , as the lose items in the room fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor closed the book and smiled at it , as she clenched the book she looked up . \" I always wanted a portrait of myself, this one is a perfect depiction of my new lease on life.\" She smiling and blowing a kiss to the now in prisoned Janine, who in the portrait was forced to smile and sit at her desk. Eleanor walked over to her new desk , and opened the church of Gozar song book again ...........................<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Three different sized yellow flowers decorated their left thigh and the right knee had a small red patch stitched in. \u201cIt\u2019s a pair of pants?\u201d I said somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBell-bottoms to be precise.\u201d Egon explained, \u201cCirca 1970, we were lucky enough to come by them while searching the Sedgewick Hotel a day ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the pants themselves aren\u2019t of a metaphysical nature, but they are inhabited by a spectral force, not necessarily dangerous, but elusive, and deviant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fair enough.\u201d I said slightly surprised before looking to them again. \u201cWhat do they do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey get down when they\u2019re not in restraints kid, quite a sight actually. Has to be a hell of a girl inside them to dance the way they do.\u201d Winston said with a grin and a chuckle. \u201cVenkman always wanted to try and get some girls to try them on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Venkman\u2019s research habits are unfortunately aside from the point.\u201d Egon said, even he had a small grin. \u201cApparently they became a host to a spirit during a s\u00e9ance aboard the Merry Pranksters Tour Bus in the mid sixties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl was probably to high on life to understand why her pants suddenly started moving.\u201d Winston laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince then, they\u2019ve been seen many places of note, you can read about it here.\u201d Egon handed me a clipboard with a few pages worth of photos and articles. \u201cOther then what\u2019s stated, the pants have been missing until we found them, not entirely sure why they were in the Sedgewick though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to try and find out why?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be nice, yes, but not entirely necessary at this exact moment, ghost behavioral patterns are a difficult subject. For now just begin categorizing, that will be enough for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you kid, if you need anything just holler.\u201d Winston nodded as he and Egon walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to begin, I heard a woman yell from up the stairs where Winston and I had come from. It startled me, causing me to bump into the container holding the pants. Before I could react it toppled from the cart and fell to the ground with a heavy clang. \u201cShit!\u201d I exclaimed trying to pick it up, but it was too late, I heard steps at the top of the stairs. I quickly through a sheet that was lying on the desk over top the container and turned around to see Miss Melnitz walking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey new guy, where\u2019s Dr. Spengler and Winston? I got another applicant that wants to talk with them.\u201d<br>\r\nBehind Miss Melnitz walked a girl in sunglasses, her hands in her cropped leather jackets pockets; I couldn\u2019t understand how I didn\u2019t notice her immediately. Long blonde hair spilled across her slender shoulders, curling at its ends, it framed her pretty face perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering I was asked something I shook my head slightly, \u201cOh\u2026 uh, they walked away, they didn\u2019t say to where.\u201d I responded to Miss Melnitz who was in front of me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, as if I don\u2019t have enough to do.\u201d She sighed, \u201cThis is Michelle, she\u2019s a late applicant, just let her help you do whatever your doing, I\u2019ll go find Egon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so I got the job?\u201d Michelle finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, it would be nice to have another girl around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait a minute! What about me?\u201d I asked slightly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both got the job, happy? Good.\u201d Miss Melnitz snapped as she walked away, leaving me standing with Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a quick look before Michelle turned around, not able to help myself staring at her nice round butt she had stuffed into the tight pair of black leather pants she wore. My eyes followed the curvature of her ass, to her thighs and below where I could see nice heels; given the creases just below her knees meant she was wearing boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019re we doing, umm\u2026?\u201d Michelle said turning around not sure of my name, I managed to pull my eyes off her before she realized my ogling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry! I\u2019m Travis, really nice to meet you Michelle.\u201d I knew my face was red, but I couldn\u2019t help it, or hide it for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled an incredibly pretty smile, \u201cNice to meet you too Travis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed somewhat and touched the back of my head with my hand, smiling with a big, dumb, grin. \"S-so, you wanted to know what I was doing?\" I said remembering I had dropped the container and covered it.</span></div></div>",

Wouldn\u2019t it be more important to find dangerous ghosts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, but I\u2019d suppose a ghost is a ghost, no matter how bad they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough, they seem like decent pants to be honest.\u201d Michelle said bending over to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could try them on if you want.\u201d I blurted out without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no thank you, I like my pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stood back up looking at me with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean your pants are way nicer then those, definitely!\u201d I laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u201d, Michelle shrugged off the comment, \u201ccome here for a second, it looks like something is busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my heart sink, \u201cMy first day and I\u2019ve messed something up already!\u201d I thought to myself as stepped over to Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s broke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah look, I don\u2019t think this little hinge is supposed to dangle like that.\u201d Michelle pointed to a piece of the container that looked out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hinge.\u201d I said as Michelle poked the broken latch.

As it made its way out, it caught its patched knee on the broken latch, tearing its pant leg.

She stopped about a foot from where they stood and folded her arms, then snickered lightly as she blew a small burst of air from between her soft, lush, lips that pushed a few long strands of golden hair from her vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle this, no worries Travis. We\u2019ll be on break in no time.\u201d Michelle declared, narrowing her gaze onto the pants, as if trying to intimidate the pair of otherworldly haunted denims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve only been here a half hour.\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cWait\u2026  does that really matter?\u201d I shook myself from my sometimes easily distracted mind. \u201cMichelle honestly, I really don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d I protested stepping over to her side. The moment I did the flowery scent of her perfume filled my nostrils, almost sending me off into a daydream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDually noted.\u201d Michelle responded, all to intent on her current course of action. Though the pants appeared unshaken by her audacious attitude. Seeming be pay no attention whatsoever to Michelle and I, the waist line of the pants merely bent forward once again, inspecting the torn leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the pants, curious if this what Egon had meant by <i>ghostly behavioral patterns</i>, and how they were difficult to understand. Distracted by them, I didn\u2019t even realize Michelle stepping forward; frustrated upon noticing she was being ignored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I don\u2019t care if you are a ghost! I\u2019m not losing this job because of some department store mark down! Now you\u2019re getting back into that damn container!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Michelle started to assault the source of her irritable outcry, the pants did something that unexpectedly stopped her in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began undoing themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Huh?\u201d Michelle mumbled aloud, baffled by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white belt unbuckled, pulling itself aside and through the first of the belt loops. Wiggling about, it pushed against the fidgeting button; helping it to slip through its hole and allow the zipper to slowly open fully. Swaying back and forth in a snake like fashion, the hips pulled over itself a few times, scrunching together until the rolled up denim reached the knees; where the pants suddenly fell to the ground abruptly, lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stood quietly for a moment, trying to grasp the situation. She turned somewhat to her side looking at me as confused as I was probably staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that about? Did they just strip in front of me?\u201d Michelle inquired, for some reason believing I knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why are you asking me?\u201d I shrugged, nearly at a loss for words. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s giving up so we can put them back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know? I got B\u2019s and C\u2019s in high school, I think discerning why a ghost did something is a little out of my league. Maybe if we just went and got the others like I said we\u2019d know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle rolled her eyes and shrugged. \u201cAlright, geez\u2026 your like a broken record.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d just rather keep us from being hurt, this isn\u2019t a fast food job ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, so I suppose dropping things and covering them with sheets is an acceptable practice here?\u201d Michelle turned fully around and folded her arms again, raising her eyebrow at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, wait\u2026 what? No! I-I told you that\u2019s not what happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, so I suppose that broken handle just happened to be like that when you got here? Your just lucky I\u2019m your partner\u2026\u201d She chuckled to herself as she placed her hand on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle didn\u2019t respond right away, instead just looked back up and smiled, apparently amused by me in some way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made me blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't get so bent out of shape, It means I think it will be fun working with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment caught me off guard. \"I'd be fun to work with?\" I thought to myself, dumbfound. I had never exactly been great with girls, let alone one like Michelle. It was actually kind of nice to hear, even if I couldn't wrap my head around why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, it hasn\u2019t even been a day and we already had to deal with a ghost. This job was technically supposed to be secretarial from the way it was explained to me.\u201d Michelle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood quietly for a moment, getting my thoughts in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess your right.\u201d I nodded slightly, smiling back at her while trying not to seem overly enthusiastic by what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, well lets get these things back in the cell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure thing.\u201d I said as I started to see a light green mist flow from out of the pants behind Michelle, immediately catching my attention. The strange wisp swirled about eerily, dancing through the air like a plastic bag in the wind. Without warning, the wisp suddenly darted at Michelle, expanding as it reached her. The incorporeal essence wrapped itself around her waist and legs, trying to envelop her lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichelle!\u201d I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Michelle jumped, panicked by the sudden outburst and somehow completely oblivious to the ghostly mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's face suddenly blushed as the mist crept across her thighs and crotch. Her expression almost seemed as if it felt slightly pleasurable, that is until the essence slithered through the toothed interlocks of her pants zipper. Michelle's expression quickly became that of being violated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!\u201d Michelle yelped as she quickly stepped back in confusion and swatted at the enveloping mist. Despite her efforts however, she couldn\u2019t drive her assailant back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was nothing more then a wisp, I could see every crease and indention in the leather as if something really had been touching it. The more alarming aspect of the situation was everywhere the mist went, left the pants with a strange green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to help Michelle, but before I could close the gap between us the mist was gone. To both our surprise it and the unnatural glow on her pants suddenly disappeared from around Michelle as unexpectedly as it came, fading away from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell was that?\u201d Michelle exclaimed, still blushing, now more heavily then before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly stepped over to her, having no idea what to say about what just transpired I simply ignored the question feeling it to be rather unimportant at this point. \u201cAre you ok? What was it doing to you? You don\u2019t feel weird or anything, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t think so. It was just\u2026 touching me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? What about your pants? The stuff just disappeared; it didn\u2019t... w-well you know.\u201d I trailed off, thinking about what could have possibly just happened. I found I had mixed feelings on the subject; on one hand my new friend could be a host to a spiritual force from the sixties; but on the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey seem fine\u2026 wait, what do you mean, <i>well you know</i>, Travis?\" Her tone quickly changed from that of nervousness to irritability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean, well... those pants were taken over by a ghost, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>SO</i> what? You mean possessed!? It better not have possessed them! These are my favorite pants, I spent $300 on them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I was just curious! All I\u2019m saying is we don\u2019t know what just happened, and we are dealing with ghosts, so anything is a possibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle gave me a slight glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear if you just jinxed me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! We really need to just go get somebody who knows about this stuff and have them check you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not volunteering for that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I, umm\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle took a few steps away from me as I stammered from her last retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look the other way for a moment alright, I\u2019ll check myself out thank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Ok.\u201d I sighed, hoping to god I didn\u2019t just piss her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of my peripheral vision I could see Michelle shaking her head at me before beginning her inspection. She put her hand down and slid it across her pelvic region, feeling the supple leather curiously. Unbuckling her chic, studded belt, she pulled down her zipper and began opening and closing it a few times before apparently satisfied with its function. Leaving the zipper down, Michelle gripped the sides of the center seam and started to run her thumbs across the outer and inner fabric line. Just as she finished and began to close her pants, the sides she held suddenly pulled from her grip, slipping the leather from between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Choose the next sentence to continue!</b></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Son of a\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought, followed by a thoroughly discontented sigh was the only reaction I could manage as my entire lower half jerked forward abruptly. The movement being neither steady nor graceful; rather seemed as if someone grabbed the sides of my open pants and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that brief moment when confusion and uncertainty began to settle in, I was reminded of being in school as a child. Gym-class to be specific. Being an overly stubborn girl, I was often taunted into a challenge by the boys. It\u2019s not that I was a tomboy or anything, but being told I couldn\u2019t do something as well as someone else simply because of my gender never sat very well with me. Most often the challenge was a tug-o-war match. Being how I am I accepted despite its usual and inevitable outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always tried to wrap the rope around my waist like the boys; supposedly doing this, coupled with a particular stance would anchor you from the pull of the opposing side. It never worked quite right for me, every time I would be yanked into nose plant. This sudden pull I felt while inspecting my favorite pair of pants foisted upon me the same feeling of helplessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d assume that\u2019s why the nostalgic thought sprung to mind in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lurched forward toward the long worktable in front of me, I put my hands out to brace myself as I came into contact with the dense wood. Tools and other odd unrecognizable objects that were strewn about its top rattled and clanged against one another from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even sparing me a moment to think, another more forceful tugging motion loosened my grip on the table; destabilizing me yet again. This time however, the center of the unwanted movement was settled slightly lower resulting in more of a pelvic thrust of sorts. It turned and pulled me away from the table toward the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling now in a clumsy manner, I skidded slightly on my high heels as I came to a sudden stop, ending up just in front of the discarded remains of the once possessed denim bell-bottoms. Unsure if I should be weary of anything more, I held my hands out and to my sides just in case I had to keep my balance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, nothing happened. The tension on my pants had completely gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously peering downward, I saw my leathers were wide open leaving my underwear on display for everyone who looked my way to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shame though was the least of my worries at the moment; I found my self happier at the fact of whatever supernatural force deemed it fit to yank me about had given up on its odd and seemingly pointless endeavor.<br>\r\nSettling back into my usual posture I looked to Travis who was still lost in thought, completely oblivious to the series of events that took no more then probably fifteen seconds to transpire. I didn\u2019t necessarily mind him not noticing though, if what just happened had been caused by that ghost, the last thing I wanted to hear right now was \u201cI told you so\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose four little words were the only thing I hated more then hearing I\u2019m incapable of something due to being female. Unfortunately for me, they usually went hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst my thoughts, my attention was promptly re-focused upon the most unpleasant sensation. My thong unexpectedly, and of its own accord wiggled and eagerly wedged as far up my ass as it could. Unlike the previous occurrences, this wasn\u2019t something grabbing hold; my leather thong itself actually began to move and slither the back strap up the crack of my butt. The front creased around my crotch as it gripped tighter, allowing the side straps to climb another half centimeter up my waist and sink in, creating small bulges of voluptuous skin between them and the pants. What panty lines were visible from lifting the tight leather of my pants were gone entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I tried to loosen the thong, the tighter it gripped. As if to deploy some sort of defensive response to me, my belt buckle sprung to life and slapped the knuckles of the closest hand to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, you\u2026!\u201d I bit my lip, trying to withhold the outcry of pain come from the twinge pulsing across my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt meandered like a snake stalking its prey; it watched me for a chance to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop it, the golden slider of my zipper fidgeted, lifting itself upward on its own and quickly closed. Still keeping watch, the rest of the belt properly adjusted its position with the loops running the outskirts of my waist before both halves came together and buckled firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to feel every inch of my now haunted leathers starting to shift at once, contorting and tensing around what I could only assume as the most prominent areas for controlling my movements effectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waistline tightened to the point of causing the pants to sit about a centimeter lower then had, just barely covering my still rather exposed butt crack and thong. The zipper was only able to stay closed now most of the way, I couldn\u2019t tell from the belt obscuring my view, but it didn\u2019t feel like the button was even fastened anymore. Overall it felt as if somehow the ghost was making my pants a size smaller. I wouldn\u2019t be surprising if I couldn\u2019t even fit a finger inside them now to even attempt removing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Travis I\u2019ll be back in a minute, just gotta use the restroom.\u201d I said deciding quickly on a course of action. Not even really waiting to hear his response, I began to run as best as I could toward the flight of stairs Jeanine had led me down initially. She said the bathrooms were on the second floor if I remember right, I thought as I nearly reached the first step before it started to feel like I was wading through water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy movements slowed to a sluggish crawl, the sound of leather creasing and rubbing against itself became ever more noticeable as the ghost metaphorically put the brakes on me. I was barely even able to lift my legs before I completely stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t move my lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Did you say something Michelle?\u201d Travis asked, finally coming back to his senses just in time to see my hips start osculating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the strangest feeling I had ever felt, completely helpless, and unable to stop my lower body from moving. My hips shook lithely from side to side, angling my butt outward with a slight wiggle with every pass in the gyration they made. My thighs stayed together for the most part, though my knees down to my feet would take turns daintily bending and extending outward to flare my foot out on my boot heel, ending with a little twist to the side of my entire leg. This alternating dance pattern, coordinated with the swaying of my hips, resulted in a single fluid motion of sexiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis stood watching with a dumbfound look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I thought things could get any worse, my legs twisted and spun me toward the long table. I hadn\u2019t noticed but my boots had even tightened, reducing the space within them by at least one shoe size. <br>\r\nThe next thing I knew my butt planted itself atop the table and bent me backward so my back was just barely touching down. Gritting my teeth in an angry blush, I watched my legs take turns lifting from the knee up to stick my feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few times, my haunted leathers pulled me forward, then slid me back into the previous position and started mimicking the same type of movement. Only this time as one leg rose, it would bend over top the other in a crisscross. With the last kick, my legs pulled forward and sat me at the edge of the table before crossing. It felt as though my little peep show had came to an end, but just as I was about to try and move I slid back again and started into lifting my feet into the air in succession once again. As I continued the sensual swaying of my legs became more rapid, until both my legs came together and began making a circular motion with my pressed together feet in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated with embarrassment, I went to grab my legs as the suddenly kicked forward, pulling me off the table and back to standing up. Before I could react my hips began swaying and I returned to the dance the ghost originally began with, though this time with more emphasis with the body turn upon my heel as my leg flared outward. This however came to a quick end as I was turned around so that my butt was facing Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ass began to bob up and down, leading into an overbearing shake from side to side of my butt. Afterward the dance began from the start while keeping my back in view, and every so often ending with a bob and shake of my round ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chasing after Catherine and you, Janine yelled, \"Let him go, fish lips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine managed to dodge the proton Streams as she flew into the subbasement. She began to laugh as she grabbed the bag of magic books and flew into the wall, her ectoplasm was enough for her to bring you through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I gotta tell the guys!\" Janine growled before she ran back upstairs. she paused as she remembered Catherine's words. \"Oh no! if we're not fast enough, our rookie might become a ghost groom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to free yourself from Catherine's iron grasp, she flew about the sewers, looking for a place to keep you, unaware her ghostly instincts were leading her to the tunnels under the museum. While the Mandala was turned off, there still was an attraction effect and a weak spiritual labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding an old cell with a usable bed, Catherine threw you onto the bed, closed the door, and locked it. As she was putting down the bag of books, you got up and ran to the door, yelling, \"Free me now, you... you... you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, Catherine flew into the cell and kissed you on the lips. You tried to escape the kiss, but Catherine hugged you. Her large lips were big enough to cover the lower half of your face, almost covering your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your struggles began to weaken, Catherine flew over the bed and released you. She looked down at you with a loving sneer as she said, \"You're a great kisser... but I gotta go read up a few books and see if I can make our relationship more... permanent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then flew off, laughing as she grabbed the bag of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regaining your breath, you got up and tried to look for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding the old office of the chairman, Catherine began to read the books. she quickly learned where she was, how to turn back on the mandala, and how to take it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uttering the spells to turn back on the Mandala and to make it accept her as its master, she gasped as a large amount of ghosts began to go through the fully re-activated mandala, their power filling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to her knees as she began to scream as the power from the other ghosts began hurt her as her body altered itself to hold it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept how she wanted you in mind, Catherine's body altered itself to look more attractive to you, using what she thought would be sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and ass grew bigger, a single breast or asscheek much bigger than your head. Her arms and legs grew muscular. Her overall body grew more curvy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pain stopped, Catherine looked herself over. Her green dress was barely holding itself over her body, only staying together by her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked over the books to see what spells stood out to her on a first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne spell would put your body into a magical cocoon, but separate your spirit from your body. Another would bring her back to life, but ruin her connection to the Mandala.  Another would simply give her a human form as a disguise, one that would even fool the P.K.E. meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a page, she saw a spell that would allow her to create and control minions out of ordinary objects. She thought of creating a large number of minions out of women's clothes, both to have minions to do her whims and to always have new clothes to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my minions later,\" Catherine said to herself as she sauntered back to you. On a mischievous whim, she will her body to look as it did before.</span></div></div>",

She watched as a number of underclothes flew about before getting into formation in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit sullen to see that it was only Brassires, corsets, and cami-knickers. Transparent women were wearing the underclothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've been spoiled my modern fashions,\" Catherine muttered as she gestured for her new ghost army to follow her to your cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the cell, trying to find something to help you escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bed that was merely a mattress on a steel frame, a sink with the water still running, a toilet, and several rags that appeared to be torn parts of different women's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were in what seemed to be either an abandoned sewer or forgotten mad scientist lair. either way, you didn't want to think long about what the fate of the clothes various owners ultimately was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you checked the clothes, you hoped to find a hair pin or something you could pick the lock on the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing, save cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamming the door brought nothing but pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking your pockets was fruitless. All you had was a few bits of candy and some loose change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you gave up and began to yell for someone to free you. \"Someone! anyone! Free me please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need to yell, sugah!

Mah name is Dixie. What's your name?\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Rookie,\" you said, having a quick feeling to go by that nickname for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rookie. how'd you get in there?\" Dixie said, producing a hair pin from her hair and began to pick the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some ghost kidnapped me. claimed I was hers and her lover,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixie stopped picking the lock, looked at you, and licked her lips. \"She's wrong.

She tore them off and said, \"And you're gonna be my lil' old booty call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixie tossed you onto the bed. Her clothes vanished as she leapt on top of you. You held her back as her face transformed back to her more monstrous form, puckering her lips. you weren't sure how long before Dixie raped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from him!\" Catherine yelled as she walked into the cell.

You didn't want to admit that, especially to Venkman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixie and Catherine got close to each other. Dixie changed her face changing back to her human one and reformed her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, little lady.

Catherine stopped when she was clearly taller than Dixie, with bigger tits and ass.
