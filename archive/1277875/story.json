Only being able to stare at the bottom of the huge sandal you start to assume the the bottom must be black but noticing some white patches that the dirt wasn't covering you begin to realize that you were wrong. Seeing the sandal start to come down you start to brace for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you got lucky as you see the sandal pass over your head and slam down in front of you causing a small quake that causes you to trip and fall on your back. Getting up you see Vanessa stroll up her front walk way witch you originally thought was her driveway. You then slap yourself out of shock. Realizing that you just survived that life or death scenario, you think that it would be best to call it quits and hope that she will just understand after you explain. Moving in the direction of your car you see it about half mile away from you. While running in it's direction you hear<span class=\"clred\"> \"Well guess nobody was really here after all. Oh well thought it was my date. But I guess he must be running a bit late\"</span> Vanessa says this to herself as she begins to walk back towards her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your just bolting towards your car and right as it seems like the car is a few feet ahead of you. *Slam* your car is crushed flat like it was nothing.

As soon as her foot stepped down onto the small car. Vanessa just assumed it was a piece mulch and didn't even attempt to look down at it. With you having no ability to stop your running fast enough you end up slamming yourself into the front of Vanessa's huge sandal. But right as you impact with the sandal. Vanessa was getting ready to walk forward and in the process of moving her foot, she having no clue that you are there had kicked you in the direction of her open front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly through the air *screaming*, you try your best to look in the direction that you are going but with the speed and air pushing back. you find it hard to keep your eyes open. Through the open doorway and into Vanessa's giant home you go. Hoping that you survive this fly, you brace yourself as best as you can. You suddenly become trapped in darkness and a terrible odor. As your fortunate enough to hit a foam like wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding to the surface below. You begin to feel yourself up for any injuries and seeing that you were lucky to go injury free. You start to take in your surroundings. And right away the awful odor that you smelled when entering this dark cave has come back stronger then before. The best way you could describe it was like foot, sweat, and wet dog. It was truly bad smelling and as you try to lean against the wall that you just slid done, you feel the damp, soft surface and look to the round opening of the \"cave\". Seeing all this indicated to you right away what this \"cave\". Was one of Vanessa's Boot's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you don't want to be breathing in Vanessa's disgusting foot sweat, you bolt yourself out. And once your out you make some distance away from the smell, Making a quick look back you Vanessa's black Dr.Martens laying on there side. Realizing you made some good distance you catch your breath. And looking up you see Vanessa entering her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa just casually closes her door over, unaware of the brief torture she put her blind date through. She straight at a digital clock sitting on her dinning room table. Seeing that it reads 6:00pm she says out loud <span class=\"clred\">\"Wow he's about 10 mins late now. *checks her phone* And still no word from him. He better have a good excuse for not at least contacting me with going to be a bit late or something like that. But I guess I'll give him five more mins before giving him a call\"</span> Vanessa finishes saying this and walks into her family living room to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the word call you feel stupid for not even thinking about it sooner your phone.

But you then remember feeling something drop out of your pocket when you went flying towards Vanessa's Dr.Martens. Scanning the area, you figure that it for sure fell out outside. And looking at the front door you see that it has some kind of rubber gasket lined at the bottom, that would make it impossible to climb underneath even at your tiny size. So realizing that idea is now out of the question you figure the only other option you have now is to get Vanessa's attention, either that or give up and live as an ant in this giant home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to Vanessa and once see Vanessa about half a mile from you. You realize that a good amount of time has for sure passed. Since it seems Vanessa has turned on the TV and is now upset *screaming* into her phone <span class=\"clred\">\"...I just can't believe this. I just got stood up, I mean you should see me I got all dressed up and look great. All for nothing, I mean I even gave this guy a half hour before giving him a call and no response. Like what a dick. He has some nerve, standing me up like that. *other person starts talking* ...yea he's like an hour and half late now. So, whatever, his loss. So do you want to come over? I mean I did get all dressed up theirs no reason to waste this night being upset at some jerk\"</span> Vanessa stands there listening to what the other person is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you felt bad and so you ran even faster so you can just try and get her attention faster. So you could explain your \"situation\" to Vanessa and hopefully get back to a normal height. And right as you make it to the foot of Vanessa's sandal. You hear Vanessa say<span class=\"clred\"> \"Great can't wait to see you soon. And you better not stand me up as well *haha*\ud83d\ude02\"</span>.

You know that this is your best moment to start your human climb. So pulling yourself up onto Vanessa's sandal. You are greeted with a familiar smell, which is the foul odor of Vanessa foot. But this time the smell was twice as strong being near the actual source. But you tried your best to just hold your breath and tough it out. Only giving you few moments of breathing in the toxic smelling odor around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the ankle and feel fortunate that Vanessa has worn Jeans. This made your climb much easier and as you reach her knee you began to breath again. And this time your met with an even stronger odor of perfume. In which you didn't really mind to much, just wished it wasn't so strong smelling. You thought as the ground (*Vanessa's Knee*) beneath you began to shake. Realizing right away that she is moving her legs. You tightly grab onto whatever strings and parts of the jeans that you could. As Vanessa begins to get herself into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying to herself<span class=\"clred\"> \"Jenna needs to get here fast. I am so bored and upset right now. I could really use the distraction\"</span> Vanessa says this as she begins to get into a ball. To playfully put her head down on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her giant face approaching you at a fast speed as you tightly clutch to Vanessa's knee. You hope that you can just manage to hold on since this seems like your best chance at an introduction. You watch as the knees come up to her breasts, her face becomes more clear being right in front of you and then her arms wrap around her gigantic legs to hold them tight. Her head then comes down on top of her knees. Knowing that this right here is your moment. You say <span class=\"cblue\">\"Vanessa don't freak please, I really need you to stay calm. I am tiny and on your knee. You gotta...\"</span>. this is all Vanessa hears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she reflexively backs her up in surprise and then quickly moving her legs down. In which you figure was going to happen so you braced yourself tightly once again clutching her jeans. <span class=\"clred\">\"Wtf? What.... what was that???\"</span> Vanessa says in a bit of fear and then she starts to look down towards her knee as she remembers the words that were said about you being on her knee. And at first she gets a look of disgust thinking you were some bug, but then thinks rationally for a moment and thinks that bugs can't talk. And you look more like a Polly Pocket then a bug. Her face then turns to curisosity as she puts her hand near you and tells you to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour then lifted towards her face, you arrive at her face and look her straight in the eye as Vanessa says <span class=\"clred\">\"Woa you are like some tiny man? How are you real?</span> *pokes you* <span class=\"clred\">Oh my, you are real...\"</span> Vanessa stumbles through sentences with being slightly freak-out at the situation. But after getting answers to questions that you didn't have to speak for, she gets a hold of herself and then says <span class=\"clred\">\"...So since your real, why are you so tiny? And on that note who are you and why are you in my house?\" </span>Vanessa finishes saying this and then starts to assume that you are just some pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to her questions you just dive right into the point and ignoring most of her questions <span class=\"cblue\">\"Vanessa I am your blind date\"</span>. Upon hearing this Vanessa becomes very confused, not expecting the tiny thing in her hand to say something like that <span class=\"clred\">\"There is no way that could be true little guy. I am sorry but I am going to need some proof. I mean the guy I was soppose to meet tonight said he was 6 foot 1...\"</span> Vanessa retaliates with this comment and you instantly repond with <span class=\"cblue\">\"Yea well you said you were suppose to be 5'2\" and btw I am 6 foot 1 or maybe more like was. I don't even know what is going on when I got here everything was so big and so were you...\"</span> You then ramble for a sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa who was listening to this and was now wondering how you would even know that she was exactly 5'2\". She then opens her phone to your profile pic on tinder to see if anything your saying is true. And as she comes to a realization she stops your rambling with saying <span class=\"clred\">\"Enough!...(you stop talking), I have no idea whats happening here. This is to strange, you seem to have the same face as my blind date and judging by the photos that were taken on his profile they have real locations marked on them which would be way to hard to fake, and just pointless effort. So, if you are him I will know that you were somehow shrunk and not just lieing about your previous height. So here's my test tell me what my quote and song choice on my tinder was...\"</span> Vanessa says this giving you a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you remember what those were and told her. Vanessa who was now in shock and belief  says back to you <span class=\"clred\">\"You are my blind date, so I didn't get stood up after-all. But I guess the question now is why are you so small?...\"</span> As soon as Vanessa says this. you two hear a sound coming near the front door that sounded like a car door slamming. Followed by Vanessa's front door knob being turned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(who was coming in?)</span></div></div>",

So you were sort of glad when you heard the door being swung open since it meant the question didn't have to be answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear what sounds like boots stomping around the corner and then <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hey girl, it's me. I can't believe that jerk stood you up\"</span> Jenna rambles on as she comes into the room. And you see a blonde girl who is a bit on the chubby side wearing a white tank top that exposes her tummy and jeans.  As she comes in she see's Vanessa, and stops rambling to say \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh.... whats wrong?? And whats going on with you hand?\"</span>. Vanessa who was just half listening to her at this point had looked up and said <span class=\"clred\">\"Well my blind date didn't exactly stand me up. It's sort of more complicated then that...\"</span>. Jenna just then gives Vanessa a very confused look and Vanessa has Jenna sit down as she explains the whole situation that your in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Woa that is something you would see out of a movie. But its real.</span> *your still in Vanessa's hand at this point* <span class=\"chotpink\">So he is your \"6 foot 1\" date. This is just a lot to take in. but do we know how he even became this small?\"</span> Jenna says this looking at you and then Vanessa does the same shaking her head no and then waiting for you to respond. In which you do with <span class=\"cblue\">\"Well I have no idea, I mean I don't think I was hit was some ray or ate anything to strange. I was just getting ready for my date and as soon as I arrived here. I was greeted with a gigantic door...\"</span> you finish talking and just look at Vanessa who at this point has set you down on her center table and has an instant response with saying <span class=\"clred\">\"Well for some reason I sort of expected that response, with all the rambling you were doing earlier. But for your sake I was hoping you had a better idea of your situation. But it looks like we have to conclude that your stuck like this. I mean before you freak out at me listen if we take you to a lab or hospital, the rest of your life would be you being tested on and that sounds like a terrible life to me. And since none of here are super scientist. Your just going to have to accept life like this</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you didn't really know how to respond I mean she was right. So, you just nodded your head in agreement and depression. In which Jenna saw you and had a sudden feeling burst through her. As Jenna's hand comes at you quickly and she cradles you tightly against her soft breast's saying <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Awe you are just to cute!! I'm sorry little guy but I just can't help myself. You are just so adorable like this. And I can't stand seeing something or someone so cute  be in that kind of mood. </span>*during this time Vanessa just watches and gives a giggle at the humiliating situation you are in* <span class=\"chotpink\">I mean cheer up little guy</span> *Jenna bring you up to her face a gives you a kiss that wasn't all that enjoyable for you and then she proceeds to cradled you back into her cleavage*.<span class=\"chotpink\"> Listen your in good hands right now. We can take care of you and you will live here with Vanessa, right Vanessa? I mean he is your date I guess it would be only right if he stays here.\" </span>Jenna looks up at Vanessa but continues to essentially suffocate you in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Vanessa has stopped her giggling and starts to think that maybe she doesn't want that kind of responsibility of taking care of this basically stranger. But then she thinks that it might also seem very shallow and mean to not only not give him a shot at a date with her. But also essentially turn him down because of his size. But it is also unfair to just lead this little man on since she(Vanessa) likes tall guys and does make that a must to date her. Plus if by some chance it didn't work out or did and they broke up. It would be so humiliating for him(you) to live with her having to deal with random guys coming in and dating her.

After a breif breath you get ready to yell up at the giantess who has essentially manhandled you with no request to do so. And then continue to almost suffocate you. But you stop yourself as you see Jenna who is just starring Vanessa who you realize isn't laughing anymore. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Vanessa *snap* V.. *snap* Vanessa, Hello? you can answer already\"</span> Jenna says this with some snaps to grab Vanessa's attention, since it seems she was caught in a daze. Which her snapping seemed to work as Vanessa turns to Jenna to say <span class=\"clred\">\"Oh sorry Jen, just lost in thought...\"</span> Jenna just responds back with<span class=\"chotpink\"> \"Okay well, so we can take care him and he should stay with you right?\" </span>Jenna asks the question again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa who is feeling sort of awkward about saying what she thinks about that has decided to as confidently as one could say <span class=\"clred\">\"No I don't think that is a good idea. I mean you seem to really like him so how about you take him\"</span> Hearing this you want to respond but as you start yelling it comes out to Jenna and Vanessa as <span class=\"cblue\">\"Squeak Squeak Squeak\"</span>. In which Jenna takes as you being more depressed about what you just heard and says <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Awe listen little cutey\ud83d\udc95, you should just let the big people talk for now\"</span> Jenna says this and then gives you no time to retaliate, by shoving you under one of her bra cups. Which forces you back into suffocating in Jenna's boob's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing that to you, Jenna then looks back up at Vanessa and says <span class=\"chotpink\">\"I don't know Vee, I have a boyfriend and I love him to much to date someone else. Plus wouldn't it be strange to have the guy your dating live with me?\" </span>Vanessa who has tried not to be to harsh in her sentences, just stumbles through saying <span class=\"clred\">\"Well.., yea... but I guess with... all that is... happening here... I don't really want to date him. I mean I might kill him if we had sex. So, this would be better for him since he wouldn't have to see me bring in another guy, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna who does understand what Vanessa is saying and does sort of enjoy how cute and adorable you are to her. But still has one problem with all this, so she says<span class=\"chotpink\"> \"Yea I know what you mean. But I don't know if my boyfriend would like a man living with me. While we still haven't move in together. Yo know?\"</span> Vanessa who has thought about Jenna's situation has the perfect response to that but has no idea how Jenna will take it. So she says <span class=\"clred\">\"Yea I thought about that so how about you just treat him like a pet</span> *Jenna gasps in surprise and disgusted face*. <span class=\"clred\">Woa woa wait before you freak out at me just hear me out. If your boyfriend thinks he's just some pet hamster then you will have no issues keeping him at your place. And I mean look at what you were doing earlier, you only get that way around little puppies and kittens. Plus you make for a great owner your sweet and super loving. This could be the greatest thing that could have happened to him. He is so lucky!!\"</span>. Saying things like those last couple of sentences are ways that Vanessa knows work as a sort of way to manipulate Jenna to be on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich it is working as Jenna thought about how cute you were and the fact that you felt pretty good against her boob. Like she was keeping a small animal safe from all the predators. And so Jenna agrees by saying <span class=\"chotpink\">\"You know what your right, he will be better off with me. I mean with you he would have to see the love of his life, move on without him. But this way he can have the happiest life in the world being one of my pets. And avoid the scary big outside world that would try to hurt him. I bet he's so happy listening to this...\"</span> Jenna goes on talking about your new adorable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you have been able to flip yourself into a position where only the bottom half of your body is stuck underneath the Jenna's giant bra.With being able to listen to most of the conversation, you think about whats being said. I mean first off Vanessa is not the love of your life and even though you sort of still want that date with her. You still know that you don't love her at least not yet. And what is this about turning you into a pet. You have no interest in being a pet. Hearing that makes you think that you are willing to take your chances with the giant outside world or maybe even be a lab rat then being this giant blonde's household pet. With the other options you would at-least have the chance to be either free or trying to get back to normal size. Plus this blonde sort of seems like a little bit of a ditz. There is no way your going to agree to any of this and so you just sit and wait for them to ask for your opinion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you lay against Jenna's giant Boob, the two girls begin to go into a full on conversation that isn't even about you at this point. It's just them talking about life. So you just zone out for awhile sort of upset that they still haven't even talked to you about there final decision. After some time passes you zone back into there conversation as you feel Jenna begin to get up and you get squeezed against her breast once again as she reaches down to grab her Purse. You then hear Jenna say <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Okay found it! Let's get ready to go, we have to hit up the store before it closes. Then it's fun times at the Bar haha\ud83d\ude02\"</span> You then see Jenna's huge hand come in towards your direction. She grabs you and takes you out of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been getting yourself ready for this conversation for the past hour. And as Jenna is bring you in her tight grip up to her face. Your ready to argue with the whole pet. But Jenna catches you off guard by saying<span class=\"chotpink\"> \"Awe theirs my little cutey\ud83d\udc95, you probably enjoyed being in my soft boobs for all that time. But\ud83d\ude18 sadly for the rest of your time, in till we get home of course. You will have to deal with being in my purse. Since these girl's *pointing at her boobs* have to get ready for my man. *In baby talk* And don't worry you will be  safe in there and we will talk later, K\"</span> Jenna says this and gives you a *kiss* in which you do your best to dry off your body. But also not wanting to waste this moment you try to argue with her and get her and Vanessa to talk to you about this whole dumb pet idea. But instead you couldn't because Jenna just ignored all noises that you were making as she put you into her white purse and gave a *wink\ud83d\ude09* then zipped it up enough to give you a slight bit of air coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can see is Jenna's armpit as you realize the Purse is to high to climb out of. So your stuck in here in till Jenna decides to take you out. So as she sets the bag in her back seat you roll around the bag as she drives. The whole ride was you listening to either Jenna and Vanessa talk or the loud music of the radio spilling out some dumb pop song. In till you finally arrive at there destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna leaves her bag as she goes inside the store with Vanessa. A few mins pass and they finally return. Jenna grabs her bag and you tumble around the inside. Then your greeted by the opening of the bag, followed by Jenna's huge hand that grabs you. Confused and angry at what is going on you only see a light that has been turned on the top of the car. Jenna gives you a smile and says<span class=\"chotpink\"> \"listen I'm going to need you to hold still\"</span> so with that said you are just completely confused. As Jenna puts one of her fingers over your mouth to make the process easier and then she starts to strip you without giving you any say about it. As she does it she ignore your struggles and your  argument of confusion. And starts talking to Vanessa,<span class=\"chotpink\"> \"We need to finish this fast. I think Chase (Jenna's boyfriend) is going to show up there. So are you cool with finding a ride home\"</span>. Vanessa just nods with a smile and says <span class=\"clred\">\"Yea I'll be good I don't think finding a ride home will be any problem *giggles*\"</span>. They just continue going back and forth as Jenna removes your pants with ease. Being only in your underwear at this point, Jenna holds you tight while she reaches into one of the grocery bags she brought from the store. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"So do you think I should keep his clothing?\"</span> Jenna asks Vanessa who says back <span class=\"clred\">\"Yea... i guess but don't put them in your purse just put in.... your glove box I guess\"</span> Vanessa says this as you watch her take your cloths from Jenna and just tosses them carelessly into Jenna's glove box then closes it tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look up in anger as you see some doll fluffy costume above you that Jenna is teasingly holding over you. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Okay now we need to make this quick so be good as I put this on you</span>\". And even with you trying to struggle, Jenna had used little strength to over power you. As your put into this fur covered suit. And then you hear behind you a zipper to lock you into the costume. Then your lifted up to Jenna's face who says <span class=\"chotpink\">\"AWE!!! your just way to adorable in this. We are some lucky gals to be someone so cute *giggles*. (*turning towards Vanessa*) And I gotta say I love that the zipper is in the back, that makes it impossible for him to be able to get off without my help *giggles*\"</span> Hearing this makes you mad, but this anger is nowhere near the amount of anger you get as you see yourself in the mirror, your wearing a hamster costume that covers everything except your face. Jenna then brings you back to her purse saying <span class=\"chotpink\">\"See now you can live with me and everyone will just assume your a hamster. So you sleep, while me and Vanessa have some fun\"</span> Jenna says this to you and like always ignores your squeaks of arguments and just zip's up her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin's pass and they arrive at the bar. Taking there purses in with them. As they get inside they see two open bar stools and go to take a seat. Jenna then drops her bag on the ground and now your just looking up, seeing a decent view of Vanessa's and Jenna's asses and also the high heels that the two girls decided to wear. You just stand there inside of the bag watching the two of them drink there worries away and then you see Vanessa get a free drink by a guy and they start talking for an hour. This fills you with anger, this isn't how you saw your night going. Being super small in a hamster costume trapped in your dates friends bag while having to watch another guy easily swoop in and take your blind date. It was very humiliating to say the least. You felt jealously coursing through you and strange thought of hoping that this guy and her just wouldn't work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

Backing out and your on your way. While driving you begin to think about how strange this whole situation was. I mean you were pretty much in desperate mode two days ago when you found out that all your friends were asked to the dance by girls and you weren't asked by anyone. <b>*Flashback*</b> ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the dance almost two days away you were starting to get to the point of thinking up an excuse to not look to lame for not going. You knew that if this dance wasn't a Sadie Hawkins theme you would find a date no problem, but given the fact that it was and most of the girls at your school either seemed to uninterested in going or nervous to ask someone you were put into a bind here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was in till you desperately opened up your locker that day and found a note, Reading <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I wanted to know if you would go to the dance with me, Check yes or no...</span> (then going to the back of the note) <span class=\"cmagenta\">Please put into locker 133 after you have checked a box\"</span>. You were all excited in till you read the number of the girls locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (You see at this high school there are four different parts split up by freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior. With the lockers for each class year also being separated into there respected places and each freshmen would get a 1 in front of there locker number, sophomore a 2, etc.. to you a senior with locker 403). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your head --&gt; 133... she's a freshmen. You know your going to get a ton of ridicule if you show up with some freshmen. But then again you didn't want to miss out on hanging out that night and you are desperate to say that a girl ask you to the dance. So you checked yes very quickly. And made your way over to the freshmen sector. With it being your study break and freshmen having class time. This was your best chance to sneak in and then sneak out very quickly. Which is what you did successfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*End Flashback*</b> Ending your line of thought, you began to feel so dumb. Not because of what your doing or did. But more so the fact that you didn't even think about what she could look like. You were in such a desperate state of mind. That you didn't even consider what the girl looked like. But it's to late now. So you just kept driving with hopes that she is some cute younger girl who is into seniors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to get closer though you see on your G. maps that up ahead there was going to be traffic. So knowing that would cause you to be like an hour late. you decided to get off at the closet exit and see if you could find a way over to your date's house. But as soon as you get off at the exit and drive a few feet, your g. maps seems to malfunction for a sec as a storm starts pouring rain. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Stupid machine... doesn't work at all in the rain...\"</span> you said out loud in anger. But with a flash of lightning, the storm ended and your g. map tells you that you have to make a turn and your at your destination. In which you do and see...</span></div></div>",

It might have been set up by a friend or yourself, be via an agency or someone you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date may be human or furry or a mythological humanoid (fairy, elf, alien (if so, nothing too weird). <br>\r\nAs stated, the date can also be either female or herm (female but with a cock/cock&amp;balls too) - as with the way the date starts, you don't have to be aware of even the existence of either macro/giant beings or of herms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontent-wise, I'd like to ask that death and destruction be kept to a minimum please, though dependig on how it's writen etc... I will allow some. Also, I'd prefer no scat. if you must have this, put a warning beforehand. Age-wise, your character is generally however old you are, but feel free to add more specific options. Other characters can be any age. It's fiction after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhenever you ad a chapted, be sure to include an \"other\" option or similar. this way, if someone wants to put a diferent take on something, they can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntry to keep an eye on spelling and grammar please. there's a spell check on here, and on most WPs. I'll not go loopy over the odd finger-slip etc... but do make an effort. This may be porn, but it should still be readable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerspective can be interchanged; just don't make it confusing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlastly, no one-sentence chapters unless its for covering options to lead to the actual chapter - If i'm making sense there. Any chapters I feel are sub-par or are too much on the violence/grossness, I'll pm you and ask you to tone it down. I'm also possibly liable to correct spellings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nso... anything else...? seems to be it... well, this is my first story on here; lets make it a good one eh? lots of options, but try not to have a story listing 30 chapters in which all of them are just follow-on options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun writing/reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGift-Points for new chapters (the better the chapter, the more points)</td>",
