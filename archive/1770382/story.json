I could feel the cold droplets falling in from the sky as I stood there and looked at the three fresh mounds of dirt. I couldn\u2019t believe they were gone. It was only a week ago we were standing in the midst of the Amazon Rain Forest, hiking and trekking through the trees. I thought that it would be okay, that our family could withstand the conditions. I was wrong, so, so horribly wrong. The next day we flew home, we all had a severe case of pneumonia and some other type of mutant disease. I was the only one resilient to it; the doctor had come in in the middle of the night to tell me that my family had passed on. I didn\u2019t know what to think at the moment. I knew I had to do something; I went and saw them in the middle of the night. The doctor had been right they were dead. The body heat rapidly fading from their now lifeless shells. I had been numb to it all.<br>\r\n\t\tI snapped back to reality, the cold rain beating onto my head had ceased as my girlfriend came and put an umbrella over my head. I continued to stare blankly at the three mounds of dirt. She wrapped a blanket around and me and spoke in the sweetest of tones but I didn\u2019t hear her. My mind was on the guilt, the pain that all of this was my idea, even though it wasn\u2019t I couldn\u2019t help but blaming myself, couldn\u2019t help but asking God, why me. She nudged me and my head finally cleared to the point of where I could hear her again.<br>\r\n        \u201cJohn, let\u2019s get you inside and warmed up.\u201d Her soothing voice floated softly into my ears. It was just then that I realized that I had been shaking. i let her lead me to the car that the funeral home had provided. She got me inside and hugged me close as I stared out the window and watched the rain turn to snow.  It fell so peacefully as it slowly started to cover the ground. The three mounds of dirt slowly went from dirt brown to white with brown spots. I stared out the window as we drove away and I told myself that I needed to go on with my life, I had to get over this. I felt Melissa\u2019s warm arm over my back and I turned to her, the pain of death was etched deep into her face. \u201cI talked to my parents. They said that I could stay with you at your house for a couple of days, help you sort stuff out.  I thought you might like that\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\tI merely nodded at the idea, showing my appreciation but not having to use words for it. I thought to all of the stuff we had at our house. We were rich, I will put it bluntly. Every year it was a new vacation, a new spot, a new memory, we always brought hundreds of dollars of stuff home with us, and our house was one of the nicest on the block. But that didn\u2019t make us total snobs, my dad\u2019s morale\u2019s had kept us in line. He always preached about us being kind to those who were less fortunate around us and treat those who were our equals with that same kindness. The lawyer had told me that everything in the house including the house itself was mine, the business that had kept us floating and allowed our wealth was being managed by my dad\u2019s main man Ronald Terrepet. I was told his last name was German but he always argued it was something else. The lawyer had also said that I was allowed all of the family inheritance when I was eighteen which would be coming up in about four months.  I didn\u2019t flaunt my riches at all, I actually appalled them. I worked a part-time job, against my parents\u2019 wishes of course, but I only worked weekends. I bought average clothes and went to an average school but always got good grades.My friends were average people, never asking for money but treating with a fairness that I could only find through good friends.  I lived a normal teenage life up until the beginning of the week, when that virus killed my family. I finally turned to my girlfriend and said \u201cthat will be great.\u201d<br>\r\n\tShe stared at me and had a puzzled look on her face; I told her that it would be nice of her to help me. The rest of the ride to my house was spent in silence. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa's parents pulled up to the two story blue house. The house now looked daunting and empty. My first thought was it was now a ghost house. A house without my parents in it and filled with dead memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa opened the car door while I was still at the back seat. Being more conscious, I knew to let emotions not get the best of me. I watched her open the door with her fragile mind take in consideration all that had happened. Her parents remained sunken to all the events and situations that was unfolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Click\" you could hear Melissa finally opening the door. My face was still showed exhaustion, but I managed to get out of the suffocating car with everyone knowing my parents had just died. Finally standing in front of my blue house now seemed gray. The forecast above my head showed that the weatherman predictions of today's weather would call for overcast and some rain. With the gray clouds descending from the roof of the house we all stood questioning if it would be a good idea for us to enter the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the knob on the door, the door opened up with squeek to push open. Walking in felt welcoming after noticing it wasn't as dark as outside was. Contiuing my path through the entrance everyone was still sad but relived to be inside. It was better to be inside than standing at the funeral cemetery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa parents said \"You really have a nice house\". A silence annoyed my girlfriend and after her parents realized what they just said, they began to feel embarrassed. Her parents were nice married couple who'd stock up on wealth from a life of selling party and fine insurances for houses that belonged to the richest, wealthiest people in the neighborhood. Her parents were actually nice people and when I first met my girlfriend I was relieved to know her parents were nice people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed my girlfriend upstairs to my bedroom to begin packing my stuff. Melissa hand turned to my desk and she picked up a newspaper. \"Why is there a newspaper here?\" Frantically I rushed to see what she was talking about. \"October 9th-, Parents died of unknown causes and with unidentified disease\" I freaked. All stomach bubbles were jumping in my stomach as I tried to remain calm enough to know what is that I needed to tell my girlfriend next. Melissa stood with her head cropped with her hair laying on her shoulders and asked \"Why would this mysteriously be here with today date and the newspaper hasn't even arrived yet?\". \"I don't know Melissa but you can not tell anyone about this.\" I could see the tears trying to form to saturate in the light but I remained still and firm for her sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know why people can't know about this.\" \"Melissa, it will multiply if we tell or not.\" They both stood waiting to come up with a plan and fast. He tucked one hand below his pocket and the other manage to go in his left pocket. \"I think we should go far into it and talk to the chief there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa knew it was coming. She was waiting for him to say so any minute. \"Okay we got to go. We gotta try this out and see if we can save everyone.\", Melissa said while bagging cloths in one suitcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could hear the parents downstairs moving their paste below so they knew it was time for them to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go.\" Melissa were getting ready to leave. \"Alright Mom I be back in a week.\", said Melissa in a loud voice from her boyfriends room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM! SMACK! The loud noise echoed and almost seem to paralyze everyone next move. \"Eddy!\" Melissa Mom screamed. \"What the\" both of them ran down. The disease was showing in her dad's face and pale was revealing he didn't have a fighting chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK. I grabbed my bag and headed out, grabbing my girlfriend with me. Back into the forest we had our cloths that would be descent for jungle hiking. \"Alright here it is Melissa. We have to get through this path to reach him.\" Melissa started to know that this may be the last warm tear she has strolling down her face. \"I don't know if the man out here are going to let us it.\" \"We have to Melissa, inless you want your Mom to be next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA orange-reddish plant with long green stem glowed by the infested poison oak tree. I grabbed my blade my father gave me on my 14th birthday and opened to stretch the blade. The cutting of the steam seemed to echoed, and a monkey seem to be alarming the jungle we were in a remote area. Rushing through the tall grass the flower was put inside my back pack behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pathway became visible once again and we were relieved. \"Why didn't they tell us the disease could be cured.\" \"Who knows Melissa.\" It was probably the best idea to protect this only flower left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are yall doing here\" said the chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, we were just going on a hike.\" I said trying to sound untouched by the sudden events. The chief seen Melissa face and that she managed to grinned to make everything look normal as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to hurry before the secret services show up with guns\" Melissa said, as she was already eagered to leave. \"Alright lets go.\" The chief didn't think to ask anything else and went on walking to where the plant was once at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour walk we managed to take the plant observatory to where they could liquefy the plant and make a medicine.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke with a sudden burst. I was dry to my surprise and I was also not in the back of that uncomfortable limousine. I turned to look around at my surroundings. I was in my bedroom; there was a desk on the far side of the room, a collection of different posters hanging on the wall. There was a lot of various things scattering the floor of my room. along the far side I had the dresser;  across from my bed in the center of the room I had the entertainment center which held a 42\u201d flat screen with my PS3 hooked into the side of it. I sat up in bed and almost collapsed back to the pillow, I was exhausted I knew that much. I heard the door open and before long I seen my girlfriend hovering over my face. I breathed deep, smelling her Jasmine perfume. <br>\r\n\tI reached up and touched her face. She laid down beside me and stroked my messy hair. \u201cI made breakfast. Sent the Staff home for the day, I figured you and me could use some alone time to go through some of the stuff that you have gathered over the years\u201d she said in her calm sweet voice.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d my voice cracked with sleep, \u201clet me get dressed and I will be down in a minute.\u201d  I said to her, the sound of sadness was clear in the tone. <br>\r\n\tI sat up as she left the room, her sundress fluttering every so lightly as she walked. I swung my legs over the edge of the queen sized bed and set my feet heavily onto the red oak floor. I moved slowly to my dresser trying to shake the tiredness that gripped me. I figured it was because of the depression, and the physical fatigue that I still haven\u2019t gotten over from the virus that I had. I lazily put on a t-shirt and a loose-fitting pair of faded blue jeans. I walked to the door slowly as I tried to retain my balance. I found myself thinking if this virus wasn\u2019t over but I brushed it off as I reached the door and my balance returned to a normal state. I walked through the hallway that overlooked the first floor. I stopped suddenly as a wave of nausea passed over me. I collapsed to the ground and shortly after blacked out. <br>\r\nWhen I awoke I was shocked to find that something had changed.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My eyes opened and I stared at the red-oak floor. Something was different, but I couldn\u2019t place my finger on what it was. I slowly sat up and looked around. My jaw dropped in shock. Everything around me was a hundred times bigger. The hallway was like a football field, stretching for a mile in each direction. The ceiling was high above me, as expansive as the sky. I felt something underneath my hand and I looked to see a hair, probably only six inches long, but to me it looked like a golden rope. What had happened? I couldn\u2019t be more than four inches tall! A loud buzzing filled my head as something large and black fly in front of my vision. A fly landed in front of me, big enough to be a cat. I stared into its horrific multi-paneled eyes and screamed. The fly disappeared and I sat there panting in fear. Suddenly the ground began to shake and I heard a familiar jingling sound. I turned to see what looked like hell bounding towards me. My sister\u2019s black Labrador, Marco, was galloping across the wooden floor, his tongue hanging out and his ears flopping. I yelled in terror, closing my eyes and covering my head with my hands, expecting to feel sharp canines cutting into my skin or claws tearing me to shreds. Instead, the rumbling stopped and I felt hot breath blowing on me. I opened my eyes to see Marco with his paws to the ground, tail wagging, expecting me to play. Stupid dog. I was just about to shoo him off when an idea popped into my head. I needed to get to Melissa and maybe Marco could help me. When my little sister was born, she was blind until the age of five. My parents had gotten her Marco to help her get around and to fetch someone when she needed something. Marco would respond to most commands. If I told him to find Melissa, he would find Melissa. <br>\r\nI looked around and spotted one of Marco\u2019s toys. It was one of those short ropes, the ones that are used for tug-of-war. I ran to the toy and grabbed onto its thick fibers. When I thought I was secure enough I called out to Marco, \u201cMarco! Here boy! Take me to Melissa!\u201d As soon as the words left my mouth I knew that this was a bad idea. Marco grabbed the toy, showering me in slobber, and flew down the hallway. I screamed as I swung back and forth, desperately trying to hang on. Marco trampled down the stairs, my body vibrating violently at the force. At the last few steps, the dog leapt and landed on the Persian carpet roughly. He stumbled a bit and that was enough for me to loose my grip. The fibers of the rope toy slipped through my fingers and I tumbled onto the Persian rug. I groaned and sat up, just to see Marco run into the kitchen without me. Melissa appeared, holding Marco\u2019s toy. The dog jumped up and down in excitement. My girlfriend opened the sliding glass window to the backyard and threw the toy out. Marco leapt after it and Melissa closed the door. Marco came up to the door with his tail wagging, but stopped when he couldn\u2019t get in. He dropped the toy as he barked to be let back in. Man, that dog was stupid. <br>\r\n~Torch~</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I turned and looked back at Melissa. To my luck, she began walking towards the stairs. I called out her name, trying to get her attention. Unfortunately, she was singing a happy tune and my shouts were drowned out. Her voice was sweet and beautiful, but now more than ever I wished that she would just shut up. I stood up as she got closer. Maybe I could jump onto her leg or something. Just then, the phone rang and Melissa turned to answer it. She went to the desk and picked up the cordless. \u201cHello, Smithson residence,\u201d Melissa said into the phone. I began to run towards her; I needed her help. \u201cOh, hi. Of course. Yes, I\u2019ll do that. Just that? Nothing else? Okay, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d She hung up the phone just as I stopped, panting at one of the legs of the desk. I wished I wasn\u2019t so out of shape. I had no more breath to call out to her and I cursed to myself as she walked away. She walked to the edge of the stairs and called up, \u201cJohn, I\u2019m heading to the store to pick up a few things. Breakfast is ready. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d If only I had waited a little longer; maybe she would have seen me. I groaned in frustration and looked around. Melissa\u2019s bag was near the desk. It could be my chance to gain her attention. I sprinted to the bag and climbed in, falling amongst the various vanities of a teenage girl\u2019s purse. Her mascara and eyeliner fell on top of me as I struggled to gain my footing amongst the scattered objects. I pushed the giant makeup off of me as I felt the bag being lifted up and I fell deeper into the pile. I could sense the swinging of the bag as I unsuccessfully tried to stand back up. I heard the front door open and close with a familiar click. The jingling of keys told me that Melissa was opening the door of the car. Just as I heard the car door open, my stomach was forced into my throat as Melissa tossed the bag onto the seat. For a brief moment, I was weightless, floating among the contents of the purse. Then, with a horrible crunch, all the force came down on me as the bag hit the seat and everything went black.<br>\r\nMy head was throbbing when I finally came to. I tried to sit up but a wave of nausea caused me to lie back down. Slowly, the pain subsided and I sat up, leaning against something soft but firm. It was dark wherever I was at and the sound of conversing was all around me. I lifted my hand and began to rub my head. My fingers brushed over a spot on my forehead that sent extreme pain through my brain. I had a huge gash there; no wonder my head hurt so much. Who knew makeup could be so deadly? I listened to the voices outside. From what I heard, I was probably still in Melissa\u2019s bag and she was at school. That means I was out for a whole day! I needed to get her attention.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon, Melissa will be back in her car, and when it\u2019s just the two of us, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll make my move. In the meantime, I need to keep busy. I have to prepare.

The important thing is, it\u2019s soft enough that I can shield my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing, too. My stomach sinks as Melissa lifts me and this purse high into the air.

When I got back from the store, the breakfast I had made had not been eaten and John was nowhere to be found. It was like he just disappeared. I searched the entire house but found no trace of him. He didn\u2019t even write a note. I tried calling his cell phone but all I got was an answering machine. After driving to all of his favorite hangouts, I came up empty. Where could he have gone? He had just lost his entire family and I knew that he felt that it was his fault, but he wasn\u2019t one to go off and do something stupid or dangerous. I just hoped that he was alright. Ronald Terrepet, the best friend of John\u2019s father, had called when John didn\u2019t show up for their weekly coffee outing. When I told him that John was nowhere to be found, he was concerned, but wasn\u2019t going to do anything drastic. \u201cIf he\u2019s not back by tomorrow,\u201d Ronald said, \u201cthen we need to worry.\u201d<br>\r\nI woke up that morning in John\u2019s house, hoping that he would show up, but it was just me and Marco.

I probably looked like a wreck, considering I didn\u2019t sleep at all the night before; I was too caught up in worry. One of my friends, Katy, walked past me. <br>\r\n\u201cHi, Melissa. Whoa! Are you ok? You look horrible!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied, putting on my best smile. I walked past a window and glanced at my reflection. I did look horrible. Maybe I would put on some makeup to cover up the mess that I was. I walked into the girls\u2019 bathroom and stood in front of the mirror, placing my purse on top of the sink. I opened my bag and began rummaging through the junk for some mascara. The last time I had been in my purse was two days ago. My fingers wrapped around my mascara, but just as they did, I felt something on the top of my hand. I thought something had tipped over and I began to draw out my hand, but whatever it was, it was still attached. I could feel it pinching my skin. I pulled my hand out and shrieked in surprise, gripping the sink to keep myself from falling over. The object on my hand fell back into my bag and I scrambled to look into my purse, trying to convince myself that I hadn\u2019t seen what I just thought I saw. I tentatively opened my bag and looked inside. My heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\nThere was John, lying on my wallet, staring up at me. He couldn\u2019t have been more than four inches tall. I could see the fear on his face, the rampant emotions that he must have been feeling. I wondered if I looked the same. <br>\r\n~Torch~</span></div></div>",

I closed my eyes and tried to hide the image that was burned into my brain. When I opened my eyes I still saw John, sitting there on top of my wallet, fear etched into his face. I opened my mouth to speak but I couldn\u2019t find the words. He was just so small. I wondered about  how this could go, my mind filled with situations, none of them having a happy ending. I motioned to pick him up and he flinched as he got to his feet and slowly began to back away. I finally found something to say \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I smiled and then finished the sentence \u201cJohnny-Poo\u201d<br>\r\nI saw him get tight for a moment, I knew he hated the nick-name, but I couldn\u2019t have held myself back. He relaxed a bit and he slowly started to walk toward my hand. He stepped onto it and it felt like a grasshopper trying to run away. I felt bad for him, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was going through his head at the precise moment but I knew that it would wait.  He climbed into my open palm and I raised him out of my purse and up to chest level to get a closer look at him. As my hand moved through the air I watched him hold on for dear life; his hands grabbing the ridges in my flesh felt like someone was lightly pinching them and I had to resist the urge to clamp them shut to stop the pinch. As I got him closer I noticed the gash on his face. It looked deep and part of his brown hair hand been mated down and tainted red. I drew in a sudden gasp as he looked at me. \u201cOh my god what happened to your head?\u201d I asked. He covered his ears and I realized how loud I was speaking and what I must sound like to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d I whispered to him as he pulled his hands away from his ears.<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to speak but then closed it again.  I must intimidate him I thought to myself as he looked at me with a sad look on his face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could have let myself get mad at the fact that she used the name that drove me up a wall but I decided against it and sat there listening to her talk.  I felt her lifting me through the air; it felt like one of those carnivals rides that always makes you sick just going up. She stopped and her eyes grew big as she noticed my head. She opened her mouth and asked what happened in a casual, but shocked tone. I covered my ears because her voice sounded as if I was sitting under a mega speaker at one of the Yankee\u2019s baseball games. She whispered she was sorry and I nodded that I was okay.<br>\r\nI looked her in the eyes and then said \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPreferably at the beginning\u201d she whispered with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I knew that something wasn\u2019t right after the funeral. I was sick like no other, and that was why I went to bed so early the night before. I woke and you were there, telling me about breakfast. My mind lunged at the idea as my stomach growled. I got out of bed and got dressed and started to walk downstairs. When I reached the hallway I felt nauseas and dizzy.\u201d Melissa opened her mouth to speak and I held up a hand at the motion. She closed her mouth and I thought of how weird I looked at the moment. I continued on with my tale, \u201cI was going to call out to you, and I tried but when I opened my mouth nothing came out.  I blacked out shortly after that and when I awoke I was like this,\u201d I spoke as I motioned to my diminutive height.<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did you get the cut?\u201d Melissa asked me, her voice sounding so sweet and soft. It made me feel better a little.<br>\r\n\u201cWell after I woke I called for Marco, I despise that stupid dog, and he took me to the bottom of the steps after I sent him on a quest to find you. You locked him outside and my hopes began to fade. I suddenly heard the phone ring and knew that you had to get some things. As I ran toy your purse you walked over to the spot that I had been standing in. I thought myself as an idiot and then climbed into your purse. I thought I was safe and could get your attention from there but when you threw the purse into the car, the make-up and other things tumbled around me. When the bag slammed down I felt the lipstick hit my head; who knew make-up could be so deadly.\u201dMelissa got a \u2018oh my gosh I\u2019m so sorry\u2019 look on her face as I knew what she was thinking at that precise moment. \u201cAnd after that I woke up and you found me, so the rest is history.\u201d I said as I looked at her and smiled lightly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, we have to tell somebody, the principal, the police, anybody. Just so they know that you are okay\u201d Melissa said as he r voice started to rise.<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not, the only person I vote we tell is Ron, he could help us. And without the funds of the company and an entire research team I could be stuck like this for a very long time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I recognized the voice immediately; it had belonged to the girl that I despised the most, Tracie Elton.  It was at this point in time that I knew I should have gone into the stall, maybe they would never notice; my second of indecisiveness made me lose the chance as Tracie and her group rounded the corner.<br>\r\nI looked down and gently set john down in my bag as I picked up the make-up that was scattered around the sink. I was pushing myself faster and faster as the girls rounded the corner and I heard the conversation go from general gossip towards hate destined to my ears. I grabbed the last of the make-up off the sink and counter and gently set it down in my bag hoping nothing fell on john. I picked the bag up and hoisted it over my shoulder as I turned to leave the bathroom. I walked briskly towards the group of girls and looked down as I felt their harsh stares burning into my scalp. I seen the first foot and avoided it as one of them tried to trip me. I didn\u2019t notice the other one as I felt something connect with my leg and a hard shove on my back. I lost my balance and fell to the ground my bag flying out in front of me and spilling the contents onto the ground. <br>\r\n\u201cOh I am so sorry Melissa, that was mean of me wasn\u2019t it.\u201d Tracie said. I looked to her; she was dressed like her usually self, stuff that was to tight and too low cut for her own good.  She happened to be wearing a tight, light pink v-cut shirt. She was also wearing a short denim skirt. <br>\r\nHer friend responded, \u201cyes, it was mean of you Tracie, we should be nice to the ones who aren\u2019t as cute as we are\u201d she sneered and the rest of the group giggled, \u201csorry for Tracie\u2019s rudeness, let me help you pick this stuff up.\u201d The friend said as she bent down and began to gather the stuff.<br>\r\nI spotted john right away and lurched towards him. I scooped john up and when I was about ready to put him into my bag I felt a hard tug on my hair. I succumb to the force and it was Tracie pulling me up.  \u201cOh what do you have in your hands maggot?\u201d Tracie asked as she pushed me and I continued to back up until my back touched the wall.  \u201cNothing,\u201d I responded as she inched closer to me, I could see the pure satisfaction in her eyes as she got within a foot. The smell of her cinnamon perfume surrounded me. \u201cWell if it is nothing, than why don\u2019t you show me, you rotten little rat.\u201d She sneered as she inched closer. I remained silent as I considered my options. I felt john squirming in my hands and I realized I had been clenching my fists. She pushed me back into the wall and I felt myself squish against my hands. I released my hands and let john out of my grip before it killed him, I broke his fall by using the back side of my leg. He hit the floor with a thud and I moved to hide him behind my shoe, but Tracie had seen him already. \u201cPlaying with dolls still? Well let me help you with that addiction destroying the doll for you. It would be the best I could do since I spilt your bag.\u201d Tracie said as she pushed me out of the way. I hit the floor and screamed \u201cjohn run!\u201d he got up and sprang across the floor. I seen the look of shock and surprise on Tracie\u2019s face, I knew she hadn\u2019t expected the \u2018doll\u2019 to start moving. She swiped him off the floor and then said. \u201cnow, now what do we have here. It looks like a boyfriend of Melissa\u2019s I think I am going to kill it, the same way I killed her gerbil when we were kids.\u201d  Tracie said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI have had enough. I know Tracie could get on my nerves, she always had. Even when we were friends as little kids, she would pull my hair, wreck my toys, and call me rude names. It was at this moment that I felt all the anger in my mind convert into something physical and worth using. \u201cListen here scumbag, you give my boyfriend back or I will take him back.\u201d I said in a stern voice. She turned from her friends and glared at me.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, now we have a Miss brave in the restroom. What are going to do? Call you girlfriend\u2019s security guard? No, didn\u2019t think so. You are nothing but a worthless pile of dust; I don\u2019t even know why god keeps you on this planet; oh I figured it out, because hell doesn\u2019t want something as ugly as you\u201d Tracie said and then laughed. <br>\r\nI took a step forward and one of Tracie\u2019s friends put a hand on me. I turned and punched them in the nose; I heard a sickening crunch and the girl crumpled to the ground.  When I turned back around Tracie had set John on the ground and she was now holding her flip-flop covered foot on top of him. She wasn\u2019t putting any pressure on him just standing there resting a foot on him to preventing him from moving. \u201cThe next time you decide you want to do something rash remember I have your sex-buddy held hostage.\u201d Tracie smiled as she put a little weight into her foot. I heard John scream.<br>\r\n\u201cHe is not my sex buddy you rotten whore!\u201d I yelled as Tracie leaned into her other foot and put close to her full weight on John. I heard a cracking sound come from under the flip-flop and knew if I didn\u2019t act fast she was going to kill him.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI was glad Melissa finally stood up for herself. I even began to clap a little when she turned and punched the girl in the face. My clapping ended when I felt myself falling through the air and slammed into the tiled floor. I looked up, shocked from the fall I found myself unable to avoid the thing that came next. I saw Tracie lift her foot into the air. The bottom of the yellow flip-flop was tinged gray. She put her foot down gently and I was surprised at how heavy it weight without any pressure. I knew if she did anything else I would be screwed. I heard Tracie say something about hurting me every time Melissa sassed off. I then heard the word that I hardly ever heard out of Melissa\u2019s mouth, \u2018whore.\u2019 I was silently cheering on the inside. My joy ended quickly as I felt the soft tissue of the underside of the flip-flop begins to get heavier. My breathing was cut off as the foam of the flip-flop filled my mouth. I screamed involuntarily as I felt my shoulder get squished into the tile.  I heard a loud crack as one of my ribs gave out and it was at this moment that I was as good as gone. I heard Melissa scream in a far off distance and then the floor started to shake. The flip-flop was ripped off of me and Tracie yelled out as she flew backwards and slammed into the ground, I breathed in and then passed out from the pain.<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI charged at Tracie, running off of blind rage I hoped I didn\u2019t step on John in the process of preventing him from being killed. Tracie went off balance almost immediately. She stumbled backwards and I heard her yell as she slammed into the ground with me on top of her. I started to punch at her face over and over again until she started screaming for me to stop. I felt myself get pulled off and immediately I turned around ran to John. He was lying on the ground; eyes closed and appeared to be not breathing. I hunched over him and saw the small rises and falls of his chest. Tracie\u2019s friends ran over to her and helped her up.  They walked out of the bathroom without a word to me; I felt a tear run down my face as I looked John over. It was at this moment I heard my cell phone buzzing in my bag and decided against answering. I would call them back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI ignored my cell phone as it went to voicemail. Right now, I was more concerned about John. Blood was dripping from his nose and I suspected that it was broken. His left arm was bent at a weird angle, but didn\u2019t appear to be in too bad of shape. I didn\u2019t want to pick him up in case there were more injuries that I couldn\u2019t see. John soon answered that question for me.<br>\r\nHe screamed as he snapped back into consciousness, startled by the sudden feeling of pain. With his right arm he clutched his side, whimpering. He opened his eyes and looked up at me in fear, his breaths quick and strained. <br>\r\n\u201cJohn, it\u2019s okay, Tracy\u2019s gone,\u201d I said, trying to calm him down. Oh, gosh, I couldn\u2019t imagine what he was feeling. He clenched his teeth in pain, but seemed to relax a little.<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026my rib is broken,\u201d he said thickly through his bloody nose. \u201cIt hurts like hell.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get you to the hospital,\u201d I said softly, motioning to pick him up.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d he yelled, surprising me. He looked at me sadly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do to me. I can\u2019t go there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, you\u2019re severely injured. I have to do something!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust take me home. I have some first aid stuff there that we can use. Please, I don\u2019t want anyone else to know about this right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t want to pick you up and cause you more pain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ok. It\u2019s just my rib and nose that\u2019s broken. I think my shoulder is only out of place.\u201d He said this with confidence, but he looked frightened as I slowly began to slide my hand underneath him. I did my best not to hurt him, but he still let out a sharp groan when I touched his torso. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I whispered to him, feeling horrible, but he only nodded in response. I carefully stood up, trying to keep my hand from moving too much when a thought entered my head: how was I supposed to hide him? Then I remembered my coat. I had taken it with me into the bathroom and laid it on the floor next to the sink. Since it was cold outside I would need it anyway, and it was the perfect way to hide John without hurting him. I walked over to the sink and picked up my coat, sliding my free arm into it before slowly sliding my hand with John into the sleeve. I didn\u2019t pull my arm all the way through; instead I kept my hand hidden in the cuff of the sleeve.<br>\r\nWith my purse slung over my shoulder, I walked out of the bathroom and into the busy hallway full of students. Nobody said anything to me as I walked past and I was grateful for that. I made it outside without an incident and to my car within a minute. As soon as I sat down in the driver\u2019s seat, I started the car and turned the heat on high. John smiled at me as I removed him from the cuff of my coat. I smiled back and then focused on driving. I needed to get him home so we could figure this all out.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nMelissa held me the whole time as she drove. I wasn\u2019t worried, because I knew she could drive stick and driving this manual car one handed was not a problem for her. What I was more focused on was the fact that I was in a hell of a lot of paaaaiiiiinnnnn! My side felt like someone had taken a hammer and smashed it inwards. Every breath I took was extremely painful. It was like I was breathing in needles. I was just so glad that Melissa had saved me from whatever fate Tracy had had in mind for me.<br>\r\nI gripped Melissa\u2019s palm as I tried to withstand the pain. She responded to my touch by stroking my hair with her index finger. I always liked it when she touched my hair; it felt good and it relaxed me. The touch took my mind off the agony for a moment and I could focus on the other things around me. <br>\r\nAbove me was Melissa\u2019s beautiful face, stained red with tears as she switched from looking at me to focusing on the road. Her long hair was like ropes of gold that hung down on her shoulders. I just wanted to reach out and let them run through my fingers. The gloomy sky flashed past as I looked out the windshield and side window. I could see the cold, wooden skeletons of the trees fly past, many covered with the year\u2019s first snow. The only thing that was still green was the pine trees and their dark complexion. I could feel the engine of the car rumbling underneath me and could hear the click, click, click as Melissa signaled to turn. The heat from the vents blew over me, warming up my cold body and allowing feeling to return to my cold fingers. <br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt the car slow down and I knew that we had arrived. I could see my mansion stretch far above me as I looked out the window and Melissa stepped outside. She held me close to her chest and hurriedly went to the door, using the key to the house that I had given her a few months before. She unlocked the door and stepped inside, and the familiar feeling of my house washed over me. It was good to be home and away from that school. But I didn't know if we were the only ones there.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember the incident and how it happened as if it had been yesterday mostly because for almost a month I had nightmares that I was in its place, but I remembered none the less.<br>\r\nI remember we were in my room. I was twelve years old and Tracie and I were inseparable. We hung out every day and walked through the halls thinking we were better than every body else. We would play with the hit thing at the time, the miniature figures with no feet that everybody called Bratz. We were playing one day, with the dolls. They had begun to lose the fun and excitement of preteen age years. It was then that Tracie suggested we do something else. Since I was way more bored than she was I said \u201csure, why not.\u201d We cleaned up the Bratz and then walked into the living room. My mom and dad were out for the weekend and so we had rearranged the living room to make it more spacious.  My little gerbil came rolling out of one of the corners in his hamster ball. Tracie watched him with a fantasized interest; I would fail to notice the look until long after she had killed my gerbil. I had called the gerbil Sparkles, that was before we had got it and I found out it was a boy but the name had always stuck. I called out to it and the gerbil looked at me and then slowly began to roll over to me because doing so usually meant treats. It was at this moment that Tracie spoke up. \u201cSo do you want to hear the game I want to play?\u201d <br>\r\nI looked up from the gerbil in the ball and responded \u201cSure, what\u2019s it called?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game that the older kids like to call Truth or Dare\u201d she said in a cool, calm voice.<br>\r\nI had heard of Truth or Dare, but I had never played it. The game that was usually mentioned also came with sick stories of all the wrong things people had done. When I had told my parents about it, they had told me that I should try and refrain from playing the game with people outside of my age group. I figured since Tracie was only a month older than me it was fine.   I looked to her and smile, \u201cwhy not, it sounds like fun\u201d I responded. Sparkles bumped into my leg again, he had rolled over because I had called and now he was expecting a treat. I stood and walked out of the room. I returned, not even a minute later to find the ball empty. I looked at Tracie and to my surprise she was holding the ball of fluff that I liked to call Sparkles. <br>\r\n\u201cI will begin,\u201d Tracie said as she held onto Sparkles and he flailed his little legs as he tried to get away. \u201cTruth or dare?\u201d she asked me. <br>\r\n\u201cTruth,\u201d I responded wondering what Tracie had in mind.<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be offended if I killed the gerbil\u201d Tracie asked with a weird smile on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, what kind of question is that?\u201d I responded as I felt my face go flush.<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, if you respond no I kill it, if you respond yes, I still kill it.\u201d Tracie said as she held the gerbil above her mouth as if she was going to eat it. It was at this moment I heard Sparkles squeak. Tracie held her mouth open with her eyes closed and before I could start laughing I watched the gerbil pee in her mouth. She shrieked as soon as the foul liquid hit her mouth, and it was at this moment I thought she was going to end the gerbil\u2019s life right there but instead she gripped her hand around him and slowly lowered it away from her mouth. She spit onto one of the plants before going into the kitchen and coming back with a Dr. Pepper.  I was laughing when she walked back into the room, I know now my laughter would end soon. She put the gerbil on the floor and then sat down behind the gerbil. For a couple seconds she just glared at the thing.  I could see the flashes of hatred flash her in eyes and it was this day that I knew my poor gerbil was going to die. <br>\r\nTracie looked at me and said, \u201cyou know, I haven\u2019t planned on killing the thing, but since you laughed at me and then it peed in my mouth, well I have come to the conclusion that today it is going to die, I am not only going to do it just to get revenge on the gerbil I am also going to do it for pure revenge.\u201d Tracie\u2019s eyes lit up with delight.<br>\r\nI knew our friend ship was going downhill, it had been for the last five or six months, but this moment in time was the turning point, actually it was the point that was going to happen in less than a minute. I saw Tracie stand and walk to the side of the gerbil. At first I thought she was going to step on it causing it to splatter all over the white carpet. Oh how I was so wrong. She started to lower herself down and then as gravity took over she put hands out to catch herself. I closed my eyes to avoid watching her butt hit the gerbil and blood explode out from out of it but the sound never came.  \u201cAre you watching Melissa?\u201d she asked as I opened my eyes.<br>\r\nShe was hovering roughly an inch over the Sparkles. He was trying to run away but she had already started to put pressure on the poor thing. I heard him squeak and that was when I opened my eyes. She was pushing down on him with her behind. She continued to push down and Sparkles cries got louder, I heard the cracking and popping of the bones beneath her and then she sat all the way down. I heard one sickening crunch but I knew it wasn\u2019t over. I heard a soft whimper emanating from the carpet. She twisted with one ghastly motion of her hips and the final crack was heard that ended sparkles life. After this Tracie stood and walked out. She and I have never had more than a twenty word conversation, until today, and now she was threatening to do this to my poor Johnny-Poo, I couldn\u2019t let it happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could see it in Melissa\u2019s eyes that it was definitely something horrible but it must have happened before we met, considering I never knew Tracie and Melissa were friends and I most definitely didn\u2019t know Melissa had a gerbil, her parents had fur allergies to most animals. I watched in horror and disgust as the argument broke up and they walked over to Melissa and knocked her out. I thought I would be next and I braced for a life ending punch. It didn\u2019t happen though; Tracie lifted her purse off of the ground and opened it. There was a lot of stuff in it, and it was way more cluttered than Melissa's. She dropped me in and then stared at me before smiling a wicked grin. \u201cHave fun John while your Master still permits it.\u201d Tracie cooed in a sickening dominative tone.  She released me and I landed onto something hard and spiky, I looked down at the hairbrush. It hurt to push my hands onto the sharp brushes and I knew if I got pinned there I would be instantly impaled by the spikes. I pushed myself and rolled to the side just as Tracie started to walk, her purse bouncing at her side. I tried to stand in the corner of the layer of stuff so none of the make-up or hairbrush for that matter, could kill me.  I heard a door buzzer and then felt the weightlessness of flying through the air. I heard the sound of the purse slamming into the window and the blackberry filled my face. I felt everything in the purse slam into the ground and push against me. It wasn\u2019t crushing me into a bloody pulp but it wasn\u2019t the most comfortable feeling of having everything on top of me. I thought I could get used to this just as the phone began to vibrate. It felt as if my world had turned into a 5.0 earthquake. It was at this moment that the purse was filled with light, just as the phone began to ring. The sound was deafening and if my hands weren\u2019t pinned to bottom of the purse I would have plugged my ears against the artist that drove me up a wall, Justin Bieber. I saw Tracie\u2019s manicured hand push stuff to the side of the phone and I saw the lipstick standing right next to the phone. I tried to scream but the phone would drone it out. Tracie shook the purse violently and the last thing I saw before I blacked out was the lipstick once again going for my face. <br>\r\n~Senital~</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI woke up with a startled jerk. I was sitting on a chair with my hands tied behind my back. I looked around the room; it was dark but not pitch black. I could see a water heater in the far corner of the room and in the middle was another chair. The surroundings of the musty place seemed vaguely familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place the location. I thought back to my memories of a child and then it clicked. We were in the grand basement of Tracie\u2019s house. I always hated coming down here when we were kids, the place was big, dark and musty. They had lights that illuminated it that made it seem not so scary but, we had never used those because Tracie said that the place was cooler looking without them. I heard somebody coming down the concrete steps. There were twelve of them to be exact, and the person who was taking them descended slowly. They finally reached the bottom and hit a couple of switches. I heard the hum before I saw the lights come on; it was the big halogen type lights that usually lit up auditoriums and different places like that. The lights began to flicker and then the darkness slowly started to run away from its frightening glare. I tried to turn my head to see who had come down the stairs, but the binds they had me in didn\u2019t allow it. The person spoke and instantly my voice registered the name of the being, Tracie, \u201cOh I see that you are awake Melissa.\u201d Tracie came around and put her hands on my shoulder and then ran it around to my face as she walked around the chair. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said bitterly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing just wanted to make sure you were awake for when your boyfriend died.\u201d Tracie said as she walked over to the chair in the middle of the room and dragged it back to Melissa.  The chair was oak, it had a slight cushion but it had been worn flat, the chair didn\u2019t have a back on it. Melissa noticed in the middle of the cushion laid john. He had another cut on his forehead, this one was deeper and the blood had dried and it covered at least half of his face.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean before he died?\u201d I sneered at her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think we left the school stupid girl?\u201d Tracie said as she circled around me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to him, I won\u2019t allow you to\u201d I said as I tried to formulate a plan.<br>\r\n\u201cOh really well you know what; watch me, that is when he wakes up.\u201d  Tracie said as she walked away.<br>\r\nI stared at john and prayed to god that he wasn\u2019t allowed to wake up, that somehow god would keep him sleeping. That didn\u2019t happen though. Maybe I put my prayer request in to late I thought to myself as he slowly stirred. I noticed the clear tape that went across his midsection. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you plan to do to him?\u201d I asked as Tracie kneeled down in front of the stool and looked at John with a sick passion.<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember on how the gerbil died, don\u2019t you Melissa. That is how your boyfriend is going to die; nice, slow, and most definitely very painful.\u201d Tracie sneered as she stood and turned to face me as she walked in front of the stool. <br>\r\n\u201cYou cant do that to him, he is a human being!\u201d I exclaimed as she walked towards me. <br>\r\n\u201cShut up or I will find a way to do it to you to.\u201d Tracie said as she backed away and then looked at john. \u201cReady to have a view that any guy would dream of?\u201d John just stared at her like she was a psychotic idiot, and in my mind I believed she was. \u201cNo response? That is totally fine I could see on how somebody would be intimidated by me, hell if I was in that situation I would be scared shitless.\u201d Tracie said as she hunched down. John still didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, and I didn\u2019t want to tell him for fear that Tracie would do something similar. She put her hands on either side of john and hoisted herself off the floor and hovered above him. \u201cAnd the fun begins\u201d Tracie said with a smile as she dropped herself onto the four inch tall guy I once called my boyfriend. I watched in horror as Tracie just sat there, I could here john beneath here, his muffled screams and the slight popping of his joints as they shifted to try and accommodate the weight that was being put on him. <br>\r\nI tried to look away but I felt someone put there hands on my head and force it back to looking at Tracie, \u201cyou will watch whether you like it or not.\u201d A feminine voice whispered in my ear.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you enjoying this Melissa, well if you aren\u2019t I sure am, it gives me a satisfaction on the inside. Makes me feel powerful, evil, dominative, hell if I knew that it made feel like this I would have done it to your boyfriend a hell of a lot sooner.\u201d She smiled as she shifted a little and I heard a loud crack come from the chair. I couldn\u2019t believe what I had just heard; Tracie my life long enemy had shrunk my boyfriend and now she was going to kill him. I felt horrible and that\u2019s when I felt the tears begin to run down my face.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nAs I lay strapped to the chair I kept wondering to myself how in the hell did the gerbil die? It was at this moment that Tracie had turned her attention to me and told me that I was going to have a view of a lifetime, whatever that means I thought to myself as she stood. I then realized what she was going to do, I was strapped to a chair; she was wearing a mini-skirt. I was four inches tall and the view of a lifetime would be up close and personal to the skirt. \u201cFuck\u201d I mumbled to myself as she lowered herself onto to me. I looked up and her butt filled my vision. If I was a normal guy I would have admired the view, I would have thanked her for doing this and then let her do it; but I\u2019m not. I knew that this was probably the way the gerbil died, and as her butt made contact with my chest it all came together.  <br>\r\nI opened my mouth to scream when the skirt filled it. I was four inches tall and in my world that meant her ass was roughly five times bigger that I was, aka that\u2019s a lot of butt. I braced for impact and it was light at first and then she relaxed. It felt like a steam roller had parked on top of me and then I heard the first pop. I screamed as my shoulders dislodges and my ribs were groaning trying to take the weight, this was definitely an unpleasant way to die. Tracie shifted slightly and I heard one of my ribs snap and rip through my skin. That\u2019s when I heard the words, \u201coh that sounded interesting.\u201d It was her voice and I definitely didn\u2019t like the tone. I found myself wondering what I would do if I lived through this predicament. As soon as a thought entered my mind I felt Tracie shift to the left putting all of her weight on my legs. My pelvis gave away and I could feel the groaning and snapping as my pelvis split in two. I screamed in pain and I felt myself starting to slip from consciousness as she shifted back to normal seating. Her weight was unbelievably heavy. I knew if she just sat there I would die of either suffocation or organ puncture, I wish one of those would happen, because just sitting there was driving up a wall, I knew she was pondering what to do next and I wish she would just get it over with. She shifted to the right and I heard my rips pop out of place, along with the rest of my upper body. She returned to normal and then continued to the left and then back to the right. This back and forth motion was making my world a popping hell.  I felt my shoulder snap as her pelvis ground into my shoulder and I knew I wasn\u2019t making it out of this alive.  I felt my arm break and then another rib, followed by one of the bones in my back. I could taste blood in my mouth as she came back down on my skull. My head groaned under her gluteus maximus. It felt as if my head was going to explode when suddenly all the pressure lifted off. My eyes adjusted to the underside of her body and I could see little specks of blood on the denim skirt.  I heard Melissa screaming and bawling in an area the seemed far away. My world was going in slow motion as I watched her slowly drop herself onto my battered body. I heard multiple snaps as she came full down on me. I could taste blood and vomit in my mouth and I no longer had the control to keep my mouth closed. The next time she landed on me I seen a fine spray of blood and chunks of yesterday\u2019s dinner fly above my head. My senses were dulled, I no longer felt the impacts she had on me as she landed, I knew my neck was broke and it would all over be soon. I watched her butt rise off of me one last time and then she jumped as I high as she could and stuck her butt out on mission for landing on me, it made contact and I heard one last ghastly snap and then all went black.<br>\r\n&lt;Tracie&gt;<br>\r\nAfter the last time I landed on him I could feel the warm liquid pooling out from under me. It felt good, it honestly did. I liked the control feeling and the way it made that little runt bawl as I executed her boyfriend. I sat there for a little over five minutes, his body making small cracks and pops as if finally gave out. As the time passed I finally got up. I could feel him peel off of my skirt and then land on the chair with a small squelch sound; it was at this point in time that I knew he was finished.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly I heard the bathroom door open. Someone was coming in. I quickly, but gently placed John back in my bag, whispering in hope to calm his fears, \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe in here.\u201d I zipped the bag shut and placed it on my shoulder just as two girls walked in. They were completely unaware of what I was hiding. I left the bathroom, trying not to look too shocked or nervous. I kept my hand on my bag to keep it from swinging too much. A thousand thoughts were running through my mind. How the heck did John get so small? How could we change him back? We needed to get back to his house and figure something out.<br>\r\nI hurried through the throng of students, pushing through the crowds as packed as sardines. My heart was pounding inside my chest, beating like a runaway locomotive. All I could think of was that look on John\u2019s face. He looked so sad. He had just lost his family and now this? <br>\r\nI opened the door to the parking lot and ran into the school\u2019s gang, headed by a rude African American named Ryan. \u201cHey, check out the pretty lady!\u201d they chortled. Ryan stood in front of me and made to grab me but I turned away, brushing past him in my rush to get to my car. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, girl? Afraid of Ol\u2019 Ryan are you?\u201d I ignored him and hurried to my car, placing my purse in my lap. The drive to John\u2019s house took less than seven minutes, probably because I was driving over the speed limit. It was a good thing the cops didn\u2019t pull me over. I resisted the urge to run to the house, but instead I walked as I normally would. As soon as I was inside and the front door was closed, I placed my bag on the floor and made to open it up. It was then that I realized that the zipper was open.<br>\r\nI looked inside, expecting to see John staring back up at me, but there was nobody. I fought the instinct to panic and began to slowly pull out, one by one, all of the contents of my bag. When the bag was empty, I scraped the sides frantically with my fingers, but I found nothing. John wasn\u2019t there; he was gone.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nJohnny-Poo? Really? Out of all the times my girlfriend had to call me that it had to be then. Although I couldn\u2019t really complain; I had finally gotten her attention. It was frightening to see her so big, so close. I had wanted her to find me, but I hadn\u2019t expected to feel so intimidated, so small. The look on her face, she had never looked at me that way, with such shock and amazement. When I stepped onto her hand, it was like riding an elevator. Her voice was as loud as standing in front of a large speaker. I wondered what she thought of me then. When someone was entering the bathroom, I saw fear flash across Melissa\u2019s face. In one swift moment I was back in the darkness of her bag, swinging at her side. I only hoped that she would take me home; I didn\u2019t want to be in school at this height, even if I was with Melissa. <br>\r\nI knew when we were outside, just by the abrupt end to the trivial conversations of high school hallways. Melissa stopped suddenly and I was thrown on top of her wallet. A voice was speaking outside the bag, but I couldn\u2019t make it out. Something hit the bag and I gripped onto the wallet to stop myself from being thrown into something else. Just then, light poured into the bag and before I could react, something wrapped around the wallet, pinning me to it. I was pulled out before I knew what had happened. I looked up to see something out of a horror movie: Ryan, the leader of the gang in our school, had just stolen Melissa\u2019s wallet, along with me. Melissa was already halfway through the parking lot and was getting into her car. I gripped the wallet for dear life, hoping for a miracle.<br>\r\n\u201cYo, man\u2026what\u2019s this?\u201d I heard one of the gang members say. Something roughly grabbed me and I nearly threw up as I was rocketed towards someone\u2019s face. I closed my eyes, afraid of what was to come. \u201cWhoa! It\u2019s a tiny man!\u201d \u201cYou idiot! Don\u2019t you realize who that is? It\u2019s John Smithson!\u201d \u201cThe one billionaire kid?\u201d \u201cYeah! Do you know how much money we could make off of him? We\u2019ll be rich!\u201d I gulped. This was bad; this was really bad.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly I turned over, backing away in complete terror as I watched Ryan unsheathe a switchblade from his belt. I was surrounded by towering figures, all with baggy pants, chains, and harsh looks. There was no escape. Ryan crouched down and placed the tip of the knife lazily on my chest. I whimpered in fear at that blade. It was big enough to slice me in half with one stab.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, little man,\u201d Ryan jeered. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s gonna work: you do as we say and you\u2019ll live to see the sunlight again.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIf\u2026if y-you let m-me go, I\u2019ll pay you each a h-hundred bucks!\u201d I stuttered in desperation. They all just laughed at me.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019re stupid?\u201d Ryan said. I could feel the sweat dripping down the back of my neck. \u201cWe know what kind of money you have. If you want to live, you need to pay a million dollars to each of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA million dollars!? I don\u2019t have that much money! I won\u2019t until I turn 18 in four months!\u201d This was a mistake. Ryan gripped the knife and began pushing the tip of the blade into my chest. I could feel it pierce my skin and the warm blood began to stain my shirt. Ryan\u2019s face got close, really close. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find out a way to get that money, won\u2019t you?\u201d he said in a tone that sent shivers up my spine. I was visibly shaking, I knew it. Never before had I been so scared. I was in some serious trouble.<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI could have screamed in total panic at that moment. John was gone and I didn\u2019t know where. To make matters worse, he was smaller than my hairbrush! I paced back and forth in front of his stairs, trying to calm myself and think of what to do. He must have gotten lost at school, which was not a very good place to be. But how? Unless\u2026<br>\r\nThe phone rang and I jumped in surprise. I answered it with shaking hands. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cMelissa? It\u2019s me, John.\u201d I closed my eyes and breathed a sigh of relief, and then I noticed the tone of his voice. \u201cAre you ok? Where are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t say.\u201d His voice was shaking with obvious fear. \u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s going on, John?\u201d \u201cMelissa, I need to come up with 5 million dollars by 12 PM tonight or they\u2019ll kill me.\u201d \u201cWho will kill you?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Please call Ron. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \u201cJohn\u2026John!\u201d He didn\u2019t answer me. Another voice came on the line. \u201cIf you want to see him again,\u201d the voice said, \u201cbring the money to the central park by the oak tree to the north. Don\u2019t call the police.\u201d Then the phone went dead. I felt like a statue as the phone slowly slipped out of my hands and fell to the floor. All of the blood had drained from my face and head. I suddenly felt weak and nauseous. What was I going to do? Only John had access to that money and it wouldn\u2019t be his for another 4 months. Slowly I picked the phone back up and began dialing the number.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember the day that I met Matthew Smithson. We became best friends immediately. He was a brilliant young man, full of energy and potential. He started the now billion dollar business with me as his right-hand man when he was only 18. Together we rose through the business world, developing breakthrough technology, best friends through thick and thin. I remember the day he asked my younger sister, Catherine Terrepet, out on their first date. It seemed such a short time afterwards that they were married. For twenty-five years I helped run the business with my brother-in-law. They had two children, John and Jenny, making me a proud uncle. I loved them like my own children, if I had had any. When I got the call that Matthew, my sister, and my niece had perished from an unknown disease from the Amazon, I was devastated. John was now my only surviving family. I immediately took control of the company, at least until John was old enough to run it on his own. I worried about him, but he had his girlfriend Melissa to take care of him. She was a good girl; I liked her the minute we met. I came to town, expecting to see John at the weekly coffee outing we usually had, but he didn\u2019t show up. When I called Melissa and she said that he was missing, I was concerned, but he had gone through so much in a short period of time. I would give him time to recover. He would call me when he was ready.<br>\r\nI always carried a special cell phone in my pocket. When Matthew was alive, he would call me on this cell phone, knowing that I would always answer. Now, as the phone rang, I knew that it could only be one person. I flipped open the phone and answered it, \u201cHello, John.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t John; it was Melissa. I was surprised that she had called me. This couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cMelissa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, Ron, but something has happened to John. He\u2019s been kidnapped, and whoever did it is demanding a 5 million dollar ransom by midnight or they\u2019ll kill him.\u201d My heart skipped a beat. I was silent for a brief moment before answering. \u201cI\u2019m coming to the house. Don\u2019t do anything until I get there.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa was waiting for me at the door. She held it open as I walked in. I could tell that she was worried, her whole body was tense. \u201cTell me everything you know about John,\u201d I said to her. She took a deep breath and then looked at me with almost pleading eyes. \u201cBefore I start I need to tell you something that I didn\u2019t mention before, but you have to believe me.\u201d I looked at her curiously. I had no idea what she was referring to. \u201cJohn\u2026kind of shrunk.\u201d I was taken aback. \u201cCome again?\u201d \u201cJohn is only four inches tall.\u201d I just blinked and stared at her. \u201cIs this some kind of joke?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I found him in my purse at school.\u201d John\u2026shrunk? Was that even possible? I studied Melissa. There was a seriousness about her. She wasn\u2019t one to joke about such things. She watched me anxiously, obviously hoping that I believed her. There was no doubt in her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn is in some serious trouble.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ok; I believe you. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nTrapped. That\u2019s how I felt. That\u2019s how I was. Bound by duct tape across my chest and a cloth to gag me, I was immobile inside one of Ryan\u2019s rancid pockets. It stank of smoke, sweat, and marijuana. The smell alone could suffocate a person and I had to breathe it in as the only air supply. My head throbbed horribly where it had been cut. The recent beatings I had endured had reopened the wound. Hot blood was slowly trickling down the side of my face. I shivered, not from cold but from fear. I had heard what the gang was planning to do with me after they got the money. It scared the crap out of me. I didn\u2019t even know if Melissa would show up. Thoughts of horrid deaths filled my mind. I tried to push them away as I listened to what was going on outside.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost 12,\u201d I heard one voice say. \u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t show?\u201d \u201cOh, she\u2019ll show alright,\u201d Ryan said, he deep voice reverberating in my chest. I heard the cocking of multiple guns. Each member of the gang carried a pistol. I just hoped that they wouldn\u2019t use them. \u201cShhh! Someone\u2019s coming!\u201d I heard the faint crunch of grass as the person approached. Ryan walked forward. \u201cDid you come alone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYes,\u201d said the person. I recognized them immediately as Melissa. A wave of relief ran through me. She did come to save me! But there was also fear. I couldn\u2019t bear to see her get hurt. <br>\r\n\u201cGive us the money.\u201d \u201cNot until I know that John is alright.\u201d Ryan chuckled and thrust his fist into his pocket. I took in a sharp breath as his fingers squeezed tightly around my chest. He roughly pulled me out and I found myself falling through the air for a brief moment. I hit something soft and cool: fresh grass. It broke my fall enough to keep me from breaking any bones, but I was in pain from the impact. I rolled over onto my back just as something pushed down on my chest and legs. Ryan had placed his foot on me. I wasn\u2019t being crushed but it was hard to breathe. I could smell the grass and see its blades as big as flat trees. I looked up to see Melissa about ten feet away, holding a silver briefcase. She looked at me with fear and worry. <br>\r\n\u201cLet him go!\u201d \u201cNot until we have the money.\u201d Melissa bit her lip and slowly held out the briefcase. One of the gang members grabbed it from her but Ryan didn\u2019t step off of me. \u201cI gave you the money now let him go!\u201d Ryan laughed. \u201cSorry, toots; we have other plans for him.\u201d He lifted his foot from me and prepared to slam it down. I closed my eyes and whimpered, waiting for the crushing blow that would kill me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d a different voice said. I opened my eyes to see Ron with a double barreled shotgun aiming directly at Ryan. My heart leapt with joy. \u201cIf you harm him I swear I\u2019ll pull the trigger.\u201d Ryan chortled and pulled out his pistol. \u201cReally old man? You\u2019re going to mess with me?\u201d Every member of the gang aimed their weapons at Ron. My uncle just smiled. <br>\r\nThe noise of numerous weapons cocking filled the area. Uniformed men wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying semi-automatic guns surrounded the gang. The letters S.W.A.T. were stamped on their chests. The gang was outnumbered, five to one. \u201cWhoa! Whoa! Whoa!\u201d Ryan yelled backing away. \u201cI told you not to call the police!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Melissa responded. \u201cBesides, this isn\u2019t the police.\u201d \u201cI strongly advise you to put down your weapons and step away from my nephew,\u201d Ron said, still smiling. One by one the gangsters put down their guns and raised their hands in the air. Ryan cursed fluently under his breath. A S.W.A.T. member grabbed the briefcase from the gang and handed it to Ron. \u201cThank you, boys,\u201d Ron said. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he opened up the briefcase, revealing nothing. \u201cIt was empty.\u201d The gang was led away, handcuffed, to a police car on the street. <br>\r\nI turned to see Melissa kneel down beside me. Gently, she undid the cloth wrapped around my mouth. \u201cMelissa,\u201d was the first word I said. There was no way to describe how relieved I was. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, John. You\u2019re safe.\u201d  She slid her arm underneath my head and back, lifting me into the air. As I looked at her caring face, my vision began to blur and numbness surrounded me. I closed my eyes as I was consumed in darkness. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke on something soft and warm. I was lying on my back with my eyes closed. My entire body ached with the abuse I had taken over the last few days. Slowly the memories of what had happened came back to me. I opened my eyes and blinked at the light. Far above me was the plain white ceiling of my room. To the left of me was my nightstand and to the right was my dresser, a hundred times bigger than normal. I was lying on my bed, covered part ways with a thin sheet. I gingerly sat up, sore all over. My shirt that I had been wearing had been taken off and the various cuts on my bare chest and arms had been bandaged up. I ran a hand over my forehead, feeling the cloth covering the gash on my head. I was still wearing my pants, but my shoes and socks had been taken off. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to my room opened and someone walked in. It was my butler, Herald. He was tall and skinny with a very sophisticated demeanor about him, but he was always very kind. He looked down at me without any shock or surprise. \u201cAh, master John! I\u2019ll send in Melissa for you.\u201d With that he left the room, leaving me a little stunned. A wonderful smell wafted in from the open door. I inhaled deeply as my mouth watered at the familiar scent. The thought of warm blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon filled my mind, making my stomach growl. I hadn\u2019t eaten for a while. Melissa appeared in the doorway, carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Her warm smile brightened my mood as she came and sat down on the bed. \u201cGood morning, John. How are you feeling?\u201d I rubbed my shoulders. \u201cSore, very sore.\u201d She nodded sadly. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d She placed the tray in front of me and sat Indian-style across from me. I eyed the steaming platter of food eagerly. Melissa began tearing off small chunks and handing them to me. I wolfed them down, savoring each delicious morsel. Together, Melissa and I ate breakfast. When we finished, Melissa put the tray on the nightstand and Herald silently walked in and took care of it. I hadn\u2019t felt so satisfied in a long time. <br>\r\nMelissa slowly stretched herself out on the bed, lying with her face towards me. I still couldn\u2019t get over how big she was compared to me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cAll I remember is seeing you.\u201d \u201cYou passed out, probably from exhaustion. We took you home and Ron fixed you up. You\u2019ve been out for a little over a day now.\u201d \u201cWhere is Ron?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s making a phone call. I suspect that he\u2019ll come in soon.\u201d Just then, Uncle Ron appeared in the doorway. He had a cell phone up to his ear and was talking in his \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 voice. \u201cUh-huh\u2026great. We\u2019ll do that. Yes. Thank you\u2026you too; good-bye.\u201d He hung up the phone and kneeled at the side of the bed. \u201cThat was an old colleague of mine. He might be able to help you out.\u201d I looked away bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can help me out.\u201d \u201cJohn, we\u2019ll get you back to normal somehow, I promise.\u201d For the first time in days, I smiled. There was still something to live for; I hadn\u2019t lost everything. \u201cThanks, Ron.\u201d \u201cThe only problem is that he lives in Europe. We\u2019ll have to take the jet to reach him. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d  <br>\r\n~Torch~</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My mind went back to all the times I had been on a plane. It was a common occurrence for me but ever since I was little I\u2019ve gotten severe motion sickness. Not only that, I\u2019ve had a few cases of altitude sickness. I always had to take medicine before I went on a plane. I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would do to me at this size. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Ron. You know what I\u2019m like on airplanes.\u201d \u201cHmmm, you\u2019re right. Maybe I can get my friend to come here. I\u2019ll call him back.\u201d He walked out of the room, pulling out his cell phone. I could hear him talking as he walked down the hallway. I turned and looked back at Melissa. She had propped her head on her hands and was looking down at me. \u201cSo what exactly happened to you, do you know?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI was walking down the hallway to join you for breakfast and I passed out. I woke up like this.\u201d I looked down at my hands. Everything about me was the same, just not my size. \u201cI think that the virus did this to me.\u201d \u201cBut how is that possible?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a disease expert.\u201d \u201cI think something more than just a disease caused this. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u201cBut who would do this to me? What can anyone gain from making me as small as a mouse?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but hopefully Ron\u2019s friend can fix this. I don\u2019t want you to be stuck like this forever.\u201d I looked up at her with a smile. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like having a boyfriend you can keep in your pocket?\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou are really cute. It would be a lot cooler if we knew for sure that this isn\u2019t permanent.\u201d \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want to have to adjust my entire life to this.\u201d \u201cOh, that reminds me\u2026\u201d Melissa stood up and crawled off the bed. She went over to my dresser and picked something up off of it. \u201cRon had some clothes made for you.\u201d She set the articles in front of me and I looked with amazement at the assortment. It was exactly like regular clothes, just made to fit me. One T-shirt even had my favorite football team\u2019s logo. Uncle Ron\u2019s attentiveness to detail never ceased to surprise me. I picked up one of the shirts and pulled it over my head. It fit me just right and was fairly comfortable. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d \u201cYour shoes are also there if you want them. You\u2019re old shirt was kind of ripped up by the gang. Ron saved it to run some tests on it.\u201d Ron came in the room again, cell phone on hand. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be able to take his equipment here. He\u2019ll be here by tonight. I\u2019m sending the private jet to pick him up.\u201d Ron got a worried look on his face. \u201cI have to go back to the company for a few hours. Will you be alright here?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cBesides, we have Herald in case we need help.\u201d Herald walked past the room just at that moment. \u201cWhatever you say Mistress Melissa.\u201d I chuckled at his vague sense of humor. \u201cI guess,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI\u2019ll have my cell phone if you need me.\u201d He turned and walked out of the room. Melissa placed her hand next to me and I crawled onto her open palm. I tried to refrain from gripping her fingers tightly. I still wasn\u2019t used to be lifted into the air like that. Melissa carried me out into the hallway. I heard a distressed barking coming from my sister\u2019s old room. I guess Marco had been locked up. Stupid dog. <br>\r\n&lt;Ronald&gt; <br>\r\nI took a deep breath as I drove to the office. So much had happened in the last week, it was physically and mentally draining. When we confronted the gang and I saw John for the first time, I was more afraid than I had been in a long time. Nothing like that had ever happened before. He was so small, only big enough to fit in my palm. When he was unconscious and I held him, I was afraid I was going to break him. My last living relative and he had to have this happen to him. I could only hope and pray that my old friend could help him.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ron\u2019s colleague had arrived with all his equipment and had set up in one of the company\u2019s labs. We were going to see if he could help John. As we pulled into the parking lot, a strange man in a lab coat came out to greet us. \u201cGood to see you, Caesar,\u201d Ron said as he shook the man\u2019s hand. Caesar was tall and lanky, with disheveled silver-gray hair and lopsided glasses. He wasn\u2019t very old, no older than Ron in fact. \u201cI\u2019m glad I could be of service,\u201d Caesar replied. \u201cNow where is this nephew of yours, Joshua?\u201d \u201cActually, his name is John and Melissa has him.\u201d I held out my hands to Caesar who bent down to inspect John. \u201cHmmm. This is very interesting. I\u2019ll have to run some tests on him.\u201d \u201cTests?\u201d I asked nervously. \u201cOh, nothing that will hurt little Jacob.\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d Ron corrected him. \u201cYes, yes of course.\u201d Caesar walked into the building, muttering something to himself. He seemed a little\u2026distracted, as if there was a lot on his mind. Ron seemed to read my expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; he\u2019s always like that. He\u2019s very brilliant, but he tends to forget things really easily.\u201d We followed the scientist into the building and down a flight of stairs to a door marked \u2018Restricted\u2019. A young man in a lab coat was there, holding the door open for us. \u201cThis is my assistant, Nathan,\u201d Caesar said. Nathan was a little stockier, with short sandy brown hair and thick eyebrows. His hooked nose and slight frown made him look a little angry. I walked past him suspiciously. Something about him made me\u2026cautious. <br>\r\n\u201cJust set Jack down on that table, would you?\u201d I gently placed John on a counter next to a variety of complicated instruments. John gave me one nervous glance before looking at Caesar. \u201cNow how exactly did this occur?\u201d Caesar said while pulling on a pair of gloves. John explained what had happened to him while Caesar listened intently. \u201cA disease? I have never heard of such a thing before. This is very intriguing.\u201d He reached over the counter and grabbed what I recognized as a Geiger counter. He ran the sensor over John\u2019s body. John flinched a little. I could tell he was intimidated. \u201cNo radiation. I\u2019ll have to check his electrical pulses and maybe draw some blood.\u201d Caesar lifted a briefcase from the floor and opened it to reveal an assortment of needles. Caesar pulled out one particular needle, two inches long. John hastily backed up and tripped over a pair of tweezers. \u201cThere is no way you\u2019re putting that in me!\u201d he yelled. Caesar looked at him in surprise. \u201cOf course not! I just thought of how I needed this for one of my experiments. See I\u2019m taking a group of\u2026\u201d \u201cCaesar, focus,\u201d Ron said. Caesar blinked. \u201cOf course, yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d He put the needle away and pulled out a smaller one. This one was only a half-inch long and was extremely thin. Still, I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to John. \u201cAlright, Jordan; hold out your arm.\u201d John obeyed, his eyes never leaving that needle. With the help of a magnifying glass and with exact precision that I hadn\u2019t expected him to have, Caesar placed the needle on John\u2019s arm and poked it into his vein. John twitched but stayed still. Slowly, the flow of John\u2019s blood began to fill the needle. Caesar only took as much blood as in proportion to someone full-sized donating blood. It was a miniscule amount, but it was something. John breathed out as Caesar pulled out the needle. He had been holding his breathe. Nathan handed John a small piece of gauze to stop the flow of blood from his arm. Caesar took a small sample of the blood and placed it underneath what looked like a microscope on steroids. The thing was as big as a person. With help from Nathan, Caesar used a computer to operate the machine. A moving picture of John\u2019s blood filled the computer screen. His individual red blood cells could be seen. \u201cOh my!\u201d Caesar said after examining the blood for about a minute. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ron asked as he moved to stand behind Caesar. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this!\u201d Caesar magnified the picture on one single blood cell. It looked like a regular blood cell, but\u2026 <br>\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s attached to it,\u201d Ron exclaimed. \u201cBut what could it be?\u201d \u201cI have only seen this in one other instance, and it was an experiment that went horribly wrong. Those are nanobots.\u201d \u201cNanobots? That kind of technology hasn\u2019t been created yet!\u201d \u201cApparently someone figured it out and used it on little Juan here.\u201d \u201cThat would explain the so-called \u2018disease\u2019 that John had. The nanobots were trying to bind with his blood. I wonder if that\u2019s how Matthew and my sister and niece were killed.\u201d \u201cHow did nanobots get inside me?\u201d John asked. Caesar looked at him. \u201cThe only way this could have occurred is if someone injected the bots into your bloodstream. This was a planned event.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I asked. Caesar was quiet for a moment. \u201cWell, the only way to reverse this is to take control of the nanobots themselves, which is almost impossible if you weren\u2019t the one who programmed them in the first place.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s no hope for me?\u201d John said in despair. \u201cOh, there\u2019s hope, it\u2019ll just be a long and difficult process, but it can be done.\u201d Ron placed a hand on Caesar\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThank you for this, Caesar. You are welcome to stay at the mansion for as long as you wish.\u201d \u201cIt would probably be a good idea to get some sleep. There\u2019s nothing else that can be done tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI laid in my bed, tossing and turning, trying to catch a little bit of shuteye. I just couldn\u2019t get to sleep. I kept thinking about who would want to do this to me. Why would anyone try to shrink me and my family? It just didn\u2019t make any sense. A noise caused me to sit up and look towards my door. Nathan was entering my room. He and Caesar were both staying at the house. Something about the look on his face told me that he wasn\u2019t here for peace. I scrambled away as he stretched out his hand for me. I tried to reach the buzzer near me that would alert Melissa or Ron if I needed anything, but Nathan grabbed me before I could reach it. His fingers crammed my arms against my chest and squeezed me with enough force to make it hard to breath. I squirmed against the hand, desperate to get free. I could see that we were exiting my room and entering my sister\u2019s old bedroom. Nathan shoved his thumb into my mouth to keep me from shouting for help. Finally, he released me and I sat gasping in his hand. \u201cUgh! It smells in here!\u201d he complained and opened the window. The cool night breeze ruffled my hair and clothes. I looked up in fear at his face. He was smiling with a wicked gleam in his eyes. I knew that this wasn\u2019t going to end well. Just as Nathan reached out his other hand for me, a loud bark rang out through the room. Marco jumped from his spot on the carpet and latched his jaws onto Nathan\u2019s calf. Nathan yelled in pain and I finally felt a bit of appreciation for that dog, but then I felt myself flying through the air. Nathan had flung his arms back, releasing me and causing me to go flying through the open window. As I saw the dark green of the grass below, only one thing was on my mind: That stupid dog! Even when he tried to save me he was the cause of my doom.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My life and all of my memories, both good and bad, flashed before my eyes in a split second. So much had happened in the past week. This would be a fitting end to my miserable existence. My body turned so that I was looking up into the night sky. I saw a glimpse of the silver stars, so far away yet so close. The moon shone down on me like a solemn friend. I spotted the big dipper, forever fixed in the heavens, and I wondered if the God of the universe cared about all that had happened to me. I prayed that I would see my family again.<br>\r\nMy feet struck the ground first, shattering under the impact. The bones in my calf and thigh snapped and my legs flared outward, the bones sticking through my flesh. There was no time to scream at the excruciating pain, no time to brace for the next wave. My pelvis hit the concrete with a sickening crunch. I literally could hear it fracturing and breaking, like the cracking of ice over a frozen pond. Shards of it stuck into my intestines and what I suspected to be my kidney. Blood spurted out from my hips and a shockwave ran through my body, shattering my ribs. There was a sharp pain in my chest as one of my ribs was thrust upwards towards my throat. All of this happened in a split second. I rolled along the ground as my world became a curtain of red. Pain like nothing I had ever felt before consumed me, but I was still alive. A sickening feeling welled up in my throat as blood poured from an unknown rib wound. My throat gurgled and convulsed as I choked for breath, but my lungs were utterly ruined. My heart fluttered weakly as I struggled for life, but it was no use. I closed my eyes and surrendered to the complete darkness. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hit the ground the sound was splat the blood went spurting high\u2026 I wondered what my internal organs would look splattered over the ground, but I didn\u2019t want to wait to find out. I flailed my arms about, desperate to grab onto something, anything. As if in answer to my prayer, a sharp pain hit my back and I heard the snapping of something that I hoped wasn\u2019t my ribs. A swirl of brown and dark green filled my vision as I crashed through a tangled web of branches. The wind was knocked out of me as I hit twig after twig, but at least I was slowing down. Finally, I came to a complete, and very painful, stop as I hit a large branch. With a groan I rolled over and blinked, trying to get the white spots out of my eyes. Slowly I sat up and looked around. I was in the large oak tree, growing right next to the house. How the heck was I supposed to get out of here? At least I wasn\u2019t dead. <br>\r\nA soft rustling noise alerted my attention. I turned to see an owl perched on the same branch that I was on. The bird looked at me with its luminous yellow eyes. I immediately froze. This was not good. The owl tilted its head back and forth in the characteristic sharp movements of birds. Then to my horror, it spread its wings and swooped upon me before I could react. I screamed as its talons wrapped around my body and lifted me into the air. Pain exploded from my side as one of the birds claws pierced through my skin. I could feel the warm blood soaking my shirt. I fell limp, hoping to fool the bird into thinking that I was dead, knowing that birds of prey crush their victims with their claws. The night air whipped past me as I looked down. I gulped at the enormous height we seemed to be at. The roofs of houses passed underneath as the owl flew silently towards an unknown destination. Suddenly, the bird went into a steep dive and I resisted the urge to grab onto its toes as we descended. Gracefully, it landed on the flat roof of a building next to what I suspected to be an air duct. Maybe I could use that to escape. The bird ruffled its feathers once before peering down at me with its large eyes. I remained as still as I could, hoping the bird took me for dead instead of dealing a killing blow. The owl, satisfied with the preparations of its meal, lifted its foot and bent down to begin pecking out my guts. Immediately, I scrambled to my feet and sprinted towards the air duct. The owl gave a little screech and flapped after me. I made it into the duct just as the bird hit and rattled the vents. It squawked angrily as it continued to try and peck at me. I slowly backed away from it, panting heavily from fear. I took one step, but my foot found nothing to balance on. I fell into perpetual darkness as I entered the main duct system. My back hit a smooth surface and I slid down a slide-like metal sheet, screaming the entire time. The duct flattened out and I rolled to a stop. I pushed myself up onto my knees and looked around. Faint light was coming from a vent some ways away. I cautiously walked towards it and peered through the metal slants. I gasped when I realized that I was back in the school, possibly the worst place I could be at the time. Now what was I going to do? I needed to get a hold of Melissa or someone, but how? Maybe I could crawl into her locker. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter how much I wanted to get help, I was just in too much pain to move. My side was throbbing where the owl had pierced it. I placed my hand against the cut, flinching at the sharp pain, and pressed down to stop the bleeding. I gave out a cry at the agony and quickly pulled away. I sat there gasping. The bleeding would have to stop on its own; it just hurt too much. I lay down with my back against the cold metal of the duct. I shivered from the cool autumn air that blew in from outside. There was not much else that I could do. I might as well try and get some sleep. My mind drifted off as I fell into darkness. <br>\r\nI awoke to the distant sounds of talking and lockers being opened in closed. I groggily sat up and looked around. Bright light was streaming in from the grate next to me, giving me a clear picture of what I looked like. I was a mess; my clothes were torn and I was covered in stinging scratches from that stupid tree. At least it broke my fall, and possibly one of my ribs. A dark red stain covered my shirt on my left side. The bleeding had stop, though the wound still throbbed. <br>\r\nNow I had to come up with an idea of what I was going to do. I couldn\u2019t stay in the vent and wandering out into the hallways in the middle of school was not a very good idea. Maybe I could\u2026<br>\r\nAn earsplitting noise broke my train of thought. \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d I managed to say as a gale of wind blew me straight into the metal grating. Someone had turned on the air conditioner, in the middle of November for crying out loud! What kind of idiots ran this school? The force of the air pinned me to the grating as the cold blast blew by me. I struggled frantically to try and get free. I managed to wiggle my way in between the vents and the air shot me out like a rocket. I hit the linoleum floor and rolled to a stop, completely dazed and a little nauseous. Just as my vision returned, a shadow fell over me. I looked to see the underside of a shoe coming down straight towards me. \u201cAh, s***!\u201d I said as the foot came upon me. Enormous pressure engulfed my entire body and I cried out at the pain. Luckily, whoever it was I realized they were stepping on something and quickly backed off. I heard someone give a short, shrill scream of surprise and then I was lifted into the air. I found myself looking straight into my friend Marie\u2019s face. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! John, I\u2019m so sorry! Are you ok?\u201d I just kind of gave a little nod, still recovering from being stepped on. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay,\u201d I slurred, my head pounding. Then everything went black as I passed out.<br>\r\nSomething big was pushing against my chest as I came to. I opened my eyes to see Marie poking me with her index finger, a smirk on her face. \u201cGood, you\u2019re awake!\u201d she said. I looked around, realizing that we were in her house, her bedroom to be exact. I was lying on my back on her bed. \u201cMarie! You have to take me back to Melissa and my uncle Ron!\u201d She just looked down at me with that wicked gleam in her eyes. This couldn\u2019t be good. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stop!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHere, Buckles!\u201d I froze. Buckles was Marie\u2019s psychotic cat. \u201cNo, please not Buckles! Marie!\u201d She giggled. \u201cYour voice is so cute!\u201d I looked down in horror as the ugly gray beast that was Buckles slinked up. He meowed a low drawling growl. Marie got down on her knees and held me over her cat\u2019s head. Buckles\u2019 ears immediately perked forward and his tail twitched as he went into predator mode. I screamed in terror as Marie lifted me up and down to avoid Buckles\u2019 swipes, all the while giggling madly. \u201cMarie! Knock the f*** off!\u201d Then Buckles jumped into the air and knocked me from Marie\u2019s hand. I fell onto the carpet, expecting to have claws sink into my chest, but all I heard was a loud screech as Marie picked up Buckles and threw him out of her room, closing the door. \u201cStupid cat,\u201d she said, sucking on a cut that Buckles had given her. She came back towards me and I backed away in fear. \u201cAwww, are you afraid of me?\u201d she teased. Again, she picked me up and held me in her fist. I struggled to get away. I was not particularly in favor of what she had in mind for me. She carried me over to her reclining chair and dropped me on the seat. She held one finger on my chest to keep me from escaping. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much you can take,\u201d she smiled mischievously. Before I could move, she had turned around and had sat right on me. The pressure was unbelievable. Every part of my body was being crushed. My shoulders popped as they were forced out of place and my ribs groaned under the pressure. I was in agony, but I couldn\u2019t scream or cry out. I was being totally suffocated. Then the pressure lifted as she got off and I took in deep gasps of air. \u201cPlease, Marie\u2026no more!\u201d I groaned. \u201cOh, come on! I\u2019m just getting started!\u201d<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at me with that passionate look in her eyes that had started this whole thing and I thought to myself, what do I do know? She finally placed a finger on my chest and said, \u201cshall we continue?\u201d I shook my head violently to the side as to say no. \u201cNo? Why not aren't you having fun?\u201d Marie asked me.<br>\r\nI once again shook my head no. \u201cwell to bad, I am having a great time and I am not going to let you ruin it.\u201d Marie exclaimed as she took her finger off of me and turned her butt towards me. I looked up and in a split second I watched the jean clad person killer close in on myself. Her butt made contact and I felt the crushing power on me once again. I held my breath because I knew once I let it go she would squish me flat. I heard Marie giggle once and then say something but the blood was roaring in my ears. I could feel my chest groaning against the weight, my hips threatening to snap out of place, my shoulders being painfully pushed against the recliner. I felt a pop in my chest as one of the ribs gave to try and adjust but I knew if sher kept sitting here I was going to suffocate. I let my breath seep out as my lungs began to burn. She lifted only for a second and I expelled the foul air and drew in another breath before she slammed into me knocking the wind out of me. She stood and I was temporarily blinded by the light. She turned her face towards me and said, \u201cHow are you doing, shall we continue?\u201d<br>\r\nI had finally gathered the courage to say something, but it was pure anger and I still let it fly, \u201cWhy do you care you Murderous B****.!\u201d I yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cto think I was going to be nice to you, but just for that.\u201d Marie said her face going from compassion to anger. She picked me up and then looked outside, it was blizzarding once again. I thought she was going to through me out the window and I wish she would have, if only I could keep my stupid mouth shut. She walked over to her winter boots, she wore them all the time. They were designer boots, half meant for looks half for a great fashion trend. I thought about what she was going to do and my thoughts came true as she dropped me into the boot and turned around and walked away like I was nothing.<br>\r\nThe smell hit me as soon as I landed into the worn part of the sole. It was combination of her perfume, must and mildew, and the overpowering smell of sweat. I had saw her in these boots before, running in the snow, skiing and jumping from trees and landing. I didn't like anything about the situation, especially the fact that she always wore them through the school day. I looked around the boot. I could see down the sole and it was about three times longer than I was. I looked up to see the boot was about twice as high as I was tall and even if I could jump to the top pulling myself out was out of the question due to the fact of her sitting on me had knocked all of the strength out of me. I remembered one of the lessons that my dad had insisted on me attending was self chiropractics. I ran through the checks to make sure nothing was broken and then I started on setting things back into place. I started with my shoulders which were causing me the greatest pain and then moved to my ribs, which hurt the most setting  back into place. I reset my hips with a simple pop but in the back of my mind I knew it could all be in vain due to the fact that she might wear the boots tomorrow. I sat down with my back leaning against my the back of the boot. I couldn't get use to the smell, every time I breathed in it stung my nose all the same.  Didn't dare lay down in case she woke up and put her foot into the boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke with a jolt and began to freak out as darkness was around me. I remembered my situation and began to relax a little when I heard what sounded like a tornado siren. It came in sharp short waves and I realized it was the ordinary everyday object, the alarm clock; oh how I felt so humiliated.<br>\r\nI waited for roughly an hour as I saw the light flick on and Marie pass over me a couple of times. She finally stopped at the boot and looked down at me.<br>\r\n\u201chi John, I hope you slept okay, well actually I don't really care at the moment and I am still mad at you for what you said.\u201d Marie said sternly. I thought to myself about of how she held a long grudge, but somewhere in her mind a could see that she was doing this as part of the torture and if I hadn't said anything she was still going to do it. \u201cso I have decided that if you can survive the day in there that I will give you anything you want, so have a good day and I hope you enjoy it very warm.\u201d she said with a sick smile. She picked the boot up and shook it around until I was thrown into the middle of the sole. I looked around to see that it wasn't very worn here but I could still see a faint outline of where her foot was and I knew this was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nMarie hesitated for a moment and I thought she was reconsidering what she was going to do and then she set the boot on the ground and I thought that my fate had changed, oh how I was so wrong. Felt the sides of the boots being pulled on as she stretched them out and the light was quickly blacked out as Marie dropped her foot into the opening. She pushed her foot in and I felt the boot tip backwards and grabbed onto the sole so I didn't slide into a more deadly position. I thought about everything that could go wrong and my plausible death. I focused back to Marie's foot, it was sliding into the boot at the moment, she had curled her toes up to miss me but one of them still caught and dragged me towards the towards the toe section. I untangled myself and ended up under the balm of the foot. I backed away from the balm section until I was half under the arch and the flat part when she put her foot down. I knew this could be bad but I didn't want to think about what would happen when she took a step. I braced for it as she put her foot on the ground. I watched the arcvh of the foot flatten out over me, the arch touched my face and the rest of my body as she put her usual weight onto her foot. I could feel my  legs and pelvis cry in agony as her mom cried out for her to go and she took off like I wasn't even there.   The arch of Maries foot crushed down onto my torso and head and I could feel my skull shifting as started walking. I felt her other foot crash down as it reverberated through my back and I knew what was next; I felt my self fly into the air as she raised her foot not even a foot off of the ground. As soon I went up I was going down again and then the boot slammed into the ground and her foot into me. I felt it push me into the worn insole as she started with the other foot and put more weight onto me. I didn't feel popping which was good but I was getting the wind knocked out of me every time she stepped onto my side. It was a process that lasted as she walked through the house, and as she reached the front door I already knew that after this I would be very bruised. She stopped as her mom said something about walking after school and my heart sunk into my stomach. \u201cokay\u201d Marie replied and I almost threw up at the fact that she twitched her foot towards me. She walked into the fresh snow and I could feel myself being pushed down in whole new places; her weight was more on the arch and I strained for breath in-between steps. She walked over to a running car and got in, I was thankful for the absent of her weight and I knew if this continued I would probably not make it until the end of the day.<br>\r\nI realized the heat in the boot already and thought about what she said, and then I realized she was wearing wool, I didn't know if it was on purpose to make my life hell or if it was cold out and she was just trying to stay warm. I tried pounding on her foot to let me out and she only pushed down on the balm of the foot for a response.<br>\r\nI tried again and she stomped her boot against the floor of the car.  Heard something pop when she did that, it was shortly after that I felt a sharp pain in my lower leg and I knew she popped my ankle out of place. No big deal, I thought to myself I don't have to walk for a while any ways. The car stopped moving and marie got out without saying goodbye. She was walking fiercely through the snow which caused a great deal of pain. I thought that I would be able to make it when I head, \u201cIce!\u201d and I knew that meant something bad. Marie began to bounce up and down on the ice, but it was on her toes. I felt myself moving forward under her foot. I came to the conclusion she wasn't jumping, she was kicking; with the shoe that I was in. I felt my anger flare but then I  remembered that was what got me into this situation. I felt my feet hit the toe section of the foot and my chest was right under the balm of it, the one place I didn't want to be. \u201cthat should do, from now on if you piss me off I will hurt you even more\u201d I heard marie said as she put her foot on the ground. I felt as if the wold had landed on my chest and I knew breathing was going to be almost impossible with her standing in one place. She pushed off and I felt my shoulders pop and my ribs groan as she lifted her other foot off the ground. She landed her other foot and then began with the right one, I had determined this about five minutes after she had began walking. I felt myself be raised into the air and then she slammed down on me and the wind was knocked me. Her foot kept coming down and I felt my ribs protest even more as she continued to walk. As much as the flexing of my bones hurt I was glad they didn't break. She continued on into the building as I tried to scream but couldn't find the breath to do so. She stopped by her locker and stood on top of me, all of her weight concentrated on me as I had heard her other foot lift off the ground. I heard an actual crack but it was from being stood on for a long period of time, or so I hoped.</span></div></div>",

I was expecting crushing force as I heard her friends gather around her and blabber away. She excused herself to the restroom and then pushed off and I braced for the impact.  It hurt as her foot slammed into me and I was glad I made this far through the day. I heard her stop in the bathroom, take off her backpack and sit on the toilet; the weird thing though, I didn\u2019t hear any unzipping. She undid the laces of the boot I was in and pulled out her foot slowly, dragging me across the wet smelly sole of the boot. I saw the light of the opening and breathed in deep for the fresh air and was only greeted with the wretched scent of sweat and mildew a smell that burned my nose and made my eyes water every time I took a breath.  She tipped the boot upside down and dumped me into her hands, she smiled down at me and then said with a look of disgust on her face, \u201ceww, you\u2019re all wet.\u201d  I thought back to on how through the day her foot had heated up and sweat seeped through the sock and dripped onto me. The thought grossed me out. \u201cSo how was a day as Bug in the Boot?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWretched\u2026\u201d was all I could say before she interrupted me.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a rhetorical question smarty,\u201d Marie said as she grinned. \u201cDo you think you could survive a couple more hours?\u201d I merely nodded. \u201cwell I would like to think otherwise, first of all you are tiny, but you already know that; second, I was putting my full weight on you, I did once and I felt a crack under my foot and then decided I didn\u2019t want to kill you; and third, if I wanted you dead you would have died yesterday when I sat on you, I was holding back then too. So in conclusion I have been nice to you and hope that you have forgiven my tortures but also have been bracing for the future, because I have much more in mind.\u201d Marie said as my mouth dropped open in shock. \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised, I thought you would have figured it out hours ago.  You may respond to me talking you know\u201d she explained to my silence.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was change of surfaces, how was I to know full weight, to you just messing around. I thought it was full weight. Are you trying to kill me?\u201d I stopped before I started to yell at her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just want to have a little fun, at your expense of course but I would never do something that would harm you; no let me rephrase that. I would never do anything that would cause you mortal injury. Melissa would kill me!\u201d Marie said as she waved a hand across her throat that indicated beheading.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat says she wouldn\u2019t, if she found out you were doing this to me?\u201d I asked as I started to forgive what she had done.<br>\r\n\u201cI am willing to take that risk; If she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, than I will be mildly upset but I will remember what I did with you and all will be good.\u201d Marie said as she pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time. \u201cWe better head off little man, don't worry I won\u2019t put you back into the boot, you hurt too much to walk home on\u201d Marie said as she looked over herself on a place to stick me. \u201cShut your eyes and no matter what no peeking, got it?\u201d Marie asked me as she scooped me up off the jean clad leg and looked around the bathroom.  I held my eyes shut as I felt myself being lowered back into place on her leg and then I felt my legs touch something tight as she pushed me into what felt like a jean prison.  After I felt my head go below the surface she told me I could open my eyes. I opened them and looked around to realize that I was in her front pocket, it was cramped but there was enough heat that I knew I wouldn\u2019t freeze. Just as she stood and picked her bag off of the ground, I heard the bathroom door open. My heart skipped a beat as the person said her name, \u201cMarie\u201d. The voice sounded familiar but I couldn\u2019t place it.<br>\r\nMarie jumped in fright as she turned to face the source of the voice when she said, \u201cHi\u2026\u201d I anxiously listened to see who the voice belonged to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nMarie looked very flustered when I called her name and she turned around to face me. She had that look of \u2018I\u2019m hiding something, and I don\u2019t want you to find out\u2019. Ever since that business with Nathan throwing John out the window, I had been in an extremely bad mood. Ron had screamed at Nathan for more than two hours after we had searched the back and front yards for John. Ron didn\u2019t even let Nathan go to the hospital to get his bite wounds from Marco treated until he was done ranting. It served that creeper right! Now seeing Marie acting like this just made my anger flare up all the more.<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa, how are you?\u201d Marie said in mock kindness. She was definitely hiding something. Marie was never nice to me.<br>\r\nI crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cI am really not in the mood to deal with you, Marie. What are you hiding?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHiding? I\u2019m not hiding anything.\u201d I just stared at her in my intense fury. Marie rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, since you\u2019re not going to have a nice conversation with me, I guess I\u2019ll go.\u201d She turned to walk out of the bathroom but I moved so that I was standing in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cTell me what it is you\u2019re hiding,\u201d I demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cI told you already, I\u2019m not hiding anything!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Marie\u2026I don\u2019t like you, I never have. I was only nice to you because I cared about John. Now show me what you\u2019re hiding.\u201d<br>\r\nMarie\u2019s face turned red in anger. \u201cYou know what, b****, I never liked you either and frankly I have no reason to tell you my secrets, if I had any. So why don\u2019t you just back off and run home to the mansion where you\u2019re a spoiled pig!\u201d<br>\r\nI was just about to retort to that comment when I noticed that the front pocket of Marie\u2019s jeans was moving. I stared at it in surprise and confusion when all of a sudden, John\u2019s head popped out. He took one look at me and smiled, relief spreading across his face. I was totally shocked; out of all the places that John could have been, I hadn\u2019t expected him to be with Marie.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had him this whole time!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring him to Ron or me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, let\u2019s see\u2026first off, I don\u2019t like you; second of all, I would never pass up the chance to have a little fun with John.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHand him over!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not yours! Why should I let you have him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cQuit acting like he\u2019s a toy! He\u2019s not! He\u2019s a human being!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would hardly call him a human, more like a bug.\u201d She reached in her pocket and pulled John out, dangling him by his leg in front of me. I reached out to grab him, but Marie moved her arm back out of my reach. \u201cWhoops! Too slow!\u201d<br>\r\nI gritted my teeth in anger. \u201cHand him over, or else!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what? Are you going to fight me? I\u2019m stronger than you, Melissa. You would just lose.\u201d<br>\r\nI pulled back my foot and kicked her in between her legs. She dropped John and clutched her stomach as she doubled over at the pain. John landed on Marie\u2019s bag, breaking his fall. I quickly scooped him up into my hand and made for the door as Marie recovered. Her look was that of pure and utter rage.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that you f****** b****!\u201d she yelled. <br>\r\nI already had one hand on the door as I turned and looked at her with a smile. \u201cYou may be stronger than me, but I can run faster.\u201d With that, I took off, sprinting down the school hallways towards the parking lot with Marie on my tail. I clenched John in my fist as he gripped my fingers to keep from bouncing up and down. His eyes were wide in fear and adrenaline. I could feel his heart racing inside his tiny chest. The students in the hallway jumped out of my way, calling out rude names as I flew past. I didn\u2019t care; all that mattered was that I got John to safety. The exit was right up ahead. Someone saw me coming and held the door open for me. \u201cThank you!\u201d I called out as a rushed through the door and out into the snow. Fortunately, I had parked close. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my keys, unlocking the car door and starting it. I wrenched the door open and slammed it, sticking the keys into the ignition and stomping on the gas just as Marie reached the car. By then I was driving away, watching her fade into the distance with her middle finger saluting me. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello Adrianna\u201d I heard Marie say and I felt my heart go into my stomach. <br>\r\nAdrianna was somebody who I had never gotten along with. She and I had met in the first grade and from then on she would bully me because I was rich and she was not. Or at least that was what she had told me. I hoped to god that Marie would keep the situation about me quiet and that was when I heard my name.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should see of how tiny he is,\u201d Marie said as she dug into her jean pocket and pulled me out. I stayed as still as humanly possible as Marie held me in her palm to show me off. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I see him?\u201d Adrianna asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have him, just don't tell Melissa. I had my fun, well actually take him home with you and bring him back on Monday. I have a couple of things I want to do with him still\u201d Marie said as she flipped her hand over and dumped me into Adrianna\u2019s hand.  Marie waved goodbye and walked out of the bathroom casually, maybe a little too casual for someone who just handed off their best friend. I have to reconsider my friends a little bit better I thought to myself as Adrianna stared down at me.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we get home we are going to see just how much you can take twerp\u201d Adrianna said as she threw me into her shoulder bag and started to walk. If it was one thing I had learned about being in a girl\u2019s bag: Make-up is deadly, cellphones weigh a lot, and protect my head at all cost. <br>\r\nAt some point in time on the ride home I passed out. It wasn\u2019t from the stuff constantly battering me, it was because the bag was in a warm car and I didn\u2019t have to worry about freezing to death. When I finally awoke I was on this vast plain of pink. I looked to my left and saw the wand of giant Tinkerbelle. The surface was nice and soft and I realized that this must be Adrianna's room. I saw the bag that she dropped me in laying on a chair, and she was on the computer that was located across from me. The bed was nicely made for a person who seemed to have no control in their life and I knew whatever she had planned could end very badly. <br>\r\nAdrianna whirled around on her chair and stared at me. She realized I was awake and then came over to me and hovered above me. \u201cHave you ever heard of waterboarding?\u201d<br>\r\nI meekly nodded my head.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever tried waterboarding?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\nI shook my head no.<br>\r\n\u201cWell today is going to be a first then, come on it will be fun. After that we can see if you could survive being sat on, the proper way that is\u201d Adrianna said as she walked over to the bathroom that was connected to her room and set me down in the filled sink. She must have been thinking about this for a while. \u201cMarie told me about when she captured you, she told me what she did to you and she also told me of how she held herself back because she didn\u2019t want to offend you or your girlfriend. Well unfortunately for you I don't have any of those morals burned into my brain.  So if I decide to kill you and then leave your body in the mail slot of your girlfriend\u2019s house, I will. So I best say that you shut up, obey as I say, and try to enjoy yourself.\u201d Adrianna said as she picked me up and dropped me into the water. <br>\r\nI tried to swim to the surface but I felt her finger push down on me. My lungs started to burn as she lifted her finger and I shot to the surface taking in a gasp of air.  \u201cAw, poor Johnny can\u2019t breathe? Well to bad.\u201d Adrianna said as she pushed her finger back onto me and then shoved me to the bottom of sink. My back hit the bottom and she kept pushing down. I felt my chest groan and my lungs began to burn before she finally let up and let me float to the surface. When my head broke the surface I took big gasps of air to satisfy my oxygen hungry body before she pushed down on my one last time.  She held her finger on me for what seemed like an eternity and my vision was started to swim as I desperately started to panic for air. My vision turned red as I let the last of the oxygen out of my chest and her finger threatened to crack one of my ribs before she finally wrapped her hands around me and brought me to the surface.  I felt the cold air on my face and began to cough as she dropped me onto the counter. She pulled the plug on the drain and then walked out of the bathroom before stopping at the door. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about escaping or when I find you I will kill you.\u201d Adrianna warned before sheturned and walked out of the bathroom. I collapsed onto my back and passed out, thankful that waterboarding was over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI woke up with a sudden jolt. I was damp and my clothes were sticking to me and then I began to cough. I tried to think of what happened when I remembered of the waterboarding incident. Adrianna was cruel; I always knew that. She was considered the class bully until ninth grade when girls were supposed to become such fragile beings. I never liked her, and I knew that if I ever got alone with her we would duel out our differences and go from there, but the only thing is I never expected to be four inches tall. <br>\r\nAdrianna walked into the bathroom wearing a low-cut Tinkerbelle t-shirt and denim short shorts. \u201cGood to see you are wake sunshine\u201d Adrianna said with a cute harshness in her voice.<br>\r\nI opened my mouth to speak and she put her hand on my body and pushed down, \u201cDon't\u201d she said as she let off and I glared. \u201cYou were passed out for two days, which mean that today is the beginning of\u2026\u201d Christmas Break I thought to myself in horror. I knew the time was getting close and that it was the perfect time of the year but I couldn\u2019t believe that I would be stuck like this over Christmas and especially with her. \u201cBy the look that is forming on your face I know that you have figured out the date, so do you want to make a deal?\u201d<br>\r\nI said nothing, \u201cOh respond or I will kill you.\u201d Adrianna snapped.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d I asked finally.<br>\r\n\u201cYou let me do whatever I want the next three weeks and when school resumes I give you back to Melissa, saying that you are still alive of course. Any questions I am open for negotiations\u201d Adrianna said as she leaned over me; her vanilla perfume surrounding me like a blanket.<br>\r\n\u201cYou call her once every two days and tell her I am okay and you tell me what you are going to do before you do it and then you got your deal,\u201d I said. <br>\r\nAdrianna stood and then smiled, \u201cI thought you would agree.\u201d She turned and walked away before coming back with some thin rope.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, and you should call Melissa. I bet she is worried sick about me.\u201d I said in a calm tone, I suddenly didn\u2019t feel too scared I didn\u2019t know if this was good or bad.<br>\r\n\u201cYour right. Here,\u201d Adrianna said as she laid the rope on the bathroom counter, \u201ctie this around your ankles and make sure its secure, I wouldn\u2019t want the rope flying off and you go hurtling to your death, but at least I wouldn\u2019t be at blame.\u201d Adrianna said as she walked into her room and grabbed the phone off the charger. She walked back into the bathroom and sat beside me on the counter. She looked at me and then smiled as she began to dial the phone number they had aired over the radio to search for me.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\nI grabbed the phone off of the hook and walked into the bathroom, I saw john lying on the counter and contemplated sitting on him while I made the phone call to his hideous girlfriend. \u2018you are going to enjoy the three weeks with him aren\u2019t you?\u2019 my mind teased as I sat beside him and then looked before smiling as innocently as I could and began punching in the number that they had aired on the number once every ten minutes for the last two days, the announcement was getting annoying. I realized something as I was dialing, I was in control of the situation and I knew exactly what I would say to her. I pushed the talk button on the phone and it began dialing the number. I put it up to my ear just in time to hear a girl answer; I knew the voice immediately as Melissa spoke. \u201cHello, hello, hello?\u201d she said into my ear and I waited.<br>\r\nI finally responded. \u201cHello Melissa\u201d I cooed into the earpiece.<br>\r\n\u201cAdrianna?!\u201d Melissa exclaimed almost immediately shocked that I was calling her.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how did you know?\u201d I responded and then giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, why in the world are you calling me? You hate my guts.\u201d Melissa stated.<br>\r\n\u201cBut john doesn't\u201d I responded smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Melissa asked in a more serious tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI have your boyfriend, he is four inches tall and I am looking for something to be cruel and inhumane to.\u201d I stated bluntly as I covered my mouth to keep from laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!!!\u201d Melissa Shrieked. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, you heard me\u201d I responded as I switched ears.<br>\r\n\u201cGive him back or else.\u201d Melissa said sternly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I will but not today; oh let\u2019s say the day we get back from Christmas vacation?\u201d I said as started the negotiation.<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not, I want him back in the next twenty-four hours or else.\u201d Melissa said coldly.<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, or else I kill him, listen hear missy. You seem to forget who has who here. I have your boyfriend and you have nothing. Yes you may be able to intimidate people with your money and power, but if you want john back we play by my rules starting now.\u201d I stated sternly.<br>\r\n\u201cYea right, what are they?\u201d Melissa said in a stubborn tone.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, rule number one: I call you not you call me. Rule number two: you will not tell me anything I can\u2019t do to him; I will do anything I want. Rule number three: if you show up here, I kill him. Rule number four: stop the radio announcements, TV broadcasts and everything else, if I hear about him being missing again I hurt him severally. Rule number five: if you break any of the rules I kill him or send you a person who is so mutilated he will wish he was dead. I will call in two days have a good day Melissa.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, if I abide by the rules I get him back when we resume school?\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, glad you understand. Now goodbye Melissa.\u201d I said as I hung up the phone. I turned to john to see that he had tied the rope efficiently around his ankles. I picked up one end of the rope and he yelled in pain as it pulled on his legs.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt; <br>\r\nWhen I felt her pull on the rope I had efficiently tied around my boots and legs I felt a great strain at my hips and legs. Adrianna looked at me and then smiled, \u201cYou said you wanted details of what I was going to do to you? Well here it is boy, I had you tied the rope around your body for a reason, I plan on hanging you onto the ceiling fan and turning it on, I will start it out slow and then speed it up as I see fit. Don't worry it\u2019s a variable speed fan and I can control the speed with a remote.  The goal of this is to see how fast I can see you go until you puke or your body rips apart from the tension. Doable?\u201d  Adrianna asked me as I hung from the rope. She tied the rope onto the fan and I thought about all the things that could go wrong. She could set it on high and I be ripped apart or I my stomach comes out of my mouth and I suffer internally bleeding, or the rope comes free and I get painted like a mural across the wall. I shook my head because none of these were settling situations.  I watched Adrianna sit down on the bed and reach for the remote for the fan. She pushed the plus button on the remote once and the fan beeped in response. I was glad I got queasy from amusement park rides because this would definitely go up on the top. The fan beeped once more as it registered the one setting and I felt the vibrations of the electric motor as the fan prepared to spin.<br>\r\nThe fan began to spin and I knew I was going to be sick, puking was definitely an option but I didn\u2019t know how when all I have had the last couple of days is crumbs I\u2019ve been fed by various people. I watched as the room began to spin faster and I felt myself lift higher and higher as Adrianna slowly increased the speed.  I knew what could happen, I tried to push that to the back of my mind as the contents of my stomach began to churn. I felt light-headedness set in as I was now even with the ceiling fan blades. I could feel the ropes gritting into my legs as they kept me from coming free. The fan increased another notch and I felt a sudden acceleration. I knew this was it as I could taste the bile in my throat, I thought to myself if I could make myself puke but then I tried moving my arms in a controlled manor and realized I didn\u2019t have the muscle to do such a thing. I turned my head over my shoulder to notice that Adrianna\u2019s rope was coming undone. I started to panic when I heard the all to familiar beep and the sudden acceleration of the fan and my stomach finally caved. I spilt the contents of the last two days for meals and for a second it actually looked cool. It was suspended in air and not moving for a split second and then I moved away from it as gravity took over. I opened my eyes for the first time in this ordeal and all I saw was colored blurs whirling past. Just the sound of Adrianna\u2019s voice was enough to make me puke once again. I heard parts of the conversation and it dealt with something about leaving it on or turning it off and keeping her promise.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nThe fan kept spinning, sending me through the kaleidoscope of colors. My head was pounding as the blood was forced into it. I groaned in pain as my stomach gave dry heaves, threatening to spew what little bile and digestive juices I had left inside. Finally, the force on me lessoned and the fan began to slow down. The colors formed together into visible shapes and objects as the fan came to a stop. I just hung there upside down, the room spinning with my vision and vomit dripping from my mouth. My head felt like someone was driving spikes into my ears. I made no effort to move; I was sick and drained of energy. My vision had turned red by the time I felt something pull on the string attached to my legs. Adrianna untied the thread and dropped my on the ground. I hit the soft carpet with a thump, glad that it was very shaggy and so it absorbed the contact. I lay there, letting the blood flow back to the rest of my body. My head slowly stopped hurting, but my legs were burning where the string had cut into my skin.<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that, little Johnny?\u201d Adrianna sneered. I just stared up at her, knowing that if I said what was on my mind, she would probably kill me then and there. The hatred that coursed through me was unbelievable. Oh, how I wish I could make her pay! But the fear was there, too. This evil witch held my life in her hands and it would be that way for the next three weeks. There was no chance of me escaping.<br>\r\n\u201cToo wonderful for words I see,\u201d she said with a twisted smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I have plenty more in store for you. Unfortunately, you slept most of the day away so we don\u2019t have much time for any more fun. I guess it will have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d <br>\r\nWith that she reached down and picked up the string, dangling me in the air as she walked to her room. I had no idea what she was going to do with me now. I just hoped that whatever she had in mind didn\u2019t cause me too much bodily harm. Adrianna entered her room and walked towards her nightstand. From my position I looked down to see a small cage, made for gerbils or other small rodents. It had an opening in the top with which Adrianna dropped me into the cage. She closed the hatch to the cage and then set a jar full of change on top of it.<br>\r\n\u201cThere; now you can\u2019t get out. Enjoy your new home little Johnny!\u201d She smiled again and then walked out of the room. I pushed myself up from the layer of shredded wood chips on the bottom of the cage and observed this new prison. It was bare except for a wheel and a small dish with a clear fluid in it that I suspected was water. It smelled like urine and animal fur, which made me guess that it had probably been used before. I sighed in despair; I guess it was better than the other places that she could have put me, but it made me feel so inhuman. I was just a bug to her. <br>\r\nI pulled my legs up close to me and began to undo the string tying them together. I winced as I undid the part that had cut slightly into my skin. Once my legs were free, I stretched them out and took a deep breath of satisfaction. It was then that an amazing smell reached my nose. I stood up on my legs, a little wobbly at first but I was steady enough. I hobbled over to the edge of the cage and looked out the bars, trying to find the source of the amazing smell. Adrianna walked into the room holding a plate of steaming pasta. She deliberately walked past the cage, letting the smell waft over me before she went and sat down on a chair directly across the room from the cage. She pretended not to notice me as she took her pretty little time in eating the pasta. Just the sight of the delicious food made my mouth water. I could just imagine the taste of it, the pleasure I would get as it filled my now empty stomach. My body screamed out for it \u2018food! food!\u2019, but I couldn\u2019t satisfy it. I moaned and sat down on the wood chips, knowing that I would get nothing. I watched as Adrianna finished the last of the pasta, scraping the plate clean and licking her lips.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm! That was delicious!\u201d she mocked. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry! Did I forget to feed my little pet? Let me fix that.\u201d She stood up and grabbed something off of her dresser. I looked up as she stood directly over the cage and dropped something into it. Small objects began raining down on me. I covered my head with my arms until the objects stopped falling and then I looked to see what they were. They were food pellets made for rodents.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? You expect me to eat that?!\u201d<br>\r\nShe bent down until her face was as close to the cage as possible. \u201cMouse food for a mouse of a man!\u201d she giggled. My face flushed in anger as she stood up and sat down on her bed, pulling out her cell phone and occupying herself. Gosh, I hated her! How I wish she would be thrown into burning oil or impaled on a stick like the witch that she is! <br>\r\nI picked up one of the pellets; it was as hard as tree bark, made for the tough incisors of rodent teeth. I couldn\u2019t eat it even if I wanted to. I moaned again and collapsed onto my back on the wood chips, staring up at the cage\u2019s top. This sucked; it couldn\u2019t get much worse than this. Chances were I wasn\u2019t going to survive a few more days with this b****. What had I ever done to deserve this? What did I do to deserve having my family die and then become four inches tall?

Why was this happening to me?<br>\r\nI wanted to just break down and weep, weep like I had wanted to since I saw the dead bodies of my parents and sister, but I wasn\u2019t going to give that a**hole the satisfaction of seeing me cry.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nA screeching noise awakened me to a dark room. Adrianna\u2019s alarm clock was blaring. I heard a whack as she reached over and turned the device off. I couldn\u2019t see her but I could hear her bed move as she got up and turned on the lights, blinding my still dark-accustomed eyes. Her door opened and closed, leaving me alone in silence for a few minutes before she returned and approached the cage. She was dressed in a jogging suit with jogging pants and sneakers. I didn\u2019t think I was going to like what she had in mind for me.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, little Johnny,\u201d she teased. \u201cDid you sleep well in the nice bed that I so thoughtfully made up for you?\u201d I just glared at her, imagining her head being blown off with a shotgun. \u201cWe have lots to do today! Are you ready to have some fun?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I muttered under my breath. She seemed to have heard me. Adrianna kicked the cage, sending me sprawling backwards.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a rhetorical question, bug. You may not have fun but I will!\u201d She reached over and took the jar of change off of the cage top and opened the little door. I backed away as her giant hand descended upon me but I knew that there was no escape. She pulled me out, holding me tightly in her fist. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help me exercise,\u201d she said with that smile of hers that I absolutely hated. She carried me down a flight of stairs to the house\u2019s basement and walked towards a treadmill in the corner of the room. I really didn\u2019t like where this was going. She dropped me on the treadmill track and pulled out a long piece of string similar to the one that had been tied around my legs yesterday.<br>\r\n\u201cHold up your arms and don\u2019t move,\u201d she commanded me. I reluctantly obeyed, watching as she began to tie the string securely around my wrists and forearm. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be attached to the hand bar at the top of the treadmill by this thread. It\u2019s just long enough that you may, or may not be stepped on by me,\u201d she tantalized. \u201cIf you can survive the half hour that I\u2019m going to run on the treadmill, I\u2019ll do nothing else to you today. No exceptions.\u201d<br>\r\nI gulped as she tied the string to the treadmill, knowing that the chances of me surviving were very small. She stepped onto the track and turned the machine onto the first setting. Immediately, I began to move towards her feet as the treadmill came to life. I ran, trying to stay as far away from her as possible, but it was only walking speed and I was barely keeping up with her. I watched as she turned the knob, increasing the speed. I ran as fast as I could, but I was already beginning to lose distance. Then she rabidly turned the knob to a running speed. I had no chance to brace myself.<br>\r\nThe ground flew out under me and I hit the sandpaper track on my stomach. It scraped my neck and face, rubbing the skin raw. I yelped at the pain and lifted up my head to keep it from hitting the track, but that wasn\u2019t my biggest fear. The track had forced me straight towards Adrianna\u2019s falling feet. If I got caught under one of them, I was surely a goner. They were landing on either side of me, just barely grazing my side. I screamed in terror as Adrianna began to move side to side, almost trying to step on me. I kicked with my legs, rolling to the sides to avoid her massive feet, all the while the treadmill scraping any exposed skin on my body and grating the flesh until it was bloody. It had become a game of cat and mouse; I could hear Adrianna laughing at my terror as I scrambled to avoid her deadly footfalls. I grabbed the string with my hands, trying desperately to climb my way away from the danger zone. With every ounce of strength I could muster, I pulled myself forward, millimeter by millimeter until I was a safer distance away, but it didn\u2019t last. Adrianna brought her hand down onto the string, wrenching it from my hands and causing me to rush right back towards her feet. I was doomed. Sooner or later her feet would land true and crush me under it. There was no way I could survive 30 minutes of this. It had barely been five! I had to get out.<br>\r\nI wrestled with the string tied to my arms, trying to loosen it. Adrianna had tied it tight, but I was desperate enough to do anything to get out. The string cut into my wrists, drawing blood but I didn\u2019t care. I could feel it loosening, starting to give way. I wrenched my wrists, ignoring the pain. Finally, one hand pulled free and the other hand followed suit. I hit the track and instead of it dragging across me like sandpaper, I shot right off of it, through Adrianna\u2019s legs and landed safely on the carpet. I lay there, panting in relief.  Then I heard the treadmill stop and Adrianna get off. She stood over me, bending down to look at me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou got lucky there, little Johnny,\u201d she sneered. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t expect you to escape the string. Oh, well. I\u2019ll still remain true to my promise. You\u2019re free from me for today, but not from my family.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I cried in disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cYou found a loophole, why can\u2019t I? Now I just have to decide who to lend you to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nOh, I was not going to like this at all.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew my situation had just gotten worse. If her family was as cruel as she was, well\u2026 I really didn\u2019t want to think about the outcome. She carried me up the stairs and down the hallway. At first I thought Adrianna was going to enter her room, but she turned to the left and knocked on a closed door instead. The door opened and we were greeted by a tall woman, somewhere in her early twenties, with blond hair and purple and pink highlights. She had pierced eyebrows, lips, and nose and she had way too much makeup on. She was wearing a pair of jeans and a plain white tank top and she reeked of cigarette smoke. This had to be Adrianna\u2019s older sister. <br>\r\n\u201cHi, Kelsey,\u201d Adrianna said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d her sister curtly replied. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on what I have to show you.\u201d Adrianna lifted me up until I was level with Kelsey\u2019s face. My heart beat rapidly inside my chest out of fear. I just stared as recognition passed over Kelsey\u2019s face and her lips curved into a wicked smile.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an ugly looking bug you have there,\u201d she sneered and stepped out of the way to let Adrianna in. Her room was a mess. Clothes laid all over the floor and bed and garbage was piled up in one corner of the room. Her dresser was littered with various objects to the point of no open space. Her room was dark with the only light coming from the sunlight shining through the pale white curtains.<br>\r\nKelsey walked over to a nightstand and pushed some things off of it and onto the floor to make room.<br>\r\n\u201cSet him down there,\u201d she ordered Adrianna. Adrianna obeyed, dropping me on the wooden surface. I hit it with a thud and quickly turned around to see Kelsey\u2019s finger push down on my chest, holding me in place. She laughed once and then reached into her pocket and pulled out a cigarette. <br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019d you get like this, little man?\u201d she asked me.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d I watched as she stuck the cigarette in her mouth and lit it with a lighter from her pocket. She breathed a cloud of smoke before speaking again.<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ve never liked your family.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d <br>\r\nShe bent down and took a draught from her cigarette, blowing the smoke directly into my face. I coughed violently, shaking my head side to side to find clean air. She chuckled at my discomfort.<br>\r\n\u201cYour family is a bunch of liars and thieves. You\u2019re dad got rich by stealing ideas from other people and jipping money from the government. Nothing he did was for the benefit of others; he did it just to make himself look good and in turn get more money. And your mom was just a b**** who married your dad just for his money.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d I yelled. I was burning in anger, furious that she would say such things. She bent down again until she was an inch from my face.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s true, and their son was the worst. He took advantage of people, using his money to gain popularity and then taking what he wanted from them and leaving them high and dry. He made himself out to be a saint, giving to charities and such, but it was all an act. He\u2019s really just a stubborn, selfish, son of a b****, ba*****. And you know what I have to say to that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cThis.\u201d She lifted up my shirt with one of her fingers and, before I could do anything about it, stuck the end of the cigarette directly into my stomach. The pain was like nothing I had ever felt before. I screamed as I could feel it burning into my skin, destroying flesh and nerves. I writhed around trying to avoid the pain but I couldn\u2019t. Finally, after about five seconds, she lifted the end off of me and I laid there whimpering in agony. An ugly black circle had been burned into my skin directly above my bellybutton. <br>\r\nShe took another inhale from her cigarette and breathed it into my face again. \u201cAww, did that hurt the little ba*****? I\u2019m sorry; I won\u2019t do that to your tummy again.\u201d Another wicked grin passed over her face and I shuddered as I realized what she was going to do. With one flick of her finger, she rolled me onto my chest and pushed me down again, pulling my shirt up in the back. This time I thrashed violently to get away, but I stood no chance. Again the cigarette came down upon my skin, and again I screamed in horrible agony. Tears blinded my eyes and stung my cheeks as I fought against the anguish. She removed the cigarette again, but she was far from done. Pushing down on the rest of my body, she secured my arm and shoved the burning embers into my wrist. My vision went red as I screamed myself hoarse. I could hear her laughing at my torment and Adrianna joining in from beside her. Kelsey lifted the cigarette, but it continued to burn in all the places it had touched. She turned me over again and this time started taking off one of my shoes.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! No more! Enough!\u201d I begged as I squirmed and thrashed. Through my tear-blurred vision I watched Kelsey raise the cigarette, its end burning like the Devil\u2019s pitchfork, and thrust it into the sole of my foot. The pain, the pain! It coursed through my body like it was all on fire! I had no more voice to shout, no more energy to withstand it. The last thing I heard was the laughing of those two demon sisters. Then everything went black.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My whole body ached from being bruised and battered. I didn\u2019t even try to move. Instead I opened my eyes and observed my surroundings. I was back in the cage, lying on my back. Adrianna was nowhere to be found. Slowly, I began to sit up, using my good arm to push myself into a sitting position. Just then, I felt the vibrations of footsteps through the cage floor and I looked up to see Adrianna approach the cage. <br>\r\n\u201cFinally, you\u2019re awake!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out for two and a half days! It\u2019s already nighttime!\u201d<br>\r\nShe bent down and began pushing objects through the top of the cage. I half expected to see more rodent pellets rain down around me, but instead she dropped a small chunk of bread beside me. I lunged for it immediately, ravenously shoving it into my mouth. It was dry and stale, but it was food.<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I would like to let you starve, you won\u2019t survive if you don\u2019t have any strength,\u201d she scowled. \u201cSo eat up and wrap up your wounds. I\u2019m not touching them.\u201d<br>\r\nWrap up my wounds? I was just about to ask her what she meant when she pushed through the bars of the cage some gaze, strips of bandages, and an open tube of antiseptic. Then she stood up and lay on her bed out of my range of view. I stuffed the rest of the bread in my mouth and crawled over to the first aid supplies. I began tearing chunks of the gaze off and squirting small amounts of antiseptic onto them. Then I placed them on my wounds and wrapped the bandage strips around them. One by one, I wrapped my burn wounds and the areas of skin that had been rubbed raw by the treadmill. Everything that I could cover I did, and I felt very satisfied afterwards. <br>\r\nI lay down on my back and stared up at the top of the cage, surprised by this act of kindness that Adrianna had shown me, but then I realized that she just wanted to keep me alive so she could torture me some more. It was a kind but cruel gesture, but I was still thankful for it. My eyes grew heavy and I closed them, grateful that I was still alive.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI awoke with a start as I felt something wrap around my body. Adrianna had opened the cage and had grabbed me while I was still asleep. By the look on her face, I knew she had something planned for me. I remained silent as she walked to the bathroom and dropped me on the sink counter. I looked up to see a wicked smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, little Johnny, here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do today. I seemed to have \u2018accidentally\u2019 dropped one of my favorite earrings down the shower drain. You\u2019re going to go get it for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? I\u2019m not crawling through some stupid drain! No way!\u201d Her finger shot out of nowhere and pinned me to the counter, pressing down on the exact spot where I had been burned. I cried out in pain and struggled to get free, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough.<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, bug, you either do this or wind up a John Smithson smoothie! Don\u2019t think that I\u2019m above killing you, little man! So what\u2019s it going to be? Huh?\u201d<br>\r\nShe released me and I just nodded my head out of fear.<br>\r\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s what I thought you would do.\u201d She picked me up and carried me over to the shower, setting me down on the tub floor near the drain. Then she pulled out a long coil of nylon thread and handed one end to me.<br>\r\n\u201cTie this to your waist. Oh, and take your shirt and pants off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am not taking my pants off!\u201d I said as I pulled my shirt off over my head and slipped off my shoes.<br>\r\n\u201cFine, suit yourself and get drain mold all over your only clothes. Now hurry up; I have things I want to do.\u201d<br>\r\nI had a few rude words to respond to that, but I held my tongue and tied the string end around my waist. Adrianna pulled the cap off the drain and motioned for me to descend into its depths. I gulped as I stared at the black hole. I had never really been afraid of tight spaces, but this was extreme. I yelped in surprise as I was suddenly lifted into the air. Adrianna had picked up the string and raised me up.<br>\r\n\u201cI would go in head first if I was you,\u201d she said with a sneer.<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, b****,\u201d I said very quietly so that she wouldn\u2019t hear me. She lowered me towards the drain and I leaned forward so that I was going head first into the dark hole. I took one last look around me before I entered the darkness and was cut off from the light. For a few seconds I was suspended in midair with just the drain walls around me. I stuck my hands out in front of my head to feel the bottom of the drain when it came. Finally, I felt the cold metal against my fingers. I came to rest on my belly at the bottom of the drain. It was cold and wet and smelled of mold and rotting substances. I plugged my nose for a moment and calmed myself to prepare for what I was about to do. With a deep breath, I began crawling forward, sweeping my hands side to side to feel for the lost earring. My hand struck something wet and gooey and made a sickening squelch sound. I resisted the urge to gag and tried not to think of what it was.<br>\r\nThe pipe was big enough for me to crawl on all fours with my back scraping the top slightly. The smell was horrible, but bearable. It was worst when I passed one of the piles of gooey sludge. I shivered in disgust each time my hand was buried in the gunk. A sticky strand of some kind suddenly attached itself to my face. I backed away, gagging as I realized that it was old hair. Didn\u2019t these people ever clean their shower pipes? I pushed the hair out of the way and continued on. It was silent except for the sound of my breathing and the occasional squash as I crawled through the slimy goo. <br>\r\nThen my worst fear came upon me. The pipe began to thin out until I could no longer crawl on all fours, but was forced to army crawl if I wanted to get through. I stopped there and took a deep breath. I had to do this, or else Adrianna would surely kill me. It was not impossible; I could do it. With another deep breath, I continued forward, trying to ignore the panic that was growing inside of me. The pipe continued to get smaller and smaller. Army crawling now took up too much space. I put my arms to my sides and inched my way forward like a worm. The pipe pushed in all around me on all sides. My heart was beating fiercely as I wiggled my way forward. Suddenly, my shoulders lodged in the pipe and I couldn\u2019t move. The panic that I had been fighting down finally broke through.<br>\r\nI struggled and thrashed, trying to get free, crying out in fear. It was too much, too much! It was too tight for me; I had gotten myself trapped, trapped in eternal darkness! It was as if all the forces of hell had begun to push down on my body, inclosing me in a grave of cold, wet metal. \u201cNO! NOOO!\u201d I cried out, bursting into tears. \u201cPlease, no\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nIt was as if I had died. I was trapped in a grave, unable to move with nobody to help me. The cruel reality of life had caught up to me. I would surely die here, rotting until my bones were swept away into the sewer system, never to be seen again. <br>\r\n\u201cAARRRGGGHHH!\u201d I bellowed out, the sound echoing off the pipe walls until it faded away, leaving only the sound of my weeping to accompany me. Maybe this was hell. Instead of a lake of fire, hell was a cold lifeless expanse where you spent the rest of eternity in perpetual darkness, alone and unable to move. <br>\r\nI lay there, silently weeping. I had given up. What use was there to living anyway? Down here was death and up on the surface was death. At least down here I would die quicker and I did not have to suffer the cruelty of Adrianna. But, no, I couldn\u2019t give up; I had to stay alive for Melissa and Ron. I owed it to them to fight for my life. I had gotten into this; surely I could find some way out.<br>\r\nI took deep steady breaths, pushing down my fears and relaxing my body. My tense shoulders relaxed and loosed from the pipe. I wiggled my way forward, elated that I was no longer trapped. The smelly goo stuck to my face as I crawled through it but I continued to fight my way forward; I was going to get out of here. The hair wrapped around me like spider webs weighed down with water. <br>\r\nSuddenly, I came upon a particularly large pile of goo. It blocked my path and I had to crawl straight into it to get through. I wriggled my way forward, using my head to push aside the gross muck. Then my head hit something solid. I paused for a moment, trying to figure out what it was. It rubbed against my head as I nodded from side to side to feel it. I moved forward slightly and touched the object with my chin and cheek. It was the earring! My heart leapt for joy at the realization. Now I just had to get it out of here.<br>\r\nI thought for a moment on how I was going to get it out. I couldn\u2019t grab it with my hands. Disgusted that I had no other option, I opened my mouth and bit down on the earring, securing it in my teeth. It tasted beyond nasty, like rotten fruit, dirty feet, and sweat mixed together. I got over the gag reflex and began wiggling my way backwards. The pipe began to widen and I breathed easier, the panic lifting as I gained more room to move. Soon, I could army crawl again and I immediately took the earring out of my mouth, spitting out the disgusting taste as best as I could. Suddenly, I felt the thread tied around my waist tighten. Then I was being pulled backwards; Adrianna was pulling me out. I slid along the slick surface of the pipe like it was ice, probably because I had so much goo stuck to me. I kept my body as rigid as possible as I felt myself being lifted into the air and then light, glorious light! It shone upon me like the light of heaven. I had never felt so relieved. <br>\r\nAdrianna set me down on the tub bottom and took the earring from my hand. <br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Johnny,\u201d she said with false sweetness. \u201cThis is from my favorite pair of plastic earrings.\u201d<br>\r\nI looked up at her in disbelief. I hope you get eaten by wolves someday, I thought to myself as I lay there in the tub. But at least I wasn\u2019t down in the drain. I had never realized how claustrophobic I really was until now and I really hoped that I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything like that again. I looked back at Adrianna, waiting for what she would have me do next. Man, I hated that b****.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are definitely taking a bath!\u201d She reached down and picked me up, sticking out her tongue in revulsion. She walked to her room and grabbed something off one of her shelves. It looked like an old pickle jar with leaves and grass scattered in it, probably for some poor bug that she had caught and then let perish in her room. Adrianna walked down the stairs and took a right, entering a kitchen/dining area. She walked to the garbage and emptied the contents of the jar before rinsing it out briefly in water. Then she set it down in the sink and dropped me in it. I stood up in the glass jar and looked up at her as she walked away and came back carrying small objects in her hands. She dropped them into the jar and I realized that they were ice cubes.<br>\r\n\u201cThere; some toys for little Johnny to play with while he takes his bath.\u201d <br>\r\nBefore I could protest, she screwed the metal lid with holes drilled into it onto the jar and moved the faucet head until it was directly over me. Then she turned it on so that a small stream of water began pouring out. It immediately began seeping through the holes at the top of the jar and I jumped backward as the water hit me; it was very cold. The water pooled up at my feet and began filling the jar. Fear welled up within me as I realized what she was doing. Through the blurred vision of the glass, I saw her put something on top of the jar lid. Soon, the water that was flowing in began to produce bubbles. That b**** had put liquid soap on top of the jar!<br>\r\nThe water was now up past my ankles and it was frigid cold. The ice cubes had began to float on top of the water, churning in the little waves produced by the falling water. Goosebumps rose on my arms and legs, causing the hair to stick straight out. Soon it was up to my knees and the bubbles had risen to my waist. <br>\r\nThis was not good. Was she going to drown me? I frantically looked around as the water rose to my waist. There was no way I could get out of this jar on my own. I turned and banged on the glass walls as the water rose over my stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cGet me out of here! Adrianna!\u201d <br>\r\nI dove under the water and began to rub all the gunk off my body. When I resurfaced, the water was up to my chest.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all clean, now let me out! Please!\u201d Either she was ignoring me or she couldn\u2019t hear me. I began to shiver violently from the cold water. My feet and fingers had gone numb and I couldn\u2019t feel my arms or legs. The bandages around my body began to lift off and the water turned a reddish color as my blood polluted it. The water was now up to my chin and the bubbles were well over my head. I kicked with my legs to remain at the surface, glad that I was a good swimmer, but the cold water had made me go numb all over and I didn\u2019t have as much strength as normal. The water lifted me up towards the top of the jar and I reached out my hands to grab the holes and so lift myself out. The jagged metal immediately cut into my palms and fresh warm blood began flowing down my wrists and forearms. The water was now half and inch below the top of the jar and I began to wonder how long Adrianna would let this last. Would I finally die here by drowning to death? The panic consumed me as the breathing space became less and less. I pulled myself up with my arms toward one of the holes near the edge of the jar, trying to get air. The water entered my mouth and all I tasted was the soap and the blood mixed in. It made me cough horribly as it flowed down into my lungs. Then the last open space in the jar disappeared as it was completely filled with water. I pushed my mouth directly into one of the drilled holes, desperate to get air. I opened my mouth and gasped, but I received nothing but water. My vision blurred as the lack of oxygen went to my brain. My lungs screamed out for air and burned as if they were on fire. What a horrible way to die, I thought to myself as my grip loosened and I threatened to fall unconscious. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hit the cold metal of the sink and took in deep gasping breaths. I coughed and coughed, finally spewing out the water that was in my lungs. Then a cold shower of water began raining down on me. I cried out in shock and surprise as the torrent pounded me with frigid water. Finally, it stopped and I looked up to see Adrianna putting away the sink\u2019s sprayer.<br>\r\n\u201cThere; nice and clean,\u201d she said with her ugly smile. I simply sat there, shivering as my body began to slowly heat up. I was exhausted from the effort that this b**** made me go through. I lay down on the cold metal and closed my eyes. \u201cI hate you, b****,\u201d I snarled before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up and immediately shivered. The place I was in was cool and slightly damp. I opened my eyes and looked around at my surroundings. It was a garage, and I was lying on a bare tool bench that was stained with oil and paint. I could smell the gasoline from the two cars parked there and all the dust and dirt from the overhanging rafters and shelves. It was just like any other garage, with a snow blower in the corner and a wall full of tools hanging on hooks. Old junk was piled up on the shelves and rafters in an unorganized clutter and a bunch of old spider webs hung in every corner of the place.<br>\r\nI sat up and pulled my legs close to me, trying to keep warm. Then I heard a door open and two people walked up to the bench that I was on. It was Adrianna and a young girl of around 9 years old. Both were wearing thick sweaters due to the cold. <br>\r\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Adrianna sneered. \u201cThis is my little sister Becky. She and I are going to play a little game with you, Johnny.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just something to get back at the little comment that you made to me yesterday. I really didn\u2019t appreciate you calling me a b**** after all I had done for you, so now we\u2019re going to play a little round of Whack-a-John.\u201d<br>\r\nMy eyes grew wide in fear as Adrianna and her little sister pulled out one hammer each. The hammers were the normal ones used for pounding in nails. Their heads were as big as my chest! <br>\r\nI jumped to my feet as Adrianna brought her hammer down upon me, just barely missing me as I leapt out of the way.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d I bellowed. Adrianna just laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn, Becky.\u201d Becky smiled with joy and raised her slightly smaller hammer. She went directly for my head. I screamed and scampered out of the way as the two hammers began raining down around me. I swerved to the left and to the right, constantly trying to dodge those fatal weapons. It was like those old cartoons where the cat would chase the mouse and try and smash him with a hammer. Now that mouse was me, but unlike in cartoons, I couldn\u2019t bend like an accordion. <br>\r\nI backed up against the wall like a trapped beetle with my heart threatening to explode out of my chest. I jumped from side to side to avoid the hammer blows, but then the two girls came at me together, one at each side. I ran to the left to escape but my foot hit a rut in the old wood and I fell on my chest. I turned in time to see a single hammer coming towards me like a rushing bull. I was doomed.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I writhed on the ground, clutching my leg, screaming in terrible agony. Tears stained my cheeks and once again blurred my vision. I looked down to see my leg bent at an odd angle. It had to be broken in at least three places.<br>\r\n\u201cWay to go, Becky!\u201d Adrianna laughed. \u201cYou made the little baby cry! Good job!\u201d <br>\r\nI looked up at them and all my anger burst through. I started cussing and cursing like no other, saying everything that I had wanted to say to that f****** b****. She just looked at me in surprise. I suppose she didn\u2019t think I had the courage to say such things. Finally, I stopped, panting in fury, waiting to see what she would do. Her expression was completely blank and I shuddered as I realized what I had just done.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to regret that, little Johnny,\u201d she said in a very quiet voice. With one quick movement, she shot her hand out and grabbed a hold of my broken leg, twisting it in between her fingers. My vision immediately went red and I shrieked in anguish. The pain was too much for me to bear. In a matter of seconds I had passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up lying on the soft bed of shredded wood chips in the gerbil cage. I opened my eyes and looked up to see Adrianna sitting on her bed looking down at me in anger. I could feel her hatred burning into me and I knew that she was trying to decide what to do with me. Finally, she looked away and lay down on her bed, out of my sight. I breathed a sigh of relief for the moment, mentally beating myself up for being so stupid as to say those things to her. I just hoped that she wouldn\u2019t kill me.<br>\r\nThe bandages and antiseptic were still in the cage. I re-bandaged my wounds and bound up my leg tightly, using a thin piece of wood that I had found for a brace. Then I sat there, day-dreaming about food and water and being back in the hands of Melissa and Ron. I prayed to God that by some miracle I would get out of here alive, and maybe be able to spend Christmas with my family. <br>\r\nA screeching noise drew me back to reality; the fire alarm was going off. Smoke had begun to drift into Adrianna\u2019s room. I heard voices shouting and people scrambling within the house. Then a voice cried out: \u201cAdrianna! Get the f*** out of the house and call 911! We have a fire in the basement!\u201d The smoke had turned thick and black; this was definitely a serious fire.<br>\r\nAdrianna leapt off her bed and ran to the door. She paused for a moment and looked back at me with a twisted smile. \u201cBurn in hell, little Johnny,\u201d she said as she closed the door.<br>\r\n~Torch~ <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nRon drove around the neighborhood in a borrowed car so that Adrianna and her family wouldn\u2019t know that we were there. I had told him about the phone call that I had received. He and I both knew that we couldn\u2019t do anything to help John, especially since I knew that Adrianna would never let him out of her sight and that her dad was the chief of police in the city. She had kept her promise about calling me every two days, but she only told me that John was still alive. I hadn\u2019t slept in weeks because I was so worried about him. Now we were driving around, watching the house for any opportunity to go in and save John.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a group of fire trucks came roaring past us, in the direction towards Adrianna\u2019s house. It was then that I noticed the thick black smoke rising into the air. Ron whipped his wheel around and sped towards the house. Our jaws dropped when we got there.<br>\r\nThe whole building was ablaze with fire. Firemen were frantically trying to get the fire under control but it wasn\u2019t working. The building was clearly doomed. I looked and saw Adrianna\u2019s family standing outside watching their house burn. Ron leapt out of the car and I followed suit, tailing him as he ran up to Adrianna. She turned in surprise as we approached, clearly not expecting us to be there. Ron jumped down her throat in an instant.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is John?\u201d he demanded. Adrianna just smiled with glee. It made me want to gouge out her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said with false sweetness.<br>\r\nRon\u2019s face went red with anger. \u201cTell me where he is or so help me I will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJust then a little girl walked up to Adrianna. \u201cAdrianna, did you leave the little man in your gerbil cage? Now we can\u2019t play with him anymore!\u201d<br>\r\nRon went pale with fear. \u201cHe\u2019s still in the house?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d the little girl said.<br>\r\n\u201cShhh!\u201d Adrianna hissed. \u201cShut up, Becky!\u201d<br>\r\nBut Ron reached into his pocket and pulled out two hundred dollars and offered it to the girl. \u201cTell me where he is and this money is yours.\u201d<br>\r\nBecky\u2019s eyes lit up with happiness as she took the money. \u201cHe\u2019s in Adrianna\u2019s room on the top floor at the end of the hallway in a little cage by her bed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ron said and before anyone could stop him he dashed straight towards the house and entered the burning building. I cried out in fear with tears streaming from my eyes. I couldn\u2019t bear to lose them both.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nFire! Fire! It had entered Adrianna\u2019s room in a matter of minutes, consuming everything it touched. It slowly crept towards me, burning everything in its path like a roaring tiger devouring its prey. The heat was beyond intense, blistering my skin and burning my flesh. I huddled in the little dish of water, praying to God for mercy as the smoke wrapped around me, suffocating me and threatening to kill me before the fire. I cried out in fear and terror, knowing that I had been left here to die and that there was no escape.<br>\r\n&lt;Ron&gt;<br>\r\nI entered the burning building, afraid of what I was to find. The heat immediately began to burn my skin; it was like walking into an oven turned on broil. Furniture, chairs, carpet, walls, everything was on fire! It was as if I had entered hell itself. I dashed through the dense smoke, covering my mouth and nose with a handkerchief from my pocket. I ran up the stairs as fast as I dared, knowing that the structure was completely unstable. Immediately, I spotted the room that I wanted to go to, at the very end of the hallway. I dashed towards it, throwing the door open and calling out as loud as I could. <br>\r\n\u201cJOHN! JOHN!\u201d but I could hear nothing but the roar of the fire. Suddenly, I heard a small voice respond.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d I rushed towards the voice to see the cage with John huddled inside. I had never seen him so afraid. I bent down and threw the jar of change from the top and was just about to open the door when a burning piece of timber landed on top of me. I yelled in pain, throwing the wood off of me and beating out the flames that had ignited on me. I was thankful that I was wearing my thick winter coat to protect me. John cowered as I reached in and pulled him out, holding him securely in my hand near my chest. I looked behind me to see that the fire had consumed the doorway. I couldn\u2019t escape the way that I had come in. In that moment I wondered if I would perish here, holding my nephew in the palm of my hand, but I was not about to give up. <br>\r\nI turned and looked at the window over the bed. Covering John with my hands, I lowered my head and dove at the window, breaking the glass and hurtling through the air. I was suspended for a moment before I landed in a large snow bank, breaking my fall. <br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nMy lungs burned as I coughed from the dense smoke. I wept silently, knowing that I was going to die, burned alive in this pitiful little cage. Then I heard a voice call out over the flames. It was like the voice of God Himself speaking to me. \u201cJohn! John!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M HERE!\u201d I cried out as loud as I could, hoping, praying that the voice had heard me. Then the one person I had least expected to see appeared. Ron came running to the cage, knocking off the jar of change with a swipe of his hands. I didn\u2019t know how he had come here to my rescue, but I had never been so happy to see his face. He opened the cage door and was about to reach in when part of the ceiling fell on top of him. I yelled in terror, afraid that my uncle had been killed, but his thick winter coat protected him from the flames. He lifted me out of the cage and held me close to his chest. I lay there whimpering in pain and fear, not knowing if we would get out of this alive. The exhaustion from my wounds overtook me. I closed my eyes and surrendered to the darkness.<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nThe house was burning like the fires of hell. I had never seen a fire so bad. One side of the building had begun to crumble, dropping burning debris all around it. The fire went out with a loud hiss as it hit the cold snow. It was a dreadful sight, even worse by the fact that John and Ron were still inside. I paced in front of the house, anxious and afraid of what was going to happen.<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid for your little bug boyfriend?\u201d a voice behind me said. I turned to see Adrianna walking towards me. No one was near us; we were in a secluded spot between a fire truck and a police car.<br>\r\n\u201cBack off, Adrianna,\u201d I snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She got right up to my face, sneering her ugly smile. \u201cYou do know that they\u2019re going to die. John will be burnt to a little crisp and Ron will die trying to save him, the pathetic fool. It\u2019s convenient to me, seeing as I didn\u2019t kill John so I can\u2019t get in trouble for it. Although I\u2019ll miss torturing the little guy. His screams were music to my ears, bringing joy to my heart! Did you know that he\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI had had enough. My fist shot out and slammed into Adrianna\u2019s cheek, knocking her to the ground. I grabbed her by her shirt and lifted her up. She just looked at me in shock and surprise. <br>\r\n\u201cGo to hell and burn, you b****!\u201d With that, I flung her with all of my strength towards the burning house. There was a piece of timber that had fallen off and had continued to burn since it had landed in a shallow pile of snow. Adrianna fell right on top of it and her long hair went up in flames. She screamed in pain as the fire consumed her hair and burned straight to her scalp. I watched with satisfaction as she shoved her head into a snow pile to put out the fire. It served her right.<br>\r\nI walked away before anyone could notice that I had done anything and I turned back to the house, just in time to see a figure leap out of a window and land in a large snow drift. Two policemen plowed through the snow and dragged the injured figure out. It was Ron and he had been burnt in the face and upper arm. The policemen supported him as they led him to the ambulance. I ran up to him and he immediately turned to face me. He held out his hand and dropped something into mine before the policemen loaded him into the ambulance.<br>\r\nI looked down at my hand; it was John, and he was severely injured in several places. He was very pale and I couldn\u2019t tell if he was breathing. I prayed to God that John was still alive.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI thought to myself as I paced back and forth of what Adrianna looked like with no hair. The image brought a smile to my head; I know that I am usually a helpful person and don't think badly about others but shoving her into the fire was probably one of the highlights of my Christmas vacation, actually it is the highlight of my Christmas vacation. <br>\r\nI sat in the spare bedroom next to John\u2019s room listening to the steady beat of the heart monitor, it had been almost a week since the fire incident and it was already two days before Christmas. I was an emotional wreck. Mom and dad had entrusted me to stay with john so they went on vacation to Arizona; Ron had told me that he had to go back to the company to fix things and all my friends stopped talking to me after my boyfriend disappears. The only person or thing I had to comfort my tears was the continuous beep of my John\u2019s heart monitor and that stupid dog. I had read john collections of books more than once, I was about to go down stair to start on his mom\u2019s collection when I heard the heart monitor speed up. I stopped by his room and listened to the rapid beeps emitting from his room and I almost pushed the panic button when it returned to normal. I walked down stairs and into their grand library; I spent about a half an hour before returning to my guest room and digging into a suspense book. I set the book down and was about ready to fall asleep when I heard the shrill cry \u201cBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP\u201d!<br>\r\nI jumped to my feet and ran out of my room and into johns. I was searching all over for the defibrillator they had made him when I heard his voice, \u201cGet me out of this stupid thing!\u201d he yelled as I turned to him to see him caught up in all of the I.V.\u2019s and monitors. I walked over to him and he immediately calmed down. I undid the wires one by one and then lifted him into my hands. He had a cast on his leg and wraps around most of his body. He looked a little bit better from when they had rescued him from the fire. He looked more alive.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI woke with a jolt. The last thing I remembered was burning in that house and so I figured this was heaven; why did heaven have a steady beat to it, it sounded like a heart monitor almost. That\u2019s when I opened my eyes. I saw the wires dangling from the ceiling many of them going into my small wrists. I started to freak. I began pulling them in big chunks, grabbing the cords in my hands and ripping kind of thing. I reached my hand and grabbed the clump when I heard the shrill cry. It sounded like one of those demons being exposed to the light and I plugged my ears. I heard a loud thudding and then the door bursting open when I shouted. <br>\r\nThe next thing I knew I was being held in Melissa\u2019s hand and she had tears flowing down her face. I wonder why she was crying and then like a slap to the face all my injuries and the memories that went with them came back. Man I hated that B****. I knew once I was over this size changing illness I was going to beat the living crap out of Adrianna, if Melissa hadn\u2019t done it all ready. I looked up her and smiled. My face felt hard and scaly and my shoulder hurt like no other but I was no happier to see my girlfriend and especially in my house. I wanted to recall all of the events that happened to me but I figured why do it now. Melissa looked down at me and said, \u201cHow would you like some food?\u201d<br>\r\nMy stomach growled at the word and I simply nodded as Melissa carried me downstairs and into the kitchen. She set me on the table and opened the fridge. There was a section of containers marked \u2018Johns Food.\u2019 I questioned it as she pulled the box out and put it into the microwave. <br>\r\n\u201cWhile you were gone we found somebody who could make food for you, they made twenty one dishes and delivered them while you were out. It was Doctor Caesar that did it for you, he said he owed you because his assistant threw you out of the window\u201d Melissa explained. The only thing that I could think of was, Stupid Dog.<br>\r\nWhen the microwave beeped she pulled out the steaming box and set the thing on the ground. She pulled out what looked like a cabinet full of plate selections and then set another one that looked like a fridge. Melissa opened the mini-fridge and steam came rolling out. When the steam cleared I saw an all you can eat buffet. I pulled my self over and grabbed a plate. I took the plate to the fridge and gave myself bacon and eggs. Melissa had set up a miniature table and chair along with a set of cutlery to go along with my breakfast. The minute I sat down I dug in. eating as much as I could; I thought to myself that it was good to be home and that I hoped I never got into another situation again. <br>\r\n\u201cIs it good?\u201d Melissa asked.<br>\r\n\u201cA lot better than gerbil food\u201d I responded.<br>\r\nMelissa looked at me with a horrified expression and I thought back to the raunchy taste of the gerbil food. I remembered that before I was allowed real food I had to eat the pebbles. Most of the time I ended up throwing it up and Adrianna would laugh as she dropped the food in and said \u201cstupid bug.\u201d<br>\r\nAs I finished the plate Melissa took it from me. I looked at her with wide eyes, \u201cThey told me not to let you eat too fast, or else you might make yourself sick. So one meal at a time, maybe a little more at lunch but for now; actually it would be breakfast tomorrow morning\u2026\u201d Melissa was saying before the phone rang.<br>\r\nShe ran to the phone and answered it. As she listened her face became paler.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hung up the phone after I said goodbye and I didn\u2019t know how I was going to tell John. I walked over to him and scooped him gently up in my hand. \u201cI have to go; I will only be gone for a couple of days. My sister is having a baby and my mom and dad want me to be there, they never found out about this so I have to leave you behind, Don\u2019t worry Ron made arrangements and Caesar is going to be showing up this afternoon to help take care of you. So you will only be with Marco for the afternoon.\u201d  I felt horrible leaving him by himself with Marco, the dog had only been circling the table and standing guard since John came home. I was concerned for his safety but my mom said she was going to be at his house in twenty minutes. I kissed John on the head before heading upstairs and gathering my stuff. He waved goodbye when my mom showed up but he hadn\u2019t moved an inch, I had a feeling something terrible was going to happen to him.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nTo watch Melissa go was almost heartbreaking. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t like being by myself in a house that could be viewed to me as a giant ship, it was that the whacky scientist and his assistant were going to be showing up this afternoon to \u2018watch over me\u2019. I never liked them; Nick his assistant was the one who got me into this mess in the first place. I looked around and Marco was the closest thing to me, I noticed that he had been watching me the last couple of hours. It was unnerving but the look in his eyes said that he missed me, not that he wanted to eat me. I whistled and he came to the edge of the table, \u201cwell if I am going to be this small might as well enjoy it.\u201d I jumped onto Marco\u2019s head and told him to go to my room; it was at this point I was thankful for the service dog. Until the stairs that was. He was jumping the stairs at four at time and I lost my balance before falling off and smacking into the wood floor. \u201cStupid dog!\u201d I yelled as I pushed myself back onto my feet and looked at the stair above me and below me. The place could be cleaned, I thought to myself as I pondered what to do. I walked to the rail and was about ready to mount when I felt something pick me up and heard the words \u201cGotcha\u201d<br>\r\nI woke up in a nice comfortable bed. It was my size and nice and warm. At first I thought I was regular sized until I opened my eyes. I was in a gerbil cage and the first thing that came to mind was Adrianna. I started to scream at the top of my lungs hoping that somebody of her family would hear me. I stopped as I heard the door open and then saw Dr. Caesar walk in. I relaxed just a bit and then he began to speak. \u201cHello Jonathan, you are being kidnapped. I have token you with me to my labs in Europe and I also brought that stupid mutt. I thought of how it would look when your girlfriend returns to find you and the mutt gone. So I made it look like you got eaten and the dog ran off. She is in for a surprise. I need you for an experiment Jonathan, the things that made you small are going to help me do it to other people, well the antibody\u2019s your body makes will. Any questions?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou are one sick man, why do you want to do this to other people? Why do you think this is okay? Do you know what even happened to me the last two weeks?\u201d I screamed.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do and I am deeply sorry for that. I remember the night after as if it was yesterday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;Caesar&gt;<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you lost the boy!\u201d I yelled at Nicholas.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sor\u2026\u201d he stuttered.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I am sorry\u2019s, if you hadn\u2019t gotten your sick idea\u2019s in the way we would still be on track!\u201d I yelled, I thought of how Ron had kicked us out and sent us back to England empty handed.<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault the stupid dog bit me in the ass!\u201d Nicholas yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare use that tone with me young man!\u201d I snapped.<br>\r\n\u201cOr what?\u201d he retorted as he grabbed something off the shelve.<br>\r\nI picked up a test tube full of acid and hurled it at him, \u201cGet out of here, I never want to see your face again.\u201d I warned.<br>\r\nHe stayed and grabbed something to block the test tube. I grabbed a beaker and threw it; he dropped the thing he grabbed and shielded his face. The beaker hit him and exploded. \u201cYou Ba*****\u201d he yelled. I grabbed another tube and threw it at him but he turned and began to run for the door. I kept throwing beakers at him until he was out of the building.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nAfter Caesar finished his story I only had one conclusion, BESIDES being crazy this guy had anger problems to.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn I don't want you to be afraid of me, I will give you anything you want to prove that I am your friend and not your enemy.\u201d  Caesar said as he gave a weak smile.<br>\r\n\u201cHow about making me big again?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201canything but that,\u201d Caesar replied, \u201cyou see I need you for the experiment, and if it\u2019s that you want to be big again I can arrange that but not for a while, I still need your blood but you have so stressed lately your body isn\u2019t produce the antibodies I need so just relax and chill out for a week or two and everything will go back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow about my family?\u201d I asked knowing that he was the one who had killed them with his stupid serum.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I might be able to help with that\u201d Caesar said as he turned and walked away.<br>\r\nI laid down fuming. He left without asking if I was comfortable. I fell asleep almost instantly unaware that he had returned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She bent down so her face was level with my body. <br>\r\n\u201cWhen Ron rescued you from the fire, he jumped out of a window to escape the building. Well, the glass had sliced open his leg and just now it has become infected. It\u2019s really swollen and he can\u2019t walk so he\u2019ll be in the hospital for at least another three days until the infection gets under control. Caesar is supposed to come later tonight so we won\u2019t be alone, so there\u2019s nothing to be worried about.\u201d<br>\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief; I was worried that it was something more serious. Suddenly, a horrible screeching noise pierced my ears. I covered them with my hands as Melissa hastily fiddled with her electronic watch. The beeping stopped and Melissa looked at me sheepishly as I pulled my hands off of my ears.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI set an alarm to remind myself to change your bandages.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ok.\u201d She scooped me up in her hands and carried me upstairs back to my room. She gently set me down on the bed and grabbed a roll of bandages along with gauze and antiseptic. I gingerly took off my shirt, still terribly sore and in pain from all of my wounds. Melissa began to carefully unwrap the bandages around my chest and back as I lifted up my arms to give her more room.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do this when I was unconscious?\u201d I asked her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Caesar and Ron were the ones who did it. You were in really bad shape when you got here, but Caesar said something about the nanobots in your system having healing properties for your body. He said that you should make a full recovery in about two weeks.\u201d<br>\r\nShe unwrapped the last of the bandage and let out a gasp. Tears started rolling down her cheeks as she saw the extent of my wounds. My stomach and chest were blotchy with burns from the fire and scrapes from the treadmill, large ugly bruises had formed from where Adrianna had handled me roughly, but the worst was the massive black spot where the cigarette had roasted my skin to a crisp. The wounds had healed significantly, but I could tell that I was lucky I had survived all that I had gone through.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my Gosh! What did she do to you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I said and looked away.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, tell me! Where did that black spot come from?\u201d<br>\r\nI hesitated and then answered. \u201cA cigarette.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d she yelled, surprising me and causing me to jump. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill her; I swear, I\u2019m going to get Ron\u2019s shotgun and blow her brains out of her head and then blow holes in her chest!\u201d<br>\r\nShe continued to rant, saying all that she would do to Adrianna and I have to say, a lot of it was quite gruesome; I didn\u2019t know Melissa had it in her. I chuckled at her rage, scared because there was a giant person yelling and cussing near me, but happy that she shared my same feelings.<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, John!\u201d Melissa said when she noticed me laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is! Don\u2019t you get it? I\u2019m home! Adrianna can go to hell, but right now, I\u2019m just happy to be safe again.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa blinked and then smiled. \u201cYou have no idea how good it feels to have you back, John. Maybe now I can sleep again knowing that you\u2019re safe.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nI awoke with a start as I heard the door to John\u2019s room open. After bandaging up his wounds, John had told me all that had happened to him, from being carried off by the owl, to ending up in Marie\u2019s possession and ultimately Adrianna\u2019s. In turn, I had told him all the Ron, Caesar, and I had done to find him and try to reverse the shrinking process. Once we were all caught up on events, John fell back to sleep. I didn\u2019t blame him; his body had a lot of healing to do. I guess I had fallen asleep on the chair beside John\u2019s bed. <br>\r\nCaesar walked into the room very quietly. He smiled when he saw John asleep and motioned for me to come out into the hallway so that he could talk to me. I followed him out of the room, closing the door gently behind me. <br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Caesar asked.<br>\r\n\u201cGood. He regained consciousness today. Now he\u2019s just sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! That\u2019s wonderful news. He should be up and running soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so. I don\u2019t like to see him in pain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWill you come with me real quick? I have something in my room that I would like to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\nI followed Caesar down the hallway. His room was at the very end in a nearly soundproof room so that he could stay up late and run his experiments without keeping everyone else awake. It used to be John\u2019s dad\u2019s room and workshop when John\u2019s mom was out of town. His dad liked to experiment with things in his free time. <br>\r\nCaesar held the door open for me and I walked into the chaotic mess that was his room. It was like a tornado had swept through the place and had thrown every object this way and that. Nothing about it was organized from the computer on the floor, to the vials and equipment on the dresser and table, to the clothes hanging from the ceiling fan. Honestly, I didn\u2019t understand Caesar.<br>\r\n\u201cThe thing I want to show you is in the closet,\u201d he said. The \u2018closet\u2019 was a small closet about 5 ft by 5 ft and was used for storing clothes. Since it was Caesar, I really didn\u2019t think it strange that he would put something other than clothes in it. I walked to the closet and opened the door, expecting to see some strange new machine or device that he had created. Instead, to my complete surprise, the closet was empty. I was just about to ask him what I was supposed to see when I felt a strong shove force me into the closet. Soon I was encased in darkness as the door was closed. I frantically felt for the doorknob and tried to force the door open, but something large was now blocking it. I banged on the door, yelling at Caesar to let me out. \u201cGet me out of here! What are you doing? Caesar!\u201d But all I heard was the sound of his laughter.<br>\r\n&lt;Caesar&gt;<br>\r\nI had successfully trapped the girl in the closet. Now I could make off with my prized possession. I entered John\u2019s room and picked him up, startling him awake, but I moved too fast for him to react. I placed him in the special carrying case I had designed for him. He frantically tried to get away, but that\u2019s when I gassed the case with a special serum. John immediately fell asleep from the gas. Not only did it help keep him out of stress, it also allowed his body to survive the plane ride down to Europe where my lab was hidden. I had lots planned for little John.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI woke up lying on something soft and warm. I didn\u2019t quite feel like my bed, but it was comfortable. I opened my eyes and gasped. I was in a small room, lying on what looked like a miniature cot. The room had three solid walls and then one wall made entirely out of glass. It opened up into what looked like a massive lab, with strange-looking technology and computers all around. I got up out of the cot and limped to the glass window. Just then, a man in a white lab coat approached me; it was Caesar! In an instant, all my memories came flooding back to me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou! What do you want with me?\u201d I yelled.<br>\r\nCaesar chuckled. \u201cWell, John, I have taken you to my lab in Europe so that I can finish the experiment that I started long ago. You see, it was I who injected you and your family with the nanobots. I had created the ability to shrink living creatures, but only by injecting them with the nanobots. Seventy percent of the creatures that I experimented on didn\u2019t live.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike my family!\u201d I snarled. He paused and looked at me.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was all for the greater good. You see, I wanted to create a serum that would allow me to shrink anyone at any given time without the risk of them dying. That\u2019s where you come in. You and your family are of a rare blood type that can produce a special type of antibodies. With my nanobots, I can use these antibodies that your body produces to shrink others. It is a brilliant plan, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll the great minds are.\u201d<br>\r\nI shook my head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not brilliant, you\u2019re just evil! I want you to make me normal again!\u201d<br>\r\nCaesar laughed. \u201cOh, John, even if I had wanted to make you normal, I couldn\u2019t. The nanobots shrunk you using a special electrical pulse. At your size, a reverse pulse would kill you. Sorry,\u201d he said and walked away out of my sight. I slid down and sat on the floor, stunned by what I had just heard. I would be stuck like this, forever? I hugged my knees as I looked down at the floor. How could this have happened? Why was he even doing this? What did he gain by having this ability? He was messing with human lives!<br>\r\nI looked up as Caesar walked past the window. \u201cGet some rest, John. I want your body to heal so that it will produce the antibodies that I need. That\u2019s why I took you away from your home. You had been under too much stress; now I can actually get things done without having to worry about you being killed. This would have been a lot easier if my former assistant had just done what he was told and taken you directly to the lab! Stupid Nathan! I\u2019m glad that stupid dog sent him to the hospital!\u201d <br>\r\nHe walked off again, leaving me alone. So that was it? I was just going to stay in this box until he got what he wanted from me? Then what? I got up and limped back over to the cot and sat down with a sigh. Again, I was a prisoner. At least this time I wouldn\u2019t be tortured or starved, or so I hoped.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s house had a furnace system that always kept the house at a comfortable 70 degrees, but the closet I was in did not receive any of the heat; it was freezing inside. I did everything in my power to try and open the door, slamming into it with my shoulder enough times to wrench it out of place, but nothing worked. I figured that Caesar had moved one of the large dressers in front of it. After a few hours I had given up and sat down in defeat, hugging my knees and trying to keep warm from the chilly air. Sometime later I had fallen asleep; the exhaustion of not sleeping for days on end had finally caught up to me. When I woke up, I was still in darkness, but I felt refreshed and renewed, except for the fact that I really had to go use the bathroom and I was extremely hungry. I didn\u2019t know how long I had spent there but I was getting tired of being trapped in the small space.<br>\r\nSuddenly, I heard someone\u2019s voice in the distance. They were calling out my name. I yelled out, frustrated that I was in a sound proof room, but was relieved when I heard someone open the bedroom door. I called out to whoever it was and then I heard grunting as a large object was being moved. The closet door opened and I blinked, shielding my eyes from the light as I looked at Ron. He helped me to my feet and the first thing I did was run to the bathroom. When I came out, he started barraging me with questions.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you? Where\u2019s Caesar? Where\u2019s John!? Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down, slow down!\u201d I said. \u201cCaesar locked me in the closet and my cell phone was in my room. I don\u2019t know where John is and I don\u2019t know where Caesar is. I think he kidnapped John.\u201d<br>\r\nRon ran his fingers through his hair and began to pace back and forth. I noticed that he had a slight limp in his left leg.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three days since I last talked to you,\u201d Ron said. I could hear the worry in his voice. \u201cWhere would Caesar have taken John?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe back to his lab in Europe?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut how are we supposed to find him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have a pretty good idea,\u201d Ron replied. \u201cI just hope we get there in time.\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI had spent three days in the little room and I have to say, it was extremely boring. There was nothing in the room except for the cot and a miniature bathroom. Caesar fed me three times a day, but other than that, I had no contact with anyone. The isolation was starting to drive me up a wall. On the other hand, my health had improved greatly. I was amazed at how fast my leg was healing; I could now put some of my weight onto it without being in too much pain. My burns had faded along with my bruises and the cigarette burns had finally started to turn into scars. I was no longer completely exhausted and I had started to get some more meat onto my bones; my ribs didn\u2019t show anymore. It was on the beginning of the fourth day that Caesar once again approached me.<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, and how is Mr. Smithson doing today?\u201d he said as he approached the cell window. I turned away from him and ignored him, burning with hatred toward him for what he had done to me.<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you have become much healthier. That is very good news. Your body should produce the antibodies I need in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cI become disposable like my family?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeavens no! You\u2019re much too valuable to lose. But I think staying in this cell is bad for you. You should be ready to join the colony.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d I said and looked at him. He pulled out a remote and pushed a button on it. A door opened in the far wall from the window.<br>\r\n\u201cFollow where that door leads to and you\u2019ll get your next meal,\u201d Caesar said and then left. I looked at the passageway. It was lit and had white walls, just like everything else. I had no idea where it led to, but I was hungry enough to go find out.<br>\r\nI stood up from the cot and limped to the door and entered the passageway. As soon as I did, the door closed behind me. Well there\u2019s no turning back now, I thought to myself as I continued forward. The path led downwards and I was glad for that because it was easier for me to walk. Finally, the passageway ended with another door that opened when I approached. I limped through the door and it closed behind me, leaving me to gasp at my surroundings. I was in a large circular chamber with a large white light dominating the ceiling high above me. Different numbered doors like the one I had just exited out of lined the walls. But what really surprised me was what was in the center of the chamber. It wasn\u2019t exactly a city; there were no buildings, but there were distinguished areas like an area for exercising, complete with a track and a basketball hoop, an area for dining filled with tables and chairs, and an area for lounging on couches and recliners. And spread throughout this miniature city was at least twenty people, all my size. <br>\r\nThey stopped what they were doing and stared at me when I appeared. Immediately, I became nervous. I had no idea how to react; it was like I was about to deliver a speech. Then one person stepped out from the group and approached me.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn? John, is that really you?\u201d the person said. I recognized the voice and the face but I didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. The person was an old friend of mine. He was medium built with green eyes and light blond hair that was shaved short. His ears stuck out from the sides and his face was covered in freckles; he was one of the people you never forgot. <br>\r\n\u201cKendall?\u201d I said in amazement. He ran up to me and gave me a bear hug, much to my surprise and agony. <br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok! You\u2019re crushing my still healing body!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said and released me. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe someone I knew is here!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really Kendall Jacobs?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought you were dead. I mean, I even went to your funeral!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ve been here for a little over a year.\u201d He suddenly got very serious. \u201cHow\u2019s my family doing? Is my mom ok? What about my younger brother and my dad?\u201d<br>\r\nI shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They were really upset at your death. They thought you committed suicide. The police found your car in a lake and your mom found a note saying that you were going to kill yourself. They just never found your body.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCaesar did all that to me. He kidnapped me to use for his experiments, not caring who he hurt in the process.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would he need you? Why would he need anyone here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe was looking for the right blood type, the right person with the right antibodies. All of us here have the rare blood type that he was looking for, but none of us were able to produce the right antibodies. He keeps us here in case he needs the antibodies our bodies <i>do</i> produce. What about you? Why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think my blood is the right type, antibodies and all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cGood for you because you\u2019re now indispensable, but bad for the rest of society. This guy\u2019s a madman.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I kind of figured that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome on; I\u2019ll introduce you to everyone else.\u201d <br>\r\nI followed Kendall, limping because of my bad leg. He introduced me to everyone in the colony, and most greeted me warmly. A lot of them were shy and didn\u2019t say much, but a few were just as energetic as Kendall. When the introductions were done, Kendall and I sat on two of the recliners in the lounge area. I propped my leg up and leaned back with a sigh; walking still took a lot of energy out of me.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Kendall asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone so badly wounded since Mary showed up after being kidnapped.\u201d<br>\r\nI told him all that I had experienced, including the torture I had received from Adrianna. <br>\r\n\u201cAdrianna? I knew that girl was a b****, but I didn\u2019t know that she was a <u><i>b****</i></u>!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but now she has no hair and second degree burns on her scalp.\u201d<br>\r\nWe both laughed at that. The day passed by and Kendall and I ate and talked together. Finally, a voice rang out from hidden speakers, interrupting us.<br>\r\n\u201cAll subjects report to your rooms,\u201d the voice said. I recognized it as Caesar\u2019s. Kendall led me to one of the doors with numbers on them. <br>\r\n\u201cI think this one is yours,\u201d he said. \u201cMine\u2019s right next to it.\u201d<br>\r\nThe door opened as I approached and I looked at Kendall before walking in. He peeked around the door and smiled at me. \u201cSleep tight! Don\u2019t let the giant bedbugs suck all your blood!\u201d<br>\r\nHe laughed and then said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. This is our home now. You better get used to it because we\u2019ll probably be here until the day we drop dead. Good night.\u201d<br>\r\nThe door closed as he left and I stood there, frozen at the thought of his words. What had my life come to?<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI laid there thinking about what I could do about this situation. I know the odds were against me, thinking that there would have to be away out I thought about the air vent. What if we could escape, then what? I asked myself as the lights automatically turned off and I heard the whine of the fan slow down meaning Caesar had cut the power to the complex.  By this action he sparked an idea in my head, an Idea that would take a couple of days planning but something that would more than likely work but I would need everybody. I fell asleep staring at the ceiling, thinking my plan over.<br>\r\n I heard the voice on the overhead PA shout good morning in a rude and selfless way. I still recognized the voice to be Caesar but he didn\u2019t seem too thrilled about running the place, I knew it was time for stage one of my plan. I jumped out of bed and found a pair of clean clothes sitting by my bedside; I thought it odd because I didn\u2019t remember them being there the last time I checked. Back to the plan I thought as I changed and walked out into the clearing. The morning smelt of fresh bacon and eggs along with the smell of recycled air. I looked to the ceiling to see the blades for the fan spinning and the lights shimmering brightly. I wondered what it would take to stop the thing and if it was too much that somebody so small that they couldn\u2019t handle it. Kendall emerged from his room and I turned to look at him. <br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d ya sleep man?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d I replied, \u201cI have a plan for you know; to escape!\u201d I announced.<br>\r\nThe colony fell silent for a moment. Kendall walked over to me and put an arm around my shoulder and then spoke in a low voice, so only I got to hear him. \u201cWe don't talk about something like that around here, most of the time the word isn\u2019t even mentioned to the fear of being punished, there was one man who tried it and succeeded but was later caught. He was executed by Nathaniel, not shortly after that. Whatever plan you have try to keep it on the down low, I say this because our every move is being watched, look around Jonathan,\u201d Kendall said as he pointed to the camera in every corner of the colony. The camera\u2019s at the kitchen area, the public facilities, the sports arena, and the recreation area.<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we get around those things?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cwe don't, every escape attempt since Twitch escaped has been altered in its track, the first thing we would have to do is shut off those camera\u2019s, I know Caesar shuts the power off at night but those cameras are always running and somebody is always watching or there was when Nathaniel was still around. Maybe they are abandoned now and we could plot, but let\u2019s get some breakfast and discuss this,\u201d Kendal held up air quotes. \u201cEscape plot of yours.\u201d<br>\r\nWe walked over to the breakfast table, actually Kendall walked I half hobbled, and half limped my way there. We sat down at a table that could fit twenty but it was just us, all the sudden 15 other people sat down and stared at me. The biggest guy of the group said, \u201cWe heard that you are plotting an escape, we want in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Kendall stammered.<br>\r\n\u201cWe will see, it will requires everybody\u2019s participation for this because we will need a bunch of people.\u201d I explained.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that we have the colony here under an iron fist. Tell us what you need and we can get It.\u201d the big man said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell the security cameras are an issue, we have to find a way to block them, shut them off, or shatter the lens out something that won\u2019t give us away.\u201d I thought for a second, \u201cWhat happens when we are bad?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cEarlier bed times, Caesar has a set of rules that are not to be broken, and if they are he pushes the bed time back, it has been set back almost a half a day, you know what he says,\u201d the big man stopped.<br>\r\nKendall picked up the cue, \u201cIsolation is the best punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSweet, anybody got the camera issue?\u201d I asked the crowd at our table.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can loop the camera\u2019s, there is one of them that has a blind spot and if I hide there while you guys buy the time we need I can do it after the punishment has been instated.\u201d I man spoke up, he was wearing glasses and had a notebook for design drawings that he had been working on during the conversation.<br>\r\nThe group looked at me, it seemed less than twenty-four hours after I had been thrown into this place I was now the leader.  I hesitated and then spoke, \u201cOkay, I have already done stage one, stage two is to gather our people and get the biggest punishment we can, I don't know what that is but you guys can figure something out. Stage three, loop the camera\u2019s and then we go with stage four which is to wait until he kills the power and then build a human pyramid and climb out of the vent and into the lab. Then release everybody from this place and go from there.\u201d I said and then smiled I was confident that it was fool proof.<br>\r\n\u201cThere is only one problem to your plan,\u201d the big guy said.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cwe are four inches tall, how do you think that he won\u2019t recognize that we are gone and then coming looking for us, the thing is that the lab is sealed and only he can get in and out and we have no friends inside the lab it\u2019s just him and the assistant.\u201d the big man explained.<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore, he fired the assistant, remember?\u201d Kendall said.<br>\r\n\u201cthat\u2019s okay, when we all escape we can figure it out from here, but for now, tell your friends get everybody in on this as possible we will meet back here at Lunch.\u201d I said and the group left just leaving me and Kendall to eat our food.<br>\r\n&lt;Kendall&gt;<br>\r\nBy the time lunchtime had come around the place was buzzing with excitement about Johns escaped plan. I had forty-five people ask me if they could help, I knew when it was all in place that we could do this, john had planned that if we started the disruption after lunch that we would isolated before supper and the power would be cut and then we would be out, in theory. As far as I knew we could only escape one by one, we first had to form a human pyramid and then a ladder, and that way we could all get out at once, saying everything went to plan. The big man who had been sitting at our table introduced himself as Switchblade, he didn\u2019t want to say his real name and we all decided it best that we didn\u2019t get personal.  At dinner john explained how we would do it, a group of couples who had formed passionate relationships in the colony would start kissing right in front of each of the cameras. Caesar would call isolation and cut the power, Mole, the one who had introduced himself at the table with the camera idea would hide under the camera located in the rec room. The minute he was sure that he got the loop started he would give us a sign and we would start on the pyramid. John would crawl up since he couldn\u2019t help support and then we would all wait for his return, of which we were certain would happen. <br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nIt was time, my masterpiece of a plan had come together and we were going through with it. I watched the couples fall into place as I faked to do something. Almost immediately Caesar called them to stop and when they didn\u2019t he ordered isolation until tomorrow morning after usual breakfast time. I figured that was plenty of time, almost fifteen hours to be exact. When we were all in our cells he cut the power just as planned. I heard the whine of the fan as it came to a stop and then the signal of Mole, he snuck over and rapped on my door and when I opened mine everybody followed and begun the pyramid that would lead to the rise of the fan. Within an hour we had everybody in place and I slowly and painfully crawled to the ceiling fan. The minute I was on the blade the pyramid retreated and everybody scurried back to their rooms until like they were supposed to. When I would return and give them the signal we could continue with it. As I sat on the ceiling blade I looked it over. It was metal and had dust on it and the images of Adrianna\u2019s room came flooding back into my mind. I almost lost my balance and fell which would have resulted in my death. I regained my composure and reached up into the vent to pull myself up.  As I walked into the dark shafts of the air ducts I was greeted with the stale air of the air conditioning system and I could smell the chemicals from the lab. I stopped at a vent hole to rest when my foot slipped and I fell through the vent. I braced for impact, hoping for the best and preparing for the worst.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t know what I would hit, but I was sure hoping that I would survive. I didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of trying to escape and then end up dying anyway. To my relief, I landed on something soft and springy. I bounced in the air a couple times before coming to rest on what felt like a massive pile of blankets. I pushed myself up with my arms and looked around, seeing that I was on a normal sized bed. It was then that I heard the scream.<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\nIt felt like knives were being shoved into my skull. I covered my ears with my hands and closed my eyes as the sound grated on me like a tornado siren. I swear, some people in Canada had to have heard that scream. When the noise ended, I opened my eyes and uncovered my ears, looking to see where the scream had come from. What I saw nearly made me pass out from shock.<br>\r\n\u201cJENNY?!\u201d I yelled in disbelief. There was my younger sister, standing at the side of the bed, staring at me with wide eyes and her hands covering her mouth. She bent down at the bedside as I sat there, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn? Is that you? Am I dreaming?\u201d She pinched her arm in response to her own question. \u201cOuch! I\u2019m not dreaming, but are you real?\u201d Her finger shot out towards me, stabbing me in the stomach. I pushed her finger away and doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that! I\u2019m still healing!\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cI thought\u2026I thought you were dead.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought you were dead,\u201d Jenny said as tears began to well up in her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t be real.\u201d She reached out her hand again and I flinched, expecting to get jabbed again, but instead she ran her finger gently down my back. I could feel her shaking as she confirmed that I was real. She wrapped her fingers around my body and lifted me into the air. I didn\u2019t flinch as she drew me close to her, hugging me against her chest. I hugged her back the best I could, trying to keep myself from crying. My sister was alive!<br>\r\nShe pulled me back and set me down on the bed again, resting her chin on the edge as she continued to look at me. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so small?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get to that,\u201d I replied. \u201cFirst tell me why you thought I was dead? I saw your body! I saw the heart monitor go blank! I even saw you get buried with mom and dad! How are you alive?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was the other mound?\u201d Jenny said. \u201cThe only thing I remember is waking up in the back of a car and looking out to see a big gravestone with our name on it. I saw the three mounds and I thought\u2026I thought\u2026\u201d Her tears began spotting the bed sheets as I realized what she was thinking.<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I had died?\u201d She nodded in response. \u201cNo, no it wasn\u2019t me, but I saw your body! I saw\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nBut she might not have been dead. There had been reported cases of people supposedly \u2018dying\u2019 but were not actually dead. Come to think of it, her body had been a little pinker than mom and dad\u2019s.<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you wind up here?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cThere was some guy in the car with me, a guy with thick eyebrows and a hooked nose. I wanted to go to the graves as soon as I saw them, but the guy kept me under restraints.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNathan. He probably switched out your body in the hearse and filled the casket with something to replace your weight! He did always seem familiar. I bet he was the hearse driver!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he took me here, and this really nice guy named Caesar gave me this room and gave me anything that I wanted, except to be let go. I\u2019ve been here ever since. What about you? You\u2019re supposed to be my big brother!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be my little sister, but I guess not anymore. Caesar did this to me. Apparently I\u2019m one of his experiments. He wants to use me to make other people this big.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What would he gain from that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said!\u201d I had always been amazed at Jenny\u2019s maturity for her age. She was 5 years younger than I was, but was still extremely smart. I could talk to her like an individual my age.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHe says that I have the right blood type to produce the antibodies he needs. I\u2019m just a tool to him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo he killed mom and dad?!\u201d she said. \u201cAll this time he was telling me that they died from some terrible disease that I had managed to live through! Ba*****!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she blushed. \u201cBut he\u2019s a jerk! I cried myself to sleep every night for two weeks straight! Now it just hurts too much for tears to be enough.\u201d<br>\r\nShe looked down and wiped her eyes with the back of her sleeve. <br>\r\n\u201cJenny, you have no idea how good it feels to see you alive,\u201d I said, my voice breaking a little. \u201cI\u2019ve lost so much in the past months\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, John. I feel the same. But now how are we going to get out of here? We need to get out and find a way to change you back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\nI looked away from her. \u201cCaesar said that there\u2019s no way to change me back,\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ll be stuck like this for the rest of my life, which at the rate that things have been going, won\u2019t be very long.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, don\u2019t think like that! There has to be a way!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that we need to get out of here. I was trying to escape from the colony when I fell into your room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe colony? What\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know? Caesar has this whole little group of small people that he\u2019s taken captive. We were trying to get out. That\u2019s how I got here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me any of these things? I mean, he acted like\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJust then the door opened with a click and I saw the last person I wanted to see. Caesar walked into the room and Jenny grabbed me, hiding me behind her back as she quickly jumped onto the bed, but Caesar had already seen.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you have there, Jenny?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Jenny said, but she had always been horrible at lying. Caesar walked over and grabbed her arm, pulling me out of her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn! How did you get here? You\u2019re supposed to be in the colony!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like I\u2019m going to stay your slave!\u201d I spat. \u201cLet me go!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that, John.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d Jenny yelled. \u201cYou said my whole family was dead! You never told me that you had done\u2026this to John! And you did it to more than just him! How can you live with yourself?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Jenny,\u201d Caesar said sternly. He looked down at me as I was clenched in his fist. My arms were pinned to my side or else I would have flipped him off. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have put you in the colony,\u201d Caesar stated. \u201cYou were helping them to escape, weren\u2019t you? Very well, you will now stay with Jenny. That should keep you out of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\nHe dropped me on the bed and walked back to the door. Caesar turned around before he closed the door and said, \u201cOh, and you can be sure that I\u2019ll fix the air vents so you can\u2019t get out. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t know how you escaped. I am not na\u00efve. This is your new home, John, so get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\nHe closed the door and I heard an audible lock. I sighed and looked at Jenny. She wiped the last of the tears from her eyes and reached over to me before I could react. I jumped a little as she picked me up and let me rest in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do, John?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just hope that Ron and Melissa find out where we are and come and get us out of here. I suppose we just hang out here while we wait. There\u2019s nothing we can do right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. We should probably get some sleep,\u201d Jenny said. She looked around her room for a moment. \u201cYou can sleep on my nightstand,\u201d she said and set me down on the wooden stand next to her bed. She pulled a thin blanket off of her bed and bunched it up into a sort of nest-type-thing and set it down next to me. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry, John,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I said with a smile. I climbed into the sheet and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Jenny stand up and flick the light switch, engulfing the room in darkness. I could see very little, but as my eyes adjusted, I could see fairly well. I heard Jenny climb into bed and pull the covers over her.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, John,\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I replied, so happy to hear her voice again.<br>\r\n&lt;Jenny&gt;<br>\r\nI woke up still in darkness. The alarm clock on my dresser glowed 1:30 A.M. I turned and looked at my brother, sleeping soundly in the bed that I had made him. Nothing could describe what I felt knowing that he was alive. He was small enough for someone to crush him in their hands, but I didn\u2019t care. I cared because he was my brother, yes, but I was happier that he was alive. If only there was something I could do to help him.<br>\r\nI shivered slightly. Caesar always kept things cold; it drove me nuts some nights. I watched as John mumbled something and rolled over in his sleep, drawing the covers closer to him as he shivered. I reached over and touched his back. He was very cold. Gently, I lifted him up, being careful not to wake him. I drew him close to me and cradled him in my hand. I could feel his tiny heart beating in his chest through my fingers. He soon stopped shivering and started to snore slightly. I laughed quietly to myself and closed my eyes, dreaming of mom and dad and John normal sized as I drifted back to sleep.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been four hours since Ron and I had tracked down Nathan. I had never seen Ron so fierce. He had stormed into Nathan\u2019s apartment and kicked the door open. Nathan had tried to run but had grabbed him by the chest and slammed him against the wall.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Caesar\u2019s lab?!\u201d Ron had demanded, but Nathan refused to speak. I had watched as Ron slammed his fist again and again into Nathan's face until it was bloody and swollen. Finally, Nathan cracked.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok! His lab is in the Alps, at the base of Mont Blanc near the city of Courmayeur Aosta! That\u2019s all I can tell you! The exact coordinates are programmed into my GPS in my car. Take it and just please leave me alone!\u201d   <br>\r\nNow we were in the Smithson\u2019s private jet, heading towards Italy. I was scared for John; I had no idea what Caesar had planned for him. I just hoped and prayed that we got there in time.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nSlowly, I began to drift out of sleep. I had been dreaming about something concerning me driving a Jaguar. I don\u2019t know why; I prefer Lamborghinis. The first thing I noticed was that I was surrounded by something warm. I opened my eyes to see that I was encased in darkness. My arms were pinned to my sides and I couldn\u2019t move. I began panicking, squirming as I tried to get free. Then I felt whatever was encasing me come apart. I fell onto something soft and realized that I was on Jenny\u2019s bed and she was looking down at me with concern.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, are you ok? Did I hurt you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, I\u2019m fine. I just didn\u2019t know where I was for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it was really cold last night. I didn\u2019t want you freezing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, thanks. It\u2019s just that throughout the past few weeks, well\u2026I haven\u2019t exactly had the most pleasant experiences. It\u2019s making me a little paranoid.\u201d<br>\r\nJenny giggled. \u201cLittle! He hee!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d I said with a smile. She picked me up and rested me in her palm. Just then, the door opened and Caesar walked in. <br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Jonathan. It\u2019s time for your testing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I\u2019m not going with you!\u201d I spat. \u201cCrazy bas\u2026.uh\u2026jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Caesar replied. \u201cHand him over, Jenny, or I will take him by force and he could be harmed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine you S.O.B.,\u201d she said and held me out to him. Caesar grabbed me and carried me out of the room. I looked back at Jenny as she stared at me in worry before the door closed. Caesar took me to a metal table and set me down in a chair my size. Then he pulled out a needle, even smaller than the one he had used before on me.<br>\r\n\u201cNow I can finally complete my experiment!\u201d he said as he made towards me with the needle. I stood up out of the chair and backed away.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think that I\u2019m just going to give you my blood, think again!\u201d I yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t cooperate, I will anesthetize you,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m going to get your blood either way, John. So what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\nI raised my hand and flipped him off, but I sat back down in the chair and stayed still. He stuck the needle in my arm and began drawing out my blood. I watched in sick fascination as the red liquid filled the needle slowly. This time, he took twice as much, enough to make me light-headed, but not enough to really harm me.<br>\r\n\u201cThere! That wasn\u2019t so bad now was it?\u201d he said as he stared in satisfaction at the blood. \u201cNow I will be able to isolate your antibodies and use them to create the serum I need!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked me up and carried me back to Jenny\u2019s room. Jenny was waiting at the door for me. She immediately took me in her hands and walked away from Caesar, calling him a few coarse words.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok, John? Did he hurt you?\u201d Jenny demanded from me.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he just drew blood. I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut now he had your antibodies, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He has what he wanted from me. I just don\u2019t know how soon the serum will be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good; he shouldn\u2019t have the power to do this to people.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d I said sadly. <br>\r\n&lt;Caesar&gt;<br>\r\nSuccess! I had John\u2019s blood and was now ready to complete the formula I had started so long ago. My body shook with excitement as I isolated the antibodies of the blood and applied it to my formula. The finished product was a bright orange color. Now I just had to decide what to test it on. I could test it on animals but I wanted to see its effects on humans.<br>\r\nJust then, the alarms started going off. I walked to the security console and turned off the alarms. The cameras showed that two people had just entered the top floor of the facility. Since my lab had four floors all underground, it would take them awhile to find me. I zoomed in on the intruders, curious as to whom they were. My mouth spread into a wide smile. It looked like I had found my test subjects.<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nIt took us two hours to find the entrance to the lab. It was hidden in a cleft of rock and blocked by a large metal door. Using a keycard that he had taken from Nathan\u2019s possessions, Ron had opened the door and we entered the lab. It was immediately obvious that we had entered a labyrinth of white hallways and rooms. The place was bear except for a few computers and tubes containing strange liquids. Boxes were piled in the corner of the first room that we entered and a few rooms had tables and chairs in them.<br>\r\n\u201cStay close to me,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get separated.\u201d<br>\r\nI nodded and followed Ron to a staircase that led downwards. When we reached the landing and stepped into the hallway, two metal walls slammed down in front of us and behind us. Ron pushed against one of the walls, but was unable to move it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use. We\u2019re trapped,\u201d he said. Then the floor split apart underneath us and we fell into a metal tunnel. I screamed as I slid down the metal tube, with Ron right beside me. Then the tunnel split into two and Ron went down one while I went down the other. I dropped from the ceiling into a room surrounded on all sides by thick walls of glass. The hole that I had fallen out of closed up, trapping me in the glass prison. I looked around and saw Ron in another glass prison right beside mine. He looked at me, and by his expression he was just as surprised and puzzled as I was.<br>\r\n Someone began to approach the glass prisons. It was Caesar! And he was carrying some sort of gun with a dart syringe containing an orange liquid loaded into it.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, visitors!\u201d Caesar said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that you could join me in my humble laboratory.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s John, Caesar?\u201d Ron demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s my nephew?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe is quite alright. I would never do anything to hurt my experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour experiment?!\u201d I practically screamed. \u201cYou shrunk him?! What the hell for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat is something that I do not have to share with you. You are intruders to my lab, so now you\u2019re going to become part of my studies.\u201d<br>\r\nI really didn\u2019t like the smile that was on his face.<br>\r\n~Torch~ <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He raised the gun and stuck the tip of it in a small hole that I assumed was for air. I hadn\u2019t noticed it before. The gun was aimed right at me; I looked back and forth frantically, but there was no way for me to escape. I was trapped.<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye, the gun fired and the dart hit me in the shoulder. I yelped in pain as the syringe stuck into my skin. Not only that, it had three barbs that had hooked onto my flesh. If I tried to remove it, I would rip off a large chunk of skin. The liquid had quickly drained into my blood stream and I expected to feel\u2026something, but I felt nothing. I looked at Caesar as he pulled out a remote and pointed it at the dart. He clicked a button and the thick metal tip of the dart lit up. A surge of electricity went through me, numbing my entire body. My vision went black as I passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lying on something soft and warm, and I could feel someone holding my hand. I opened my eyes and saw John\u2019s face, looking down at me in concern. He looked completely normal. I reached up my hand and touched his cheek. He smiled and placed his hand over mine. For once I could finally see what he really looked like; I could see the long scar across his forehead and I could see the still-healing red burn from the cigarette on his wrist. His face was peeling in places from the burns he had received, but he looked healthy and was healing far better than I thought possible. He was the John that I remembered.<br>\r\n\u201cJohn\u2026are you big again?\u201d I asked him. The smile on his face disappeared as quickly as it had come. He shook his head sadly, and it was then that I looked around at my surroundings. I could have screamed from the shock, but my voice had died in my throat. Everything, everything around me was huge, from the desk as big as a mountain, to the bed I was laying on that might as well have been a football field. The only thing that was normal was John, and then I realized: Caesar had shrunk me! <br>\r\nI looked at John, my eyes wide in fear and my heart thumping loudly in my chest. Then he spoke for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, Melissa. Caesar brought you here after his experiment was a success. You\u2019ll be safe here with me and Jenny.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJenny?\u201d was all I managed to say. Then I noticed the giant standing behind me at the foot of the bed. It was John\u2019s sister, Jenny. A million questions exploded in my head, but I still couldn\u2019t get over the shock of all of this. I sat up and looked at Jenny.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were dead?\u201d I said. <br>\r\nShe shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her voice was as loud as a megaphone. I flinched at the sound, but was reassured when John wrapped his arm around my shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not used to this like I am, Jenny,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really loud to her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jenny said and blushed. I had always liked John\u2019s sister; she was very kind and gentle. With a softer voice she spoke. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dead. Caesar brought me here and led me to believe that my whole family was dead.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the point of that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd now that he knows his shrinking formula works, who knows what he\u2019ll do!?\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any way that we could escape? Ron came with me; he could help us get out if we find him, that is unless Caesar shrunk him, too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about Ron, but with Caesar you never know. I thought he only had one vial of the formula so Ron probably is still around here, more than likely normal sized.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAt least one of us is,\u201d I muttered. I had begun to appreciate what John had gone through. Now I could finally understand how he felt. I hugged my knees and tried to calm myself. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m scared, John,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied, wrapping his arms around me. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to be ok. Somehow we\u2019ll get out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;Ron&gt;<br>\r\nShock. That\u2019s all I could describe it as was shock. My old classmate, one who I had trusted enough with the life of my last living relative, had betrayed me and had been the cause of all that had happened to John and his family in the first place. Not only that, he had now shrunken Melissa! Was I next?<br>\r\nI paced the small white room that Caesar had put me in. It was like a refurbished prison cell; no matter how luxurious it was, I was still trapped. I had to escape and somehow find a way to reverse this. Was there anyone I could maybe contact to help us? My options were slim\u2026<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The door was locked from the outside with what I guessed was an encrypted code. I couldn\u2019t get out that way\u2026or maybe I could. I walked to the wall beside the door and felt it with my hand. It was made out of fiberglass, or something similar to it. In the corner of the room was a chair with metal legs. Maybe I could use that. I walked over and picked up the chair, turning it so that its legs were facing away from me. Here\u2019s where all those years of lifting weights paid off. I heaved the chair over my head and slammed it into the wall. It bounced back like I had done nothing, but a dent was left where I had hit it. Again I slammed the end of the chair into the wall. This time the fiberglass cracked, but didn\u2019t break. Once more, I smashed the chair against the wall, and the fiberglass splintered and broke apart, revealing an interior metal skeleton supporting the wall. A control box was located in the exact position that I had broken through the wall. It was sealed with a hatch lock, but I could break that. I kicked at the lock repeatedly, until it broke free with a snap. The door of the control box swung open, revealing a tangled mess of wires and electrical systems. I smiled as the layout of the system came naturally to me. I knew exactly what to do.<br>\r\nAfter switching around a few wires, the door to the room opened up and I walked out. Forget calling the FBI; I\u2019m going after Caesar. I ran down the white hallways. Gosh, didn\u2019t this guy like color at all? He was disorganized enough. The hallway opened up into a large room full of computers and chemistry instruments. Caesar was bending over a table with his back turned to me, examining something. I ran towards him, grabbing a long bar that was on a counter  on the approach. He turned around and looked at me with surprise as I grabbed his shirt and threw him onto the table, sweeping vials and flasks of liquids and different substances onto the floor. <br>\r\n\u201cListen here, Caesar! You\u2019re going to show me where John and Melissa are and you\u2019re going to change them back!\u201d<br>\r\nCaesar just laughed. \u201cLike I\u2019m going to do that! My experiments are not for you to have.\u201d<br>\r\nI lifted him from the table and slammed him into the wall. \u201cChange them back, or else!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what?\u201d he sneered. I released him and swung the bar in between his legs, hitting him in the privates. He doubled over, falling to his knees.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what, f****** ba*****!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI still won\u2019t change them back,\u201d he squeaked in pain. I slammed my fist into his face, breaking his nose. Hot blood poured out and coated his face. He let out a string of cuss words and spit at me in insult. I heaved him up and slammed him onto a different table.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say this one more time,\u201d I growled. \u201cChange\u2026them\u2026BACK!\u201d<br>\r\nI failed to see Caesar\u2019s hand reach behind him and grab a flask. He flung the flask forward and it hit me in the cheek, cutting a long gash in it. I released him and stumbled backward in surprise. He immediately jumped to his feet and began chucking various vials at me. I ducked to avoid the first few, but one struck me in the arm and exploded. My arm burned as the acid began to eat away at my skin. I rolled behind a counter as more flasks flew past, breaking against the wall and spilling their contents. The barrage of projectiles suddenly stopped and I took the moment to leap out and attack. I jumped out from behind the counter to see Caesar finish loading a gun-like object. He pointed it at me before I could react and fired.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I leapt forward and brought the bar I was holding down on the wrist that was holding the gun. I heard a loud snap as Caesar dropped the weapon, his wrist broken. Caesar fell to his knees, whimpering. <br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease!\u201d<br>\r\nI pointed the bar at him threateningly. \u201cChange my nephew and Melissa back\u2026now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t,\u201d Caesar said. \u201cThe process is irreversible. I haven\u2019t created anything to reverse it yet, and even if I did, it would probably kill them. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d<br>\r\nI cussed at him and lowered the bar. \u201cFine! I\u2019ll just take my family and leave.\u201d As I turned around to walk away, Caesar grabbed my leg and tripped me. <br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d he hissed. \u201cYou cannot have my experiments!\u201d He grabbed a scalpel off a table and went for my throat with it. I swung the bar upward, slamming it into Caesar\u2019s temple. The madman crumpled to the ground, unconscious. I stood to my feet and grabbed the key card from around his neck, but my revenge wasn\u2019t quite over. I kicked him in his side again and again until I felt his ribs give way and break. Then I took the bar and slammed it over and over onto his leg until his fibula and tibia were crushed and broken in several places. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for John you ba*****,\u201d I snarled. It took all my mental resistance to not kill that man. I had better things to do than deal with him. After making sure he wouldn\u2019t wake up for a long time, I got up and walked away. Now to find my family\u2026 <br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kendall\u2019s really alive?\u201d I asked John. He nodded in response.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He was one of Caesar\u2019s first victims.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat son of a b****! How could he do that to Kendall\u2019s family?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about anything but completing his experiments,\u201d John said. \u201cI mean, look what he did to us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d I still hadn\u2019t gotten used to the fact that my old Barbie dolls were larger than I was now. John had told me everything that he knew about Caesar\u2019s lab, including the colony.<br>\r\n\u201cIs he going to put me in the colony?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\nJohn shrugged. \u201cI hope not. I don\u2019t want to be separated from you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither. It\u2019s frightening enough as it is. Now I know how you felt to be around us.\u201d<br>\r\nHe smiled at me, but his smile disappeared as the door beeped, signifying that someone was going to enter soon. Jenny placed her hand on the bed and John climbed on, but I remained where I was.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Melissa,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d<br>\r\nI stood up and looked at her hand, but it was as big as a car to me! I remembered how John had acted when I first found him; he was scared crapless. Now it was me, but there was nothing to be afraid of, at least not with Jenny. I knew she wouldn\u2019t hurt me, but it was all just overwhelming.<br>\r\nJohn climbed down from Jenny\u2019s hand and walked over to me. He grabbed my arm and gently pulled me towards Jenny. Reluctantly, I climbed onto her hand with him and Jenny raised us into the air. It was like riding a lift without railings.<br>\r\nJenny stood up and walked away from the door; she wasn\u2019t about to let anyone take her brother, or me for that matter, away from her. The door opened up and a figure walked in. It was Ron! Oh, gosh, I had never been more relieved to see him than now!<br>\r\n\u201cJenny?\u201d Ron said in total amazement. \u201cI thought you were dead?!\u201d Jenny was probably getting sick of hearing that, but she ran to Ron out of joy. I was in awe of how something so large could move so fast, and I grabbed onto John as we \u2018flew\u2019 forward at what seemed like a hundred mph. Ron embraced her, being careful not to crush us. <br>\r\n\u201cI missed you, Uncle Ron,\u201d Jenny said. It was a genuine family reunion. <br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nRon pulled away fairly quickly, as though he had just remembered something important.<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Caesar?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\nRon smiled mischievously. \u201cHe won\u2019t be bothering us anymore.\u201d <br>\r\n I didn\u2019t bother asking him what he meant. I knew how Ron got when his family was in danger. Caesar didn\u2019t stand a chance. We exited the room and into the hallway, following the rows of tables to a door at the end of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that leads to the upper floors,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe can get out from there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d I yelled and Jenny came to a stop. Ron looked at me curiously. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave Kendall and the others in the colony,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to get them out, too. Maybe then we could convince the FBI or someone to arrest Caesar.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cErr, ok, but I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ron said in confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cCaesar has a colony of shrunken people,\u201d Jenny explained.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that makes more sense. Where are they?\u201d<br>\r\nI shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. This place is like a maze.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going to get them all out anyway?\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n Ron thought for a moment. He looked around the room trying to come up with ideas. I could just imagine a light bulb appearing over his head as he clearly got an idea. He walked over to a table and picked up a bag. \u201cThis should work.\u201d<br>\r\n&lt;Melissa&gt;<br>\r\nWe exited the underground lab to the outside world, a thousand times bigger to me now that\u2026well\u2026 Jenny still held John and me, and Ron carried the bag with the former occupants of the colony. Those people were so happy to get out of that prison. Kendall had been shaking in excitement at the possibility of him meeting his family again. Others were anxious to see their spouses or children. It was heartbreaking to see how many families Caesar had ripped apart. <br>\r\nJenny followed Ron to the three-seat pickup that we had come to the lab in. Ron had paid a farmer $10,000 to borrow the truck for a few days. It just showed how much Ron loved his family; no price was too high for their safety. Jenny climbed into the passenger\u2019s seat and held us near her chest. Ron got into the truck and gently placed the bag at Jenny\u2019s feet for a secure spot. He started the truck and I could feel the engine vibrating through my tiny body. But before Ron could put the truck into drive, about fifteen black cars came screaming around the bend of the road and surrounded us. Men wearing sunglasses and carrying handguns jumped out of the cars and aimed\u2026at us. <br>\r\n\u201cGet out of the truck and put your hands over your head!\u201d one of the men screamed at us. I looked at John who looked at Jenny who looked at Ron who was just as confused as all of us. Ron opened the door and slowly got out, placing his hands on the back of his head, but Jenny remained where she was. She obviously didn\u2019t understand what was going on. <br>\r\n\u201cYou, too, girl!\u201d the same man barked. Jenny, confused as ever, got out of the car, but she wasn\u2019t sure on what to do. The men in black aimed their weapons at her like she was some kind of threat. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t point those things at my sister!\u201d John yelled, but I doubt his voice would carry far enough for even Ron to hear.<br>\r\nThe men approached us cautiously, always keeping the guns pointed at Ron and Jenny. They arrested Ron, pulling him into the back of an SUV. Two men came up to Jenny and grabbed her arms. Jenny tightened her grip on us in a reflex, making it hard to breath. The men forced Jenny\u2019s hands open and I found myself in the grasp of one of the men in black. I struggled, calling out to John for help, but he couldn\u2019t do anything. He had been taken by a different man. I briefly caught a glimpse of Jenny as she was also forced into an SUV before I was dropped on the seat of a car next to John. The door closed to the car, silencing the barking orders of the men outside. I sat up and looked around. We were in one of those cars that had the seats facing opposite from each other so that two people could talk face to face. John and I were on one side and two strangers were on the other. The first person was a man who looked to be somewhere in his forties. He had a bald head and a brown mustache. The person sitting next to him was a lady in her twenties. She had short black hair that parted over her pretty face and she was very curvy.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid of us,\u201d the man immediately said. \u201cI am agent Grant from the FBI, here to arrest Caesar Romano for the kidnapping of several US and European citizens. This is Dr. Renee Kelly,\u201d he said, indicating to the woman sitting next to him. \u201cShe was a former assistant of Caesar\u2019s. Dr. Kelly originally brought Caesar\u2019s actions into light.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re here to put a stop to Caesar\u2019s insane plans?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Grant replied.<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you arrest my uncle and my sister? They weren\u2019t doing anything!\u201d<br>\r\nGrant looked taken aback. \u201cYou have to understand, we were mostly concerned for your safety and the safety of the other prisoners. We didn\u2019t know who was helping Caesar or not. It was only a safety precaution.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ron was helping get us out,\u201d I said. \u201cJenny was just another prisoner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the woman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it all taken care of once we get to where we\u2019re going.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBern, in Switzerland.

Jenny immediately scooped John and me up, letting us sit next to each other on her palms. Ron was clearly irritated, grumbling to himself.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you arrest us?\u201d he demanded of agent Grant.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a precaution for the safety of Caesar\u2019s victims,\u201d he simply said. \u201cI apologize for the misunderstanding.\u201d<br>\r\nRon sat next to John\u2019s sister as the car began to move. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you taking us?\u201d Ron asked, a little more polite this time. <br>\r\n\u201cTo Bern, Switzerland. We have a lab set up there to help reverse the, uh, shrinking process.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how to reverse it?\u201d I exclaimed.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but first we need to get some information from you,\u201d Grant replied. \u201cWhat do you know about Caesar?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters he\u2019s a crazy, delusional madman who likes shrinking people, but I suppose you already figured that out,\u201d John said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\u201cCaesar is in his lab unconscious,\u201d Ron said, more serious than John. \u201cI had to take him out to rescue my family.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe kept a colony of people that he shrunk, probably all the people he kidnapped.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where are these people?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI had them in a bag in the front seat of the car before we were arrested,\u201d Ron responded. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you found them or not.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, so sorry for the mix-up. Do you know why he was kidnapping these civilians?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe wanted the antibodies their bodies would produce to create a shrinking serum that would work on any living creature,\u201d John said. \u201cMy blood had what he wanted and he successfully made the serum. He used it on Melissa,\u201d he said while indicating to me.<br>\r\n\u201cThen he has succeeded in creating a permanent serum,\u201d Kelly said. She looked at us with something like sympathy, as if she understood exactly how we felt.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean a permanent serum?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to explain that we need to tell you Caesar\u2019s history,\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n\u201cCaesar was hired by the US government for his extreme knowledge in science,\u201d agent Grant said. \u201cHe was paid to create a shrinking serum that could be used for the defense of the country, and possibly create more room in prisons. Dr. Kelly was Caesar\u2019s assistant, helping him out with the project. It was\u2026mostly disastrous. Most of Caesar\u2019s test subjects died, or experienced severely painful side effects, which eventually killed them, too. Caesar had been using animals for his test subjects and he wanted to move onto human testing, but we refused. Because of the lack of success of the project, we shut down the program. Caesar, extremely upset, became obsessed with finishing his experiment. He went on to work in secret, dragging Dr. Kelly into the process.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCaesar told me that a corporation in Europe had agreed to fund the process,\u201d Kelly explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that he was lying at the time. He got his money over the black market. How, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but he convinced me to help him continue his project. After about six months, we had success, but the effects of the shrinking process were not permanent. Sometimes the effects only lasted an hour before the subject returned to its original size. Caesar told me that he needed to get human subjects that contained certain antibodies that would produce the serum he needed to shrink whoever he wanted. Injecting nanobots into all people was just too expensive and the rate of survival was low. When I found out that he was serious with going through this plan, I tried to stop him. In turn, he shrunk me using the defective serum, but I managed to escape. Because of my antibody makeup,  I was stuck your size for two years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTwo years?!\u201d John exclaimed. \u201cHow did you survive?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was very, very lucky. A poor farming family found me and kept me safe. They helped me contact some of my friends in the US. When I got home, I told the FBI and now we\u2019ve been searching for Caesar ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve found him but now what?\u201d I asked. \u201cAll the people he\u2019s shrunk have permanent effects.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve figured out how to reverse the process,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAfter doing some research and creating a list of people that Caesar would kidnap, I came upon the Smithson family. John and Jenny, your bodies are both perfect for creating the shrinking serum and the reverse serum. Caesar never bothered thinking of a reverse to the process. I\u2019m guessing he only kept you, Jenny, in case John died, but since you haven\u2019t been affected by the shrinking process, your body has responded to the nanobots in your system by creating the reverse serum.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo we can get back to normal?\u201d I said hopefully.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but there is one problem; just like with the nanobots, the reverse serum might not bind with the body, although the chances of that are very slim.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take those chances!\u201d John said. I had never seen him so excited.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI liked Dr. Kelly; she was very kind. After we had made it to Bern, agent Grant had given us a room to relax and unwind from the day\u2019s events. It was very fancy, with three queen-sized beds, a 32 inch flat screen TV, and scented toilet paper! Everyone from the colony had also been given places to sleep, but theirs in proportion to their size. I was with Ron, Jenny, and Melissa.<br>\r\nI lay on one of the beds, relishing how soft it was, when all of a sudden, Jenny came running out of the bathroom and jumped on the bed. The mattress compressed and popped back up, sending me flying into the air. Needless to say, I screamed, probably like a little girl. Instead of spinning through the air, I went straight up, slowly flipping over until I was looking down at the sheets below. For a moment, I was weightless, like I weighed very much anyway, and then I started to rapidly descend towards the bed. A large object shot out as I fell and I found myself landing gently on Jenny\u2019s hand. She dropped me on the bed before I could get over the surprise and stuck her face right next to my body, smirking.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d I yelled as she giggled. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, John! Can\u2019t we have some fun? Caesar\u2019s going to jail, and tomorrow I\u2019ll have my brother back!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like me tiny?\u201d I smiled. She laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fun, but I want to hug you without worrying about crushing you, and you still need to teach me how to play tennis.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s kind of hard when the ball is bigger than me.\u201d <br>\r\nThe bathroom door opened up and Ron walked out, fresh out of the shower. \u201cAlright, kids, get to bed,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, I\u2019m an adult!\u201d I replied jokingly, putting my hands on my hips. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you keep thinking that, Shorty,\u201d Melissa said from the bed across from me.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re no bigger than I am!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI bet I could still beat you up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can beat both of you up, now go to bed,\u201d Ron said as he crawled into his bed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you two even think about doing anything just because you\u2019re sleeping on the same bed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would we do that? Jenny would kill us!\u201d Melissa joked.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ron; we\u2019ll sleep a pillow length\u2019s apart.\u201d<br>\r\nJenny picked me up and set me down on the bed next to Melissa as Ron turned off the lights. A few minutes later, both Ron and Jenny were snoring, fast asleep. It was too dark for me too see, so I whispered out to Melissa.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still awake?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered back. I stood up and crawled over to where she was laying and she sat up to look at me. \u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d she said quietly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if the serum doesn\u2019t work and we spend the rest of our lives like this? Or what if it only works on one of us? Then what do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not think about that. I\u2019m sure everything will be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but what if it does happen? How will I tell my mom and dad? I mean, our whole lives are before us, but what can we really do if we\u2019re stuck like this? I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to school, or college, or get a normal job. I\u2019d spend the rest of my life staring up and fearing for my safety, always second-guessing who I could trust or who would help me. I could never be independent and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI reached out my hands and cupped her face, stopping her in mid-sentence. Her face shone with the very little light that was in the room, showing her fear and nervousness. I stared into her eyes and she stared into mine. Our heads leaned forward and our lips met in a kiss. Oh, how I had wanted to do that for so long! To show Melissa the love and appreciation I had for her. I closed my eyes, focusing on the feel of her lips against mine. And then we parted, but a tingling feeling stayed with me.<br>\r\n\u201cSee, there\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d I told her. She nodded and I could still feel some anxiety in her. I drew her close and hugged her, stroking her soft hair. \u201cWhatever happens, it\u2019ll be alright\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n~Torch~</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d Dr. Kelly asked me. She was holding the syringe containing the light blue reverse liquid taken from Jenny\u2019s blood only a few hours before. I nodded, nervous of how this was going to go down. There was a large probe stuck to my bare chest that would deliver the electrical current to activate the serum. Melissa was in the room next to the one I was in, due to the fact that she had to take off her shirt for the probe. Once my procedure was complete, Dr. Kelly would go and do it to Melissa.<br>\r\nI was sitting in the middle of a hospital-type bed, my heart thumping in anticipation. I nodded my head to Dr. Kelly and lay down as she gently took my arm and proceeded to inject the serum. I closed my eyes and cringed as the needle entered my vein and the liquid was forced into my bloodstream. It was a small amount, but due to my size, it would be enough. Ron stood next to the bed, his arms crossed over his chest. He was just as nervous as I was.<br>\r\n\u201cIs this going to hurt?\u201d I asked as Kelly went to the machine that powered the probe.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she replied. \u201cMore than likely, yes. You might pass out from it, but it won\u2019t kill you. You\u2019ll probably experience what you felt when you first became like this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d I looked at Ron and he smiled at me. Kelly placed her finger on the button to initiate the shock and looked at me, waiting for my ok. I nodded once more, swallowing against my dry throat. She hit the button and the effect was immediate. Pain shot through my body and a thousand colors exploded in my vision. I arched my back and clenched my teeth, resisting the urge to yell out. Then my body went numb and my eyesight went black as I fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn...Johnnnnn\u2026\u2026\u2026JOHN!\u201d someone shouted my name. My head was pounding from a headache and I moaned in response. <br>\r\n\u201cFive more minutes\u2026.\u201d I mumbled. The headache had started to fade, leaving numbness in its place.<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes you lazy bum!\u201d <br>\r\nI obeyed the voice, opening my eyes and blinking them to clear my blurry vision. Jenny was standing over me, smiling and jumping down in excitement. For a moment I couldn\u2019t understand why she was so happy, and then I realized that she was no longer a giant.<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY S***!\u201d I yelled, sitting straight up, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. My head exploded in agony again and I held it, letting the pain fade away before looking at Jenny. She grabbed my arm and pulled me off the bed to my feet. Before I could even get over the initial shock, she had wrapped her arms around my waist and squeezed me in a bear hug. I hugged her back, laughing in joy. She was now a head shorter than I was, what she used to be before\u2026<br>\r\nOh, gosh this was awesome! Ron came over as Jenny let me go. He grabbed my arms and lifted me into the air like he used to do when I was a kid and then embraced me, laughing the whole time. My ribs felt like they cracked a little under his grip, but I didn\u2019t care. Ron stepped back, looking me in the eyes. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling! And then I remembered Melissa. I ran to the door, pointed at it and giving out a \u2018HA!\u2019 as I opened it and went to the room next to mine, just as the door opened and Melissa stepped out, also normal-sized. She ran to me and hugged me, and I kissed her over and over again. <br>\r\nDr. Kelly walked out of the room and I went up to her, shaking her hand. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!!!!\u201d I said. <br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026You\u2019re welcome,\u201d she replied, surprised, but happy. Oh, there was no way to describe how I felt! Freedom, that\u2019s what it was! I had gotten my life back! I guess there is such a thing as a happy ending\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA FEW WEEKS LATER\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to grab some lunch on Wednesday?\u201d Kendall asked me as we walked side by side from the rec. center to his house. All the people in the colony had been returned to normal and given back to their families, and now Kendall and I were able to hang out like we used to.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll buy,\u201d I replied. I looked at the snow covered trees and the tracks made on the powdered sidewalk by various people, very much aware that at one point in time I could fit in them. Kendall noticed what I was looking at and smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never look at anything the same ever again, huh? I know just how you feel.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just glad that nightmare is over.\u201d I suddenly stopped, staring at a house that we had started to pass. Kendall stopped when I did.<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You go on ahead and I\u2019ll catch up; I want to do something real quick.\u201d Kendall shrugged and continued walking. I waited until he rounded the corner before walking up to the front door of the house and ringing the doorbell. The door opened as Adrianna answered it. She was clearly wearing a wig over her burnt scalp. I could see the ugly scar underneath the fake hair that would keep her from ever having nice hair again. I smiled at her surprise and shock to see me.<br>\r\n\u201cHello, bitch,\u201d I said. She flushed in anger and opened her mouth to reply, but I never gave her the chance. I drew back my arm and slammed my fist into her temple. She crumpled like a sack of potatoes as she blacked out. I kicked her limp body back into her house and closed the door.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye, bitch,\u201d I said as I walked away. Kendall just looked at me curiously as I ran up to him. He didn\u2019t ask me anything; we just continued walking.<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026lunch on Wednesday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<b>THE END</b><br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I gripped the end of the syringe and pulled with all my might, but it was too late. Caesar pulled out the remote and activated it. The dart lit up and a surge of electricity ran through my body. I screamed at the pain as my vision went blurry and the world around me began to spin. My legs became jelly and I felt to the floor, writhing as I had the sensation that I was being pulled across the ground. I could hear Caesar laughing in the background. Finally, the agony subsided, and the explosion of colors in my vision began to fade. I opened my eyes and stared up and up and up into Caesar\u2019s gigantic form. He had shrunk me, just like he had done to John and Melissa. I rolled to my feet and ran as fast as I could, but I was puny compared to this new giant world. A massive hand grabbed my feet and I was lifted into the air, dangling upside down.  My heart was pounding in fear as I stared into Caesar\u2019s gigantic smirking face. I had never been so afraid in my life, and I realized just then what John had been experiencing the whole time. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, it looks like you\u2019ve gotten shorter since the last time I saw you, Ron,\u201d Caesar sneered. \u201cI would like to add you to my collection of people, but I really have no use for you, especially since I know you would rebel against me.\u201d <br>\r\nHis grip on my legs loosened and I found myself plummeting through the air. Luckily I turned and landed on my feet instead of my head, but the force of the impact sent sheer pain straight up my legs and into my torso. I crumbled to the ground, too disorientated to move as I felt the rumbling of footsteps in front of me. Caesar towered above me like a living skyscraper. He raised his foot above me and I was covered in its shadow. I tried to move, but my legs refused to respond. I was still too dazed to react. My old friend tilted his head to the side and smiled as he looked down at me, reveling in my helplessness.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ronald,\u201d he teased. \u201cI\u2019ll make this quick for old times sake.\u201d Then he brought his foot down. As the force that would end my life hit me, I thought about my nephew and Melissa. Their fate had been sealed. They would be Caesar\u2019s experiments for the rest of their lives.

The skull had been caved in and blood and brain juices were seeping out from the ruined carcass.<br>\r\n\u201cEewww! Gross!\u201d Becky said with a giggle.

Oh how I couldn\u2019t wait for this to be over. I walked over to the container and stuck the piece of gerbil food into the oil. It was thick and mildly unabsorbing. The piece began to swell in my hand. As it got bigger it became softer to hold onto. I pulled it out and it stuck of processed veggies and rotting meat, how could rodents eat something like this.

The minute she turned around I puked.  I hurled up everything the fan didn\u2019t take out and then the chewed up gerbil food. It tasted even worse the second time and by the time Adrianna had returned I had gone into dry heaves. She set the kid sized plate full of steaming hot pasta in the cage and then smiled, \u201cEnjoy, I am going to bed rat so eat quietly.\u201d Adrianna said as she walked over and flipped off the light. I felt my way towards the hot pasta and gorged myself. By the time I was done Adrianna was asleep and there was still enough pasta for breakfast, saying I made it through the night. <br>\r\nI awoke with a jolt. The cage bedding wasn\u2019t underneath me and the smell of rubber filled my nostrils. I tried my arms to push myself up to realize I had been tied by my arms to something. I opened my eyes and seen the \u2018Gold\u2019s Gym\u2019 logo under my back. Adrianna was sitting on the end of the treadmill cross legged. \u201cGood morning rat. Today\u2019s challenge is going to be exercise. You could say that I have been going up in the pounds most recently so you are going to help me run it off. I could have been mean and turned the treadmill on while you were still sleeping but I decided against it. So here is how it\u2019s going to go, I will start the treadmill and you will run in front of me, if you fall behind you risk being dragged or stepped on, so I suggest you run fast. By the way I weigh about 150 so you figure the rest.\u201d Adrianna said as she reached up and hit the start button. The track slowly began to turn under me and I watched Adrianna stand and then step on. She put her foot over me and I immediately began to run towards the front of the track. I reached the plastic piece at the end of the rubber track and was about ready to jump when Adrianna hit the speed up and the track forced me backwards. \u201cNo, NO little guy. Don't you think that you can get away that easy, you have to run with me.\u201d She said as she sped the track up and I began to run to avoid her footfalls. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to do this, I was mildly out of shape and I could feel the treadmill speeding up ever so slowly. I could hear Adrianna laughing as she kept running in behind me. \u201cCome on little guy don't want to get squashed under my feet.\u201d Adrianna said as she pushed the button to speed it up even faster. I began to lose ground and could feel Adrianna\u2019s feet getting closer. I turned my head over my shoulder to see the slack in my ropes behind me going under Adrianna\u2019s shoe. She saw this too and smiled as her foot came down and pulled me off my foot.  I screamed as I lost my balance and went flying at the wills of the rope. When I landed I was directly under Adrianna\u2019s foot. I turned to the left just in time to avoid being crushed. I was bouncing along the rubber, over and over again and I watched her footfalls get closer and closer to me. I tried to pull myself free but the ropes cutting into my wrist was just too tight. I screamed as my vision became the sole of her shoe. I tried to turn and get out of the way but it was too fast. Her shoe connected with my body and it pushed me down onto the treadmill. I could feel her coming down on top of me and like twigs I could feel things begin to pop out of place. Her weight shifted from the back to the front as I felt my arms be popped out of the socket. I heard a distant snapping sound and suddenly felt myself go launching backwards. Her foot lifted off of me and I launched off the treadmill. I landed on the soft carpet and she hit the stop on the treadmill. She turned and walked off the treadmill and path was straight for me. I tried to move but the pain in my limbs screamed against it. She walked up to me and then placed the dirty sole of her shoes on top of me. She stood there as my body tried to adjust to her weight when I heard her say; \u201cI wondered where john went?\u201d she pushed down on my body snapping one of my ribs and grinding my shoulders into the ground. \u201cMan this floor feels weird. I wonder what kind of BUG I am squishing.\u201d  She said as she rocked her heel back and forth before finally stepping off and leaving me on the ground. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She set me gently in the cage and I passed out almost immediately. When I awoke Adrianna was looking at me with a grin on her face and she waited for me to turn to her before she spilt the bad news.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while you were passed out because you couldn\u2019t handle me; I did some research. I searched your name and found that you uncle has put a bounty out for your safe return but so has another guy. His name is Caesar, no last name as far as I know but he wants you as well. He uploaded a picture of what you would look like four inches tall and he also said that you are worth millions and is willing to give that much to have you back. He said that you can take a lot over a period of time because the nanobots you have been injected with make a fast healing, so things that should take months to heal only take a matter of days. So what I have concluded from this is that I will return you to him, after Christmas break and tell your girlfriend unless she come up with 10 million dollars she can fuck off. How does that sound?\u201d<br>\r\nI sat up and realized that I didn\u2019t hurt at all. I looked down to see myself in just shorts.  I had ungodly looking bruises on my chest, legs, arms and neck. When I touched my hand to my chest it hurt but my ribs were just fine. Aw hell no I thought to myself as the name Caesar clicked in my mind. He was dad\u2019s old coworker. He helped the family find his riches and when we rose to power he took his share and ran. Caesar\u2019s share happened to be just over 20 billion dollars. My dad had never liked him, said he was to tainted, too selfish. It was one of the reasons of why he left the company. I knew the guy was insanely smart and that he was not too happy with us when he half left/ half quit because he was forced to but I never thought it would turn out like this. I looked up to Adrianna to see she had an evil grin on her face. It was the grin that matched the ones she had when she did something bad to me.<br>\r\n&lt;Adriana&gt;<br>\r\nI was overjoyed when I found out that John healed quickly. My mind filled with ideas of what I could do to him. I looked down at him as I let a maniacal grin form over my face. I looked outside to see it was snowing once again and that put out most of my ideas. I scanned my room for something that would help me out when it came to torturing him. I saw the Mushroom chair that sat in front of my computer and thought about how long he would last if placed there. My eyes also scanned over my track shoes, which I haven\u2019t used in almost a year but I could go to the fitness center. Oh the possibilities, all the bloody possibilities.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t like what my eyes saw as she scanned the room. She locked her eyes outside and shook her head. Then her head trailed to the general area of sports stuff which included running shoes that didn\u2019t look to comfy. Then she settled her vision on the mushroom chair in front of the computer. Whatever she was thinking of it meant hell for me, just as long as she didn\u2019t tie me to a fricken ceiling fan again.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\n\u201cOkay John, I think I am going to leave you alone for the day but come tomorrow be prepared for something brutal\u201d I said to him as I turned and walked out of the room. The thought of torturing him for two weeks filled me with joy, and now that he was able to repair himself I could go a lot harder on him. I walked downstairs and grabbed a bowl of cereal lost in thought of how I could hurt him.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI hoped Adrianna forgot about me for the rest of eternity. I wouldn\u2019t mind dying of starvation just as long as she didn\u2019t touch me again I would be fine. I thought about how Caesar had his flyer of almost ten million dollars for me. I always knew that there was somebody behind it but I never expected it to be him. I lay down slowly on my nest of cage stuffing. I closed my eyes and thought about Melissa and how she must feel about me being left with a homicidal bitch. I drifted off shortly after.<br>\r\n~Sebastian~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought of some of the most recent words out of her mouth terrified me.  The ideas ran through my head all night of what she had planned. Telling me that I had the day off was worse than her actually tormenting me. I hated this. I waited all day for something to happen, for Adrianna, or the devils spawn as I was beginning to think she was; to come into the room and swoop me from my cage and do something ungodly evil to me. It never happened. I waited most of the day and when her alarm clock read 10:35 I figured she wasn\u2019t coming home. I fell asleep with a smile on face, glad for once that I didn\u2019t have to lick my wounds. I fell asleep shortly after midnight worried that she was going to attack me in my sleep. At seven-thirty the next morning I heard Adrianna\u2019s alarm clock screaming into my ear. I rolled over and realized that she was standing right next to the cage and grinning at me. \u2018This can be good\u2019 I thought to myself. \u201cWell good morning sunshine. How was your day off?\u201d <br>\r\nI looked at her with hatred, horror, fear and just plain resent. \u201cAh the silence treatment from the little bug? Well I can fix that. In an hour my family and I are going ice-skating and you are coming with us. Not so silent now are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I go ice skating? I am four inches tall you dumb ass.\u201d I yelled and She smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might say that. You will be skating with me, if you don\u2019t understand I will demonstrate.\u201d Adrianna said as she picked up a doll and dropped it in her boot and proceeded to put the boot on. \u201cdo you understand now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cyou cant do that. I am a human being!\u201d I shouted.\u201cCorrection, you are a small human being, or a bug in this case and bugs are meant to be squashed. So what do you say bug?\u201d she asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026\u201d I stammered but Adrianna cut me off as she lifted me out of the cage and into her purse.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a rhetorical question you dumb ass.\u201d Adrianna said before she dropped me into her purse and zipped it shut.<br>\r\nI slammed into a lipstick tube and then looked around.  I knew of how this could end, any possibility that fluttered into my mind was gruesome or disturbing. I hated Adrianna and couldn\u2019t wait for this day to be over.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\nI leaped with joy when my mom called my name and told me it was time to go. I had thought of the plan, even though I had no intentions of telling John of where he was going to be skating with me, but I figured he would figure it out eventually. I walked causally down the stairs mostly to hide my excitement of what was going to happen but I also didn\u2019t want John to die from the things in my purse. I thought of what he might look like afterwards, his tiny body smashed with the organs spilling out the side, or him totally mashed to paste. I wanted to tell him so bad what was going to happen but I decided not to tell him until we get to the rink, you know just build the excitement.  My mom shouted one more time for me to go and I yelled back, \u201ccoming mom, these boots are hard to walk in so just chill.\u201d  I knew this would be the best day of my life, and the last day for John. \u2018How am I going to tell Melissa?\u2019 the thought crossed my mind as I got into the car. \u201cI will worry about that later,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cwhat was that hun?\u201d my mom asked. \u201cNothing,\u201d I smiled and looked out the window as she backed out of the driveway and we started off towards The Rink.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt; I felt the car roll to the stop and Adrianna\u2019s little let out a excited shriek. Adrianna got out slowly and was walking carefully. I heard her mom telling her to hurry up but she didn\u2019t go any faster. She was blaming the boots but I had my other ideas. I didn\u2019t know what she had planned but she didn\u2019t want to hurt me. Maybe she turned over a new leaf and vowed that she wouldn\u2019t hurt me anymore.  I heard the squeaky door to \u2018The Rink\u2019 open. It was what the people who ran the place called it. the place was deathly silent as their family walked in and I thought of how weird it was. I remembered the time  and realized that they had privately rented the place for some event because \u2018The Rink\u2019 never opened before noon during the winter. This was bad. I wondered what event it was when I heard the guy ask Adrianna what size and kind. Adrianna replied, \u201cFigure skates, and size 10.\u201d Whatever she had planned my life was about to turn into a living hell.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;\u201cWell John, if you haven\u2019t figured it out, today is my birthday. And for my birthday I chose to go ice-skating. When I spent the night at Tracie\u2019s house I told her about you and she gave me this idea. Go ice-skating and put you in the skate. So here we are and I hope it doesn\u2019t smell to bad. But the smell should be the least of your worries.\u201d I told John as I took him out of my purse and dangled above the skate. I watched him squirm at the thought and then looked at and opened his mouth to speak. \u201cno objections bug.\u201d I told him as I dropped him into the skate. I remembered the bet Tracie had made me that he couldn\u2019t last more than ten minutes. If he did I won, if he didn\u2019t she won. I bet her 200 dollars that he would survive ten minutes at least and Tracie said he couldn\u2019t last a second more than five. I was so looking forward to winning this.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nThe sole of the ice skate was hard and most definitely worn. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to this. I felt the skate be set on the ground and I knew what would be coming next.  The skate was shuffled around again as I studied the pattern of the insole and realized that I was screwed. The area towards the heel was dark brown with wear and the middle had an arch where the wear  wasn\u2019t too bad. I shuffled towards the middle of the ice skate when the light was cut off from the outside world. I knew that I wouldn\u2019t last long. I stopped and laid flat as Adrianna slid her foot into the skate. Her sock reeked of sweat and boot as it passed over me. The smell from the skate and her sock alone made me gag.  When her foot reached the end of the skate I felt her touch the skate to the ground and the pressure was just barely bearable. I knew that if she wanted me to live that she wouldn\u2019t be skating long. I pushed on her foot as if to tell her to let me out but she just stopped her foot to the ground.  \u201cAdrianna, don't stop your skates you\u2019ll bend the blades\u201d her mom nagged. \u201cI thought I felt a bug in my skate. Its okay if there is one it will be dead soon anyways.\u201d My heart sunk as she responded. I could hear her mom laughing at me as Adrianna stood up. She put her full weight on me as she took her first step and I felt the air get forced out of me. when she stepped on the other skate I sucked in a breath of foul air and realized that I may never breathe fresh air again. Her foot slammed into me a second time and I locked my arms above my chest to try and stop some of the pressure. My wrists snapped like twigs and I hoped that she would make it quick but I knew with her nothing would ever be quick.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\nI stopped just outside the rink and set my watch. I looked down at the stopwatch part and smiled as I clicked the go button. Tracie said that she would give me the money if he the watch read even a second over ten minutes. I looked up about ready to press go when Tracie walked up behind me and poked me in the sides. I shrieked and jumped before turning around and greeting her. \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked.\u201cMaking sure you don't cheat. At ten minutes you take the skate off, if he is still alive I give you the two hundred and we call it even. Deal?\u201d Tracie snickered as she pushed onto the ice. \u201cDeal\u201d I said, as I felt John squirm. I felt two cracks already and was worried that he might not make it to the ten minutes and I would have to pay out. I stepped onto the ice and John wiggled inside the skate. I started to laugh as he unknowingly tickled me. I would miss him, if I was Melissa.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt; I heard the sound of Tracie\u2019s voice followed by the torturing slam as she scared Adrianna. I knew this wasn\u2019t good. With Adrianna standing on me it was like having a building parked on my chest.  I realized that i couldn\u2019t breathe while she was standing there. The weight on me was incredible. I felt her every twitch as stood in place and kept her balance on the sharp blades. The flexing of her foot side to side felt like a steam roller slowly moving back and forth. My arms had this burning sensation going through them but I was lucky they weren\u2019t bleeding. I felt her step on the ice and I knew that this was officially when hell began. She pushed off and her foot slammed into my chest as she raised her other foot. My body groaned against the weight she was putting on me as she took off for stride two. My lungs ached as for I haven\u2019t taken a breath in almost two minutes. When the pressure let off I sucked in a breath before her foot slammed the ice skate into the ice. I prayed to God that he would take me early so I wouldn\u2019t have to live through the whole ordeal.  <br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;I checked the clock to realize that I had been skating for almost nine minutes. I did a jump in the air and landed hard on my right foot when I felt the first crack. I laughed out loud as Johns struggles increased and  I slammed my right foot down as I turned around and pushed off towards the other end. I knew I would win this bet, john wouldn\u2019t, but I most definitely would. I checked the clock and skated over to the penalty box as it rolled to ten minutes. I stopped and slowly undid the skate. I pulled my sock out and was shocked to see John still at the bottom of the skate. Tracie slid over and looked inside the skate. \u201cwell that would be ten, Congrats bug for winning Adrianna $200.\u201d Tracie said as she handed Adrianna $100  in twenties. \u201c you get the rest when he\u2019s dead.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She put the skate back on the ground and tilted it back so my body slid down towards the heel section. I opened my mouth to yell at her only to have it filled with her sock. I could see barely see the light around her foot as she settled into the skate and begun to redo the laces. Her heel rested on top of my abdomen.  She stood and I felt my pelvis pop out of place immediately. She took one step out of the penalty box and I knew I wouldn\u2019t last much longer. Adrianna pushed off and the wind was knocked out of me as she slid sideways and slammed the skate into the wall. She took off sliding and my legs snapped under the intense pressure. She knew what she was doing; I could hear the laughter in the far off distance as another bone broke in my lower body. I felt her stop and the load being put on me increased significantly. \u201cLook mom I am standing on one skate\u201d Adrianna shouted as I tasted blood in my mouth.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\nI knew that he wouldn\u2019t last much after the ten minutes; I could feel his bones groaning under the ball of my foot as it grinded him into the skate. It was exciting. I took off again, with my right foot I pushed against the wall and I felt something warm squirt out from under my foot he didn\u2019t have much time left.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nWhen she pushed off I felt everything I had eaten the night before get squished out of my stomach and onto the bottom of her foot.  I shifted so that her heel was on top of my chest and I knew the next time she stepped down she was going to shatter some of my ribs. My nostrils burned from the vomit and my head hurt from the bottom of her foot pummeling it. I felt her stride and my ribs gave with a ghostly crack. I could feel the blood running from the wounds at my side. For some reason I was still alive. I hoped that I could leave this freezing hell sole and be with my family soon. I felt Adrianna\u2019s foot slam down and shatter my pelvis before hitting my shattered rib cage. I felt the blood spatter my face as my heart exploded from the pressure and then all went black.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\nI felt John\u2019s leg crack and break as I pushed off against the wall. I knew that it wouldn\u2019t be much longer since he was under the heel instead of the middle of the foot where he should have stayed. I pushed myself harder to get more speed and I felt a series of cracks as I glided on my right foot. The warm liquid was beginning to pool around my foot and I knew that he didn\u2019t have much longer when I jumped into the air and landed with a hard thud. The squelch sound it made me almost lose my breakfast and I felt multiple sharp edges cut through my sock and into my foot. It was at this point I skated across the rink and then exited before taking slowly untying the skate and pulling my foot out. My sock was bloody due to John and me.  Tracie walked over slowly and looked inside the skate. \u201cHere\u2019s the money, congrats on the kill and you should probably have somebody take a look at your foot. I hate it when they have defective skates.\u201d I smiled as I limped over to the skate rentals and explained my foot. They told me to throw the scrapes in the trash and as I tossed the skate into the trash receptacle I couldn\u2019t help but thinking to myself, I wonder what it was like to be crushed in such a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** Authors Note**<br>\r\nI didn't intend on having two ending chapters but for the hell of it here is the second half. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nMy stomach was empty. I was hoping that Adrianna would turn the fan off. My sides hurt from puking, my legs hurt from being tied to the fan and I knew that sooner or later the rope was going to come free. I wondered what could happen with my life, if this was how it was going to be, wake up every day to be tortured by her and then pass out from all the damage she causes me. I began to pray, the first time since I started this ordeal. I prayed for my safety and that I could see my family soon, and I prayed for Adrianna and that she would shut the fan off so I could rest for the day. I tried to focus on something but the room was spinning past so fast that it was a colored blur. I closed my eyes as I felt the urge to hurl once again. I thought about screaming out for her to stop but couldn\u2019t find the voice to do so. I thought about even if she heard me it wouldn\u2019t make a difference due to the noise of the fan that it would some inaudible jumble of syllables. I thought could see the outlines of the blurs change in the room and I knew Adrianna was going for the remote because I heard her cussing about where it was.  She pushed the button for the remote and then the inevitable happened. I heard a small sonic boom as the rope snapped and I felt free from my spinning death trap as I hurtled across the room. <br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt; <br>\r\nI watched John go round and round and it was quite entertaining. When it first started out I could see his facial expressions and I knew he was going to puke before anything else could happen. I pushed the button for the next speed and then watched him turn into a blur. It was not even a minute later that I saw the shower of upchuck come from the fan. I spoke to him to tell him he won when the little guy threw up and I got a ring of it onto my shirt. I thought about yelling at him and punishing him even more but then I realized what I would do in a situation like this. I thought about it long and hard and then remembered that I had agreed to let him off after he threw up. I looked at my bed to try and see where I left the remote and realized I had lost it. I began to search my room swearing as I went because I knew he was probably going through hell at the expense of my enjoyment.  I continued to search until I found it on my computer desk. I pushed the button and then heard a snap and my heart sank.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nIt was an experience of a lifetime. I mean how often do you get to fly through the air and not have to worry about anything as soon as you hit the wall. I thought about doing a superman pose as I flew through the air. I decided against it as I braced for impact against the surface I was going to hit. It looked like a pillow pushed up against the wall but I hoped to myself that it was just the wall. I curled into a ball just as I struck the surface, I heard a sickening crack and then all went black.<br>\r\n&lt;Adrianna&gt;<br>\r\n I watched John hit the pillow with a look of horror on my face. How would I tell Melissa I killed her boyfriend, would I go to jail for it? These thoughts ran through my head as I grabbed a flashlight off the table and slowly walked over to my bed to see if he was alright. I was scared of what I would find as I turned the light on and crawled onto the bed. I swept the light over the pillow and saw John lying on the bed sheet. He looked unconscious but seemingly okay and I prayed to myself he was still alive.<br>\r\n&lt;John&gt;<br>\r\nI opened my eyes slowly and saw a bright light, as my eyes adjusted my mouth gaped open at what I saw.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked me up and dropped me in the box. \u201cNow don\u2019t you go anywhere!\u201d she giggled as she closed the lid. I groaned and leaned against the side of the cardboard box. Why had I ever been friends with Marie? I heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Great, I thought. Here she comes to torture me some more. The box rattled as someone grabbed it and opened the lid, but it wasn\u2019t Marie; it was her younger sister, Kayla. Oh, boy.<br>\r\n\u201cCool!\u201d she said when she saw me. She snatched my up and held me tightly in her fist. \u201cYou\u2019re so tiny!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKayla! You need to take me back to my house, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I\u2019m taking you with me to my friend\u2019s house!\u201d With that, she shoved me in the pink bag that she had been carrying and began skipping down the hall, causing me to tumble round and round in the bag like some ghetto amusement park ride. My stomach felt like it was fusing together with my liver from the force. I couldn\u2019t decide what was worse: being stuck with Kayla or being stuck with Marie. Oh, the joy.<br>\r\nI heard the booming sound of a car door being slammed. Then everything stopped moving. We must have been in her mom\u2019s car. I could feel the engine rumbling through that blasted bag. I called out, hoping that her mom would hear me, but the radio was blasting country music. I hated country music. I conceded and sat down, hanging onto the side of the bag to keep from being tossed around at every pothole. Finally, the car stopped. We must have arrived. This would be my last chance to get out of the bag. I stood up and crawled to the top of the bag, using a zipper on the inside to hoist myself up. I was just about to get out when Kayla picked up the bag. I nearly lost my grip but I hung on, almost out. Kayla got out of the car and I got a look at where we were at. It must have been on the other side of town. Nothing was familiar and the houses were more rundown. A creek ran past the house where we were at. <br>\r\nMy stomach lurched as Kayla began spinning round and round. Why do little girls do such things? I hung on to the bag for dear life, but I was not strong enough. My grip slipped and I was flung through the air. It was a whirlwind of color as I spun around. It seemed as though I was flying for an eternity, then a harsh cold woke my senses. I crashed into the creek, submerging into the cool water. I frantically kicked my legs, trying to get some air. I broke through the surface, floating with the current. I spotted a milk carton not far from me. I dogpaddled to it and pulled myself onto it. My body shivered from the cold water as I lay there on the slick plastic. What amazing luck that I had. <br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How did my life come to this? It couldn\u2019t possibly get worse! I\u2019m four inches tall, lost in a place far from home and floating on an empty milk carton in the middle of a cold creek! How would I ever get back home? There was no way that I could contact Ron or Melissa. If I leave the carton, I could very well freeze and drown. Not that it mattered anyway; I\u2019m lucky that I survived this long. I can\u2019t trust anyone! Not even my best friend Marie! What else was there to lose?<br>\r\nI shivered in the frigid air. It was cold and was probably going to snow again soon. It didn\u2019t help that I had fallen into the water. My body was rapidly succumbing to the effects of hypothermia. I wouldn\u2019t survive long out here. What would happen to my body? Would I slip into the water and float down to its depths, never to been seen by mankind again? Would I float along with this carton, possibly being noticed by a random passerby? Would I be frozen in an ice chunk, perfectly preserved until the spring thaw came? What did it matter; I was so insignificant anyway. <br>\r\nThe first white flake fell from the sky, landing on my hair like a crystal crown before melting away and drizzling its cold water down into my eyes. Soon it was followed by a torrent of snow, falling down in large, fluffy chunks. They caused little ripples in the water as they landed in the creek that slowly pulled me onward with its gentle current. Suddenly, the carton shifted violently and started to move swiftly backward. I gripped the lid for dear life, hoping that I wouldn\u2019t fall in. I turned my head back and forth as far as I dared to try and see what was happening, but my grip was already weak as it was; I didn\u2019t want to slip. Something warm grabbed my shirt and tore me from my hold on the carton. I felt the brief wave of cold air fly past me before I was enveloped in something soft and dark. The cloth covered my entire body and heated up my cold limbs. I was being rubbed back and forth in the warm cloth, nearly suffocating me. Finally, I saw light and I scrambled for it, clawing my way over the earthquake of moving fabric. I placed my hand on what I thought was stable ground (or fabric for that matter), but the cloth gave way and I found myself falling through the cold air. My fingers scrapped against the cloth and I somehow got a grip, breaking my fall but wrenching my shoulder out of place. My grip slipped and I hit the ground which turned out to be pavement. When I opened my eyes, I saw the shadow of a person standing over me. They began to bend down and I raced to my feet, running in the opposite direction. I spotted what might have been the underside of a dumpster. I dove underneath it before the person could grab me, bending slightly to keep from hitting my head on the metal underside. When I had made it nearly all the way to the back, I turned around.<br>\r\nA face appeared, that of a teenage boy not much younger than me. He had a curious look on his face as he peered at me. His eyes were a bright blue and he had light brown hair. His cheeks were dotted with freckles that made them look almost rosy. I stood there, shaking all over, mostly from the cold but fear had a big part in it. I had no idea what this boy had in mind for me. His face was on its side and I could only see about three inches of it because of the space in between the dumpster and the ground. He couldn\u2019t reach me from where I was at which set my mind a little more at ease. But what choice did I have? If I didn\u2019t go to him, hypothermia would take over and I would surely die. I was already becoming drowsy which was not a good sign. How do I get into messes like this?<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just stared at him, not sure on what to do. \u201cI want to help you,\u201d the boy continued. \u201cI can take you back to where you live. I\u2019ve been there a few times before. I know the way.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026how do I know that I can trust you?\u201d I asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t exactly had very pleasant experiences with strangers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you stay here, you\u2019ll die. It\u2019s already starting to snow pretty heavily. And I pulled you out of the creek and dried you off. That\u2019s got to count for something.\u201d<br>\r\nI gulped, knowing that I had no choice. I had to trust Daniel; it was my only chance of getting back home. My legs felt like lead weights as I forced my frozen limbs to move forward. I could no longer feel my fingers or toes. I just hoped that I wouldn\u2019t lose them from frostbite. Daniel reached out his hand underneath the dumpster and grabbed me when I got close enough. I ducked my head onto his thumb to avoid bumping my head as he drew me out. I was immediately pelted by large white flakes of snow. The weather was quickly turning into a blizzard. Daniel opened up his coat and lowered me into one of the inside pockets. I was encased in darkness, but the heat radiating from his body felt oh so wonderful. It wasn\u2019t long before I was shivering again; I shook as the numbness in my extremities faded and I gained back my sense of feeling. I could feel the muscles beneath Daniel\u2019s shirt moving as he walked. I had no idea where he was going, but I hoped that he wasn\u2019t going to try and walk all the way to my house in this weather. Something about him told me that he didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. <br>\r\nDaniel stopped moving and I heard the faint click and squeak of a door opening and closing. I was jostled around a bit as Daniel seemed to bend down and move. The coat opened up and a hand descended upon me, wrapping around my body and lifting me out of my warm compartment. I couldn\u2019t see where I was, but when everything stopped moving, I saw that Daniel had placed me on an old mattress that looked tattered and worn. I peered around, realizing that we were in a vehicle, probably an old van. The insides were rusted and the windows and sides were packed with insulation and cardboard. The back seats had been removed to make room for the bed and the only front seat left was the driver\u2019s seat. I didn\u2019t know why; there wasn\u2019t even a steering wheel. Daniel was sitting across from me on the mattress. It was then that I noticed that his clothes were tattered and dirty.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re homeless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\nDaniel nodded. \u201cMy parents died in a fire when I was about 8 years old. I\u2019ve been living on the streets ever since. What about you? How did you get so small and how did you wind up out here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Someone did this to me and tried to do it to the rest of my family, but my parents and my sister died from it. I can\u2019t trust anyone anymore, not even my best friend. It\u2019s her fault that I\u2019m out here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your family. That must be really tough on you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I still have my Uncle Ronald at least, and my girlfriend Melissa. They\u2019ve been taking care of me, but I got separated from them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. As soon as the snow lets up, I\u2019ll give your family a call. I know a place that has a phone for public use not too far from here. But for now you can stay here. It\u2019s cold but I have plenty of blankets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI really appreciate that, Daniel. You saved my life; thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI always liked the Smithson family. Your dad donated a lot of money to the homeless shelter that I go to for food. I suppose that I can help his son out,\u201d Daniel said with a smile.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a good thing that Daniel let me stay with him. I was covered in a tent of thick wool blankets. It was cold in the van, but I was plenty warm. Daniel was still sleeping, curled up in his coat and a blanket. He began to stir and he opened his eyes, looking down at me with a smile.<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d I tried crawling out of the blankets but I yelped in pain when I tried using my arm. It was terribly sore from when I pulled it out of place.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to your arm?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI wrenched it out of the socket yesterday. It hurts like heck.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me fix it.\u201d <br>\r\nDaniel reached over and grabbed my shoulder between his index finger and his thumb, using his other hand to hold my body steady. With a twist and a loud pop, he put my shoulder back in place. I rotated my arm, amazed at what he had done. It still hurt, but not as much.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to do that?\u201d<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \u201cI had a friend awhile back who showed me how to do that. It comes in handy every now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d<br>\r\nHe leaned back, accidentally bumping what looked like an old radio. The radio came to life, spitting static. It grated on my ears but then it turned to a male voice speaking. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is a public announcement: John Smithson, the famous billionaire, has gone missing. He has light brown hair and brown eyes, is 5\u201910\u201d and is roughly 180 lbs. He was last seen at his home two days ago. If anyone has any information on his whereabouts, a $500,000 reward is being offered. Please contact his family at\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThey rattled off the number to my house, leaving me in total shock. Ron and Melissa were desperate to find me. It made me feel good inside.<br>\r\n\u201c$500,000! That\u2019s half a million dollars!\u201d Daniel exclaimed. \u201cYou could buy your way through college with that kind of money!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Ron must have had to pull a lot of strings to get that money.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why they left out the information on your\u2026well\u2026small problem.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d I said dryly. Daniel just chuckled. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, it could be worse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it could be, but everything that could have possibly gone wrong has so I\u2019m not too optimistic anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still alive, aren\u2019t you? Isn\u2019t that all that really matters?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere are worse things than death.\u201d Daniel just looked down in silence.<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI looked up at him, a giant compared to me. I was at his complete mercy, yet he treated me with kindness. I made me feel like a human again.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s ok. The past is the past. We can\u2019t dwell in it forever. We have a whole future ahead of us.\u201d He shifted to his knees, turning around and looking out one of the windows of the van. \u201cIt looks like the snow has stopped falling.

He yelled at him for hours, not even allowing him to go to the hospital to get his bite wounds from Marco treated. We had searched the front and back yards over and over again, trying to find John, but he wasn\u2019t there. In a last ditch effort, Ron had sent out that public announcement for any information on John. Now I was pacing back and forth in front of the home phone, hoping and waiting for it to ring. I had cried myself to sleep the last two nights. John was somewhere out there, and to make matters worse, it was blizzarding. We had no idea how to find him; he was just too small.<br>\r\nRon came up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright, Melissa. We\u2019ll find him somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hope that you\u2019re right, Ron.

I don\u2019t want to lose him, too.\u201d<br>\r\nJust then, the phone rang.

Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon pulled up beside an old shop where a young boy in a tattered coat was standing in front. The boy waved to us as we got out and we quickly made our way over to him.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Daniel?\u201d Ron asked the boy.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. It\u2019s an honor to meet you. I have John with me.\u201d Daniel opened up his coat and reached into his pocket, pulling out John. John was covered in bruises and small cuts and his clothes were torn in several places, but he was healthy and he was alive. I reached out my hands and took him in them, drawing John close to me. John gripped my fingers tightly. I could tell that he was happy to be back with us.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Daniel,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with us for lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. I couldn\u2019t accept that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Daniel,\u201d John said. \u201cWe insist.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I appreciate it, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nWe all piled into Ron\u2019s car, me sitting in front holding John in my lap and Daniel in the back seat. John told us everything that had happened to him as we drove home. I swear I\u2019m going to kill Marie. She\u2019s a b****. We got back to the house and Daniel ate lunch with us. Ron asked him a little about himself. Daniel was really shy, but he was very nice. I liked him and I was glad that he found John and not someone else. When lunch was over, Ron handed Daniel the $500,000 check. Daniel tried to refuse it, but we made him take it. Ron drove him back to his home, leaving me alone with John and the servants.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I watched her hurry into the two story house before glancing back at me at me and closing the door. I waited patiently for her return as I pondered on how I felt and what I would do with the rest of my life. I enough money to tour the world a thousand times over, I wanted to continue on with high school because I know it would have made my mom proud. My dad had always expected me to take over the family enterprise but I had other ideas with my life. That was all up until Monday of this week. I looked back towards my girlfriend\u2019s house as I watched the door open and Melissa come running down the cement trail and up to the limousine.  I pushed open the door and let her in, she passed over me once again but this time I felt the rain come off of her poncho and hit my warm face.  She sat down on the seat next to me and pulled off the poncho. She pulled an umbrella from the backpack style bag and set it on the seat. \u201cFor future use\u201d she told me. It just now that I had noticed that the snow had gone back to rain. I knew it was common for this to happen, just before we got slammed by one of the biggest storms of our winter season, and I thought to myself, its only November. The drive was silent as we weaved slowly through traffic. We were stuck at another Minneapolis stoplight when Melissa\u2019s Cellphone began to buzz. She looked at me and then back to the device in her hand before answering it. \u201cHello,\u201d her soft voice sounded through the car. \u201cYes, okay, we can do that; love you to mom\u201d Melissa said as she flipped the phone closed. \u201cDo you mind if we stop by the mall, I have got to get some things that my mom forgot to pack?\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cSure,\u201d I said, my voice sadder than I had intended.

The rain was soaking the suit I had been wearing, even thought it had begun to dry off right after the funeral. I looked around the car filled parking lot as we slowly walked towards the mall entrance. I begin to feel nauseous again as my vision began to swim. Melissa had ran ahead in order to get out of the rain; I went to call out to her, to tell her that I needed help but then all went black. <br>\r\n\tI woke with a startle. I began to cough and opened my eyes.  I felt like I had been ran over by something, the nauseous had faded and the pounding headache that I woke up with was now gone. I looked to the cloudy sky to see rain falling. I though to myself it wasn\u2019t raining as hard but then something slammed into me. It felt like somebody had dumped a five gallon pale of water over my head and I was instantly drenched. I began thinking to myself, what the hell, and then it happened again. I yelled in frustration at whoever was throwing the pales of water from the sky. I began running across the parking lot as these \u2018pales of water\u2019 pelted me from all directions. I suddenly heard an ear grating sound. It sounded as if somebody was shooting up the parking lot. I dived to the ground with my hands over my head yelling \u201cplease don\u2019t kill me, please don\u2019t kill me.\u201d The sound reached a deafening volume and then it faded as I felt as if a tidal wave of water washed over me. I held my breath, and when I slammed back into the ground I breathed in. I began coughing as I looked to what had stopped my flight with water. It looked like one of those amusement park rides, but it didn\u2019t have the hydraulics or anything on it. My mind finally clicked. The thing that was standing before me was a giant shopping cart. I thought to myself what kind of sick joke is this?  And then that\u2019s when it hit me.  It was at that moment I knew what had happened. It was like the scene out of the Animorph\u2019s books that I had read as I child. I thought to myself that this couldn\u2019t be happening. I knew that my current size had changed, that I wasn\u2019t full height anymore, I knew for the lack of better words; I had shrunk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought of how intimating the object was as I stood there and gaped at it. I wondered to myself what an average human would look like at this height. My senses kicked back in as the adrenaline wore off. I realized that the temperature outside was freezing and instinctively I began to shiver. My world turned dark as something blocked out the light.  I thought to myself that this was it and I prayed silently to myself that the lord would take me swiftly.  I looked to the heavens to expect a shoe or a boot heading towards me about ready to crush the life out of me, but instead I saw the hand of god. It had this angelic halo around it that I assumed the halo came from the lights in the parking lot. The hand grabbed onto the cart and my world went back into full speed. I jumped onto the bottom of the cart and couldn\u2019t wait until I was back inside, outside of this hateful Minnesota weather.  The cart bounced and rattled as it moved slowly through the parking lot. It was at this moment in time that I really got a feel of my current size. I saw the pant legs of the angelic hand and could only figure that I was about ankle height. I stood on unsteady feet and I could barely touch the bottom of the basket. I knew that it was this moment in time that I was four inches tall, or short. <br>\r\n\tI waited for the smooth concrete of the sidewalk as the cart threatened to shake me to pieces. I suddenly felt weightlessness as the cart slammed into the concrete barrier of the sidewalk. I hung on to the car for dear life until I was slammed back into planet earth.  I almost lost my grip which would have resulted in certain death. The cart continued forward and I felt a familiar rattling of a bad wheel, I heard some course words from the person in the panted legs with the angelic hand. The cart lurched forwards suddenly and then veered onto its side before going fully over as it slammed into the wall of the Calhoun Mall.  I slammed into the unforgiving concrete and felt something crack in my lower back. I stood to my surprise to find that it had not been broken just put out of place. I had a moment of self-victory and then I remembered my current situation and also the fact I had no one to celebrate my little victory against the shopping world. I hunched my shoulders slightly but then I heard the automatic whoosh of the doors open and I felt the radiating heat come out of the building. I was now thankful for the Angelic Hands outburst as I quickly dashed for the door. I made it inside just as the door began to close and that is when I heard a familiar voice. I looked up from my position of my hands on my knees to see Melissa striding to the door with a phone to one ear and an earbud to another. I had always hatred the way my girlfriend tuned out the world, mostly because she never heard you when you talked on the phone, but she never heard anything around her either. I tried to scream but due to the lack of being physically fit, I was still out of breath and my scream sounded like an aired out whistle. I watched the automatic door open and debated whether to follow or not due to the fact I had spent almost twenty minutes of getting inside. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sat there, rigid and cold, staring out the window as we drove along the street covered in a fresh powder of snow. I took his hand in mine, trying to offer some comfort, but he didn\u2019t respond to my touch. After a few seconds, however, he slowly curled his cold fingers around mine and squeezed my hand. I looked up at him and smiled, but he had not moved his head or body. He still stared blankly at the houses as we drove by. I couldn't blame him; he had lost nearly everything. To an extent I knew that he blamed himself for what had happened, but who could have known that we would all get sick with that disease?<br>\r\n I had been with his family on the trip to the Amazon, and I remember coming home, just glowing and reminiscing about the vacation, but then I got the headache. It wasn\u2019t bad at first, but it got worse and worse. I remember talking to John and how he complained that his head hurt, too, and so did the rest of his family. Within a few hours, they were all in the ICU. I was lucky; the disease didn\u2019t affect me as bad, but I was so afraid that I would lose John. When John called me and said his parents and his little sister had passed away, I wept, but deep inside I think a part of me was thankful that it was them and not John. Now as I sat there, staring at my boyfriend, I realized the cruelty of being a survivor. John would never forgive himself for the death of his family. He would always be questioning why and what he could have done to stop it from ever happening, but I knew he was grateful that at least I didn\u2019t die, too. <br>\r\nI was going to do whatever I could for John. I loved him and to see him in this kind of pain, it broke my heart into a million pieces. For now, there was nothing I could really do, but be there with him.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun began to set below the hazy, gray clouds, casting a red glow tinted gold against the sky. The driver of the car stopped in front of John\u2019s house and we stepped out into the cold, frigid, November air. Snowflakes gently fell upon us as we walked up the steps and John unlocked the door to his house. I brushed the white powder off of my coat before stepping into the warm entryway of the home. John took off his coat and hung it on the coat rack next to the door. I did the same and followed him into the kitchen where the cook had prepared a meal for us. It was one of John\u2019s favorites: Italian angel hair pasta covered in a cheesy, tomato sauce with garlic bread on the side. We sat down at the table, but John barely touched his food. Again, he sat there staring blankly, taking a bite of the pasta here and there. I could just imagine the cold blanket of grief that was engulfing his mind right now, but he seemed a little better than from the funeral. When dinner was over, Herald, John\u2019s favorite butler, came and cleared the table. John pulled Herald aside and talked to him. \u201cWill you tell the other workers that they can have tomorrow off?\u201d John asked. \u201cI want to have some alone time with Melissa so we can go through the house. Just for one day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Master John,\u201d Herald replied. \u201cI will make sure it\u2019s taken care of.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Herald.\u201d<br>\r\nJohn walked up to me and smiled. I could still see the sadness in his eyes, but he was definitely getting better. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure it\u2019s ok with your parents that you stay here for awhile?\u201d he asked me.<br>\r\nI nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well you can sleep wherever you want. Do you need to go to your house and pick up anything?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I have everything I need already. I\u2019ll just sleep in your little sister\u2019s room.\u201d John flinched when I said that, but he nodded in response.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go to bed early,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cGood, you need your rest. I\u2019ll probably go to bed soon then, too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, good night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood night.\u201d I leaned over and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He gave a genuine smile before turning around and walking up the stairs to his room. I grabbed my bag from in front of the door with all my stuff in it and followed John up the stairs. His door was already closed with only a little crack open. I could hear his deep breathing as he slept and I realized that he probably hadn\u2019t even changed before crashing. With a smile I turned and opened the door to Jenny\u2019s old room, or John\u2019s little sister. A dark mass immediately jumped on me, knocking me to the ground. A wet substance bombarded my face as I struggled to get the object off of me.<br>\r\n\u201cMarco! Get off me you stupid dog!\u201d I hissed. I pushed the black Labrador off of my chest and sat up, wiping the slobber from my face. They must have locked him in Jenny\u2019s room. He was her dog after all. I pushed the dog away with my foot and picked up my bag from the floor, walking back into the room. Jenny\u2019s room was a pale blue with butterflies painted on the wall and posters of puppies and kittens hanging over her bed and dresser. Her bed was piled with a variety of stuffed animals, concealing the SpongeBob mattress cover she had. Unlike my room at home, Jenny had always kept hers nice and organized. There were no clothes on the floor and no garbage littering the carpet. Her dresser had all her makeup in one part, her hair stuff in another, and all her jewelry was in the jewelry box. All her shoes were in her closet except for a pair of slippers by her bed. <br>\r\nIt was so eerie to see everything in the exact place that Jenny had left them. It was almost like she was coming back, but she wasn\u2019t. I shook the disturbing thought from my mind and dropped my bag on the floor near the foot of the bed. Before I could change and get ready for bed, Marco decided to sneak his way into the room and try to convince me to play with him. I grabbed the dog by the collar and dragged him out of the room and into John\u2019s parents\u2019 room, closing the door. That took care of that. But as I turned back to Jenny\u2019s room, a wave of nausea suddenly hit me. I stopped, clutching my stomach as pain welled up in my abdomen. I expected it to go away, but it didn\u2019t. Instead, it spread to my legs and chest until my whole body was in pain. I fell to my knees, groaning at the pain, but somehow unable to cry out for help. My vision blurred into a thousand colors and then went black. I didn\u2019t feel myself hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull throb in my head as I finally came to. I was lying on something extremely soft, but I didn\u2019t open my eyes. I let the headache I had fade away as I tried to remember what had happened. Why had I passed out? It had come totally unexpectedly. Slowly, I pushed myself up into a sitting position and I looked down at what I was lying on. It looked like long white stalks of grass had been twisted together to form little tubes, but as I looked closer I saw that it was more of a type of fabric made up of thin, wiry strands of silver-white thread. I stood up, still looking at the ground and my feet sunk into the strange, soft substance so that it came up to halfway up my calf. Confusion whirled around in my brain. What was this stuff? And then I looked up.<br>\r\nOh. My. Gosh\u2026<br>\r\nAbove me was the towering wall of fabric with jellyfish and flowers against a blue backdrop. I recognized it as the mattress cover of the bed. Even higher above that was the pale blue ceiling of Jenny\u2019s room, but it seemed like a mile away. My heart thumped violently as I slowly turned around, looking at the rest of my surroundings. There were Jenny\u2019s slippers, the size of a semi trailer each. Her dresser was a football field\u2019s length away with its drawers rising into the air like a mountain. The soft substance I was standing on was the carpet in Jenny\u2019s room. Everything around me had somehow grown to become immensely huge, and then the realization hit me. Nothing had grown; I had shrunk.<br>\r\nI sucked in a breath and tried to keep myself from panicking. Oh, gosh, how did this happen? It must have been something to do with what caused me to pass out. I had to think. What was I going to do? I had to get John\u2019s help, but how? I couldn't be more than four inches tall, judging from the size of the slippers over there. But I had to make a decision.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My feet sunk deep into the field of carpet, giving me the sensation of walking through sand. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around what I was experiencing. I mean, honestly, how is this even possible?! I guess I couldn\u2019t focus on that now; I needed to get John\u2019s help. <br>\r\nThank God that the door was open. Even better yet, the hallway floor was polished wood instead of carpet. The carpet felt nice to lie on, but was hard walking through. As I stepped onto the wood floor I took off into a run. The floor that usually creaked under my weight no longer made a sound, and my now tiny footfalls were muffled and faint. John\u2019s room was right down the hall, about ten feet away, but to me, it seemed like miles. I stopped running a fourth of the way through, frustrated with myself for not keeping in shape like I used to be. The rest of the way I jogged or walked. When I reached John\u2019s room, I was relieved to see that his door was open, too, but only about half an inch. With my body turned, I tried to squeeze through the crack, but I wasn\u2019t skinny enough. Great, just my luck. I grabbed the side of the door and pulled with all my strength, but I just wasn\u2019t strong enough. Then I heard a rumbling noise that I recognized as the furnace of the house kicking in. The warm air started blowing from the vent across the hall and I could hear the vent in John\u2019s room start emitting air, just enough to force the door a little more open. Surprised at my change in circumstances, I squeezed through the now bigger crack and found myself staring up at the green walls of John\u2019s bedroom. At the far end of his room to my left was a TV stand that held John\u2019s X-box 360 and PS3. Above the game systems was his 52\u2019 flat screen TV hanging on the wall in such a position that allowed him to play videos games or watch movies while lying on his bed. His dresser was to the right of me in the corner of his room next to his bed which stretched out in the center of the area with the headboard against the wall. A poster of John\u2019s favorite football team hung over his headboard along with a shelf containing some of his valuables. In the far right corner of his room, John had a desk he used for homework and a place to set his laptop. <br>\r\nAll of this I took in with a sharp breath, trying to contrast the difference that everything now was compared to me. Everything in this room I had seen a hundred times, touched a hundred times, and now they were a hundred times bigger. It made me feel insignificant. I could hear John\u2019s breathing as he slept, but I couldn\u2019t see him. He was probably wrapped deep within his covers like he usually was. And then the realization hit me: how was I supposed to wake him up? John had been known to sleep through his alarm clock going off at full volume without waking up for twenty minutes. He definitely wouldn\u2019t hear me if I tried to call his name. But what if I managed to crawl onto the bed? Maybe I could wake him then. But what could I even do then? Tap him on the forehead? John didn\u2019t even wake up when someone was shaking him. Maybe it would just be better if I waited until morning to try and contact him.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, I probably wasn\u2019t strong enough to climb his bed or dresser anyway. And even if I did wake him, I would probably feel horrible about it. This was more than likely the first night in awhile that he actually seemed to be sleeping well. Making up my mind, I walked to his bed, thankful that John\u2019s servants always kept the house clean so underneath his mattress it wasn\u2019t dirty or dusty, just a few boxes stashed underneath. I spotted one of his socks lying about a foot away. John never left dirty clothes on the floor so I figured it must be clean. I walked over to the article of cloth and picked it up, surprised at how heavy it was as I dragged it across the floor with me under the bed. Maybe that was because it was a thick wool sock, lucky for me to keep me warm. I slipped into the footwear and curled myself up in the fabric like a sleeping bag. John\u2019s deep steady breaths above me quieted my fears and I faded off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creak of the bed drew me out of my slumber. John was moving around, and by the looks of it, I had slept until late in the morning, which was quite strange of me, but I had been tired. As soon as I heard John move, I scrambled out of my makeshift sleeping bag and peered out from under the bed. I was not prepared for what happened next.<br>\r\nA bare foot, over twice as long as I was tall slammed down in front of me, shaking the ground. I could see every wrinkle, every hair on the foot in detail I had never been able to notice before. But that was not what took my breath away. A second foot landed next to the first and I watched in awe as John\u2019s heel muscle contracted and stretched as he stood up from the bed. My neck craned backwards as I looked up and up into the face of my boyfriend. Again I could see every detail. I could see the sleep encrusting his eyes as he fought the drowsiness of slumber. His hair was a mess, sticking out in every direction possible. One of his cheeks was smushed in, probably because it had been the one he had been sleeping on. His expression was that of a normal teenager who just got out of bed: grumpy and disorientated. <br>\r\nBut what was most impressive was when he moved. He brought his hand up to his face and scratched his head with fingers that could effortlessly crush me. He yawned, showing teeth that could split me in two and a maw that could swallow me whole. As he stretched out his arms, I watched his biceps and triceps flex, aware of the fact that those muscles were each bigger than I was. He cranked his neck to the side and I heard it crack like the sound of a whip. He took a step forward and I became conscious that I was shaking. This giant, this living monolith of a person was my boyfriend. Only a short while ago I could look him in the eye without hurting my neck, but now I probably couldn\u2019t even reach his ankle. <br>\r\nJohn bent over and picked up something off the floor. I recognized it as one of his wool socks, but then I saw that he was looking around in confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d my other sock go?\u201d he mumbled. He reached his hand for the bed, straight towards me. In that instant I probably would have been better off if I hadn\u2019t moved, but fear took over me and my body reacted purely on instinct. I ran. And I heard John jump back with a yelp.<br>\r\nThe dresser had only been a foot away, so I dove underneath it, cautiously looking out. But John had seen me and the look on his face was not what I had expected it to be; he was looking down at the crack between the carpet and the underside of the dresser with disgust.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! There\u2019s a stupid mouse in my room!\u201d he exclaimed and my blood turned to ice. I looked down at the clothes I was wearing (thank God they had shrunk with me) and was horrified to see that I was wearing a gray sweatshirt, the one I wore right before I changed and went to bed. No wonder he mistook me for a mouse. <br>\r\nI scrambled away from the edge of the dresser as John kneeled down and stuck his face sideways so that he could see. I opened my mouth to speak, but all that came out was a whimper of fear, which did no good to me at all. John leaned back with a sigh of frustration and then I saw his hand reach out and grab something from under his bed. He pushed a box to the edge of the dresser to my right, blocking off any chance for me to escape under his bed, and he was holding something else in his hand: a bat. It was too thick to fit under the dresser, but the very sight of it sent chills up my spine. He intended to use it on me. <br>\r\nThen John did something that I hadn\u2019t expected him to do: he walked out of his room. Cautiously, I crawled to the edge of the dresser again and looked out, and then I heard it: the jingling. With a scream I dove further under the dresser just as Marco bounded into the room and started pawing at the dresser, barking and wining. John must have set him loose.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Marco!\u201d John yelled. \u201cDrive the rat out so I can bash it!\u201d<br>\r\nOh, please, no! I crawled back as far as I could before hitting the wall, watching as those giant, clawed appendages tried to grab me. Terror like nothing I had ever felt before gripped me and I shook uncontrollably. My boyfriend was out to kill me!<br>\r\n\u201cCome ON you stupid dog! Flush the thing out!\u201d John said. I was screaming now, but either I wasn\u2019t loud enough or Marco\u2019s whimpers were drowning them out; John didn\u2019t hear me. And then I felt something at my back. John had stuck a meter stick under the dresser and was pushing me with it, straight towards Marco. \u201cNO! NOO!\u201d I screamed as those deadly paws got closer. I was sobbing now, desperately pushing against the stick to get away, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough and there wasn\u2019t enough room for me to climb over or underneath it. <br>\r\n\u201cCome on, boy! Get the rat!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, please! No!\u201d I wrapped my arms over my head, waited for those claws to pierce me, for those canines to slice me through, but then I stopped moving and I heard one word out of John\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa?\u201d He had practically whispered it, but there was no mistaking that he had said my name. I uncovered my head to look at him and see his face go from flushed with frustration to ghostly white. In an instant he stood up and grabbed Marco by the collar, dragging the wining dog out of the room and slamming the door shut. Marco barked a few times in protest, but John ignored him. He quickly got down on his belly with speed that startled me. He was looking straight at me and I was even more scared, more intimidated. He opened his mouth to speak, but then closed it again. Horror was written all over his face and I knew that he knew what he had nearly just done.<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, forgive me, I am so sorry, Melissa!\u201d he moaned. \u201cPlease, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\nI just nodded, not able to make myself speak. I stared into his big eyes, worry emanating from them in massive amounts. Slowly, very slowly, he began to move his hand under the dresser. I watched it, my heart pounding in my chest out of fear. As it neared me I backed away and John stopped. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Melissa. It\u2019s ok; I will never ever ever ever ever hurt you. I promise.\u201d A feeling rose up inside me when he said those words. Anger. He had nearly killed me! But no, that wasn\u2019t his fault; he didn\u2019t know. Marco probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt me anyways; the dog was just trying to play. The anger inside me faded away, and truly I don\u2019t think I was even fully angry at him in the first place, just more relieved. <br>\r\nI crawled towards his hand and placed my palm on his palm. It was warm to the touch and the soft beating of his heart through his veins calmed me enough so that I pulled myself all the way onto his hand. \u201cWatch your head,\u201d he whispered and curled his fingers over me. I ducked down against his skin as his hand began to move and suddenly I was being lifted into the air as John sat up and carried me up to his face. I looked into his eyes and gulped, knowing one of us would have to speak first.<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was looking me over with a mixture of shock and confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d I stuttered, still a little shaken. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d I stared at his massive face, willing to keep myself from breaking down into tears. John must have noticed; he was always good at seeing things like that.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. We\u2019ll get this figured out, ok?\u201d he said softly. I nodded my head and smiled a little to show my gratitude. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I passed out last night and woke up on the floor like\u2026this,\u201d I said, gesturing to my diminished height. John scratched his head with his free hand, something he unconsciously did when he was thinking. <br>\r\n\u201cI bet my uncle could help. He could set up a project in the company to reverse this or something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do until then?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have to tell your mom.\u201d<br>\r\nFear rose up inside me. I didn\u2019t want to think what my mom would say if she saw me like this. \u201cCould we please not?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa, we have to tell your mom. She\u2019ll find out eventually and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be happy if we don\u2019t tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026this is bad enough as it is.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright, Melissa. I promise.\u201d I looked up into John\u2019s eyes and saw the fierce determination in them that John got when he was going to do something difficult. It was a look that meant he would do whatever it took to complete the task.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to change into some real clothes and then I\u2019ll take you to your house, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\nHe gently set me down on his bed and grabbed some clothes from his dresser. With a quick glance at me, he opened the door, pushed Marco out of the way, and closed it, leaving me alone in the room. I wrapped my arms around my knees and buried my head in my hands. Why was I so afraid? John would never purposely hurt me and neither would my mom. Was it just that fact that they no longer seemed completely human to me? Or was it the fact that I no longer seemed to be completely human? I was so small I had fit in John\u2019s palm! The world out there was huge now compared to me. I could easily get lost in its vastness and no one would ever find me.<br>\r\nThe door opened again, pulling me back from my swirling thoughts. John entered the room, fully dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and holding Marco by the collar. The dog was desperately trying to get to the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid dog!\u201d John growled. \u201cStay out in the hallway!\u201d He forced Marco back into the hallway with his foot and closed the door to keep the dog out. John turned around and knelt by the bed, lying his hand palm up next to me. I crawled onto it and he slowly lifted me up and carefully set me down in the chest pocket of his shirt. I kneeled down in the fabric, looking out over the edge to the floor far below. <br>\r\n\u201cYou ok there?\u201d John asked, looking down at me. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I replied while looking back up at him. His heartbeat was strong and steady through the fabric of the shirt and it made me feel safe. John opened the door once more and Marco immediately bonded into the room to the bed. When he saw that I wasn\u2019t there, he looked around in confusion before turning to look at John, but John had exited the room and shut the door behind him, trapping Marco inside.<br>\r\n\u201cStupid dog,\u201d John muttered as Marco\u2019s muffled barks came from the room. I giggled at the comment. John walked down the stairs of his house and grabbed his coat from the coat rack before slipping on his boots and pulling out his car keys. He put on his coat and carefully zipped it up, mindful to keep enough room open for me to breathe and enough covering me to keep me warm. As soon as he opened the front door, the cold hit me. I shivered and huddled low in the pocket as John drew his coat closer to his body. Every step that John took I could feel; his muscles relaxed and contracted beneath me, reminding me of how much power he had compared to me. Soon, I felt him bend down to get into his car and I heard the shutting of a car door. His keys jingled as he started the engine of his mustang and turned the heater on high. John unzipped his coat so I could see again and I watched as his arms stretched out on either side of me to grip the steering wheel. A few minutes after we were on the road, John began to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cWho would do this?\u201d he asked aloud. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. I mean, how is this even possible?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Who has something against me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not someone with something against you; maybe it\u2019s someone with something against me.\u201d<br>\r\nI looked up at him to see his vision cloud over in a blank stare.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked him, a little concerned.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no I\u2019m not,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFirst my family and now you. If I ever find out who did this\u2026\u201d He gripped the steering wheel tightly before taking a deep breath and relaxing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that this isn\u2019t fair. Not to you, not to me, not to anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that your uncle can help me?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. If anyone can help it would be Ron. He was my dad\u2019s best friend after all. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d We spent the rest of the time in silence. I don\u2019t think John knew what to say. That\u2019s ok, I didn\u2019t either. We pulled up to the shabby apartments where I lived and John stepped out of the car. He made his way towards the front steps of the building when someone called out to him.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you!\u201d John turned around to see five thugs walking towards us, clearly members of a gang. I lived near the shady side of town, but we didn\u2019t usually get gangsters around the area. Usually. Today of all days!<br>\r\nThe five quickly approached us, blocking off John\u2019s path to the apartment and his car. I felt his muscles tense underneath me as he prepared for a confrontation. The leader of the group stepped forward with a smug smile on his face. I crouched down in the pocket, barely looking over the top.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just give us your wallet and we\u2019ll leave you on your way,\u201d the lead thug said.<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance,\u201d John replied. The smile on the leader\u2019s face quickly disappeared and he gave a curt nod to his buddies. The other gangsters began closing in. This didn\u2019t look good\u2026<br>\r\n~Torch~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
