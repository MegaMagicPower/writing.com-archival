You would love to find one but you don't know if they would ever be into your stink fetish or if they ever found out they would want to get a way from you or not. Only hope is to fine that girl that would be into you no matter what, but you feel as the would be impossible to fine nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to walk in the streets you step on a piece of paper, as you look at your feet picking it up and having a look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Stink Hotel. The Best place to cover your stink fetish needs where you get to meet your favourite game and anime characters and get to full fill your fetish and pleasures that you have always wanted.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looks very interesting to you as it was just what you have always wanted, and now you can do it with your favourite characters from video games and anime it just got better. As there is no need to go and find it as you look up and see this massive hotel that is well over 1000 feet tall, as you can see the name on it is called \"Stink Hotel\" which is where you hope to head to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the door, as you do it looks like as if the doors opened on their, own as you walk you see to ladies standing there wearing maid outfits, as they lean towards you planting their lips on both of your kisses giving you a small peck, before stand up straight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadies: Welcome to Stink Hotel enjoy your stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at both at them, blushing a tiny bit from their kiss as you nod at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nod back allowing you to continue to walk to the a counter as you see another girl behind it. This one happens to wear a nurse costume. As you go to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Too late for halloween isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying as a joke, the girl in the nurse costume gives out a cute giggle before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse: No. Every employee here are girls and we like to dress up in cosplay so thats why you might be seeing me as a nurse, I know it looks bad on me but I thought it looked cute on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: And it does, it doesn't look bad at all. It looks great on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say making the nurse blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse: Umm.... Thank you... Anyways, welcome to Stink Hotel where you to full fill your stink fetishes and pleasures, sign here and go to the elevator over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying pointing opposite to her, as you look that way and see a elevator, then looks back at the Nurse. Nodding at her getting a pen and writing your name down. As you give her a smile, in which she does back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk away from the counter, and head to the elevator it automatically opens it up allowing you to walk it as it closes. You see to your right another girl, this one is wearing a catgirl costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Cute costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Catgirl blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl: Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying as she lifts her butt leaning towards your direction and then relaxes her butt into her previous, leaving you wondering what she was hoping to accomplish. But then a stench hits you, it becomes stronger and worst, getting a strong smell of rotten eggs. You look over to the cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl: Was it good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that making you blush, as you nod saying yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl: Well good, always good to fine someone liking my farts. But unfortunately most people that come here are only here for the characters from the games and anime and don't care about my stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Well I kinda enjoyed it, to be honest I wish I could smell more it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl: Really?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to blush more making your face more red, seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl: Well.... in this elevator you get to choose to go into your favourite game or anime and get to meet your favourite characters.. But if you want maybe I could full fill your fetishes for you instead. What do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying as she shows you the choices of anime and games as well as her floor which would lead into her room.</span></div></div>",

Naruto puts on his sandals, and puts them in front of you, expecting you to jump on them, and you don't disappoint by jumping on his foot, getting a hard on already from the smell.

Naruto stealthily puts his hand next to you, and you realize that he's helping you get closer to Konohamaru's ass.

It seems as if the cat girl knew where what time specifically you wanted to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff around the air and notice something. It seems as though you're right under someone staying still. It's odd how you never noticed, but you just now noticed how stinky and wonderful the smell is. You look up and see a pair of shorts covered by a red dress, the clothes Sakura wears all Pre-Shippuden, though something is odd. You see Sakura farting every so often, even though you had never seen her fart in the series before, so you assume this universe is specifically made for you to enjoy yourself. You quickly run onto Sakura's blue sandals while also comparing your height to hers. It seems as though you shrunk to about 4 inches tall, the height of an average middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Sakura had not taken being a Ninja serious yet, her senses weren't strong enough to sense you yet, which is a great boon for you. You could experience Sakura's smells and then move on to the next girl without her being any the wiser. You then hear the bell ring but stay on her shoe, knowing that anyone, even Sakura, would feel something your size crawling on her bare leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: You stay on Sakura's shoe the entire day, without anyone noticing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: You can't resist temptation, and climb up her chair leg to smell her farts that you smelled earlier, but closer to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: You fall off her foot, and take the chance to move onto another boy or girl (Please, no Iruka, Mizuki Etc, older females are fine though.</span></div></div>",

Sakura, being the teachers pet is the first one in line, prompting you to get stomped on by a bunch of random people, though being stepped on doesn't hurt in the slightest. After everyone steps over you, you stand up, feeling not uncomfortable at all, despite the grooves of the ninja sandals. Knowing this is great news, because now you can be more risky without fearing being squashed like a grape under an elephant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the class and, as is obvious you see a bunch of the Canon characters as kids. There's Hinata, Ino, Sakura, and even all of the guys. You decide that you will only go after girls for now and, considering there's 3 of them you have options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think in your head about the pros and cons of each one. With Sakura, she goes home to a family with no ninja training, meaning you can easily sneak around her house with no one finding you. The con is that there's no one else at Sakura's house, no one attractive you can switch too once you get bored of Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ino, her family is a ninja family, which will be much more likely to catch you, which is a big con. Another con is that there's not many girls to switch to, should you want to. The big pro, however is that Ino is hot, even as a pre-teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with Hinata, she's really nice, so even if you get caught by her, she wouldn't torture you or anything. Continuing from that last statement, the likelyhood of Hinata catching you is nearly 100%, considering she has the Byakugan unlocked, which gives 360 degree vision while also able to see Chakra. You don't know if you have Chakra or not, but you probably do. A pro is that Hinata also has a little sister, Hanabi that has cute little feet you could smell if you want variety in your life, although you aren't sure if Hanabi is as nice as her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Sakura, stay true to the original<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Ino, the sassy clan heiress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Hinata, the shy and kind Hyuuga Heiress</span></div></div>",
