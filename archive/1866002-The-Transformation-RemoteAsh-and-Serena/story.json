What he saw however, wasn't quite what he expected. Out of the ends of his fingerless gloves, he saw that his once coarse fingers had been replaced by much more feminine, well manicured fingers with painted nails. Freaking out, he began to check the rest of his body. He found that his arms were now devoid of hair and much thinner and that there were now two mounds sticking out of the front of his jacket blocking his view of the rest of his body. Leaning forward to look at the rest of his body, his vision became blocked by long, honey blonde hair. Suddenly realising what had happened, Ash looked over to where Serena had been standing and nearly burst out laughing. Where she had been standing was now his old body, but still dressed in her own clothes which seemed to have been resized to fit his body. His old body was now dressed in Serena's tight black top with slight bumps in the chest where her bra was sticking out. It was also wearing her short red skirt allowing Ash to see his old hairy legs. Serena's shoes and knee high socks were also resized for Ash's much larger feet and her hat was on his head. He also assumed that since he was still wearing his own underwear, his old body was now wearing Serena's panties, most likely changed slightly to accommodate his penis. Deciding to see how Serena will react to the changes, he made his way over to her and asked if she noticed anything different.</span></div></div>",

After seeing what it could do first hand, he had grown curious as to just how much he could change with it. While he found his new body to be different from what he was used to, he was beginning to actually enjoy being Serena! His new body was much much more feminine and slim, but it had it's perks. He loved how it felt whenever his long hair brushed against his neck and the feeling of having breasts on his chest was certainly enjoyable as he found out when he brushed his hand against them earlier on. The one major issue he had was the lack of support he had for them as the bra he should be wearing was now on his old body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that he would try to swap his clothes, if not just his underwear, with Serena, he took aim at her with the device and pressed another button that he assumed would switch their clothes and proceeded to shoot himself with the same button...</span></div></div>",

Let's let our Pok\u00e9mon out as well!\"  Serena said grabbing for his poke balls.  Ash went to where she remembered Serena keeping hers, but only found two Pokemon for some reason.  Sending them out sent out Pancham, and Fennekin.  Looking over Ash saw her Pokemon, Pikachu, Fletchinder, Frogadier, Hawlucha, and Goomy surrounding Serena.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I commend you and all on winning four badges with just those two Pok\u00e9mon, but don't you think you should expand your team if you plan to win the Kalos league?\"  Serena asked her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not quite knowing what to expect from the remote, Ash closed his eyes and hoped for the best. He felt the usual flash of energy and as he opened his eyes he could see Serena was now dressed in his own clothes, rather than looking ridiculous in her old outfit. He looked down at himself and could clearly see he was wearing Serena's black top, her red skirt as well as her shoes and socks. As he looked down he could feel his new hat shift on his head, making it clear that had changed too. Although it couldn't be seen, Ash could feel his breasts being well supported by his new bra, which was black lace, matching his new panties. While the newfound support from his bra was appreciated, the panties he was wearing felt strange and restrictive, almost uncomfortable, as if they weren't the right size. He shook those feelings off however, thinking it was just because he had never worn them before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was getting late, the pair returned to their campsite where Clemont and Bonnie were making their dinner. On the walk back, Ash had to constantly readjust his panties, without making it obvious to Serena hat something was wrong. He secretly loved how oblivious she was to their situation, which caused him to feel slightly aroused, though he tried to clear his thoughts before he got carried away. Not thinking anything of it as he grew up with a penis, Ash could feel his member growing erect in his panties, straining them further. As he wasn't focused on it however, the fact that he had his own genitals on Serena's body was lost on him for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the camp, Ash helped set up the table for their meal. Every now and then he would try to catch Clemont's attention to tell him about the remote, but he was too distracted. He also unintentionally bent over too much while serving out the Pokemon food, flashing Serena with a glimpse of his panties, and as she formerly had a crush on him, this had carried over with the reality changes, so she was now technically attracted to and in love with her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dinner finished the group made their way to their tents to change. Despite his new body, Ash and Clemont still shared a tent. The pair continued to chat as Ash stripped to just his new bra and panties, with Clemont not thinking anything of the half naked girl in front of him. Ash then pulled on his new pink pyjamas, when he realised he needed to urinate. Sliding out of the tent, Ash made his way into the forest where he pulled down his pink shorts and black lace panties, where he proceeded to squat, knowing how different his anatomy was to a girls. Realising this was his best chance at having alone time, Ash also pulled off his pink hoodie, leaving himself in just his bra. He then began messaging his breasts, finding the pleasure from them to be like nothing he had felt before, eliciting moans of pleasure in his new, sexy voice. As he continued pleasuring himself, his other soft, delicate hand ventured down across his slender, curvy body and between his legs, where it was met with a hard, phallic object. His eyes shot open as he realised what was going on, he recoiled in horror as he stumbled to his feet, his panties halfway down his legs and his shorts and hoodie strewn across the ground. He slowly came to realise that the entire day his discomfort was caused by his own penis still being attached firmly between his legs, meaning Serena must still have her vagina on his body. There was something that just felt wrong about having a penis right now, but looking down at himself caused Ash to grin slightly. Here he was, in the body of one of the most beautiful and feminine girls he knows, with a large, erect penis in between his legs. Somehow this thought turned him on more, as the sweet, innocent little Serena was now adorned with this manly object, something only Ash knew was wrong, but felt so right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill highly aroused, Ash began to ponder what to do next as he stared down past his juicy breasts to the sight of his own hard penis.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smirking to himself, Ash realised that seeing his lithe, petite body with his own erect penis attached was turning him on much more than he ever thought it could. With his new dainty hands, he firmly grasped his appendage, the smooth skin on his hands feeling foreign, but pleasant, much different to his own hands. He then began to masturbate like he never had before, rubbing his dick while massaging his breasts with his free hand, eliciting feminine moans of pleasure, turning him on further. He then started running his hands through his soft, flowing, honey blonde hair, pulling on it softly which gave him a twinge of oddly erotic pain, eliciting a gasp of pain along with a moan or pleasure.  \"Oh Ash, yes Ash yes. Keep going, I'm almost there\" he said to himself, the sound of Serena's voice mixed with the moans pushed him over the edge, as he unleashed his load, spraying all throughout the clearing. Coming down from his high, Ash slumped against a tree, with his appendage softening as he panted from the exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering somewhat, Ash straightened out his hair as he collected his discarded clothing, pulling his tight, black lace panties back up his legs as he readjusted his matching bra. Looking down at himself, he could clearly see his penis bulging out the front of panties, so he readjusted his penis, hoping to relieve some of the discomfort he had been feeling. He then pulled back on Serena's pink pyjamas, and made his was back to the camp. Climbing into his tent, he found that Clemont was still up and reading, so he climbed into his sleeping bag, where he had also stored the remote. As Ash lay there, he considered letting Clemont in on the remote, thinking that if he had someone to talk to about it he might have more fun. He also found that his penis was still being restricted quite badly by his tight panties, causing him to fidget and consider making more changes to himself and Serena in the morning...</span></div></div>",

Clemont?\" Ash said, a little nervous. \"What's up Ash?\" Clemont asked, confused by how nervous Ash was. \"Well you probably won't believe me, but I found this remote out in the forest earlier\" Ash said as he produced the remote from his sleeping bag \"and I was wondering if you'd like to take a look at it. Somehow it's able to alter reality without anyone noticing other than the user, when I tried it earlier I accidentally switched bodies with Serena, then another button gave me her clothes\" He said, blushing slightly at how ridiculous he sounded. \"Ash you're sounding ridiculous right now, you've always looked like that, though if what you're saying is true, I wouldn't be able to tell if you did look different...\" Clemont trailed off as he started pondering the possibilities. \"Here look I'll show you\" Ash said, climbing out of his sleeping bag as he shuffled over to Clemont \"Hold onto this and press one of the buttons, just point it at me and something will change\" \"Alright just to see if you're not crazy I'll try, but if it doesn't work I'm going to sleep\" Clemont said as he looked over the remote. Choosing one at random, Clemont clicked a button as the pair were inveloped in light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing their eyes, Ash had to stifle a giggle. In front of him, Clemont was looking the same as before, but the clothes he was wearing had changed. He was now dressed head to toe in Serena's pyjamas, looking ridiculous in her pink shorts, pink hoodie as well as the bow in his hair. Ash meanwhile was dressed in Clemont's nightcap and night shirt, which had been resized to fit his slender form. \"Ash what the heck is going on? Why am I in your pyjamas? No offence but I really don't like wearing them, these shorts are so tight and revealing, and how do you wear these underwear? I don't need a bra for goodness sake, and how do you deal with these panties? It feels like my penis is being crushed!\" Clemont said as he unzipped his hoodie, trying to remove the bra which was hanging empty against his chest. \"I told you, they're not mine, they're Serena's\" Ash giggled at Clemont \"And besides, with these boobs the bra is needed, and the panties, well they're not great, but you've got to admit the lace feels great, it's constantly making me hard\" Ash said, massaging his breasts. Clemont blushed slightly, but Ash could see that his shorts were starting to tent up, clearly the lace was getting to him to. \"Well... Okay you may have a point, but can we change back? This is too weird\" \"Alright fine, just grab the remote\" he replied, as the pair once again switched outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" Clemont sighed as he looked over his outfit. \"Well you've proved your point, the remote works, now what are you going to do with it? I'd love to look at the technology used to create it, but I can tell you're not ready to give it up\" \"You're not wrong\" Ash replied, happy to be back in his, err, Serena's clothes with a bra again, the feeling of lace already starting to turn him on. \"I was thinking we could play around with it tomorrow, I'm pretty happy with this body, but I'm sure there's other functions on the remote to test out\" nodding, Clemont agreed and the two went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ash and Clemont woke up and began planning what to do with the remote. Removing his pyjamas and underwear, Ash changed into a fresh set of underwear, another black lace pair, this time with boycut panties, and a frilly bra. Putting on the rest of Serena's travelling outfit, he fixed his hair when he noticed Clemont looking at him while blushing. \"What's up Clemont?\" Ash asked as he placed his hat on his head. \"Well it's just... It might sound a little weird... And you can say no, but I was wondering if I could... Maybe... Wear a pair of panties again? It's weird I know, but after wearing them last night and-\" but Ash cut him off \"It's okay, I know how you feel, of course you can, but they'll be smaller since they're resized for my-I mean Serena's body\" Ash said, pulling out a pink pair of panties from Serena's bag, which was nearly sheer lace, with a ribbon on the front. \"Uhmm... Thanks... Ash... I'll just\" Clemont muttered as he grabbed the panties off Ash, removing his pyjamas and pulling them up his legs. Ash looked a way out of decency, but glanced back to see a large bulge protruding from Clemont's crotch, which he quickly adjusted for comfort. He then dressed in his jumpsuit, and the pair continued outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Serena and Bonnie already setting out the table, the boys began preparing the meal, while discussing what to do with the remote. \"Well we've got two people to switch with here, what more do we need?\" Ash muttered to Clemont. \"You've got someone to switch with, but the other option is Bonnie! I'm not going to switch with my sister Ash!\" \"Why not? It'll give us something to do until we get to town\" Ash argued. \"Sure, but that'd be so weird! We're related, plus she's like, half our age\" \"Oh come on, just try it, being someone else is fun\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief period of arguing, the pair decided that Clemont would at least briefly try being Bonnie. While the girls were looking away, the pair grabbed hold of the remote and fired at Bonnie and then at Clemont. After a brief flash of light, the pair could see that the person helping Serena set the table now looked exactly like Clemont, though still dressed in Bonnies outfit, with her brown top, white skirt and black shorts. Ash had to hold in a laugh at the sight, while Clemont was blushing madly. \"Ash this is too much, I can't stand being in this body\" Clemont whispered. \"It's too weird, this is my sister for goodness sake\" \"Alright alright we'll switch you back\" Ash said, though when aiming the remote, Ash jokingly pressed the button which gave him Serena's outfit and his own genitals. When the light died down, Ash could see that Clemont was now dressed in Bonnies outfit too, though because the panties Ash gave to him were not his own, they remained on his body. Ash could also see a rather large bulge pushing forward in Clemont's new shorts, which seemed very out of place on his small body. \"Ash! What did you do?!? This is worse than before and I've still got my... Well, this!\" Clemont angrily whispered, gesturing towards his bulging penis. \"Relax already, I pressed the wrong button by mistake, we can fix it n-\" but before Ash could finish, Bonnie rushed over to the pair. \"Mmm that smells really good, will we start eating now?\" Bonnie asked, as she grabbed the food and brought it to the table. Ash looked at Clemont and shrugged, knowing there was nothing to do for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout their breakfast, Clemont was fidgeting constantly, looking clearly uncomfortable in his young body, trying his best to hide the erection being caused by Serena's panties but unfortunately the white skirt he was wearing mixed with the tight shorts the little to disguise it. Ash meanwhile could hardly hold back his laughter, finding the whole situation to be hilarious. \"I hear there's a gym leader meetup in the next town to celebrate the final round of the showcases. So not only will all of our friends be there, but so will the leaders!\" Serena explained as they ate. Through all of this Ash's eyes lit up as he realised the potential targets, there was going to be so many people for him to choose from, he could mix and match from anyone he wanted! The group finished their meal and Clemont instantly caught Ash to switch him back. Looking him over, Ash could see that Clemont was really struggling, with his new hormones it looked like he was about to cry. The sight of the bulging mass in the tight shorts made Ash realise how desperate Clemont was, clearly he was being turned on by the situation, but it was his sisters body. If he were to do anything it would be creepy, and his new young hands would be tiny in comparison to Clemont's appendage. \"Alright Clemont we'll change you back, or we could switch? That way you've still got a new body\" Ash could see Clemont pondering the notion but he quickly shook his head \"No Ash I'd really rather just keep Bonnie out of this, it's too weird, especially with this\" He said as he grabbed his penis, causing him to blush as he realised what he had just done, removing his hand quickly after. \"Just put me back in my body with my clothes\" The pair then took hold of the remote once more, as Ash pressed the same buttons, returning Clemont to normal. \"Thanks Ash, it's good to be back in my body. Also, I'm sure we're both thinking the same thing, but I can't wait to see everyone tomorrow, so many options to choose from\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing their supplies up, the group began on their way to Lumiose City where they would soon meet up with a number of their friends and potential targets of the remote.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On their trip to Lumiose City, Ash and Clemont spent most of their time investigating the remote and its capabilities. Using one of Clemonts inventions, they were able to work out what the functions of most of the buttons were, as well as their limitations. Over the course of the day, Ash had become a lot more comfortable with his new body, though he had begun to think about who he would swap with the next day. Clemont has a few ideas too, though he was most interested in seeing the remote in action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, the group arrived at the base of Lumiose tower where they could see a stage being set up for the upcoming performance. Amongst the crowds who were gathered, they could see a number of their friends, including Shauna, Trevor, Tierno, Miette, Sawyer, Alain and Mairin. In a separate area, a number of the gym leaders from the region were present, including Viola and her sister Alexa and Korrina, with others set to arrive throughout the day. Having greeted their friends, Ash and Clemont gave each other a nod, and began to get to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Happy with the results, Ash and Clemont surveyed their work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena had been their first target, She had been left with Ash\u2019s body, though her hair had been switched with Korrina. The clothes she was wearing had been changed too, and Ash\u2019s body was now wearing Alexa\u2019s outfit, not overly feminine, but fittingly funny to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor had been given Shauna\u2019s personality, as well as her life, though his body was now Bonnies, who had been dragged into this against Clemonts will. He was now acting a lot more femininely and would soon be taking part in the performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna herself now had Trevor\u2019s life, and had been given Clemonts body and clothes. She kept her own genitals however, as Clemont wasn\u2019t ready to give up his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierno was let off somewhat lightly in comparison, though his life had been switched with Alexa, and  he ended up in Ash\u2019s outfit as a result. He was given Alexa\u2019s hair too, which looked odd on his body. He was also given Mairin\u2019s vagina, which was still somewhat immature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiette had been given Alain\u2019s body as well as Korrina\u2019s personality. She also wore Korrina\u2019s outfit, which looked ridiculous on Alain\u2019s masculine frame, and left a very large bulge in her skin tight workout shorts. She had been given Korrina\u2019s breasts too, which looked odd on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlain himself now had Serena\u2019s body, though he was given Miette\u2019s vagina, which suited the body he was now in. He also wore Marin\u2019s outfit, which made Serena\u2019s body look a lot younger than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMairin was left with her own body, though she had been given Alain\u2019s outfit and Sawyer\u2019s penis, as well as his head. Her life was also switched with Viola, meaning she would be in charge of her own gym soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer now had Marin\u2019s head as well as Serena\u2019s outfit on his own body, which looked quite silly. He also had Viola\u2019s breasts and vagina, the breasts appearing much larger on his younger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola had wound up with a flat chest as well as Sawyer\u2019s penis, which left a rather noticeable bulge in her tight jeans. She was now living Mairins life as well, resulting in her developing a crush on her new travelling companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa was now living Tierno\u2019s life and wearing his outfit, she kept her own body, though her hair had been switched with Tierno\u2019s too, making her look quite manly. She had also been given Tierno\u2019s penis, which on her feminine frame left quite a large bulge. It was clear she was having some issues walking with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorrina had been left with Miette\u2019s personality, and as such was much more interested in performances than in battling. She also wore Sawyer\u2019s outfit, which in comparison to her usual athletic outfit was a lot more formal. She was also flat chested, which made her look oddly manly, especially with Ash\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie, to the annoyance of Clemont, now had Tierno\u2019s body in her own outfit. While he wasn\u2019t the biggest guy in the group, the outfit did little to hide her new body. The tight shorts had quite a large bulge protruding from their front, and her new masculine body stretched the feminine outfit quite a bit. Bonnie was still herself mentally though, and was happily parading around playing with the nearby Pok\u00e9mon, occasionally adjusting the bulge stretching out her shorts and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Clemont were able to pick and choose from the group as they pleased. Clemont now found himself in Shauna\u2019s body, though he retained his own penis. He was now wearing her outfit too, which consisted of a par of nearly skin tight pink shorts, a very tight fitting pink top, a pair of pink heels, as well as a push up bra and a very tight, lace pair of panties. Clemont had kept his own penis however, and as a result there was a rather large bulge pushing out of the shorts. As this was his first real time in a girls body, Clemont was using every opportunity to feel himself up, finding it very hard to avoid being aroused, which only made the bulge in his crotch even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh on the other hand, now found himself in Miette\u2019s body. His experience wasn\u2019t all that different in comparison to his time in Serena\u2019s body, He felt a lot less exposed however in his new body, as his new outfit covered more of his upper body. The tightness of the outfit felt quite nice as well, as it accentuated his new curves greatly. He was also happier to be wearing shorts rather than a skirt, even if they were shorter than the skirt he had been wearing for the last few days. The one major difference Ash could feel was that Miette had been wearing a thong. He had seen several in of them in Serena\u2019s bag while changing, though hadn\u2019t worked up the courage to try one on. Although it felt odd as it crept up his new, tight ass, Ash couldn\u2019t help but feel aroused, and as he became more erect, the thong rode up more and more, which only turned him on further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a glance with Clemont, Ash could tell that he was heavily aroused. The pair excused themselves and made their way into the tower, using the excuse that Clemont wanted to show something to Ash in the tower. After getting far enough away, the pair burst into laughter, which came out as more of a giggle of glee. \u201cAsh I can\u2019t believe how much fun that was, did you see Miette as Alain?\u201d Clemont said between giggles. \u201cI know, I can\u2019t believe the size of the bulge in those shorts, Miette sure got lucky\u201d Ash says, laughing the entire time. \u201cSpeaking of bulges Ash, I\u2019m going to have to get rid of this erection, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to go around with this all day, I need to go and have some private time. There\u2019s a spare room over there if you want to use it\u201d Clemont says with a slight blush. The entire time they were talking he had been playing with his breasts, pulling his hair and rubbing his new larger ass. He was clearly enjoying himself, which was quite evident from the large bulge which was threatening to spill out of his shorts. He didn\u2019t even give Ash a chance to respond, as he turned to walk away, unzipping his shorts as he did so. As Ash turned to walk away, Clemont called out \u201cOh and Ash, thanks for involving me in this, if I can pay you back I will\u201d. Ash looks back and sees that Clemont has already removed his top, and he catches sight of Shauna wearing nothing but a pink bra and panty set, with a very large bulge springing out from the front of the panties. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it Clemont, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll think of something\u201d Ash says as he slips his tight shirt over his head and bends forward as he pulls off his shorts, giving Clemont a great view of his tight ass, with the thong becoming lost between his cheeks. He then winks at Clemont before making his way into his own room, swaying his hips as he walks, feeling up his breasts as he does so.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Closing the door behind him, Ash began to feel himself up. This was the first time he had been truly alone since he got the transforming remote, and now he had a brand new body to explore too. He had gotten used to Serena\u2019s body, he found out some of the more sensual areas of her body and how to turn himself on. Miette\u2019s body seemed slightly different however, her breasts were slightly bigger than Serena\u2019s, though they were still covered by a light blue bra, which matched the thong he was wearing. He found that groping his ass provided more pleasure than rubbing his breasts, so after removing his bra, he began squeezing his new, tighter ass with one of his hands. He sat down on the bed in front of a body sized mirror and began to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down however, the thong he was wearing became lodged even farther up his ass, which caused him to moan in pleasure in Miette\u2019s melodic voice. He decided to leave the thong on while he masturbated, as he massaged his breasts with his spare hand. His body seemed to work on auto pilot as his spare hand roamed around his body, alternating between massaging his breasts, to pulling on his own hair. At one point he found himself slipping a finger into his tight ass, the feeling of which pushed him over the edge as he climaxed, causing him to scream out in pleasure. As he lay there recovering, he heard a similar scream of pleasure come from the other room, signalling the Clemont in Shauna had finished up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he caught his breath, Ash heard a knock on his door, which was opened by Clemont, who was red faced, wearing nothing but Shauna\u2019s panties, which seemed to be a little bit stained. He closed the door behind him and sat down on the ground opposite from Ash to catch his breath. \u201cAsh... I... I can\u2019t believe how good that felt! I\u2019ve never felt anything like that! It was like my body knew exactly what to do and I was just along for the ride\u201d Clemont says, with a slight bulge reforming in his panties, Ash tried not to stare, but seeing a mostly naked girl in front of him was quite distracting. \u201cI know what you mean, my body was on auto pilot or something, it\u2019s like I knew every pleasure zone\u201d Ash says, absent mindedly running his hand through his hair. \u201cI think Miette has some fetish to do with her ass or something, I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off of it, or out of it for that matter\u201d Ash says while blushing, finding the entire situation to be more than a little strange. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me\u201d Clemont says while rubbing his own ass \u201cI just wish I had realised before I grabbed that... Never mind. Maybe some of their characteristics carried over to us considering we have so much of their bodies. I\u2019ll have to look into this a bit more whenever we experiment with the remote again. We should probably go back now though, the others will start wondering where we went soon\u201d Clemont says, sounding a little bit disappointed. He stands back up and stretches out a bit, cupping his breasts again as he does. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to get dressed again, see you outside.\u201d Clemont says as he walks away, which Ash can\u2019t help but watch, enjoying the sight of Shauna\u2019s ass in nothing but a a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Ash gets up and gets his clothes together, finding it difficult to reposition his junk inside his thong. He pulls on the rest of his outfit and straightens out his hair in the mirror, trying to look normal for the rest of the group. After searching through his new bag, Ash finds a makeup kit and following the auto pilot that guided him before, he applies a light layer to his face, thinking he looked perfect. Smoothing out his outfit, he can\u2019t help but admire his new body. Serena\u2019s body was great and all, but it wasn\u2019t as sexually charged as Miette\u2019s. Perhaps he would use Serena\u2019s body for when he was travelling and wanted to have some fun, then whenever they meet up again he could use Miette for other purposes. These thoughts went through his mind the entire time, as his hands roamed across his body without even realising, settling on his ass once again, getting close to slipping another finger in before he realised what he was doing. \u201cMan, I\u2019m far to horny for my own good\u201d Ash laughs to himself as he heads outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he finds that Clemont facing away from him, and he is clearly having similar issues, as he has one of his hands under his top, playing with his breasts while the other is down the back of his shorts, clearly moving in and out, eliciting moans of pleasure from him. Smirking, Ash sneaks up behind him and grabs him by the breasts, causing Clemont to gasp in both shock and pleasure. \u201cLookie what we have here \u201cShauna\u201d, looks like somebody was getting carried away\u201d Ash laughs to himself as he lets go of Clemonts breasts, who seems to be both embarassed and highly turned on. \u201cGod Ash don\u2019t do that to me, it\u2019s bad enough that I can\u2019t control myself, I don\u2019t need you to get involved too\u201d Smirking, Ash begins to head outside. \u201cWell maybe we can help each other out later\u201d Ash says with a sly wink, causing Clemonts jaw to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair return outside, they find that the remainder of their group has found an area to eat their lunch. They sit down between Serena and the Alain, finding it hilarious that nobody has caught on to the situation. Clemont can\u2019t help but laugh at the sight of Ash\u2019s original body wearing Alexa\u2019s outfit, which Ash finds somewhat embarrassing. He can\u2019t help but think that Sawyer looked quite cute, feeling somewhat jealous that he had a larger pair of breasts than him. Finishing up their lunch, the group begin to prepare for the upcoming performance.</span></div></div>",

She was glad to learn the remote was quite useful. It had the ability to turn anything into anything, not even accounting for mass density material, it had blown her mind at first, but as months past using it all the time it had become almost second nature. She no longer needed a place to stay, food even having her clothes made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeast to say it had been a really great gift and she had hopped to show it off to ash as soon as they met again. The opportunity came far quicker than expected, within a few days she had heard from him that he was coming back to kalos for a bit to attend a pokemon league champion conference and he was bringing his friend brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena had heard her fair share about brock from ash, his role as a gym leader, family member and later even pokemon doctor had wowed her. What he had forgotten to mention was that he was also a giant pervert. Ash had sent brock of to stay with her a few days before the conference was over. And although he certainly was a nice person, his perverse antics had annoyed her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing brock propose his love for nurse joy for the nth time had been her breaking point, she had impulsively pointed the remote at an unsuspecting brock and turned him into a nice bright pink dildo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit ironic she supposed having turned him into a dildo, but it didnt quite matter as long as long as it would keep him quite. Another breakthrough she had made was learning she could transform living beings, opening an entire realm of possibilities for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she had given herself some rather gratuitous 'upgrades'. Having her cup size go up a level and slightly increasing the size of her thighs adding even more to her already curvey body. She had also raised her sex drive quite substantially, finding herself dripping wet more often than not and giving brock a purpose, she wasnt that mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days of having her improvements ash had finally showed up. Straight away she could tell he was rather entranced by her new 'assets' even catching him staring once in a while. She had wanted to finally get a shot to be with ash, but now she was having second thoughts. Her mind going on about a tangent about what she could do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*what does she turn him into?*</span></div></div>",

He had repeatedly tried to communicate to her but all he could muster was slightly ruffling parts of his fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeast to say it was quite a bit suprising finding himself transformed into a rather form fitting swimsuit for her one of her female companions. Ash had to admit, serena had certainly matured, rippening into a metaphorical perfect curvey bustey bright red apple. And he had been having a hard time keeping his eyes off of her lately. But this was certainly an odd way to fulfill his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ash, I kinda needed a new swimsuit, i hope you dont mind filling in until i find one!\" Serena explained as she rubbed the fine rubbery fabric ash was composed off. Ash was extremely sensitive in his fabric state, each time she ran her fingers through ash shivered in ecstacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena had noticed her swimsuits shivering and confirmed ash was indeed consious, this had excited her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can start your job right now!\" Serena cheerfully stated as she stripped and prepared to slip herself into her new swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh whimpered as he felt her enter, having her inside him was a completely different experience, the inside of his stretchy fabric had somehow felt even more sensual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs serena had slipped him on completely and zipped him up, Ash had finally gotten a grip on his mind. He could feel everything on serena as her swimsuit, the way his thin rubbery fabric had expanded and contracted as serena filled him out felt incredible, every inch of his form fitting self now hugging serena as if clinging onto her for its dear life. Lathering itself onto her smooth succulent skin. He could now also feel the slightly more profound details on her, now having a first hand experience of supporting her breasts he could feel every inch of her errogonous fat on her chest, even feeling her nipples poke through him and rub into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena to had felt absolute bliss as she zipped ash up. She could feel him urgently almost desperately pulsate in enjoyment. The thought itself of having her crush as a bit of thin expendable fabric clinging onto its owners body nothing more and nothing less had pushed almost pushed her off the edge. Letting her fluids flow freely into ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon ash had felt a new sensation as moistness had continued to pile up on her nether regions and seeped into him. What bodily fluids she was expelling and he had been soaking up had tasted like the most delectible honey he had ever had and had made him feel so hot and tingly in his fibers.He just had to have more. Ash began to pulsate harder and harder on her nether regions stimulating her and releasing more and more of her wonderful juices. The sound of her pounding and moaning as well as the fidgeting of her hips completely over powered by all the sensations he was feeling. Before a large gush of new liquid had shot into him like a torrent and serena had shot a very audible gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes serena had regained her composure and smiled as she could still feel her swimsuit rubbing her breasts and chest soothingly. Pulling at the the lower part of her swimsuit she turned scarlet as she felt just how soaked it was. Next time she really should hold back on her sex drive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt so good but so scary. She then had the wonderful sensation of her breasts filling with air and growing as her body was inflating. Then as the inflation slowed Serena realized that she was shaped just like a balloon you would see someone holding on a string, Serena attempted to scream but she couldn't, she had no voice, with a terrified look on her face, her face and hair  froze and flattened into a 2d image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long string grew from her nozzle, now tied up,  to the floor, Serena was just floating, with an eternal face of terror along with red cheeks of pleasure. Serena could no longer think all she was was a balloon. But she could feel. And it felt good as if in eternal orgasm.</span></div></div>",

READER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.</div><br>\r\n**************************************************************<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Ash looked around and noticed that Serena wasn't going to stop Pikachu. Ash sighed, knowing that Pikachu probably wasn't going to take \"no\" for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Okay, Pikachu, you win,\" she said, clearly uncomfortable with the fact that Pikachu was about to creampie her. \"But the only way I'm going to do this is if we have some privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Pikachu grabbed Ash's little yellow Pikachu hand and led her to a standing hollow tree stump. There was a pile of slate next to the stump, making it easy to get in. The inside was heavily shaded by the walls of the stump at the sides and the canopy above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ash followed Pikachu into the stump, and the second they hit the ground, Pikachu started kissing Ash passionately. Ash was surprised for a second, but she ended up closing her eyes and returning the kiss with even more passion. Pikachu and Ash stopped kissing, and Pikachu found all of the most sensitive parts of Ash's new body and began lovingly caressing them. This sent waves of pleasure up Ash's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She smiled and reached for Pikachu's tapered little prick, which was already at a full hard-on. She began stroking it, slowly and softly, and then she got on her knees. She licked it near the tip and put it in her mouth, slowly moving her head up and down the shaft. Pikachu began blushing madly, with an expression of sheer bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Pikachu decided that he was going to take over, so he grabbed Ash's ears and began thrusting his dick in and out of her mouth. When Pikachu was on the verge of cumming, he pulled his dick out, but Ash quickly leaned forward and began sucking it again. Pikachu couldn't hold back anymore, and he blew a hot, sticky load into Ash's mouth, and she swallowed every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mmm, I never thought that could taste so good,\" Ash said. She sat down with her back against the wall, legs spread, slit clearly visible. \"Give me all you've got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Pikachu walked up to Ash and started stroking her clitoris, making her moan out of pleasure. When the folds were thoroughly moistened, Pikachu lowered himself over Ash and began making love with her, slowly but surely. Ash couldn't help but moan with pleasure. After a few minutes, Pikachu began picking up speed and using his electricity to add stimulation. Ash kept screaming and moaning, wave after wave of pleasure washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Pikachu...\" she said, \"I-I think we should get to the oth-AAAAaaAAAAaaaAHHHh!\" As the final wave of pleasure washed over her,  she could feel Pikachu's hot, sticky seed shoot up inside her, leaving a mess on the ground and around the lips of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Pikachu stopped and regretfully withdrew. Ash pulled his face down for another kiss. After they were done, Ash was spent, but she loved every second of it. She didn't want to give this up. She just wanted to be with Pikachu for the rest of her life. Serena couldn't complain about that, could she?</div></span></div></div>",

There were these strange pressures on top of his head and something was tickling his legs. He tried to stand up, only to instantly fall flat on his face. He could feel his feet! It was as if his legs ended in a single toe. Ignoring the weird feeling he moved his head to look up and spotted Serena standing about fifteen feet away, a smile on her face and Braixen by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is my cute little Kirlia. Did you have a nice nap?\", her voice was somewhere between genuine concern and smug superiority. Ash mind latched onto this word. Kirlia? An attack by wild psychic type would certainly explain everything. Why he was blacked out, the weird sensations and why Braixen was standing at the ready. He blocked out all the weird sensations as his mind went battle-mode. Bringing himself to his knees, he swirled his head around to look for the thread, at the same time his hand reached for the pokeballs at his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething green fell in his field of vision blocking his sight, while his hand found no balls, instead grabbing onto some kind of flap. Touching it felt incredibly disturbing, halfway between cloth, parchment and skin. He swore he could almost feel his touch<i> trough</i> it. He gave it a tug, in an effort to get it off of him. The sudden sharp sting, caused him to cry out in pain: \"<i>KIIII !</i>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around him seemed to slow down, as his mind caught up to with what just happened. With dawning horror he looked down and took it all in. He saw the alabaster white limb holding onto a piece of skin-dress of the same color with its only two fingers. The \"dress\" was continuous from limb to flap and he knew it continued upward to form his face. Beneath it where green legs, ending in a single point as if to mimic a ballerina and the thing in his eyes, was his new hair. He was sure if he where to reach up, he would have been able to feel the two red horn growing out of his skull. He struggled to his feat. Certain of the impossible. <br>\r\n<i>He</i> was the Kirlia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wasn't quite right. The feeling of wrongness was subsiding, as if now that his brain knew that his body was different, it didn't care anymore and everything was as it should be. Normally that would be quite a concerning development, but Ash had a different problem to focus on. Now that the weirdness was gone he could really <i>feel</i> his body for the first time: the horns on his head, the skin extending to form the dress, the sensation of permanently standing on his tiptoes, all off it. And through this feeling he discovered the second traumatic change of the day. <i>He</i> wasn't the Kirlia.<br>\r\n<i>She</i> was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn panic and shock she cried out: \"<i>KIRLIAAAA!</i>!\", only to be meet with a mocking: \"Oh you finally figured it out, huh?\". Ash swirled around to look at her \"friend\" and managed to ask a fearful: \"<i>Kiir?</i>\" (Why?).<br>\r\n\"Well to answer your presumed question: because I had the chance, it was basically the perfect opportunity.\", seeing Ash's shocked expression, she continued: \"I'm not stupid Ash, I know you don't reciprocate my feelings and I talked to Dawn and May. I'm sure at some point you would have grown frustrated with the Kalos-League and just left. Wouldn't you?\". Ash, stumped by the accusation, was unable to respond, so Serena continued:\"And <i>Ta-da</i> now you never have to leave. You will fit right in, a cute little dancer for our performance-troupe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the next sentence her facial expression seemed to take on a more derange look, without actually changing: \" You'll never have to worry about dumb badges or stupid tournaments again and can be my best friend forever. Just imagine it.\" Impatiently Serena continued, raising a pokeball:\"So there is one last question remaining: Will you come willingly?\" Then Braixen stepped forward, flame igniting on the end of his stick: \"Or do I have to force you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling panic set in, Ash furiously looked around. Where was Pikachu? Where were her other Pokemon? There! About twenty feet back, partially hidden by the grass she spotted Pikachu's unconscious form, still singed from his presumed defeat at Braixen's paws. And there not even five feet away from him where her cloth and pokeball. If she could get over to Pikachu or her stuff she could... her train of thought was cut of by a jet of flame missing her by a few inches.<br>\r\n\"Last chance. What will it be?\" came the mocking voice of her former friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Ash do?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Panic was starting to creep-up on Ash. The overwhelming feeling of <i>wrongness</i> had subsided, but she still felt weird, so feeble and weak. Everything around her seemed bigger and more dangerous. The forrest around the clearing looked darker. The wind felt harsher, brushing against her horns and tousling her skirt, returning some of the wrongness she had been feeling before. But the biggest changes in her perspective where in Braixen and Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt almost twice Ash's height, the girl looked imposing. She was still smiling in a slightly off way, but Ash could feel that she was genuine in her offer. She didn't want to unnecessarily hurt her, didn't want a bad start with<i> her new Pokemon.</i>. The bizarre mix of craziness, hope, malice and genuine concern gave Ash the creeps. But no matter how bad Serena was, Braixen was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had know the fox-like Pokemon since it had been a little Fennekin, had feed it, played with it, petted it, even fought alongside it. Now it stood almost a head taller than her and held a flame pointed squarely at her. The look of cold determination on its face send chills down her new spine. This was the look of a Pokemon that would do its best for its trainer no matter what. Ash had seen such looks often enough on her own Pokemon to know that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\" came the shout. \"Better decide fast, I don't want to hurt you.\", the sincerity of her words made it worse, as Ash's slowly awakening psychic-powers caused her to subconsciously take in the whole range of Serena's screwed-up emotions. This in turn influenced the young Kirlias view of both her opponents and her surroundings, causing them to appear more dangerous and twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\", Braixen's glare intensified, causing Ash to take a step back in fear. The pressure the other Pokemon exerted was almost unbearable. It made her want to run away, to curl up and hide from the stronger Pokemon. It were her new-found pokemon-instincts playing havoc with her still human mind. As a Pokemon, a psychic one at that, Ash was able to instinctively understand the strength of other Pokemon in relation to herself. And currently, even though she was an evolved form, her fighting capabilities where barely above a newborn, causing the other Pokemon to appear even more powerful. In the wild these instincts would have been extremely useful, allowing her to avoid danger and pick her battles, but now the overwhelming urge to flee and hide, hindered her ability to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh clasped her hands, pressing them against her chest, in an effort to calm herself. She had to find a way out of this mess, she had to think, think damn it. But under the icy glare of Braixen her mind always returned to those instinctual option of: \"run and hide\" and \"submit and hope for the best\". <br>\r\nShe refused to give in. There had to be better options, but she knew fighting would almost certainly do her no good. If only Pikachu where here, he could... Pikachu! Ash had been so overwhelmed, that she completely forgotten. If she could reach him or her other Pokemon in her clothes, she could fight. Now if only she could close the distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\", Braixens flame flared up, increasing the pressure and driving the more basic instincts back into the forefront of her mind. She had to make a decision fast.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh whirled around and started running as fast as her now short legs could carry her, desperately trying to close the distance between her and her Pokemon. She <i>felt</i> the fire before she felt it, throwing herself to the ground, managing to avoid the worst of it, and scrambling to her feet. But it had cost her time and the body of a Kirlia, <i>her body</i>, wasn't build for running. So, as she heared the commanding shout of: \"Flame Charge!\", it was already to late to dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen had closed the gap in an instant, colliding with her at full speed. The pain surging through Ash's body caused her cry out again: \"<i>KIIIIII !!</i>\", as she was flung  forward from the impact. The pain seemed to redouble as she hit the the ground, bounced off and rolled several feet before coming to a stop. Trying to push herself up, her vision blurred and she collapsed back down, retching in pain. Everything inside Ash seemed to scream for her to either <i>run</i> or <i>fight</i>, but as the pain started to fade, she managed to regain her focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up through tears, the young Kirlia rejoiced. She could see both Pikachu lying unconscious in the grass and the pokeballs at her belt. Braixens attack had carried her within five feet of both. Ash knew she had only time to do one thing before the the fox Pokemon would reach her again. So she climbed to her still unfamiliar feet and ran to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were no clear labels, just buttons, switches, and a few dials of different kinds.  The more they looked it over, the more curious and strange the device became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both Fennekin and Pikachu joined their respective trainers as they looked over the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" began Ash.  \"Pikachu, what do you make of it?\"  The little electric mouse just sniffed it for a second before saying, \"Pika, pika,\" which Ash interpreted as confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" began Serena as she took the remote, \"I think we could hand it over to one of the professors, maybe they know what-\" Accidentally, Serena's finger brushed across something on the remote, causing the remote to start to hum. \"Oops,\" was all Serena could get out before the group was consumed in a bright light.  All four covered their eyes, shielding their eyes from the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as quickly as it came, the light went leaving the two pokemon and humans standing in the same open field.  Slowly, the four travelers' eyes adjusted to the regular light of the sun and blinked away the extra spots.  Ash was the first to speak.  \"Pikachu are you okay?\"  Pikachu, still wiping the brightness from his eyes answered back in a frustrated, \"Pika, Pika-Pi!\"  Ash sighed, grateful that his friend of so many years was fine and good.  Turning to Serena, Ash began, \"Serena how are yo-\" when he suddenly stopped.  From the neck down, Serena looked fine, not even her outfit of black sneakers, stockings, and top, and red skirt was hardly even rustled.  However, above the neck, Serena was still mostly fine except.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Ash,\" started Serena as she too finally managed to chase the brief blindness from her eyes.  \"Why did you-\"  Both trainers paused for a few brief seconds before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serena,\" stated Ash calmly, \"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... not really,\" stated Serena, though she had to admit that Ash seemed noticeably louder.  \"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all,\" answered Ash with a sigh.  \"Um Serena... I think that light did something to you.  Serena, I won't be surprised if you don't believe me, but you have Fennekin ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena panicked for an instant before she yanked for her purse and dug through it until she found her compact mirror.  Flipping it open, Serena looked in the mirror and sure enough, as if they had always been there, Serena had two large, orange and red, Fennekin ears sticking out of the side of her head.  Her long hair cascaded over the ears with out difficulty and even matched them quite well.  If it weren't for the well of concern that was growing in her gut, Serena might just admire her cuteness for a few moments.  Letting out a yelp of concern, Serena's panic took her again for a moment as she closed the compact mirror and shut her eyes, hoping it was all a dream.  However, Serena took a few moments and composed herself before looking again at the compact, confirming her new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I think you're right, but you should know-\" began Serena before she was interrupted by Ash.  \"Don't worry Serena, I'll call Professor Oak or maybe Professor Birch, maybe they know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and taking comfort in Ash's concern for her, Serena spoke, \"Thank you Ash, but you should know... you have Pikachu ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" shouted Ash in surprise, forcing Serena to wince.  Reaching up, instead of normal, small human ears like he was used to, Ash was surprised to discover two long, furry appendages.  Serena held her compact open to Ash so Ash could examine himself.  Sure enough, Ash had two appropriately sized Pikachu ears where his ears should be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again,\" moaned Ash as he slouched slightly, remembering the time he accidentally got turned into a Pikachu by a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" asked Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.  Point is, we're in the same boat,\" answered Ash as he stood up, adjust his shirt slightly, noting it gave him a slight itch.  Grabbing the map out of his bag, Ash quickly looked to where the nearest town would be.  \"The nearest town that might have a long distance phone would be... probably... Laverre City, but that looks like at least 2-3 days walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ash, I'm sure we will be fine,\" comforted Serena as she put on her backpack and readied herself, not noticing the odd calmness that she exuded.  \"We'll head to Laverre City and get one of the professors to help us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" answered Ash as he finished checking over Fennekin and Pikachu, both of whom seemed unchanged.  Both Pokemon were concerned, but happily hoped onto their respective trainers' shoulders.  \"Alright, let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the remote,\" said Serena as she took a gander at Ash.  \"Just make sure you don't press anything on it. I don't want to change anymore... though, I have to say, you do look rather cute with Pikachu ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, surprisingly, blushed as he carefully put the remote in his bag and joined Serena.  \"Thanks... though I'd prefer handsome than cute.  Those Fennekin ears look... cute on you as well.\"  Serena blushed at this compliment as Ash and she slowly made their way towards Laverre City, unaware that this little adventure had only just begun.</span></div></div>",
