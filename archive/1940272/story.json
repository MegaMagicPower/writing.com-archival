            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was the day; Thirty long moons had passed since her visit to the human world. With a wistful sigh, Twilight reluctantly admitted to herself hat she missed her human friends. There was an odd, charming quality about her human friends. And even though she interacted with them the exact same way she did with her friends, there was a different feel around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought to herself about what made them different from her own friends, adding more reasons to her list of why she should at least visit Canterlot High. She thought of the obvious like it's what friends do, and they' were probably missing her a lot more than she was. After all, Twilight has friends just like them, and they don't have her specifically. There was an alleged \"twin sister,\" but Pinkie did say she lived in the city. Plus the fact that their version of Twilight still seemed to be in her antisocial shut-in phase made it less likely of them befriending her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was the fact that she subconsciously missed being a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it the reason was, it was enough to convince her to at least see what they were up to. Just pop in, say hello, stay for a couple of hours, and go back home. She sighed again, taking a deep breath and approaching the magic mirror. \"Well, here goes nothing.\" Bracing herself to be disoriented by the trans-dimensional travelling. Once again she felt herself lose consciousness for a brief minute or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up, she found herself unable to stand. Her legs buckled every time she tried to stand, and she quickly realized she wasn't bipedal again. Twilight looked at where she expected her hands to appear and was surprised to see small hooves. It didn't take long for her to guess that she was still in pony form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- what happened? Why am I so sma-- Why's my voice like this!?\" Twilight quickly fell backwards and brought her fore hooves up to her mout, finding it hard to believe that her voice was that high pitched and undeveloped. Her breath quickly sped up, resulting in short, jagged intakes of air that only made her feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless fears and speculations made themselves apparent. What if someone sees me, what if I'm stuck like this forever, and many other \"what-ifs\" entered her mind, each psyching her out more than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when her anxiety reached a boiling point, a soft, soothing voice called from nearby. \"Are you okay, little fella?\" Twilight, both petrified and curious, turned to face whoever spoke to her and was relieved to see a familiar face. \"Aww, Applejack never told me her horse had a foal. You're a long way from Sweet Apple Acres.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fluttershy, I'm glad you-- wait, what are you doing?\" As if Fluttershy ignored Twilight's attempts to communicate, she grabbed the tiny pony and cradled her up to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy examined the small creature in front of her, its lavender coat, purple eyes, and hair reminding her of Twilight. The human girls gasped slightly and stepped back, noticing both the horn atop its head and the wings on its sides. \"Wings and a horn? What the? You're not from around here, are you?\" Fluttershy glanced towards the school's statue, remembering how Twilight Sparkle came and went to their universe. Quickly piecing the small details together, leaving her to ask, \"Twilight, is that you?\"</span></div></div>",

Just Desserts: Do I need to explain? Okay, fine.

Well, once Sonata has all the fun, I'm sure the other two will be running to get in on the excitement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie...just stick to Sonata. Don't deal with her friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie and Sunset were inside the classroom as the bell rang, the trio of girls previously talked about were also chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdiago tightened her grip on her pencil until it broke in two pieces at the sight of them, \"I want those two, along with their friends, taken down a size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonata whispered into her leader's ear, \"Can we do it now?! I bet they'll look so, so adorable! We can take them home with us, and be mommies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria pulled Sonata away by her hair, hissing, \"We. Are. Not. Playing. House. And, shut it! They might catch on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdiago breathed a sigh at her team, explaining to them both with controlled speech, \"You two cut it out. We need to be very quiet and concentrated here. Or, we're back to the drawing board for getting back at them. You remember how long it took us to get this pathetic one ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher said as the students took their seats, \"Today is the day, my little students! Reports on what you did over the winter break are due! Who wants to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jumped out of her chair, literally, \"Me! Pick me! First! First, woman! First!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher suddenly realized why her headaches mysteriously disappeared over the break, \"...Of course, Miss Pie. Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the class sighed, except Sunset and the Dazzlings (too busy with breathing exercises for their retrained singing voices).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie paid none of the negative responses any attention, and went to the front.</span></div></div>",

The subjects basically boiled down to presents and pranking her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset worried on the result of her friend's rambling, which might possibly end with her grade being lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrading would certainly be the least of worries as the Dazzlings set the plot in motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic had returned to their voices. Unfortunately for them, only enough to cast magic. Absorbing it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they focused on destroying the lives, one-by-one, of the girls who'd wronged them. If they didn't catch on, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset rubbed her eyes, thinking Pinkie appeared shorter than before. Slightly shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick blink, Sunset noticed she seemed even smaller than one second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...everyone in class stopped falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey immediately had complete attention on Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie didn't see anything off about her surroundings, at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she hit the age of fourteen, her eyes glanced downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, she jumped from foot to foot, screaming as she regressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie shouted in confusion, \"Sunset! What's happening?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset snapped out of her unmoving awe at what took place before her and everyone else in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed to the front, grabbing her friend, and calming her as she slipped from a teenager to a toddler in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her eyes closed the rest of the time, Pinkie finally opened them, and saw she stopped getting younger. Then, glimpsed at how Sunset held her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of like a mother to her crying child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie, unbelieving her knew view on life, was hugged by Sunset, who easily towered over her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's feet could kick around in the air without worry because Sunset kept her close to her chest, which meant a good length off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much for Pinkie to handle, and she drifted into sleep while hearing Sunset ask to call a hospital.</span></div></div>",

Another place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing to her cute feet, Pinkie tried to walk in the attempt of getting a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoted she could still walk, which was nicer news. Except, her walking ability was very poor, which caused her to almost fall onto her padded bottom or face several times.

It's...out of their hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie would've began crying right there, except Sunset had much more interesting details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gained an angered tone, \"I think I know the reason behind all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie raised an eyebrow, indicating for her currently-older friend to keep speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dazzlings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was so amazed she fell onto her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset giggled at the adorable scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, came up with a plan for a cure, \"I don't know how they can still posses magic, but they must be the source of your...new age. I'll have someone follow them. Probably Rainbow and Applejack. They're the two to call when force is the need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before picking Pinkie up, Sunset announced happily, \"Until then, you'll be staying with me!

Next to where she was in bed was a changing table for some odd reason and wondered why it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her bed, she noticed her bed was white and a light blue with two short rails on each side, making it seem like she was sleeping in a crib-like bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this made no sense to Pinkie until she looked down at herself and saw that she looked smaller than she was before! She looked to see she had a pinkish robe like that from a hospital. Then she at her hands that looked of that of a toddler.

But, Adgio trixked her, she put a couple of special balloons down on the ground with them so that pinkie would pick them up as well... <br>\r\nAnd she did.<br>\r\nAdgio prayed to celestia that if she would blow up one of the balloons, it would have been one of hers, one that was curse with a age modifying  curse.<br>\r\nAdgio hoped that pinkie would try blowing up the balloons down at her house, but she never thought that pinkie would try... During class.<br>\r\nPinkie pulled out of the balloons from her pocket, and place the little tube to her mouth and began blowing I to it, using all the breath in her body, only stopping every once in a while to get some more air... But then she felt as if something was wrong,<br>\r\nSomething she couldn't quite put her finger on... Her finger which was getting awfully tinier.<br>\r\nShe stopped blowing up her balloon, and noticed how slowly, but surely... She was shrinking!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She muttered. Two months of planning, research, and trial and what do I have to show for it? The girl muttered angel lifting her head to glare at the object before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last two months the girl had been trying to combine science and magic. Her last few attempts blew up in her face so Sunset Shimmer had suggested something smaller, and a helping hand.  Two months later the fruits of her labor were before her, and they were disappointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cupcake. A result of a combination of magic and science, the culmination of her research into the concept of magic. And it was a cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that it was a regular cupcake would be an insult to the rainbow iced sparkling treat. It was just, perfect. There was no other way to describe the rainbow colored treat. Perfect looks, perfect texture, even the perfect smell! Twilight could even swear there was singing as she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other day Twilight would have been drooling at the sight of the treat. Today though, she was to tired and angry to be affected by the magical treat so settled for glaring at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl muttered something and ran a hand through her tussled hair. Sleepless nights, missed showers, and explosions for a cupcake. She said glaring at the offending pastry. A rapid series of knocks interrupted her thoughts and the door was thrown open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight! A perky cheerful voice called as Pinkie came skipping in. I hadn\u2019t seen you and a few days and. Oh my gosh! Twilight! Are you ok? Pinkie gasps before suddenly appearing next to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight adjusted her glassed with a frown. She really, really, wasn\u2019t in the mood for Pinkies antics today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m fine Pinkie, just disappointed in a failed experiment. She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie gave her a look. Twilight. When was the last time you bathed? Or ate? The violet haired girl made to answer, then froze when she couldn\u2019t\u2019 actually remember. Ummmmm. And at that moment her stomach growled making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve been cooped up in her for too long! Pinkie declared. Its time for a break! But Twilight protested only to have Pinkie start pushing her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo buts missy. You get cleaned up and we\u2019re going to Sugercube Corner! My treat. The other girls will meet us there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut. Get going I\u2019ll be right her. Pinkie said giving a too wide smile. Realizing she was defeated Twilight complied and went to go get cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resisted the urge to scream when she saw her own reflection. \u201cMaybe I can use a break.\u201d She thought as she tried to make herself presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile downstairs Pinkie had gotten bored and had noticed the cupcake on the table. Her eyes were immediately drawn to it and her mouth watered. She had to have it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie didn\u2019t just tackle it and start tearing into it, no. She paused at first knowing it wasn\u2019t hers. But after a moment she managed to convince herself that Twilight wouldn\u2019t miss one cupcake and snatched it, savoring the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Twilight came down. Ok I\u2019m ready now annaaaaaaahhhhhh! Pinkie!<br>\r\n Tes? The pink teen said swallowing the last mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my experiment! Twilight yelled panicking! That cupcake was the result of mixing science and magic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Well can you make another? It was really gooood! The pink teen said giving a small bounce. Pinkie this is serious. Twilight argued panicking. It\u2019s still untested and uncontrolled! I don\u2019t even know how exactly I made it or what it would do! Who knows what will happen now that you ate it! Twilight screamed concerned for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment pinkie felt her stomach rumble. There was a pause, the world holding its breath as both teens looked frightened. And then Pinkie hiccupped. A bit of glitter puffed out of her mouth but nothing happened. Humm. Cherry. Pinkie declared tasting her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned and face palmed as Pinkie continued to hiccup giggling with each one. Leave it to Pinkie to eat a magic cupcake and only get hiccups. Twilight muttered rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell since I\u2019m not *hic* going to go boomy! *hic* Can we go*hic* to Sugercube*hic* Corner now? Pinkie asked between hiccups. Twilight sighed and nodded deciding she was far too tired to try to analyze Pinkie\u2019s pinkieness today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Twilight notice something strange with Pinkie as they leave?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lifted a hand to blot out the evil beams of light until she managed to sit up. Disoriented for only a moment, Rarity stretched her arms and legs gracefully, emitting a delicate yawn. She felt invigorated and ready to face the day. Rarity tried to step off of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only to discover she couldn't! Her eyes sprang wide open and she was now fully awake. Rarity looked at her surroundings and immediately realized the environment she was in was definitely not her room. It was...a baby nursery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inspected farther, Rarity could faintly make out a whole nursery through the large, white wooden bars of the...crib? She was in a crib? Rarity looked around some more and was stunned and frightened at what she saw next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room appeared to have been freshly wallpapered with a white paper with vertical pink stripes, intertwined with a delicate, green tinted flowering vine. The room was filled with baby furniture in white enamel; next to the window there was a rocking chair and adjacent to it was a matching changing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the changing table were several baskets, filled to the brim with diapers, lotions, powders, oils, and many other infant care products. There was even a small baby bathtub that was padded so when the baby was bathed, they wouldn't bruise themselves during the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dresser stood by the opposite wall and had an acrylic apothecary jar full of pacifiers and a small nursery lamp on top. The entire room had a bunny motif; adorable pictures of baby bunnies seemed to be everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamp, the curtains, and even the crib sheets had bunnies on them. There were three framed color prints of bunnies descending in a diagonal across one of the walls. Rarity always adored bunnies and there they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking more closer with a keen eye, Rarity noticed that the mobile hanging over the end of the crib above her had bunnies hanging from it's wires and a diaper stacker now hung from the crib with a bunny applique. The tall yellow diaper pail next to the changing table had a pattern of a group of baby rabbits romping joyfully in a patch of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole roomed looked as if someone had spent weeks working on a nursery just for her. Just as things couldn't get any worse, Rarity heard a ginger crinkling sound from beneath her as she moved, almost like a cackling fireplace or crumpling paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked down at herself and noticed that she was clothed in a fuzzy blue baby sleeper with mittens on her hands. She felt the top of her head and was instantly aware that she was indeed wearing a frilly bonnet to match her current attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what got her attention the most was the pacifier that was in her mouth. A dark blue pacifier, she could easily make out. This horrified Rarity to no end to the point where she let out a shriek so loud it could have been mistaken for a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the nursery door flung open. Rarity tearfully jerked her head to see who was entering at the moment and would have spit the pacifier out of her mouth had her mouth not been sucking on it so hard for reassurance. Rarity was mortified to see the new visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure said in a cheerful voice, \"Good morning, little Rar-Rar! Did you have a nice nap?\" The figure lifted Rarity up from under her forearms and held her to face level, rubbing it's nose to Rarity's and mushing her cheeks together. Rarity gulped as she saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rarity\u2019s eyes widened in horror as she realized she could no longer talk. Only a stream of incomprehensible baby babble escaped from her mouth, along with a bit of drool. Rarity was mortified as it slid down her chin and dripped on her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled and wiped the mess from her chin. \u201cAnd good morning to you too Rar-rar!\u201d The pink hared girl cooed as if nothing was wrong. \u201cWhat? No Pinkie please! Listen to me.\u201d Rarity babbled and gurgled some more as she wiggled trying to make her friend understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Rarity suddenly yelped in shock as Pinkie flipped her over, undid part of her sleeper and Rarity experienced her first diaper check in years. \u201cUh-oh! Did wittle Rar-rar make a diddy?\u201d Pinkie cooed flipping Rarity around again and holding her up. \u201cI think she did! Yes, she did! A certain baby girl needs her diapee changed!\u201d Pinkie cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Pinkie was right and Rarity cringed as she was carried over to the changing table. The diaper squished wetly against her, swollen the wetness indicator long since discolored hinting at the nights worth of accidents locked in its padding. \u201cHow could I not notice?\u201d Rarity thought dismayed that she never even noticed the state of her diaper until pinkie had pointed it out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer musings were interrupted as Pinkie suddenly whisked her clothing away leaving her in nothing but a diaper. \u201cLets get you changed!\u201d Pinkie said happily already gathering up the supplies and moving to undo the tapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity panicked. \u201cNo! Pinkie! Listen to me! I\u2019ve been changed into a baby! Can\u2019t you see that! Help me!\u201d All that escaped her mouth though and all Pinkie heard was another stream of baby babble making the girl giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour so silly Rarity.!\u201d Pinkie cooed poking her in the stomach, an act that made Rarity giggle much to her shock. \u201cI\u2019ll have this nasty diaper off of you in no time!\u201d Rarity gurgled, kicking her legs and squirming for all she was worth to stop Pinkie but nothing she did worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just placed a hand over her stomach, easily holding her down as she removed the wet padding with the other. As it was removed Rarity felt embarrassed, ashamed, utterly confused, and maybe even violated. It was too much for Rarity and she soon found herself crying like the infant she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie didn\u2019t notice though, merely fixing the smile on her face, lifting the baby\u2019s ankles with a hand and proceeded to clean her change with a wipe. This made Rarity start to cry harder, truly bawling. Pinkie finished and without hesitation grabbed a pacifier from the jar and shoved it into the baby\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity\u2019s cries were abruptly silenced by the foreign object. Instantly her body began to suckle the rubber nub and Rarity slumped in defeat. Rarity nurced her pacifier noisly as pinkie quickly finished the process, sprinkling her with baby powder and taping the new diaper closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go! All done!\u201d Pinkie cooed patting her diapered rear. \u201cNow what should you wear, well I guess since you already have the pacifier.\u201d Rarity once again found herself helpless as her friend proceeded to wrangle her into an outfit. When she finished Pinkie took a moment to admire her handywork and Rarity got a look at what she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now wearing a frilly pink and white onesie, which did nothing to hide her diaper. Pinkie had also dressed her in matching socks and mittens and yet another matching bonnet was tied to her head as she nursed on her pink pacifier. In all Rarity was not the perfect image of a darling baby girl, and she hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to not notice Rarity\u2019s distress Pinkie picked the baby up and set her on her hip as she walked out of the nursery. Rarity could only wonder where she was being carried.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A string of incomprehensible babbling emerged from Rarity's mouth, as well as a thin line of drool. It coursed down her chin, only to fall wetly onto her bib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, did Rar-Rar make a little diddy in her dydee? I think she did! C'mon, let's get you cleaned up. Mom and Dad left me in charge of you for the day until they finish their errands.\" Sweetie Belle said in a sing-song voice as she settled Rarity on her hip while she walked towards the changing table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie was right; Rarity did have a very wet diaper on. Rarity cringed as the sopping diaper squished up against her private loins. Her diaper drooped heavily in front of her and the translucent wetness indicator on the front of the diaper had a faded yellow stain beneath the thick padding, hinting at the night's production of baby pee it held locked in its absorbent padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle gently laid Rarity onto the changing pad and began to untape the diaper. Rarity panicked, \"Sweetie Belle, you have got to listen to me! I've been changed into an infant! Can't you see?!\" Much to her dismay, all Sweetie heard was another melody of incoherent baby blather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle smiled as she poked her \"little\" sister in the stomach, \"You're so silly, Rar-Rar! And such a sweet little baby. Don't worry little sis, Big Sis will get this nasty diaper off of you in no time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity felt offended, violated, and extremely embarrassed all at once. The soggy diaper that was wrapped around her waist showed the extreme impropriety and incontinence that made her seem like the infant she truly was. Because of this, Rarity began to cry in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of reacting, Sweetie Belle merely smiled and continued to dispose of the old diaper. Meanwhile, Rarity was bawling, less gracefully than she would under normal circumstances. This was too much for the poor girl to handle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sister's mouth wide open, Sweetie seized this opportunity to grab a pacifier from the acrylic apothecary jar sitting close by. As soon as it all started, Rarity's sobs were abruptly silenced by the foreign object in her mouth. With her mouth filled with the soft latex of the rubber teat, Rarity began to suckle in defeat.</span></div></div>",

The whole time she couldn\u2019t stop cooing at how cute little Rarity was, constantly playing with her sisters chubby stomach and tiny toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Rarity found herself enjoying the attention, much to her dismay, and she couldn\u2019t help but to squirm and squeal childishly as Sweetie played with her. That done Sweetie picked her sister up again and carried her out of the nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity only had a moment to wonder what was going on before she found herself strapped into a highchair. \u201cBreakfast time!\u201d Sweetie sang tying a bib around her sisters\u2019 neck. Rarity felt her stomach drop. Not only dd she somehow become a baby and had her diaper changed but now she was sitting in a highchair in nothing but a diaper and bib waiting for her formerly younger sister to feed her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity felt her head spin as she tried to process everything, but Sweetie Bell was already back removing her pacifier and holding a bowel of, something. \u201cOpen wide here comes the Choo-choo!\u201d Sweetie cooed holding a spoonful of the goop up at Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was still in shock but instead of fighting Rarity opened her tiny almost toothless mouth at her sisters\u2019 request. Three things shocked Rarity as Sweetie shoved the spoon into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne: why had she done that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: that whatever Sweetie was feeding her was good. Really, good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree: She was suddenly very, very hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabbling for more Rarity reached out to the bowel, making her sister giggle and scoop up another spoonful. At the moment Rarity didn\u2019t care how childish she looked as she swallowed every spoonful, bits and pieces sticking to her face and falling onto her bib. She just wanted to be full!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after Sweetie had cleaned her face that Rarity realized what had happened and her embarrassment returned as Sweetie offered her a bottle. The thought of drinking from a bottle disgusted Rarity to no end, but like before a powerful thirst gripped her and she soon had no choice but to start nursing the bottle. Seeing her sister was occupied Sweetie went to get her own food. Soon Rarity was done, letting the bottle fall onto the chairs tray as she waited for Sweetie to finish her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much to do except bounce in her chair, kick her legs, and nurse on her pacifier after Sweetie gave it back to her. This finally gave Rarity time to think and process what had happened to her, but all her question still came up with no answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she a baby? She was pretty sure she went to be as a teen in high school so what happened? Not having answers made her kick and beat her tiny fists against the tray in frustration. Rarity was only vaguely aware of how childish she was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Sweetie finished, picked her sister up again and Rarity found herself carried to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She held her hooves out, \"Come on, sweetie. Auntie Cadance is here to catch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset failed at moving after four steps, to trip painlessly into her aunt's hooves. Cadance embraced the foal, pleased to hear little squeals of delight from the baby. All of a sudden, she felt a painful tug on her hair, \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the child on the ground...after gently pulling her off the mane, Cadance said to her with a tad bit authority, \"No, no, cutie. My hair isn't a playtoy, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset apparently understood, starting to cry. Cadance felt guilty for causing the sobs, putting Sunset on her shoulder to pat the foal into calmness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance held the foal to her eyes, irritated now, \"Okay, I'm not having a lot of fun with the pranks you're pulling, child. Those tears were fake, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset gave a flash of an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance was seriously surprised, \"What in the hay?! Hey, you are still all there in the mind, aren't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset tilted her head to showcase confusion. Afterwards, her own hoof found its way into her mouth, being sucked on by a seemingly-innocent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance raised an eyebrow, \"Really? As if I would fall for that trick, missy. Well, I guess it's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cooed at the little one before saying more, \"I mean, what could you possibly do now, hhmmm? Stuck in that small helpless baby body, completely dependent on your very own enemies for everything! Too bad that Twilight's your new mommy, I bet! No crown for you, sweetheart. How's about a new diaper, instead?! Seeing as how you've just went in your current one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset had began to grit her teeth with every backhoof to her own ego...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard the last few sentences of Cadance's mockery, and glanced down at the diaper hanging from herself, thoroughly soiled. She, for real this time, couldn't keep the tears from flowing down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance felt a bit of regret for making fun of the tiny villian...then remembered this was still a evil pony on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked the diaper, \"Whoa! Somepony's really soaked their dia-dee! But, I shouldn't change you until you've got a full load. No point in wasting a perfectly good diaper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset whimpered, from the urine cooling and her own fear of the mare holding her. She didn't want to go potty anymore than she already had, so held her hooves out. Sunset hoped Cadance was stupid enough to fall for the adorable eyes she was utilizing to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was now resting on the shoulder of the expert babysitter, smiling out of sight at how easily the adult could be fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance patted the foal's diaper, saying sweetly, \"I'm waiting, Sunset. No diaper change until it's ab-sol-utely necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset would've told the mare, if she could still talk, to go buck herself. With a swallowing of pride, she began to grunt with effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nothing was accomplished, she turned to cry deeply on the mare's shoulder, hating the disgusting wetness of the diaper, along with Cadance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her river of pony-made droplets all departed, she sighed, trying it out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she could feel the lumps of crap land silently, expanding the diaper out noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance cruelly pressed on the back of the full diaper, just to upset Sunset, \"You do need a change, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset held her dams of eye water back, not giving the bitch the satisfaction. She would so make this particular Alicorn pay for such horrible embarrassment...whenever she regained her former adult body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance finally decided to walk over to the changing table, laying the child down softly onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out all the supplies, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing the tapes, she then grabbed the foal's back hooves in her magic grasp, lifting them up with care. Then, teleported the diaper into a nearby trashcan. Next, wiped the messes off the foal, saying all the while, \"Who's a messy foal?! Sunset is! Yes she is! I'll need to tell your mommy about how you just lo-ve to stay in a dirty diaper! Does wittle Sunsetty wike that?! If not, who cares?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how Sunset hated Cadance for what she was planning on saying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her area was clean, a brand-new, clean diaper was introduced to the foal's bum swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes next, Sunset was on the carpet, just in a glaring contest with her new aunt, even if the adult had just changed her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight got out of the tub, toweled off, and went into the room all sparkly clean for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her sister-in-law shake a rattle in her new child's face, laughing while she did it. Cadance said to Twilight as she shook the baby's toy in front of the most annoyed foal right now, \"She is just a little cranky from not enough sleep. We should get her to bed now. As in right now! I must speak with you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You two play nice for mommy, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, they would get along beautifully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance, eyes ignited with hatred, said, \"I may be a foal now, but that just means I can watch you all the more closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset snickered, \"Don't you have a husband by the way?

Your. Mouth. Better yet, why don't I just do it for you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance had a pacifier teleport into her mouth, magically-stuck until she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled curses was her response to the nasty trick. But, soon tired herself out, then curled into a ball, slumbering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset grinned, \"How cute! Now, how to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was walking back to the room, bringing with her two bottles with chocolate milk. Shining Armor stood at the door, fiddling with the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when his sister came over, asking, \"Hey, could you get this door open. Cadance and I were supposed to go speak with Celestia and Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight promised herself she would tell Shining about Cadance's regression...just not right now, \"Oh, it doesn't matter. She left already before I even got out of the shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do you know where she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay. Well, she should be here somewhere. I'll go search for her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I'm such a numb-skull! I actually do know where she went! So, just go back to your room. I'll send her to you in a little bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Great, then! Thanks, little sis'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight watched as Shining turned the corner, then freaked out, \"WhatamIgoingtodo!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced for a few minutes, breathing out-of-whack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowed down when an idea hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exclaimed, \"If I can't get Cadance, I'll just pretend to be Cadance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she used an Appearance-Transformation spell, taking on the disguise, in voice and body, of Shining's wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, one small problem: getting somepony to watch the children who wouldn't blurt out the news of what happened to Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was speaking with Discord about the events in her day when fake Cadance rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord yawned at his friend, pointing at fake Cadance, \"I can already guess whatever she's going to say is much more interesting than that darn bunny, Angel, you've been telling me about for the past hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake Cadance asked without a moment's hesitation to Flutters, \"Could you babysit for me? I've got a lot on to get done right now, so could really use the assistance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy smiled, \"Sure, Cada-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I'm Twilight! I'm just posing for Cadance, who is a foal I should add, so Shining doesn't lose it at the knowledge his life partner's a baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Um...o-okay, Twilight. But, we should talk about this later on, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Anyways, later!\", fake Cadance said as she teleported off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord giggled with delight, \"How chaotically delightful! A secret nopony's supposed to know about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy sternly told him, \"Discord! You're coming over to help me watch those foals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?! Silly filly, I don't change diapers, or bandage boo-boos! I'm a being of pure randomness! I can do whatever I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do this because I'm a friend in need, and so I can make sure you don't do anything to upset Shining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine! Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, they were then teleported to Twilight's room. Both of them saw Sunset try out a spell, get peeved, then try again while Cadanc slept peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as soon as Sunset glanced at Discord and Fluttershy, she acted like she had been asleep the whole time, which was unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord laughed, \"Well, it appears somepony is an adult in the mind, right Sunny?! I am loving the past several minutes!\"</span></div></div>",

She was surrounded by a group of rather familiar young female highschoolers. No, she knew exactly who they were! It was Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie! They towered over her now, very similar to sky scrapers. Just looking up at them made Sunset feel dizzy and lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer shifted slightly when she felt something thick and soft between her legal. She looked down and noticed that she was wearing a diaper. A DIAPER! She felt so helpless and weak; she was confined to a cotton prison. Looking further down, Sunset Shimmer noticed that she was lying in a crib, and that she was no older than eight months old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?! What did you guys do to me?!\" Sunset tried to say. But her efforts in communication resulted in irritated baby babbling. \"Aww, she's trying to talk! Too bad she can't,\" a smug-looking Rainbow Dash chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I can't talk?!\" Shimmer blabbered and prattled on incoherent and slurred nonsense, trying to speak as the group of girls giggled at her attempts. \"Turn me back to normal now!\" Sunset Shimmer beat on the bars of the crib in frustration, screaming her displeasure as she drummed her heels on the padding of the cot she laid in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer unstably stood up with her pudgy legs and gripped the upper clasp of the cot with her tiny hands. \"You're all gonna pay for this!\" Suddenly, Sunset's bladder and bowels decided to evacuate themselves. Shimmer had a look of embarrassed horror on her face as the soft stools fell from her bottom and landed onto the growing pile she was making between her legs with an almost soundless plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer seemed to be having trouble comprehending on what was happening to her. She could easily feel the diaper jerk slightly as each last log departed her colon involuntarily. The more she filled her diaper, the heavier and harder it became to hold up. Finally, she felt like she had finished and she plopped down into the crib, a pronounced 'squelch' adding to the fact that she had inadvertently messed herself without knowing it. Sunset Shimmer grimaced as she felt the slimy mess of her own leavings pressed up against her bottom and smeared it all over her crotch. She couldn't take any more and she instantly began to scream and wail like an infant in distress.</span></div></div>",

The small baby girl began to softly cry, tears seeping out of the corners of her eyes and melting down her cheeks in profusion. Her toothless gums could not contain her spit and drool quickly escaped her lips and coursed down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stroked the small girl's tears away with her dainty finger and smiled down sweetly at Sunset. \"But don't worry...you will be in good hands. You have me and the girls to take care of you.\" The purple teenager reassured the infant that dangled within her arms helplessly. Sunset Shimmer wept silently as Twilight continued to gently stroke her while murmuring consoling words to her, although they didn't seem to improve the problem right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer gazed up into Twilight's plum-colored eyes. Twilight stared right back down at her with so much love, concern, and maternal compassion that made her feel guilty for all of the horrid things she had done to her and her friends prior to the fall formal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Shimmer suddenly felt a hungry sensation in her stomach. She clutched her stomach and began to impotently punch her protuberant baby's gut with her pudgy hand. Twilight noticed this right away and gently took ahold of Sunset's hand, \"No-no, Sunny, don't hurt your tummy. It's just telling you that it's hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset flinched at the new nickname that Twilight had given her and frowned as her stomach let out a sonorous growl. \"Oh my, Sunset, when was the last time you ate?\" Twilight giggled. Sunset blushed at the condescending question. Twilight held the orange baby girl up to her eye level and smiled tolerantly, \"I think we should get some food in you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset had to agree. She was pretty hungry, and she had skipped lunch earlier that day. There was no use fighting it. She knew that she needed food to nourish and sustain her while she was trapped inside this infant's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight decided that Sunset's blank expression was enough to tell her that she was indeed hungry. Twilight carried Sunset Shimmer over to a small highchair. She placed her in the trayless chair and drew the strap up between her legs, fastening the strap securely behind her so she couldn't climb out of the chair while her back was turned. Then Twilight took the wooden tray that leaned against the rear of the chair legs and locked it in place in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset felt humiliated by her state of undress and the circumstances of her meal. The thought of being belted into a high chair wearing nothing but a diaper and an infant's feeding bib was utterly degrading. While she waited for Twilight to heat her food, she drew circles in the high chair tray with the pudgy index finger of her right hand as Twilight stepped behind the high chair to fasten a small towel around her neck for a feeding bib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pronounced beep signaled that Sunset Shimmer's meal was heated. Twilight took the plastic bowl of pureed food out of the microwave and placed it onto the tray of the highchair. Sunset was able to get a glimpse at the meal that Twilight had selected for her. Macaroni and cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mac and cheese was, oddly, one of Sunset's all-time favorite foods. This did seem to brighten up her mood a little bit. Twilight took a small, rubber-coated baby spoon and measured out a tiny portion of the gooey meal onto the spoon. She then ladled the spoonful into Sunset's mouth. The moment the food hit her tastebuds, Sunset was immediately infatuated with it. She gobbled it down faster than Twilight could spoon it in until she had finished the entire bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer was a glorious joyful mess; her face was smeared with the gooey mac and cheese. A shapeless yellow ring of liquid cheese had formed around Sunset's mouth. Even a dab of the cheese had gotten onto the tip of her nose. Sunset looked down at herself and realized how messily she had eaten. The bib looked like it had more mac and cheese on it than there was inside her stomach. Some of it had even dripped onto her fatty baby belly that protruded outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sunny, looks like you've just proven to me that you can't feed yourself.

I think after eating all of that mac and cheese, you deserve a nice relaxing bath.

This was a chance she had to take and just simply started to play along and slowly nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Twilight could respond, the door behind her slowly starting to open, Sunset quickly panicked as to who would enter the nursery at a time like this and began to struggle out of her highchair bonds as quick as her little body allowed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess turned around and noticed the door open slowly to reveal Spike coming through the door.

She IS a mess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer blushed. She was already embarressed being seen a complete mess around Twilight, but being around another person, or in this case, a talking dog, was more than she could tolerate. Sunset began to softly cry again, the small rivulets of tears that trailed down her face adding to the sticky wads of liquid cheese on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't cry, Sunny,\" Twilight 'awww'ed as she put her hands under Sunset's underarms and lifted her out of the highchair. \"Thanks for the supplies, Spike.\" Twilight gave her faithful pet a smile. Spike narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, right,\" Twilight chuckled. She withdrew a small dog treat from her pocket and put it on the floor, to which Spike immediately gobbled it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get you a bath.\" Twilight said, smiling gently down at the former teenaged girl. She walked over to the changing table and Sunset was surprised to see something she never saw sitting there before. It was a large, pink plastic baby tub that was fit perfectly for her size. There was a soft cushioning at rim of the tub to keep the baby comfortable while it would be bathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer was then carefully laid down into the tub that was already half-filled with a reasonable quantity of lukewarm water. Twilight held up a small, dampened rag and began to scrub the liquid cheese particles off of Sunset's skin until she was spotless. Twilight was satisfied with the results and she proceeded to washed her former rival with another cloth that had been lathered well with a bar of baby soap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her own good, Sunset decided that she would stay still. She did feel dirty and a nice bath would do her some good. She watched as Twilight paid close attention to her little foot soles and in between her toes. Twilight washed every part of Sunset's body, even behind her ears. As she was being rinsed off, Shimmer felt so much cleaner and so much more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, bathtime was done for and Sunset Shimmer was quickly buffed dry with a fluffy warm towel. Twilight then laid her back down onto the changing table and began to sprinkle the young tot's body sparingly with baby powder, making sure every crevasse of her body was coated with the soft powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good girl, Sunny, yes you are, yes you are!\" Twilight cooed as she slipped a new diaper onto Sunset's backside. Sunset couldn't help but hold back the twinge of a smile. It wasn't an evil or devious smile, but a genuine, happy smile. She felt so safe and protected and secure when she was with Twilight, it was so strange to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight noticed her former rival's beaming expression and smiled broadly as she worked a red baby sleeper onto Sunset's body. Once she was fully clothed, Twilight laid Sunset Shimmer back down into her crib. \"Okay Sunny, I'll be back in a little while, okay?\" Twilight smiled as she then left the room and locked the door, just to Sunset's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Twilight left, Sunset Shimmer began to weep again. \"Nooo! Don't leave me here again! I-I need you! W-what if I have another dirty diaper again?! Please, come back!\" She wailed, although a mishmash of slurred gurgling was the only thing that emerged from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her small fit, Sunset couldn't help but notice a a glimmering object in the corner of the cot she laid in. She sniveled silently as she crawled on her belly over to the object. When she came close enough, she realized that it was....</span></div></div>",

She used all of her strength to lift herself up off her bottom and stand on her two little pudgy feet, but it wasn't long before she dropped back down onto her diapered rear as her weight gave way to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms and started to think about the common design of a crib, there was always a mechanism that kept the wooden bars in place, climbing out was out of the question, she could barely even stand up to properly lift herself over.

The wooden bars she leaned against swooned right open, letting her free from the wooden prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed out of the crib and looked around the huge nursery, everything had gotten bigger before her very eyes, now she was free to crawl to whatever she wanted.</span></div></div>",

Sshh... Its okay Sunny, please calm down. Twilight is here, don't worry, I'll fix up your little boo boo.\" First instinct was to calm down the weeping infant and defuse the situation, strange enough Sunset held onto Twilight tighter than she was doing with Sunset. Twilight picked up Sunset's pacifier off the floor and gave it back to the infant and put it in her mouth. \"There we go, problem solved, you can stop crying now. I'm not mad at you for escaping your crib. I should've known better than to leave you alone with mean ol' Spikey-Wikey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset's cries for care soon simmered down and Twilight forced a smile despite the awful bump on the infants head, she then frowned slightly and turned round to face Spike who was now poking his head through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike.\" Twilight glared at her companion. \"What were you trying to do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Twilight.\" Spike lowered his head in shame. \"It wasn't my fault though! She got out of the crib and she tried to pull on my tail! What was I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've talked to her. I think she still understands what were saying.\" Twilight took her eyes off from her canine companion and now focused back on Sunset Shimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike came back in the nursery and kicked the door closed and moved back to his original sleeping position and lay himself down. On the other hand, Twilight took Sunset Shimmer back to the crib and this time placed Sunset down in the open crib and sat down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that about Sunny. We're not used to looking after a little cute baby such as yourself, after all what's happened after you tried to steal the crown. My friends are coming back soon after they finish their classes to look after you together.\" Twilight smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in time, Sunset didn't care about the others, it was Twilight for some reason who she really trusted. She didn't laugh, nor taunt at her new body and neither did she rub in the fact that she defeated her using the very crown she was destined to steal. Sunset didn't care anymore, she crawled over to Twilight and stretched her little arms up at her face. She wanted to be hugged again.</span></div></div>",

The infant was in her crib as happy as can be, her logical and rational thought was pushed back into the deep dark depths of her mind and continued to enjoy life as an infant to the fullest. If she made a mess, no worries, Twilight would be there. If she was hungry, not a problem, Twilight would always be there to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she lay in the crib feeling full up on delicious milk, she felt incredibly energetic to say the least. She turned her head and found Spike lying down in a corner of the crib nestled deep in the soft blankets loudly snoring, the puppy laid down on his back with his paws up into the air with his tail wagging ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset knew what she wanted to do. A side of her wanted to go over and complete her unfinished business with the puppy and hug him to feel his soft short fur, besides the lack of toys within the crib she wanted to get a very close up look. She began to make her way over to the puppy by crawling on her stomach, as she moved closer and closer to the puppy her smile began to get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally when she managed to get within arms reach, she began to wrap her arms around Spike's chest and embrace him into a big hug. But that didn't seem to last long as the puppy once again rose from his spot and let out a big yelp of distress. Sunset was immediately pushed back from Spikes force and landed onto a soft pillow, she giggled loudly and Spike held himself up against the wooden bars, standing on his two hind legs with his front legs stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Sunset!

Help! She won't stop bugging me!!\" Spike quailed. Twilight noticed that Sunset was wiggling and rolling around, giggling wildly as drool slipped past her gums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight narrowed her eyes. \"It doesn't look like she's bothering you to me.\" \"Twi, please!

He flinched in disgust as he noticed the rancid aroma was protruding from the young infant before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer paused as her adult mind flashed back to her. She realized what she had just done in her diaper in the presence of two people, one being a talking dog. She stood up on her wobbly, unstable baby legs and tried to run to the other side of the crib in humiliation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, her toes caught a fold in the sheet and she fell, twisting in the air to land flat in the mess that was accommodated within her diaper. Sunset's eyes sprang wide open as she felt the pressure of her fall make the foul ooze in the back of her diaper mush up between her legs and into her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm trickle started running down the insides of her legs and pooled in the mess in which she sat as her bladder emptied itself involuntarily.

She counted all of the small cracks and shaped them into imaginary animals with her finger, tracing them like a connect-the-dot game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer eventually became visibly and audibly bored of her make-believe game. She rolled onto her side when she noticed a small, furry object in the corner of the crib. She figured that it was Spike, but she noticed that it wasn't moving or breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset soon became curious, and now that she was fully-awake, she wanted to do some exploring. She crawled over to the object and noticed a small brownish-red teddy bear sitting in the corner, a happy smile stitched across it's face with two blue buttons for eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up. It was as if she'd never seen anything so..so...fascinating before in her life. She forcefully pushed her adult mind to the back of her head once again and let her infantile curiosity get the best of her for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset slowly extended a pudgy arm and grasped the small teddy bear. She felt a stab of reassurance and comfort as soon as she touched the stuffed animal, so she grabbed ahold of it and began to hug and squeeze it tighter than a mother holding it's young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset, now feeling a little more than sleepy, decided it was time to catch some more Z's.

I hope that isn't any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't.\" The Vice Principal smiled. Luna slowly walked over to the crib and leaned over to see Sunset Shimmer wrapped in her thick blankets donned with her pacifier and sleeper. \"For the first lesson, I want to show you how to handle an infant with great care. I know you're an excellent learner and I hope you can do this without too much trouble.\" Luna picked up Sunset and held her close to her chest, with one hand on Sunset's back and another on her bottom as a pretend seat to support the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight carefully noted where Luna's arms went and they all made sense, her eyes widened as the lesson began and realized the mistake she had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed that you have held Sunset with both arms on her back with a tight grip in an attempt to keep her in one place. That is wrong, ironically, I made the same mistake when I first worked at the Daycare Centre years ago. But don't forget, she must be leaning on your chest and that you kept a hand rested on her bottom to make sure she is seated correctly. You try.\" Luna handed Sunset over to Twilight who slowly tried to copy what Luna had just done, without much error she placed her hand on the infants bottom and the other on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sunset couldn't give her own opinion on the lesson, she did feel more comfortable with a hand to seat her bottom. No longer did she have to clench on to Twilight tighter than she could and now she could relax and let the Princess do all the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Luna cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next hour, Luna educates Twilight on how to properly care for an infant. As for the current lesson, Sunset Shimmer is relaxing in a bathtub of warm water, luxuriating in a mountain of frothy bath bubbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now for your next lesson: Bathing the baby.\" Luna began. She carefully cupped her hand behind Sunset's small head, supporting her neck and back as she arched her slightly into the air. Luna picked up a sponge and began to gently  wash Sunset's backside with the sponge, deftly preforming the craft as if she was born to do it while Twilight watched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you support her head, neck, and back carefully,\" Luna reminded Twilight as the purple teenager followed her \"teacher's\" instructions and repeated what she had done to Sunset. Sunset Shimmer, on the other hand, was all smiles as she felt Twilight's dainty, feather-like caresses gently cleansing her smooth, delicate skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the next step. Washing the baby's hair. It's a tad bit harder than washing the baby itself, but I know that you'll get through it easily.\" Luna positioned Sunset's small head in her hand again as she poured a cup of lukewarm water over the small girl's head, rinsing it and soon thoroughly soaping it with baby shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, intrigued, watched as Luna reminded her on how to correctly clean a baby in a way where both the baby and caregiver were comfortable. Twilight quickly realized all the mistakes she had made previously and what she had forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sunset Shimmer was loving every moment of this. She giggled and softly kicked her feet in the air, splashing both Luna and Twilight with water and suds. Luna returned fire by lightly splashing the nine-month-old Sunset with the bubbly water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset, disoriented for only a moment, promptly retaliated by using her pudgy baby hand to splash Luna in turn. Unfortunately, Luna stepped out of the way and the water splashed Twilight instead of Sunset's anticipated target. Soon it all broke out in an all-out water war and Twilight couldn't help but indulge in all the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all good things had to come to an end and soon Sunset Shimmer found herself being gently buffed dry with a warm towel by Luna, who was still tutoring Twilight on how to correctly dry an infant. Like before, Twilight cautiously listened, nodding from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, it's time to dress the baby.\" Luna said as she carried Sunset over to the changing table. The Vice Principal seized a diaper, a package of wet wipes, and a container full of powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping both of Sunset's ankles in her hand, Luna slipped the diaper underneath Sunset's backside and lowered her back down. Sunset Shimmer squirmed and wiggled impotently as Luna attempted to latch the diaper's adhesive tabs onto the front of the padding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please hold her still, Twilight?\" Luna asked, and immediately, Twilight did as she was ordered. Much to Sunset's dismay, Luna and Twilight were able to affix the new diaper onto her body. Luna sighed in relief, \"She truly is a little troublemaker, isn't she?\" The Vice Principal quipped, Twilight chuckling a bit in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that little moment, Luna showed Twilight how to dress a baby. The Vice Principal had selected a red and yellow-striped, one-piece baby romper for Sunset to wear. Although Sunset tried to protest, she immediately found her favorite red pacifier being shoved into her mouth to hush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, this little one is probably hungry.\" Luna said, handing Sunset Shimmer to Twilight, who held her the proper way this time. Twilight proceeded to sit little Sunset into the highchair and promptly locked her into the tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset watched in pure boredom as the two \"grown-ups\" chatted on, the tall blue lady talking the most. Sunset Shimmer eagerly watched Twilight prepare a small dish for her, Luna by her side, teaching her step-by-step. Sunset gave a toothless grin of ecstasy as Twilight placed a bowl of shapeless green slop onto her highchair tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sunny,\" Twilight chimed as she ladled up a spoonful of the suspiciously-green sludge with a rubber-coated baby spoon and moved the pile towards Sunset Shimmer's mouth. \"Open up! Time for some yummy peas and spinach!\" She crooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset grimaced and firmly clamped her mouth shut. Now that she was a baby, she HATED peas and spinach! \"Oh come on now, it's good for you!\" Twilight urged. Sunset kept her lips sealed, even as Twilight began to smear the green gunk across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Twilight Sparkle, let me show you an old trick.\" Luna said, taking the spoon from Twilight. She moved the spoon towards Sunset's mouth like Twilight did, \"Okay, Sunset Shimmer, open up the hanger door and eat your din-din!\", Luna cajoled. Sunset kept her mouth shut. \"Now Sunset, you need to open up and eat your dinner.\" The Vice Principal admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset reluctantly opened her mouth, yet it wasn't big enough to allow Luna to feed her. \"I expected that reaction. Are you sure you don't want to eat your dinner?\" Luna chimed. Sunset nodded, her lips still sealed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'm sure you wouldn't mind if the Tickle Monster paid you a visit, then!\" Luna she held the spoon out in front of her with one hand, while she reached down to the foot rest with the other and lightly prickled Sunset's foot sole with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer managed to maintain her stern expression about five minutes before she cracked and began giggling uncontrollably. Luna continued to tickle her until she was convulsed with open-mouthed breathless laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, like a venomous snake striking, the spoon darted forward and deposited its pureed load of vegetable muck into her gaping mouth. Sunset gagged, sickened, but swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to choke me?!\" Sunset Shimmer asked accusingly. Instead of fluent english, however, only a string of slurred dribble emerged from her maw. But Luna took this opportunity to shovel another spoonful in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer swallowed the disgusting pap and opened her mouth submissively for another spoonful. She couldn't fight her in her present condition, she knew. Resistance was futile when your only weapon was an infant's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna continued to feed Sunset the rest of the bowl until nothing had been left behind. \"And that, Twilight Sparkle, is how to feed a baby.\" Luna told her 'student' as she wiped Sunset's face off with a damp terry cloth rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and then asked, \"Don't we have to feed her a bottle?\" \"Why, of course. I was just about to get to that.\" Luna smiled. The Vice Principal elevated Sunset out of the highchair and said to Twilight, \"I already heated up a bottle. It's over there on the counter.\" She gestured her body towards the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight saw the bottle and seized it, then passed it to Luna. Sunset Shimmer's eyelids began to droop sleepy. The Vice Principal took this opportunity to feed Sunset her bottle to lull her to sleep faster. While she hummed a quiet melody, Luna aimed the nipple of the bottle towards Sunset's mouth and watched with satisfaction as her mouth instinctively latched onto the nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer proceeded to suckle, her infantine reflexes taking over as she nursed on the bottle. A thin jet of the rich, creamy milk spewed into her mouth and flowed down her tongue in swift swigs. It felt unbelievably good and Sunset increased her pace of suckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a good baby for a former villain and all. So submissive and obedient.\" Luna murmured to Twilight, who nodded in agreement. \"Besides the fact that she caused trouble in the past, she's really sweet once you get to spend time with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, hollow slurp signaled to the two of them that Sunset Shimmer was finishing off the last drops of the bottle. Once she did, Sunset felt a sudden rising pain that erupted from her stomach and rose into her throat. Twilight noticed the sour look on Sunset's face and smiled, \"Oh, I think she needs to be burped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded and handed Sunset Shimmer to Twilight, taking the now empty bottle out of Sunset's grasp. \"Go ahead and burp her.\" She instructed. Twilight compiled and gently began to pat Sunset's back, almost immediately receiving a loud burp from Sunset in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her belch, Sunset sighed in relief as the air trapped in her esophagus was released. She draped her chin over Twilight's shoulder and slowly closed her eyes, letting dreams begin to unfold within her mind as she floated off to the sea of naptime.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunset Shimmer's peaceful nap was abruptly interrupted when she was awoken by the sound of someone, or something, walking all over her bed on all fours. Suddenly, she felt something wet, sticky, and slobber-ridden gently brush against her cheek. When she opened her eyes to see what had disturbed her afternoon rest, she was surprised to see Spike, trying to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Sunset. You're all wet and you soaked the bedsheets,\" Spike whispered. Sunset's eyes sprang wide opened as she shifted slightly to verify this. Indeed; she did feel wet. The inside of her diaper was soggy and the hot stickiness of the diaper pressed up against her loins. Her crotch felt very irritated and it burned profusely, confirming that Sunset Shimmer had a diaper rash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset sighed as she gingerly sat up in the cot, her diaper pressing up further against her bottom, a gentle, pronounced 'squish' emitting from her wet garment. \"Oh well; at least I'm not that wet. Maybe I'm getting my control back,\" She smiled at the thought, but it was interrupted by the irritated rash that radiated from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset flinched in pain and let out a small cry that was loud enough to draw the nearby attention of Twilight, who was sitting on a chair, reading a book. Twilight immediately placed the book down and stood up from her chair, rushing over to the side of the crib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess gently lifted Sunset up, this time holding her correctly, one hand supporting Sunset's head and neck whilst the other protectively held the baby's pajama-covered, diapered bottom. This set her off and Sunset Shimmer began to cry louder, her cries of pain not quite a wail, but at the same time not a cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Sunny?\" Twilight murmured as she whispered sweet nothings into Sunset's ear to try and calm her. \"Are you wet?\" She felt the baby's diaper, and suddenly realized it was expanding, only slightly. \"Aww, Sunny, did you 'oopsie'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset realized what she had just done in her diaper and sighed. It was bound to happen again, afterall. Who didn't expect it from a little baby like her? To prove her point, Sunset began to wail loudly and tearlessly. \"Aww, shh, it's okay Sunset. I'll clean you up in no time. Just relax and let me do the work and it'll all be over soon, I promise.\" Twilight assured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's clean you up, sweetie.\u201d She carried her charge towards the changing table. Sunset Shimmer was on the verge of tears, and would have broken down had it not been for Twilight\u2019s reassuring presence and gentle cooing. \u201cGood girl. Pretty girl. Sweet girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully laid Sunset onto the mesh-padded cushioning of the changing table and wiped a tear from the small child's cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey, don\u2019t cry. You\u2019re just a little baby, you couldn't help it. You're such a good girl, Sunny. Such a sweet little baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight continued to praise Sunset Shimmer with soothing endearment as she pulled out the supplies to begin the change. Sunset tearfully watched as Twilight unbuttoned her sleeper and put it aside to later deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Twilight unfastened the front of the diaper, a strong reek of soured urine assailed her nostrils. She shook her head with motherly forbearance and quickly removed the chafing, irritating garment and wiped the stale pee from Sunset Shimmer's loins with a baby wipe, then tied the old diaper into a neat bundle before swiftly hurling it into the wastebin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Twilight cooed to the fretful infant as she lifted her chubby legs high into the air and affixed a fresh diaper underneath her. Sunset gave a tiny smile as Twilight laid her bottom down onto the diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sunset felt the Princess rubbing cool, wet rash cream into her skin. She giggled as Twilight's strong fingers worked the cold cream into her seat, kneading and molding the cream into her irritated bottom. She felt a light rain of powder falling on her appreciative lower cheeks, and her legs being lowered as the process was repeated across her privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then folded the front of the diaper over Sunset Shimmer's front and pinned the adhesive tapes onto it, securely encasing the white bulky garment over the young girl's waist. \"There we go, no more tears.\" Twilight smiled as she lifted the half-naked baby girl into the air and nuzzled her nose to Sunset's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer smiled and giggled a bit. She was truly enjoying this treatment and she actually felt appreciated and loved for once. She let her adult mind slip back into the deep darkness of her head and let her infantine side get the best of her once again. She cooed and blew delighted bubbles of spit, giggling happily as Twilight hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Piles of toys and soft cuddly animals were scattered on the soft play mat ready to be used by Sunset Shimmer and sometimes Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sat down normally keeping her legs crossed and picked up one of the stuffed toy animals and handed it to an excited Sunset Shimmer. The infant crawled over to the toy and reached up and grabbed it, drool and all sorts of babble was coming out of her mouth yet she didn't care, there were toys infront of her and that didn't matter. She wrapped her arms around the toy completely and hugged it as tight as she could and continued to let out babble and gibberish out of her mouth now that she had the toy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Twilight could do anything she heard the nursery door open and saw both Principal Celestia and Luna enter the room slowly, she got up from her seat and quickly stood attention, leaving little Sunset Shimmer on the floor to play with her new toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Principal Celestia.\" Twilight smiled. \"Luna.\" She also nodded to the other Principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that Luna was giving you private lessons on looking after Sunset Shimmer, did you learn anything useful?\" Celestia smiled and looked down to see the infant. While Sunset Shimmer ignored the guests and continued on playing with her new toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned a lot of things from Principal Luna. I learned how to hold her up properly and to give her a bath correctly. I enjoyed the lessons and after Luna left, Sunset Shimmer and I sat down and got some of the toys out of the toy chest.\" Twilight then sat back down and crossed her legs, at the same time Celestia and Luna both kneeled down to get a closer look at the happy infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason we came here Twilight Sparkle is because we understand that you're her guardian and somewhat of a parent.\" Celestia leaned a little closer to Twilight and began to talk. \"I was wondering if you'd like to take Sunset Shimmer out of the nursery today for a playdate with the other babies. The Cake Family who you know have their two little children around the same age as Sunset and I personally asked them if they have time for you to go to their house and have a fun time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought about the offer for a moment and instantly questions popped up in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do they live?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't important Twilight. I can take you there in my car they don't live very far away from here neither and their house has a memorable design which I'm sure you'll take note of.\" Celestia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The excitement with the toys on the floor was just whizzing past her mind like an explosion, in all of her years she had never done something so fun and relaxing in such a long time that she shook her body and wanted to be put back down to continue with the fun. She let out another string of baby babble and dug her head into Twilight's chest and latched onto her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at the Principals beside her and smiled. \"I think she really wants to go out and have a little fun. I think she will like playing with the other babies so she'll have little friends of her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled a little. \"Unfortunately I won't be able to join you three at this little get together, but I'm sure it will a lot of fun for little Sunset. As for me? I have work to do and check up on the students who stayed behind today in detention.\" She leaned forward which caught Sunset's attention. \"Have fun little Sunny. Don't get too tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Luna exited the nursery and left the door open. Twilight and Celestia didn't speak to each other but they had the same idea to grab some baby supplies, toys and Sunset's red pacifier for the journey to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Celestia and Twilight left High School and began to head towards the parking lot at the side of the complex. The Principal dug her hands into her trouser pocket and pulled out a pair of keys and headed towards a small white Mini Convertible and opened the door for Twilight at the passenger side. Twilight slowly got into the vehicle with Sunset still wrapped in her arms now donned in a light pink onesie with her red pacifier stuffed in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia opened the drivers door and lowered herself into her seat and put the keys into the vehicle and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Sunset comfortable on your lap? I don't have a baby seat for her so this might be a little dangerous, but since the Cakes House is pretty close to the High School we'll be alright.\" Celestia turned and looked out of the back window and began to reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took a quick glance at the infant and still noticed that Sunset was still latched onto her. \"Sunny is fine. She's holding onto me tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mini reversed out of its parking spot and finally was able to make a move. It slowly got out of the parking lot and went onto the main road and turned for the suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride wasn't very long and there was a steady flow of traffic on the streets. Twilight looked out of the window beside her and lifted up Sunset Shimmer so she could get the view of the car going down road after road. As for her she kept quiet, her pacifier was more than enough to keep her occupied and her diaper still felt clean and soft like how it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stopped the car and looked out of her window and looked back at Twilight. \"Here we are!\" She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and carefully pushed the door open with Sunset still in her arms and took a good look at the house Celestia had pointed at. A regular semi-detached house with a design that all of the other buildings around her seemed to share. She walked over to the front lawn and looked behind to see Celestia still in the car, this time, poking her head out of the window slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get back home Twilight, but I'll come and pick you and Sunny up at half six, how does that sound?\" Celestia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine. Take your time.\" Twilight smiled. \"Thanks for the ride here. I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Twilight Sparkle. You're always a pleasure to be around.\" Celestia smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia leaned back in her seat and drove off into the distance, leaving Twilight to knock the door and start the play-date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The baby's mouth was wrapped around a blue pacifier with a rainbow lightning bolt emanating from a cloud on the shield of the pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Pinkie Pie's arms held two babies rather than one.

The orange baby was sucking on a green pacifier with an apple on the shield. The baby's eyes were squinting contentedly, or quite possibly, angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's face was clouded with a mix of dazed puzzlement and disbelief. \"Whaa-?

Just no fussing, okay cutie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Applejack wasn't one to surrender. She whimpered disconsolately, waving her arms around wildly and violently drumming her heels on the padding of the changing table, slamming her legs down with such force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl squeezed her eyes shut with all of the force she could summon from her baby muscles as she tried to build a dam in her eyes to prevent the tears from spilling. Applejack clearly wasn't going to give up, not anytime soon at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie, now sporting a stern look, spoke up, \"Now Applejack,\" The pink teenager chided in a commanding tone, \"No more fussing, alright? Turn that frown upside down and we'll wipe those bluey-blues right out of your system in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, however, continued to thrash about, squirming uselessly. At that moment, Pinkie Pie completely overpowered her. The pink teenager grabbed both of Applejack's ankles and lifted them into the air. Finally Applejack gave up after a long fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak with exhaustion from her struggling, Applejack lie on the changing table, letting her waterworks flow as she painfully watched her friend change her diaper. Pinkie pulled down the front of the diaper to see what damage Applejack had done to her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a mess. Applejack had managed to cover not only her bottom with the sticky goo, but it had fallen into the front of the diaper in front as she knelt on the floor and had smeared itself all over the front panel of the diaper. She was covered from stem to stern in baby poo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie shook her head with maternal forbearance and grinned as she lovingly maneuvered a series of moist towelettes around Applejack's bottom. After a handful of thorough swipes she was completely clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed in relief as she watched Pinkie conclude the diaper change with a quick dusting of powder and a new diaper. When the whole ordeal was over with, Pinkie gently lowered Applejack to the floor, lying her next to the other eight and nine-month-olds on the carpet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled over to Rainbow Dash and Rarity, only to find that Rainbow Dash was gone. \"Where's Rainbow Dash? Ah need to talk to her,\" Applejack asked her other regressed friend. Rarity shrugged and sent a message telepathically to Applejack. Now that they were infants, it was possible for them to communicate in their own ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I saw her, Fluttershy took her into the other room. She said she was going to feed her. I don't see why she simply didn't just give her a bottle in here, though.\" Rarity replied. Applejack turned to look at the adults, who were chatting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting to be too much. We didn't even deserve this punishment anyways,\" She plopped to the floor, landing on her diapered bottom which made her cringe. \"Ah miss my old body. Even high school is better than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, Applejack,\" Rarity gave a cute rosebud smile from behind the pacifier in her mouth, \"I'm sure this will all be over soon.\" Applejack was stunned, \"You're like this punishment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aside from the diaper changes, of course I do!\" Rarity blushed a bit as she continued, \"It is very nice to not have any responsibilities of my own. It's stress free and oh-so-relaxing,\" The ivory baby smoothed out her short purple ringlets, \"And my hair still looks fab-u-looooouus!\" She squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah never thought I'd here that comin' from you, Rarity,\" Applejack looked down at her infantilized figure and sighed, \"Ah miss working at the farm, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity patted her friend on the back sympathetically, \"Not to worry, darling! I'm sure our families understand that this is the correct punishment for our wayward behavior days ago. After all, we were a bit harsh on poor Sunset Shimmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess you're right, Rarity.\" Applejack gave a half smile. \"Ah'm gonna go apologize to her.\" The orange toddler knelt on all fours as she crawled towards Sunset, who was tossing a ball back and forth to the Cake twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunset Shimmer?\" Sunset's eyes widened slightly at the familiar voice in her head. She turned her young head around and her eyes immediately narrowed, \"What do you want?\" She replied coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack shot her a guilty expression. \"Ah just wanted to apologize fer mah behavior a few days back. Ah'm sorry, Sunset. Ah should have acted much more mature than that, and, well, now,\" She gestured to her small body, \"I pretty much have the right to act as immature as I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset's face softened as she wiped a thin rivulet of drool from her chin, \"Don't worry about it. Water under the bridge.\" She gurgled happily as she crawled over to Applejack and clumsily wrapped her into a hug. \"We can start over. I sure have learned my lesson.\" Sunset sat onto the carpet and smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She beamed down at the six infants below that knelt at her feet and stooped down onto her knees next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we go! One for you,\" Mrs. Cake passed out teething biscuits to the older babies (Sunset, Pound, and Pumpkin), then handed a bottle of milk to the other three (Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice snack, sweeties!\" With that, Mrs. Cake left the room, once again carefully locking the door behind her. Applejack promptly spit out her biscuit, \"What in tarnation is this supposed to be?\" She gagged. Rainbow Dash nibbled on her biscuit, \"I don't know, but my gums suddenly feel 20% better.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do agree, my bare gums have been aching to the slightest touch, and these lovely biscuits sure do the trick!\" Rarity exclaimed as she gummed down on her biscuit, thin strings of slimy drool falling from her slack lips as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was stunned. She looked at her biscuit in amazement and slowly put it inside her mouth to the test. Her toothless gums had been hurting badly ever since she was transformed, so maybe it wouldn't hurt as much. After a minute's worth of chewing, Applejack's gums felt at ease, no longer did they ache or burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with the other babies, Sunset and the twins were happily sucking away at their bottles. The trickle of cold milk going down her tongue felt unbelievably satisfying, to say the least. Sunset's stomach wrapped itself contentedly around her meal as she drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bubbles of air gurgled up through the nipple of the bottle, Sunset knew she had finished and sadly pulled the nipple out of her mouth. Milky drool escaped her lips and ran down the corners of her mouth and chin. Sunset put her bottle aside once she spotted something shy in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily gurgling and babbling to herself, Sunset crawled over to the area and seized the object. She giggled as she began to place the toy inside of her mouth to mindlessly chew on like any other curious infant. Although her adult mind attempted to intrude and ruin the experience for Baby Sunny, her juvenile side once again triumphed over her adult mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the foreign object was sticking out of her mouth, Baby Sunny twirled her tongue around, feeling it's texture. She giggled; it had a very smooth surface and was shaped like a ball. She squeezed the object inside of her mouth with her gums and it produced a soft squeak. It was a ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby Sunny began to giggle uproariously; never in her life did she find something so simple so amusing. Then again, simple things amuse simple minds, and at the moment Sunny didn't quite have her mind. She squeezed it again, this time spitting it out and using her hands. It squeaked again and more giggles emerged from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her new favorite toy, Sunset crept back over to the group to parade around with her new toy. Pound and Pumpkin soon noticed and followed after Sunset, giggling as they all crawled around in a huge, spread-out circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cold milk inside her stomach was making her tired and she was ready for a nap. Extending her chubby arms towards Mrs. Cake, she was then laid into a spare crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't no way ah'm takin' a nap inside of a dang crib!\" Applejack protested. Much to her dismay, she let out a massive yawn. Unfortunately for her, Mrs. Cake noticed and smiled as she laid her inside the crib with Sunset. The same thing repeated with Rarity and Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all of the babies were tucked in, Mrs. Cake popped pacifiers in each little mouth that was open and unoccupied. Sunset smiled in her sleep contentedly as she nursed on her prized red pacifier while clutching her beloved stuffed bunny Wah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, however, wasn't having any of it. She fussed and kicked and whimpered, almost hitting her fellow friends in the process. Mrs. Cake was quickly aware of Applejack's tantrum and wordlessly lifted the orange baby out of the crib, cooing, \"My my my, someone is too fussy to take her nap. Well, we can fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was absolutely horrified when Mrs. Cake carried her to the corner of the nursery. She gently placed her inside a small white swing that was powered by a windup music box and let the motion of the swing and tinkling notes of the music box sooth her to sleep with its tiny mechanical lullaby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"A\" frame of metal support pipes on either side was more than sufficient to maintain stability of the swing. Little AJ couldn't fall out or tip the swing over no matter how hard she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep seat and her freely-hanging legs gave her no purchase to push or pull herself out of the seat. She couldn't have gotten out of the swing unassisted even if she had wanted to free herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake smiled maternally as the gentle rocking and swaying motions of the swing slowly began to lull Applejack to sleep. She struggled to keep her drooping eyelids open, but the reassuring humming and tinkling of the music box was too much. She instantly dozed off, dreams of early youth unfolding within her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake left Applejack in the swing for another ten minutes before carefully lifting her out, staying vigilant in case she was to wake her. If Applejack was woken up and started to cry, she was sure to set off the other sleeping tots. If that happened, the room would be filled with the anguished wails of disturbed infants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lying Applejack inside the crib alongside Sunset, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, Mrs. Cake turned on the mobiles that hung over both cribs and grinned as they slowly rotated, the tiny figurines dangling from their hooks as they spun in a counter-clockwise motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each infant now resting in a peaceful sleep, Mrs. Cake silently left the nursery.</span></div></div>",

The Princess nodded understandingly, \"Awww, it's okay Sunny. Don't cry; I'll clean you up,\" She picked Sunset up and carried her over to the changing table to change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset lay in front of Twilight on her back, clothed solely in a sunny smile and the perfect aplomb of infancy. She sucked on her thumb idly as she waved her legs up and down without a hint of shame at her exposed nakedness. Twilight giggled at Baby Sunny's antics and deftly taped the new diaper to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the change was over and dealt with, Twilight quietly laid Sunset back into her crib with the others. Suddenly another pungent odor assaulted her nostrils. Pinching her nose shut, Twilight smiled tolerantly once she saw the growing wet stain on the front of Applejack's diaper and her ever-so-slowly expanding backside. She knew that Applejack was wet and messed her diaper in her sleep right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight decided to check the other babies' diapers, just in case. It wasn't uncommon for babies to wet or mess themselves in their sleep, especially after eating. She placed two fingers down Rainbow Dash's diaper to check if she was wet. Inevitably, she was. She did the same for Rarity and the Cake twins and she got the same results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, everyone's wet today,\" Twilight giggled quietly to herself. She looked at Applejack's diaper and she appeared to be finished, so she was first on the list to be changed. Twilight gently picked up the orange baby girl and carried her over to the changing table to change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was being cleaned, Applejack slowly began to wake up from her dreamless slumber. When she saw the Princess towering over her, she immediately began to panic. Twilight was aware that she was awake but ignored her squirming and patiently continued to powder her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless how she fought, Applejack knew she was too weak to fight it any longer. Twilight was bigger and much stronger than she was now, and there was no use resisting it. Fighting it was out of the question when your only weapon of defense was an infant's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak with exhaustion, Applejack lie supine on the changing table. She could no longer contain her tears and let a fresh flow seep out of the corners of her eyes. Twilight noticed and 'awww'ed as she wiped the tiny girl's tears away, \"Awww, it's okay Applejack. I know you couldn't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack knew she had to accept it. Her body was going through a natural process and she knew that she no longer had the ability to control her excretory system. She was just about to cry aloud when Twilight shoved a pacifier into her mouth, silencing her incipient wailing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a new diaper was affixed to Applejack's bottom, Twilight lifted her up and...surprised her with a hug. Twilight saw the hurt expression on Applejack's face and hoisted her to her chest to comfort him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack found herself looking over her shoulder, being held to Twilight's upper chest with a single arm under the curve of her rump while she patted her back with her free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her hand traveled down to pat her thickly diapered behind, Applejack lay her head in the hollow of Twilight's neck and whimpered in despair as she heard Twilight make small mothering noises to console her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can someone enjoy this?\", Applejack thought to herself, \"I never imagined being held in Twi's arms would make me feel so small and weak. She looks enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack gasped as Twilight wrapped her hand around her bottom and gave it a comforting squeeze. She closed his eyes in embarrassment and thought, \"She can hold my entire bottom in one hand! She makes me feel so powerless...so helpless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her ordeal was over, Twilight carried Applejack back to the crib and laid her back down to continue their afternoon nap. She noticed that the other babies were still fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled and thought, \"Their diapers will keep until they wake up. There's no rush. A few more minutes in wet diapers wouldn't hurt anyone. Afterall, they'll have to get used to wearing wet diapers if they're going to remain this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Applejack was tucked back in, snug as a bug and very comfortable, Twilight left the room. Applejack longingly stared up at the spinning mobile above her and internally sighed. She snuggled up close to Rarity and Rainbow Dash, wrapping her little arms around them for moral support and comfort as she drifted back off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her eyes wearily and yawned again, smiling at her fellow cribmates. She felt great and was ready for another round of playtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment she heard the Nursery door open, and in came Mrs. Cake, Twilight, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie. She grinned toothlessly and babbled on, as if to tell Twilight about the dream she'd had. Twilight smiled and picked Sunset up, \"Hello Sunny. Did you have a nice nap?\" Sunset nodded vigorously and squeaked with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rose from her spot inside the crib and yawned. Once her eyes were fully open, she saw Fluttershy reaching out to pick her up. Applejack closed her eyes in anticipation. No more fighting it, she thought. Whatever Fluttershy or Pinkie desired to do with her was bound to happen anyway, she was in no condition to prevent it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was elevated into the yellow teen's arms, she borrowed her head in the crook of Fluttershy's neck to fall back asleep once again. Fluttershy smiled as she heard soft whimpers escalate. Turning her head to face the crib, she noticed a tearful-looking Rainbow Dash reaching out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling quietly, Fluttershy lifted Rainbow Dash up as well, emitting a happy gurgle from the blue infant. Rainbow nuzzled cheeks with Fluttershy then rested her head over the teenager's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity had also woken up as well, wanting to be held. Pinkie was immediately by her side and soon, Rarity was lying happily in Pinkie's arms, drooling copiously and smiling at everyone around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tending to her twins, Mrs. Cake looked out the window and noticed that it was getting late outside. \"Oh my, it looks mighty late out there. I think the Principal will be coming to pick you up soon, Twilight,\" The baker said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked out the window to see Celestia's car pull up and she nodded, \"Yep. Thanks so much for letting us over, Mrs. Cake. I know it meant alot to Sunny over here.\" She gestured towards the baby in her arms. Sunset was babbling off more incoherent sentences and waving her hands around, drool dripping from her chin in profusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake smiled, \"Anytime, dearie. Now you come back soon; Pound and Pumpkin seem to take a liking to Sunset.\" \"Don't worry. We'll come back soon. Right, Sunny?\" Twilight asked the baby in her arms. Sunset nodded eagerly and loosed let enough excited squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell downstairs rang, catching Twilight's attention. \"Well, we better go. Bye everyone!\" The purple teen waved to the others as she left the room, Sunset grinning as she rode Twilight's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door was opened, there stood Celestia. She smiled, \"Ready to go?\" Twilight glanced at Sunset, then nodded, \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow next?</span></div></div>",

That is, until Celestia spoke up. \"So how was the playdate? I take it that Sunset had the time of her life, right?\" The Principal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded, gently bouncing Sunset on her knee, which made the tiny toddler grin, \"Yes, she appeared to be having a really good time. I'm glad; I think she's finally adjusting to her new life.\" The Princess suddenly sighed, which caused Celestia to tear her eyes away from the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Aren't you happy for Sunset Shimmer? You should be proud of yourself, Twilight.\" The Principal murmured to her pupil. Twilight inwardly bit her lip, \"Yeah, but...I can't help but feel a little guilty.\" Celestia's eyebrows furrowed, \"Well, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shifted uncomfortably in her seat, \"Well...I can't really put it into detail. It's all of these taboo feelings that won't leave me alone. Anytime I see Sunset Shimmer so happy it makes me feel all...warm inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia placed her hand over Twilight's, making the young girl smile, \"It's called maternal instincts, Twilight. Don't worry; it's a completely normal thing that comes naturally to girls when they're around a baby. It means that you really do have a special place inside of your heart that belongs to and is devoted to Sunset's safety and protection.\" She pointed to the yellow baby girl who was playing with her pajama-covered toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled, \"I...I guess it is maternal instincts. I do care about Sunset very much, especially since she's now too vulnerable to take care of herself against her will. She's my friend and I'd do anything for her, no matter how much of a bully she used to be. I mean, everyone deserves a second chance at one point, and Sunset Shimmer is one of them. Am I crazy, Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Principal smiled warmly, focusing her gaze back on the road as she smoothly navigated the lanes with her vehicle. \"Far from it, Twilight. You're doing perfectly fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Twilight breathed a sigh of relief and leaned back into her seat. She smiled as Sunset rested her young head against Twilight's stomach and yawned quietly, closing her eyes to drift off to sleep once again. Twilight knew, deep within her soul, this was only the beginning of their new life together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunset was woken to the merry tune of birds chirping. A bright beam of light danced over her face, forcing the baby girl to open her eyes. As they opened, Sunset Shimmer caught a glance of her surroundings. It was obvious that she was somewhere outside and laying inside of a baby carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset tried to call out to Twilight when she realized that her prized pacifier was securely wedged in between her mouth and that her favorite velveteen rabbit toy was neatly tucked away in her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was warm, humid and overcast; a perfect sunny day like the ones told in story books. It was a partly cloudy day and it seemed as if everyone was outside on this lovely day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset managed to let out a mix of a gurgle and a whimper from behind her pacifier. A familiar figure approached the front of the carriage whom Sunset recognized almost immediately. \"Twilight!\" Sunset thought, reaching out for the girl who provided her with all of her needs and wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled and stroked Sunset's thin red and yellow hair, \"Good morning Sunny. We're just gonna take a little walk because it's so nice out and you look like you need some fresh air, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset cooed in response and snuggled deep into the warm blanket that encased her small body. Twilight giggled and disappeared from sight. About a second or two later the carriage began to move; it was clear that Twilight was behind the carriage pushing it throughout the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset looked down at herself and noticed that she was clothed only in a pink T-shirt with a small bunny rabbit stitched onto the front and her diaper. The weather was warm and dry so Twilight probably decided that a T-shirt and diaper would be sufficient for Sunset's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset quickly forgot her state of relative undress and concentrated on the green world that surrounded her. She was fascinated with the number of colors on the leaves of the trees she saw. She had never known there were so many hues of green and yellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to count them on her pudgy baby fingers, but the profusion of subtle shades made her run out of fingers before she had finished listing the colors on one branch alone. She gave up and decided to enjoy the outing from her new perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was so close to the ground that she could discern the blades of grass that sprang up on either side of the asphalted path. Acorns carpeted the ground beneath the enormous oak trees and had been scattered all about the park by an army of industrious squirrels intent on burying their nutritious booty for the next winter season to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset stared in awe at the new environment. Life seemed so much more fascinating and vibrant from this point of view; She learned that the mere act of breathing was an experience to be treasured and savored for a lifetime. Everything seemed so peaceful and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!\" An unfamiliar voice snapped Sunset out of her reverie. \"Is that really you?\" It appeared to be a female voice, at that. Suddenly another voice penetrated the air, \"Hey Twilight! How've ya been? It's been too long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo girls approached the carriage, making Sunset whimper in fear that someone would recognize her. The first girl had blue and pink hair with blue eyes and cream-colored skin. The other was green with lighter green and white hair, she had yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra? BonBon? Is that really you guys? I haven't seen you in forever!\" Twilight's voice exclaimed in surprise and excitement. The three girls hugged each other, then parted as BonBon asked, grinning down at Sunset, \"And who is this cutie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset whimpered, pulling the blanket up to her eyes in fear. Twilight tickled Sunset's foot, \"Her name is Sunset Shimmer, but I just call her Sunny. She seems to like it alot.\" The Princess explained. Lyra gently yanked the blanket away from Sunset and giggled, \"Aww, she's shy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's adorable,\" BonBon crooned, giving Sunset's exposed tummy a little pat. \"Are you babysitting her?\" \"You could say that,\" Twilight smiled knowingly. Lyra smirked, \"Been stealing other people's babies, huh Twilight?\" The purple teen's cheeks turned scarlet, \"Lyra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green teenager laughed, \"I'm just kidding.\" She then turned to look at Sunset again and grinned, \"Ohh, did little Sunny have an accident?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer froze. It couldn't be true...but yet again, it was. A hot torrent of urine flooded the inner panel of the diaper, soaking it through the padding. Her eyes widened and she began to murmur softly, fussing as she squirmed around. The wet diaper quickly cooled and became cold and clammy, which wasn't a very pleasant sensation to the poor tot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight heard Lyra's comment and looked down to confirm this. As she looked more closer, the evidence was undeniable. Sunset indeed wet herself; her diaper was positively soaked! Twilight noted that the crotch of the disposable diapers the baby was wearing had a large golden stain beneath the translucent white plastic covering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Princess noticed that Sunset looked embarrassed and scared. She smiled apologetically at Sunset and lifted her out of the carriage, shaking her head in amusement, \"Ohh, did Sunny make a little diddy in her dydee? It's okay, don't cry, Twily's here. She'll get you cleaned up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonBon smiled, \"Oh Twilight, is it alright if we help change her for you?\" \"Better yet, you can do it yourself if you want!\" Twilight handed the diaper bag to the young girl. BonBon's eyes lit up, \"Really? Thanks Twi! And don't worry; Lyra and I have had plenty of babysitting experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset became rapidly uncomfortable underneath the thoughtful gazes of the two girls who were much older and bigger than her. Lyra and BonBon looked enormous as they towered over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took the diaper bag out of the wire rack in the bottom of the carriage and set it on the grass to the side of the asphalt path. She opened the side of the bag and took out the plastic covered changing pad which was supplied when she bought the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thoroughly inspected the area and selected a grassy spot that was close but didn't have hidden rocks or entrance to fire ant colonies. Once she had made her preparations, she allowed Lyra and BonBon to begin the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was mildly embarrassed to be treated like an infant in front of not only one, but TWO strangers, but the pacifier in her mouth disabled her thoughts. She sucked on it furiously for reassurance and quickly felt her chagrin melt away with every suck. Soon Sunset's embarrassment completely evaporated and she was so tuned into nursing her binky that she didn't even notice that the diaper change had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!,\" BonBon cooed, lifting the much calmer and cleaner Sunset Shimmer up to her head level. \"All clean. Now let's go back to Auntie Twilight.\" The beige teenager passed Sunset back to Twilight. Immediately, Sunset clung to Twilight's chest, quaking in mortification as she continued to suck on her pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we didn't scare her,\" Lyra fretted. Twilight smiled, \"Nah, she's always like this, even when I change her. Don't worry about it.\" She gently laid Sunset back into her carriage and noticed the baby yawn, \"Baby girl is ready for a nap, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset nodded sleepily and grabbed her stuffed rabbit, and then nestled comfortably back into her pillow and blanket. Lyra and BonBon 'aww'ed and said their goodbyes to Twilight and Sunset, then headed off on their own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pondered to herself. She understood that Sunset would be tired after that traumatizing ordeal she just went through. She deserved a rest. Swiveling the carriage around, Twilight headed back towards the school grounds to put Sunset down for a quick, relaxing bath and a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shutting the door behind her and locking it, she sighed in relief and carried Sunset over to the changing station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter undressing the small girl, leaving her completely naked, Twilight filled the baby bathtub with warm water and, deeming it safe for a baby's skin, she immersed Sunset into the water, careful not to wake the small girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Twilight, Sunset still remained in a state of bliss as she continued to doze off. Twilight used a clean washcloth to lather with baby soap and proceeded to soap Sunset's smooth baby skin. She thoroughly scrubbed the girl's back, arms, legs, and midsection. The Princess wrung out the cloth and applied more soap. She carefully washed Sunset's face, making sure not to get any in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cleansing had subsided, Twilight soaped Sunset's thin baby hair and rubbed a dollop of baby shampoo into her hair. Sunset smiled contentedly in her sleep at the gentle administrations and lightly squirmed at the tickly sensation. Twilight smiled and covered Sunset's eyes as she doused her hair with a cup of water to rinse out the frothy suds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBathtime came to a close as Twilight pulled Sunset out of the tub and hauled her over to the changing table to dry her. The Princess briskly rubbed her dry until she was sure that she was completely clean. By now Sunset had woken up and giggled as Twilight dusted her small body with baby powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good girl Sunny,\" Twilight cooed as she massaged the powder into the young girl's skin. \"Such a sweet little baby.\" Sunset squirmed as Twilight began to rub a finger-sized gob of Nursery Vaseline into her backside, getting it nice and lubricated so it would protect her sensitive baby skin through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taping on a new diaper and dressing the infant into an orange sleeper, Twilight laid Sunset into her crib and went to prepare a bottle for the young girl. In the meantime, Sunset amused herself with the teddy bear inside of her crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a new bottle of formula was prepared, Twilight returned to the cribside, only to find Sunset sitting up in her crib with her teddy bear in front of her, shaking her finger and prattling to it as if she was lecturing the stuffed toy about some imagined naughtiness. Twilight thought she looked adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sunny, here's your ba-ba,\" Twilight lifted her out of the crib and cradled Sunset in the crook of her arm. She gently held the tip of the bottle inside Sunset's mouth and watched with amusement as Sunset latched onto the nipple and began to suck on the enriched formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes of suckling, a long, hollow slurp signified that Sunset had finished her bottle. Twilight set the empty bottle down and held Sunset to her shoulder, gently patting her back in order to burp her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft noise that Sunset Shimmer emitted sounded more like a delicate coo from a baby girl than a full-fledged belch. Twilight grinned at how demurely Sunset manage to behave even though she had been transformed into an infant. It was as if her manners were improving immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took a good look at Sunset and noticed that she was getting sleepy again. The Princess laid the droopy-eyed toddler down into her crib and draped her blanket over her, then...much to Sunset's surprise...she delivered a soft kiss to Sunset's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Sunny.\"</span></div></div>",

It's too late to be walking outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers shared a nod and followed Mrs. Cake towards the exit of the nursery. Once they were outside and in the car, Mrs. Cake pulled out and drove in the direction of Fluttershy's house which was only a few streets down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the ride in the car, Applejack had woken up and gazed around the insides of the car as it smoothly navigated the lanes. She smiled in ecstasy as the gentle rocking of the van and the reassuring humming lulled her into a sense of security, which only made her even more tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally reached Fluttershy's home, Mrs. Cake dropped the two girls and their babies off, then drove back to her own home. Fluttershy opened the door to her house, in which it was obvious that she raised animals there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity's noses were instantly filled with the aroma of exotic animals as they inhaled. Their hyper-active six senses were much stronger than before; they could smell just as equally as a dog could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked up the stairs, Applejack had a growing sense of uncertainty. She shot a worried glance towards Rarity, receiving a smile in return.

Much to the three babies' displeasure, Fluttershy and Pinkie each selected a highchair and bib for the three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack now donned a green bib with a granny smith apple on it, Rarity wore a blue bib with diamonds on it, and Rainbow Dash's bib had tiny cut-outs of clouds with a rainbow-colored liquid spewing out of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked at her bib with disgust, \"A bib? Honestly! Ah'm capable of feedin' mahself without makin' a mess!\" She shouted in her baby language. All that emerged was a long string of baby gibberish, slimy drool oozing from the small girl's lips as she prattled on to the adults that couldn't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Pinkie decided; Fluttershy would feed Applejack, and Pinkie would feed Rarity and Rainbow Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Applejack's dinner, Fluttershy selected a jar of pureed macaroni and cheese along with a side jar of strained plums.  It wasn't exactly the most nutritious of meals, but she didn't want her to start crying again. She hoped that the sweet fruit might help keep Applejack's mood light and help her deal with her unexpected transformation into an infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was ready, Fluttershy ladled out a heaping spoonful of the macaroni and slowly brought it to Applejack's mouth, \"Open wide!\" She smiled playfully. Reluctantly, Applejack opened her mouth to invite the spoon in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the flavor of the food hit her taste buds, she was pleasantly surprised. Her rejuvenated sensation of taste had amplified some of the flavors while suppressing other components. Applejack decided that it wasn't half bad, although the texture left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, her lack of teeth severely limited the range of foods she was able to eat. If she wanted to eat solid food, it would have to be baby food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy continued to ladle in spoonful after spoonful into Applejack's mouth until the jar had been finished. Satisfied with the results, she put the empty jar aside and picked up the jar of strained plums. When the lid was unscrewed, Fluttershy repeated what she did with the first jar by measuring out a small amount onto the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had finished the jar, he opened the second jar he had selected. Applejack closed her eyes again, hoping this one would be better than the last. When she closed her mouth to swallow, an involuntary groan of pleasure escaped her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flavor of the strained plums was so intense that her hypersensitive taste buds were overwhelmed. She held the plums in her mouth to let their fumes permeate her head. It was wonderful! Applejack opened her mouth eagerly for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Fluttershy was glad to let in another spoonful. This process repeated until the jar was completely empty. The butter yellow teenager wiped away the bright purple plum stains around her mouth and chin with the dishtowel, then gave her a bottle of formula. Applejack suckled the formula happily as her stomach wrapped itself contentedly around her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Pinkie was on the job of satisfying two infants with meals of their own. For Rarity's dinner, she selected a jar of chicken and vegetable puree along with a small cup of chocolate pudding, while Rainbow Dash would get a jar of macaroni and cheese with a side dessert of bananas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough baby books recommended against it, Pinkie decided one little cup couldn't hurt Rarity. Of course she might spit up while being burped later on, it couldn't possibly cause any harm. This being said and done, Rarity would happy to eat her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up, Dashie! Here comes the choo-choo train!\" Pinkie cajoled, aiming the spoonful of pureed macaroni towards the blue baby's mouth. Giggling, the small girl opened her mouth widely, allowing Pinkie to spoon in the first amount of the popular dinner choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rainbow had finished the first jar, Pinkie moved on to the next and retrieved the second jar and ladled in the first spoonful. The aroma of ripe bananas exploded into Rainbow's baby-sensitive nose as Pinkie slipped the spoon past her toothless gums and dumped the dessert under her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGobs of pureed banana squeezed from her open mouth, dripping from her slack lips and oozing its way down her chin to fall into the catch pocket of her bib. Rainbow giggled as Pinkie smeared a fingertip of the bananas all over her nose. Rainbow attempted to lick it off, but had no success. Luckily for her, Pinkie kissed it off, emitting more chortles of glee from the baby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Rainbow was suckling noisily at her bottle of formula while Pinkie began to feed Rarity. She ladled out the chicken dinner and said as the heaping spoonful neared Rarity's mouth, \"Open wide, Rar-Rar! Open the hanger so the airplane can come in for a landing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubmissively, Rarity opened her mouth and politely let Pinkie spoon in the first mouthful. She swallowed the pasty mixture and opened her mouth for a second spoonful. Pinkie happily dumped the second helping into her mouth and readied the third as she downed the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was pleased by the meal; her infantized taste buds perceived the food differently than they would have had she been an adult. Pinkie continued to feed her until she had finished the first jar. After wiping Rarity's messy face, Pinkie opened the small cup of pudding and measured out the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the spoonful of the rich brown cream entered her mouth, Rarity's eyes widened. The smell and taste of the sweet pudding was mightily intoxicating. Eagerly, she opened her mouth for the next mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, all done! You're such a messy baby, Rar-Rar!\" Pinkie giggled as she wiped Rarity's face down with a damp washcloth. Rarity chuckled in delight and awaited her bottle of formula. Expectantly, Pinkie handed her a bottle of cool formula and watched with satisfaction as Rarity downed the beverage in swift swigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all three babies fed and pleased with their exquisite meals, Fluttershy and Pinkie quickly cleaned them and the highchairs and then laid them down into their cribs. Unbeknownst to the babies, Fluttershy and Pinkie had secretly spiked the bottles with a ground-up Sleepy Time pill so they wouldn't fuss during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't take long until the Benadryl took effect, drugging them into slumber amid the soft notes of the unceasing lullabies of the nursery's speaker. With smiles, Pinkie and Fluttershy quietly left the nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Applejack was roused from her deep slumber and woke up with a foggy, drug-clouded head. She whimpered and rolled onto her side as the warm, inviting caress of daylight danced on the sheet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, babies!\" A familiar voice chirped. Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity all simultaneously shot up in the crib to see Pinkie Pie peering down at them. \"Here's your morning bottles! It's still too early for you to be up.\" In her hands were three bottles full of a golden-brown liquid. Applejack recognized the odd concoction almost immediately and reached out for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Pinkie handed Applejack her bottle and watched with satisfaction as Applejack latched onto the rubber amber nipple and began to suck voraciously. The sweet aroma of apple cider filled Applejack's mouth and nose. She savored the wonderful flavor and loosed an involuntary groan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that Applejack was having a ball with her bottle, Rainbow and Rarity began to whimper in negligence and soon, they too were nursing on their own bottles. Grinning, Pinkie hopped out of the nursery and locked the door to insure that the babies would have no way of escaping, besides, the window was shut and had a protective lock. Even if they wanted to, there was no way that they could possibly exit the nursery without being carried in an adult's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she thought about it, Pinkie realized just how helpless the babies were opposed to her. The thought of being in complete control and power made her smile as she walked proudly down the stairs to prepare breakfast for the babies and Fluttershy, whom was waiting for her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Applejack had already finished her bottle. Wiping her mouth and dropping her empty bottle, she loosed a prodigious burp. Rarity cringed in disgust and removed her bottle from her mouth, \"Honestly, Applejack, you could at least hold it it like SOME people,\" She gestured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rolled her eyes as Rarity attempted to burp in a \"polite\" fashion. She and Rainbow Dash began to giggle uproariously when Rarity was so enthralled with the art of eructation that she didn't even notice the trail of slimy drool that ran from her slack lips and dribbled down her chin, only to fall wetly onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Rarity cried, hastily wiping the drool away. \"It's not funny! I'm trying to demonstrate the correct way to..eh...belch.\" \"But it is funny!\" Rainbow chuckled, shaking her bottle up and down in hilarity. Rarity pouted and crossed her arms, \"At least I'm trying to act like a lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, making messes in your diaper. Real ladylike!\" Rainbow Dash rocked back and forth on her bottle, breathless with laughter. Rarity's eyes widened when an unforeseen event occurred. A strange, light, almost tickling feeling came from her behind. She stopped for a moment, wondering what had happened when the odd sensation returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity felt rather than heard a slight popping from her behind and sat stock-still on the crib mattress as the weird sensation became stronger. Within minutes, she dumped over a half a pound of semi-liquid waste into her diaper. In short, she thoroughly messed herself and filled her diaper to maximum capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was shocked at how infantile she had just acted. Disgusted, she reached back and gently pushed the back of her diaper, feeling a prominent bulge in her diaper. \"I...I...\" Rarity's face fell in dismay. Applejack and Rainbow Dash's laughing expressions melted away and were replaced with concern for their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity...Are y'all oka- Oh sweet apple pie! What in the hay did y'all eat, Rarity?\" Applejack's fat baby fingers flew to her nose and she pinched her nostrils shut, gagging and swooning at the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash simply stared at her two friends and didn't return her gaze; instead her attention was turned inward to some demanding need that had to be answered before all else. Rainbow grunted, then smiled in satisfaction as if she had accomplished some task of great importance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the fetid odor of another dirty diaper assaulted Applejack's nostrils, \"Oh! Rainbow Dash! This is too unlike y'all,\" The orange baby girl cried out. Rainbow shrugged nonchalantly as if this was a regular routine of hers, \"As long as I know I'm going to be changed, it's not that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that bad?! Big Mac's outhouse smells better than yer diapers!\" Applejack replied in disgust. Rarity's face clouded in frustration and within two minutes of retaining a strained, twisted look of embarrassment on her face, she began to cry her heart out inside the crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash managed to remain calm and silent for the next two minutes until the ooze inside her diaper began to itch slightly. It became increasingly uncomfortable and soon, she began to wail uncontrollably aside Rarity. Applejack was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all are sissies! Why, ah'm not even sure if ah can keep up with you two! I\u2014\" All at once Applejack realized that something untoward was happening in her crotch. There was a growing feeling of warmth that was crawling toward her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw no! Please no! Not again! Ah've wet mahself!\" She internally screamed.  An anguished sob escaped her lips and she began to beat on the crib bars with her tiny fists in frustration. The sobs soon grew into a infant\u2019s wail of despair. She fell back in the crib and rolled over on her belly, beating her fists on the mattress in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Pinkie Pie entered and approached the crib with a grin as the foul aroma of dirty diapers reached her nose. She smiled brightly down at the three crying babies and said with invigorated enthusiasm, \"Uh-oh! Looks like I've got three little stinky babies to change.\" The pink teen giggled, \"Let's get you three cleaned up and then we'll get you some breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a smile, the pink teenager hoisted Rarity out of the crib and carried her over to the changing table for a change. Rarity closed her eyes in anticipation and felt herself lifted and laid on his back on the changing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes again to find Pinkie Pie towering over her with a broad grin on her face. She tickled her protuberant belly with her fingers to lighten her mood, making Rarity giggle. With her charge now satisfied, Pinkie lifted her chubby legs and slid a fresh diaper beneath her, and then lowered her back onto the soft material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being powdered and rubbed with a finger-sized gob of Vaseline, Rarity was clad in a clean diaper, happy and calm once again. She was placed back in the crib and given a bottle of formula while Pinkie picked up Rainbow Dash to change her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same process repeated; Rainbow was cleaned up and given her own bottle of formula, then was placed back inside the cot. Applejack was next on the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pinkie reached over the crib to pick her up, Applejack internally sighed in utter defeat. She knew there was no stopping what was coming. Her body was going to a completely natural process and there was no denying it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her dismay, she was carried to the changing table and stripped of her wet and messy diaper. Pinkie Pie yanked open the snaps on the crotch of Applejack's onesie with three loud popping noises. Then she bent her forward and tugged the onesie out from underneath her bottom and pulled it over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Applejack found herself lying on her back on the plastic changing pad having her diapers removed. When Pinkie pulled the front of her diaper down between her legs, the reek of the dirty diaper shocked Applejack beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie took one look at the brown mess that had spread over her friend's bottom and shook her head, saying, \"Ooooh, you're one stinky little baby!\" She cooed to Applejack as she gingerly began to wipe down the muck until her bottom was completely free of any traces of feces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Applejack was cleaned up and put in a fresh diaper, Pinkie gathered all three babies and took them downstairs to find Fluttershy drinking a cup of strawberry maple tea. The yellow teenager smiled at the sight of her friends and patted the table, \"Here we go, girls. We already have high chairs waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's words were true; three large high chairs, one orange, one blue, and one white sat around the table in a circle while two other chairs were in between the highchairs. As quickly as they had arrived in the kitchen, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash were promptly latched into their respective high chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy tended to Rarity and Rainbow Dash while Pinkie tended to Applejack. All three baby girls now donned a bib to catch the food that was expected to fall out of their mouths during feeding time. When they were secure, Fluttershy and Pinkie readied clean spoons and bowls of food for the babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then decided; all three babies would receive a meal of rice cereal and pureed peas along with a second bottle of milk to satisfy their hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie took the first jar and spoon in hand again and moved the adult chair in front of the high chair with her other hand. Then she opened the jar and ladled out a spoonful to feed Applejack. \"Open wide, Baby!\" She encouraged, cajoling the spoonful of pureed peas towards Applejack's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Applejack opened her mouth and allowed the first spoonful to enter her mouth, allowing Pinkie to dump the contents under her tongue. Immediately, Applejack gagged, but Pinkie forced the second spoonful in. This process continued until Applejack had finished the first jar and they decided to move onto the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fluttershy wasn't having a problem feeding two babies at once. With the help of her 'stare', Rainbow and Rarity were the fastest to oblige her commands and eat their meals. She was exceedingly pleased with the results and continued to ladle the pureed-peas laden spoons of baby food into the girls' mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen breakfast was over, the babies slowly became droopy-eyed and were laid down for their mid-morning nap. Fluttershy and Pinkie expected to change more dirty diapers once the babies woke back up. Secretly they had spiked the food and their bottles of white grape juice with a quintuple Colace and Diuretics. They expected to find three tearful babies with very full diapers by the time their naps had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a knock on the door interrupted their plans. The two teenaged girls went to answer it and when they opened the door, they saw...</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Cake frowned at the teenager, \"I think you both know all too well, Pinkie.\" \"W-what's going on? I-is there something we did wrong?\" Fluttershy whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Principal Celestia interjected, \"When we asked you to take care of the babies, we didn't say you could keep them to yourselves. You're not cooperating with our plan.\" \"The plan doesn't matter! As long as they learn their lessons, they're good to go!\" Pinkie shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" retorted Mrs. Cake, \"What you and Fluttershy are doing is not what part of the complex design of the plan! They have to accept the life of a young child slowly. You're going too fast, which is bound to mess up their adult minds. We can't let that happen at all; so it's time that both of you learned what it's like to not be in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two astonished teenagers could rebuttal, a luminous glow engulfed their entire bodies and left small twinkles as their tall bodies slowly began to descend to the ground. \"No! Pweesh! Me no baby! No babu! Pweeze, don't do dis! Me be good! No babu!\" Pinkie screamed. Fluttershy was speechless and remained completely silent as the transformation continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, there was nothing left of the two teenagers except their clothes, which now draped over their bare toddler torsos like disassembled tents. A crying, pink, six-month-old baby girl with curly magenta hair lie on the floor next to a slightly-bigger, seven-month-old yellow baby girl with light pastel pink hair. Both girls were weeping the losses of their adult bodies, begging in nonsensical baby babble to be returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake and Celestia exchanged knowing looks and each of them scooped up an infant. \"Well, it's too bad. I really thought these girls would be able to handle the responsibility. But its now apparent that they're still too immature to understand the plan.\" The blue baker sighed, adjusting the pink baby in her arms. Pinkie Pie buried her young head into the hollow of Mrs. Cake's shoulder as if she was trying to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Cup Cake,\" Celestia sighed. She smiled and gave the yellow baby in her arms a little tickle on her tummy. \"I know. It's complicated. Looks like we have two more babies to take care of. You know...I've been thinking lately,\" She pursed her lips, pausing in anticipation for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mrs. Cake asked. Celestia began, \"I was thinking that maybe Flash Sentry should join in with the others. Don't get me wrong; he's a great boy and all,\" \"But it might encourage the others to accept their new roles as infants. You're a genius, you know that?\" Mrs. Cake practically finished the Principal's thought for her. Celestia chuckled and nodded, \"You know me all too well, Cup Cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack slowly awoke from her nap, rising from her spot inside the cot. She gave a restless yawn and rubbed the sand out of her eyes, rapidly blinking to assure herself that she was fully awake. The orange baby girl suddenly noticed two small lumps underneath a blanket near her and Rarity and Rainbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to what was underneath the blanket, Applejack crawled towards the lumps and removed the blanket, gasping at the sight. Flames  flickered in her green eyes, smoldering them a crisp, charred golden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the babies she saw had long, curly, light pastel pink hair held together by a low hairclip with a butterfly on it. She had pale yellow skin (in the dim light, it was hard to describe the color) and wore a green nightgown with butterflies and flowers on them, along with a pair of pink pom-pom socks. But most of all was that she couldn't have been more than seven months old. Her thickly-padded nighttime diaper was held high in the hair as she used her arms as a pillow while she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack had to gather all of the strength she could muster to not scream when she saw the next baby lying beside the yellow one. This next baby was below month seven, about six months instead. She had poofy magenta hair that was pinned into two curly pigtails. She wore a blue shirt beneath a pair of pink overalls and a small pair of yellow socks with three balloons on each heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack could identify these two in a millisecond. They were Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie.</span></div></div>",

Sunset was fast asleep; donning a simple pink sleeper and her prized pacifier in her mouth as she slept. Twilight walked over to the side of the crib and laid Sunset down, smiling at Applejack, \"Good morning, Applejack. Have a good sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplesauce wanted answers rather than a friendly greeting. She loosed a string of nonsensical gibberish, a semi-solid sheet of saliva dripping from her already drool-ridden chin. \"Twi! What's happened ta Pinkie an' Fluttershy? Why are they babies like Rarity, Rainbow and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she could understand the babbling baby girl, Twilight heaved a soft sigh as she began to explain. \"You're probably wondering why they're young like you. I suppose I should tell you the truth, but then again, I'd be breaking a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then lifted the still sleeping baby Fluttershy into her arms and could smell the strong aroma of a dirty diaper wafting up from the dozing child's undergarment. The Princess smiled and shook her head with maternal forbearance as she carried her infantilized friend to the changing table for a much needing changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, Sunset Shimmer was roused from her deep slumber and rose from her spot in the crib. She sucked on her pacifier for a moment before greeting Applejack with a neighborly, toothless grin, \"Hi Applejack. I didn't expect to see you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rarity was up and awake as well, followed by Rainbow Dash. \"Good morning, darlings,\" chirped Rarity. \"Looks like we have a visitor. What's up, Sunset?\" Rainbow Dash casually asked, rubbing her tired eyes. Sunset's shoulders lightly shrugged, \"Oh, nothing new.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She jolted forward in surprise and began to breathe heavily, \"Omigosh...I just had the craaaaaziest dream! I got turned into a baby!\" The small pink tot awkwardly put her hands behind her to push herself up to a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat up, Pinkie saw her feet and toes and realized that something was very, very wrong. Her toes had become stunted and chubby were joined to feet that were barely six inches long...Her feet and toes looked exactly like soft, pudgy, baby's feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, Pinkie put her hand in front of her face and noticed that it too had undergone a similar transformation. She looked at the other occupants of the crib and tried to ask them what happened but all that came out was, \"Mmmmgaaaa caaaa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smirked, \"So, it looks like ya'll have finally gotten your comeuppance.\" \"So it wasn't a dream?\" Pinkie asked innocently, shifting uncomfortably in her spot. \"Nope,\" Rainbow Dash giggled, \"And it looks like you're alot younger than us, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How old am I?\" Pinkie inquired, tears leaving her eyes unbidden. Rarity pursed her tiny lips, \"Hmmm...well darling, you appear to be a little over six or seven months old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie let out a loud shriek at the news, alerting Twilight. Once she had Fluttershy diapered, the purple teenaged Princess rushed over to the crib railings and gently laid Fluttershy down, then lifted up the screaming Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight held Pinkie over her shoulder and gently rubbed soothing circles in her back to calm her caterwauls of despair. Pinkie, however, continued to wail uncontrollably. Twilight held her tighter and closer and murmured soft mothering noises to console her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time Pinkie relaxed and quieted a little. Satisfied, Twilight dipped her hand into her pocket and produced a blue pacifier to pop into her mouth. Once the soft latex of the rubber teat entered her mouth, Pinkie's submerged infant reflexes surfaced and she instinctively began to suck for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had Pinkie completely calm again, Twilight carefully laid the six month old infant back into the crib and gave her a blanket to cuddle with. Reluctantly, Pinkie clutched the blanket to her chest for moral support and comfort. The warm, fleecy fabric brushed against her cheeks and relaxed Pinkie to the point where she became rather droopy-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled at the other infants in the crib and nodded, \"I'll be back in a little while, girls. And I'll see you soon, little missy,\" The purple teenager gently tweaked Sunset's nose, making her giggle. Twilight then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Twilight was gone, the room went dead silent. Sunset tried to break the ice. \"So...what have I missed?\" She grinned.</span></div></div>",

The baby boy appeared to be a little less than a year old, perhaps eight to nine months old or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenaged Princess unceremoniously plopped Flash Sentry into the crib right next to Sunset and grinned, \"Sunny, meet your new baby brother...Flashy! I think you two already know each other, but let's just start fresh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer gulped. Why was Flash, her ex-boyfriend, a baby like her and the others? He didn't deserve it! When she got good enough of a glance from Flash, she could tell he wasn't very pleased with his current condition either. Tears were coursing down his face in a relay race and his tiny baby lips quivered as he shuddered in humiliation. A bright red blush peppered his face and he appeared as though he had committed the world's most heinous crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Flash noticed that Sunset was staring directly at him, he tried to crack a tiny lopsided smile, yet it didn't seem to improve the situation. He began to bawl in frustration, beating his tiny fists on the bars of the crib to express his anger towards Twilight. Twilight merely smiled and popped a pacifier into the boy's mouth, drowning out his anguished wails of despair and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now babies,\" Twilight's voice became lower as her face dropped and became more businesslike, \"Let's get this straight. You are all helpless babies now, and you are to NOT contradict Celestia, Mrs. Cake, or me at ANY time or of ANY circumstance. You all must accept the facts and face the music. Now that you'll all way below a year old, you're all too weak and too small to fend for yourselves. You cannot feed yourselves, you cannot talk, you cannot walk, only crawl. And most of all; you have absolutely no control over your bladders or your bowels, which means using the toilet is out of the question. The only toilet that is available to you now is your diapers. You cannot fight what has been done and you cannot undo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's mouths were agape in shock; well, besides Sunset. She had already gone through almost half of a week of being mollycoddled and pampered like the baby she was. She deserved it, afterall, and resistance was futile. Besides, being a baby was relaxing, she had to admit. Not to mention lots of fun. Her renewed sense of taste made her imagination become more curious like any other babies' would. She didn't mind being a baby much at all. As long as she knew that Twilight would be there to take care of any of her messes or to nourish her with the sustenance she needed, it was fine by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Twilight's sudden outburst, each of the babies slowly began to cry in fear and of the indignities that had been bestowed upon them. Sunset was the only one who didn't even shed a single tear out of the entire group. She nonchalantly watched the others around her bawl and weep helplessly. Twilight maintained her stern expression for almost a minute before she softened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down next to the side of the crib, she stroked each baby's cheeks soothingly. \"I'm sorry I frightened you all. I just wanted to let you guys know that this is how life is going to be from now on, and there's no going back. I'm so sorry, but this is for the better. Trust me; within a few days you'll love having the life of a baby. I promise.\" </span></div></div>",

Twilight dumped the food into the babies mouth and watched her chew and swallow it down the hatch like a good little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't about to last for long. Sunset felt the nice taste of cheese and macaroni slide down her throat and she slowly licked her lips, to show affection she clapped her hands together and made incoherent babbling noises to Twilight. Despite the fact that she got a little bit of food on her bib, but that wasn't going to matter soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good little girl Sunny!\" Twilight also decided to clap in response for the good behaviour. \"You've still got a little bit left to go and then you can have a nice big bottle.\" She dipped the spoon into the bowl and got a decent amount of food for her little baby to chew on, she craned the spoon over to Sunset until she felt something tap on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight put the spoon back into the bowl and turned round to see Pinkie Pie covered in the leftover food that Pound Cake had to eat. Small pieces of macaroni lay dormant in her torn apart hair while the melted cheese dripped down her bright pink clothes and onto the floor. Twilight looked shocked at the sight of her friend being covered in so much food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\" Twilight looked at Pinkie's feet and slowly worked her way up with eyes wide open to take in the fact that she was splattered with food all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie opened her mouth to begin speaking but was interrupted by the sounds of Sunset's laughing and giggling who, slammed her hands onto the plastic tray and leaned back into the pillow behind her. Pinkie looked at herself and her clothes and giggled, she took a small dab of cheese that dangled from her skirt and placed it on Twilight's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee.\" Pinkie Pie smiled, she also crossed her arms. \"I'm going to change out of my clothes and into something more comfortable.\" The pink teenager began to walk towards the kitchen doorway but she was stopped by Twilight after taking a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Twilight grabbed Pinkie Pie by the arm, slightly cringing as her hand became covered in food. \"What about the babies? I can handle Sunset on my own but I don't know if I can feed Pound Cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh silly.\" Pinkie picked off a few pieces of macaroni from her white shirt and put them in her mouth and began to chew on them. Twilight frowned at the sight. \"You'll do fine.\" Pinkie leaned closer to Twilight who in turn tried to lean away from her dirty friend. \"<i>Watch out for Pound, he's a sneaky baby.</i>\" Pinkie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah... Sure.\" Twilight nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two grown ups talking to each other both Sunset Shimmer and Pound Cake looked at each other from over their high chairs. Sunset noticed that Pound was still covered in oodles of mac and cheese from earlier and he now suckled his thumb. He took it out for a split second and waved his drool covered hand at her. He then looked at Sunset's bowlful of food and then looked back at Sunset with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPound spoke a bunch of gibberish towards Sunset and pointed at the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset blinked. Did he just talk to her? Or was she seeing things? But that wasn't the least bit important. Her questioning and reasoning quickly took back seat into the recesses of her mind while she thought about the situation that Pound was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset started to put two and two together and noticed a few things that happened in the last few minutes. Pinkie Pie seemed to be very happy when Pound placed the bowl on his head. She giggled, laughed and stuck her tongue out at him and kept on playing with him even though she got really dirty. Twilight on the other hand didn't play as much, she used the spoon as an aeroplane just once and that was it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrool escaped her mouth as her body did the rest of her thinking for her and she latched both hands onto each side of the plastic bowl, she lifted it up and started to tilt it so that it would land on her head. With a few bits of food already falling out she quickly pushed it down and felt the bowls contents leave and fall down onto her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food soon dropped out and landed all over Sunset just the way she wanted it to with a loud splat. The warm gooey cheese soon dripped down from her hair and landed onto her bib and backside and continued to drip further down onto the seat. Sunset looked over at Pound Cake who began to laugh and clap his hands at the sight of Sunset covered in food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gha-ba-ba!\" Pound Cake roared in laughter, he jumped back and forth in his high chair seat unable to contain his laughter at the other baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing caught the attention of Pinkie Pie and Twilight who, finished their conversation the moment Pound Cake began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! Pound Cake is happy that you're going to feed him.\" Pinkie Pie smiled at the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned around to see what all the commotion was and immediately noticed Sunset Shimmer covered in mac and cheese from head to diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUNSET!\" Twilight screamed at her little baby girl. \"What have you done!?\" She leaned back in horror at the sight and placed the hands on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset didn't expect that reaction, her big smile suddenly dwindled into nothingness as Twilight quickly rushed over with a paper towel to wipe the food off her. Why wasn't she happy? Why wasn't she laughing like Pinkie Pie? It made no sense. And to make matters worse the paper towels that were quickly wiped across her bare skin made her feel very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to swell around Sunset's eyes. Her groans of pain and confusion began to get louder and louder until she broke down in tears with her arms and legs violently kicking up against Twilight's big strong hands.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to redeem herself but she didn't want to turn down an offer with her only friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset didn't have much time to think, because Rarity opened the door within less than a minute.

Not long after Sunset sat down, the humane5 started to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash started singing \"Rock-a-Bye\" over and over again, and one by one, someone else would join in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD: Rock-a-Bye<br>\r\nPinkie: Rock-a-Bye<br>\r\nFluttershy: Rock-a-Bye<br>\r\nAJ: Rock-a-Bye<br>\r\nRarity-Rock-a-Bye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity then took over, singing \"Our Baaaay-Be Sunset\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them then sung in unison, \"Iiiin the Treetop! When the wind blows, when the wind blows, the craaay-dle.. will drop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was confused about the song, but didn't quiet notice the subtle changes happening to her body. By the time they said \"will drop!\" Sunset actually had lost seven years. Her jeans were looser around the waist, and her sleeves were too long for her arms. Her face started looking younger and younger, and her hair was mysteriously shortening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sung a solo line again \"Oh Sunset... when the bough breaks!\" followed by all of them singing \"Your craaay-dle... will fall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff of just those lines, Sunset lost another 5 years. As a five year old in 17 year old clothing, her clothes consumed her. Her little feet didn't even meet half way in the jeans and her panties were incredibly loose. If one was to pick her up, both articles of clothing could easily slip off, leaving the little girl's bottom naked. The sweatshirt was relatively huge, too heavy to even lift the sleeves. At one point, in the song, she finally felt something off about her clothes and looked down in horror. <i>Whats happening to me?!</i> she thought. She started to silently tear up. She prevented herself from crying a lot, because she was <i>a big girl and big girls no cry</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn final unison, they all sang loudly \"And down, down, down, will come our baby Sunset! Cradle and All!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the song, Sunset had reached the tender age of 1. She could still talk, but her voice was high pitched and many words were hard to pronounce. By the end of the song, Sunset had also lost all psychological barriers, wailing like the baby she was. The sweatshirt covered her entire body, and the panties were almost falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ and Rainbow Dash didn't look at Sunset. The whole plan seemed kinda messed up to them. Fluttershy, Pinkie, and Rarity on the other hand crowded around little Sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was the first to say! \"D'awwwww, its okay little Sunset. Your big girl friends are here.\" Sunset ignored Rarity, until Rarity picked her up. Sunset's pants and panties fell, allowing a faint breeze to pass through her chubby legs. Then Rarity held her in one arm and removed Sunset's sweatshirt, shirt underneath, and bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset covered her eyes, with tears coming out. She had never felt more mortified. While Rarity rocked her back and forth, Fluttershy and Pinkie were showering her with compliments, like \"You're so adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was going to continue to cry, but something distracted her; it was a PACIFIER! Rarity pulled out a purple pacifier with a red loop, and gently shoved it into Sunset's mouth. Sunset couldn't help but enjoy the taste, but she closed her eyes. This wasn't what she had in mind today!</span></div></div>",

She wanted her little baby waby to wave to her guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me girls, Little Sunset needs a changy wangy\"  Rarity exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Pinkie followed, right behind Rarity. AJ and RD kept a distance, this still was pretty weird for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came into a room that was sun themed. The carpet was a light orange. There were baby toys in a big box in the corner, though some were spread across the ground. A shelf full of baby books and a rocking chair were nearby, followed by a red stroller that read on the handle \"Sunset Shimmer.\" In the far back was a polished wooden crib, with a red mattress and orange covers and pillows. Nearby was changing table, dresser, and closet. The closet had spare baby necessities and the dresser was fully of miniature versions of Sunset's clothing. As for the changing table, it was also red with a soft orange surface. There were plenty of diapers stacked in the changing table, along with baby powder, lotion, and wipes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie shouted with glee \"WOW! Rarity, you really went all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course I did. My little Sunset deserves the best treatment, and the best fashion!\" Rarity responded joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, somebody needs a diaper\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset peaked out the corner of one of her hands, frightened by what she saw. Tears came down her face, as Rarity placed her on the changing table. Rarity was quick though, raising Sunset's chubby legs and powdering her butt thoroughly. She then slid a diaper underneath, and strapped the white cushion into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it my darling!\" Rarity then pulled out a miniature version of Sunset's purple shirt and orange skirt, and dressed Sunset up. \"Now, isn't she just adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them gushed, and soon it was just Rarity and Sunset. As they left, Rarity held Sunset in one arm, moving her chubby right hand to wave good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rarity brought Sunset back to the baby room, and finally removed the pacifier. Sunset instantly cried after it was removed, \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there there.. Mama Rarity is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaa Waaa Why ya-you 'sobs' wegwes me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've been driving yourself crazy trying to be redeemed. It was never going to happen unless you're image changes. No one can be mean to a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-bu-but I no wanna be babwy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'awwwwww, you'll love it soon, don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won-ta! Me bi girw! Me bi- giiiii WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there\" Rarity started rocking her back and forth, singing <i>hush little baby don't you cry</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset soon drifted off to sleep, but the day was young. In a couple hours, she'd be waken up and face her new life once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wrapped in her little orange blanket, Sunset had one of the best dreams ever. She dreamed that the school had forgiven her, and that she was the leader of several school projects. In this dream, everybody looked up to her and she had tons of autonomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a stark contrast to the real world, and within three hours she'd soon re-realize her fate. At around 11:00 o'clock, the sun started to come out and the clouds dispersed. Small rays of light passed through Sunset's room window. Sunset was already waking up though. She had a faint sleepy smile on her face as she woke up, but slowly realized her scenario. If things we're bad enough, she felt warm and wet around her crotch. She tucked her head underneath the covers, looking at her butt. She saw her normal dress, but there was white bulge at the bottom. Curious, she lifted it up to find, a DIAPER! It wasn't just any diaper, it was a wet diaper. She immediately started crying \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DIS A-ta HAPWENIN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity heard Sunset's cries on the baby monitor, and quickly came up. \"Hello my little darling, how'd you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset paused for a second and then went back to crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was very calm, \"Awww, there, there. Let's see what's bothering you.\" She carefully reached down, and picked up Sunset from her arms. She then rested Sunset on her chest with one arm, checking Sunset's diaper with the other; she carefully stretched the diaper elastic seeing yellow stains. \"That's all. Haha, don't worry Mama Rarity can fix you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity walked Sunset over to the changing table, gently laying her on the soft surface. \"Now, this shouldn't take long.\" She removed Sunset's mini skirt and unstrapped the diaper. In a streamless action, she lifted Sunset's legs and slid the diaper away. \"Time for the baby wipes!\" Rarity gracefully rubbed Sunset's butt, almost giving a mini massage. Sunset didn't want to admit that this felt great. Before Sunset knew it, Rarity was tapping the baby powder, and sliding a new diaper in place. Sunset cooed as the new diaper was finally strapped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rarity dressed Sunset with the mini skirt, she asked \"So, How was your dream Sunset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset hesitated, but tried getting out the words \"G-good. Stuudwen forgwive me iin it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thats marvelous. Well, don't you worry that will happen very soon now that your a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset quietly teared up, \"Wh-why am I wike dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you don't remember. Its part of a school program. You signed up, thinking it would change your image. I was listed as your caretaker, and you came to my house later this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dwid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And I'm so happy you did. You and I can do so many fun things today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haa-how wong it gonwa wast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The experiment didn't specify.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset looked down, scared of what to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted though, by Rarity. She picked up Sunset, holding her firmly in her arms. \"Don't you worry. This can be fun. For instance, here's a bottle. Can you say that Bot-tle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset adorably said \"Baa baa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity patronized her \"Very good. Now, drink up. Its nice and warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the pacifier, Rarity shoved a warm bottle of formula into Sunset's mouth and Sunset suckled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl\" Rarity said. She slowly walked over to the reading chair, holding Sunset's bottle steadily. In the chair, Rarity rocked Sunset back in forth while holding the bottle in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset soon finished, and Rarity asked \"Would you like to go outside now? The cafe is nearby and having you become redeemed was sorta the idea of regressing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear suddenly surged over Sunset, and Rarity could tell. \"Of course, we don't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Sunset's fear partially vanish. She was still her, and she wasn't going to let anything, even being a baby, get in her way. \"No, me act-twy wan ta go. I gotta be wedeemed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then. Let's show the world the new you!\" Rarity stood up, and moved to Sunset's red stroller. She placed Sunset in the comfy interior, with a stuffed doggy. She strapped her in place, and took her out. \"They're going to love you!\"</span></div></div>",

Choo Choo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity started pushing the cart slowly, which still scared Sunset. She feared she smash into something, not trusting Rarity completely. Before they left the house, Sunset yelped \"Staahp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity came over, kneeling down in front of Sunset. \"Whats the matter sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset hesitated to get out the words \"i-its scawwy. I cud cwass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggled a little at the idea. \"No, its alright Sunset. You're ok. I want to give you something though to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset tilted her head adorably \"wut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity didn't respond, instead she took Sunset out of the seat. The sudden abruptness scared Sunset, and she was worried that she asked the wrong question. \"Don hur me, I sowwy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity still respond, but did something even better; she hugged Sunset. Rarity's hug was a nice and firm, pressing Sunset into her chest and providing warmth. Sunset quickly calmed down, closing her eyes and smiling. Sunset was completely subdued. Rarity slowly rotated back and forth and Sunset adorably cooed in response. After about 3 minutes of hugging, Rarity put Sunset back in the stroller, with the stuffed doggy. \"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset smiled \"Betta, tanks mama Warity\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you ever get scared, just remember I'm here. You can even hug your doggy for comfort. If you really need my help, I'll come by to give you a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-ha-how wil you knowa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Darling. I just do. Its a unique skill that all mommies have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset liked this answer and responded, \"tanks mama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity gently pushed the cart, and Sunset adjusted by hugging her doggy. Rarity gradually pushed the cart to normal speed, while quietly singing \"la di da li la\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached the sidewalk near the stores. Things were still pretty quiet, but several adults were walking by. None of them recognized Sunset and several of them waved to Sunset on their walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were still about a block away from the cafe, one adult stopped them to meet Sunset. She looked to be in her late 30's, wearing a white blouse with stylish black pants and boots. Her skin was tan, her hair was orange, and her eyes redish orange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just came out of a beauty saloon, and saw Rarity and Sunset to her left. She immediately paused after seeing Sunset Shimmer, and then shouted, making quite a public scene \"Oh! She's ADORABLE!\" She jogged the little distance to Rarity and Sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was starting to have second doubts about leaving the house. This lady seemed enormous, and her loud voice didn't make things any better. Rarity smiled, \"You have company little Sunset. Don't worry, this will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady came over quickly, \"Hi there, I'm sorry. I noticed your baby and I just had to come over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled, giving a very laid back reply \"Oh, I totally understand. My little Sunset is quite the sight isn't she.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, that's an adorable name. Can I say meet the little angel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer was currently hiding behind her doggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Sorry, she's a little shy towards adults.\" Rarity then knelt down to Sunset's level, \"Sunset, would you like to meet this nice lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu uh..\" Sunset then tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be willing if mommy held you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset paused and then said \"maywe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, could girl. Mommy is very proud of you.\" Rarity reached down to hold Sunset. She picked her up and pressed her firmly into her bosom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset looked up at Rarity and the lady. Both staring down at her. Sunset looked up confused and somewhat scared. What was this lady going to do to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tickled her chest. \"Awww, she's cuter than I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity responded for Sunset \"Oh, thank you. She is, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I have to ask then, how'd you become her mother? You look so young yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity paused for a second and then responded \"Well, I uh.. I'm her foster mother. I met her through the school at the orphanage. She looked like she needed a mother in her life, and after a long talk with my parents, I decided to adopt her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's so sweet.\" The lady then poked Sunset's nose \"You look like you're in good hands little one.\" Several more minutes of her playing with Sunset, until Rarity interjected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, do sorta have to get on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I totally understand. Thank you for letting me play with her. You be good now Sunset.\" She then waved and passed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rarity strapped Sunset back in, \"You were very polite thank you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset blushed \"Tanks. Da sabe wa ah gud one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled, \"Thank you. You know, your such a nice baby. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset cooed in response and they were on their way. Within 7 minutes they were already at the cafe. Time for the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opened the door, pulling it outward and pushing Sunset through the door first. Luckily, only so many people were in the cafe at that time. It was just 6 girls from multiple different cliques.<br>\r\nHere are the girls:<br>\r\nNaomi <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727074651/mlp/images/a/aa/Naomi_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\nMystery Mint <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727072901/mlp/images/2/2a/Unnamed_Girl_13_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\nAqua Blossom <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727074744/mlp/images/7/76/Unnamed_Girl_4_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\nPaisley <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727074532/mlp/images/2/21/Unnamed_Girl_5_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\nCloud Kicker <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727074837/mlp/images/8/87/Unnamed_Girl_8_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\nApple Fritter <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130727074557/mlp/images/c/c8/Unnamed_Girl_9_ID_EG.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity came over to where girls were chatting and said \"Um.. Hi. Do any of you have a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud Kicker was the first to respond \"Yeah, come over Rarity. And whose the cute baby in the crib?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity came closer, enabling to actually see Sunset Shimmer. None of them responded. They were all just dumb struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi cut in \"Don't tell me that's... that's Sunset Shimmer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity nervously replied \"Why yes? I actually came over for specifically this reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a unanimous \"WHAT?!\" from their classmates <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rarity struggled to form the words. Sunset hid behind her stuffed doggy. She feared they'd do something to her. Thanks to her fear, everything was muffled. She had no idea what any of the <i>big girls</i> were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.. See, its pretty tricky to explain. It has to do with that magic stuff that Twilight brought here. An accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Mint scoffed \"serves her right.\" The rest of them nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity took a deep breath. This was the first time she was defending Sunset Shimmer, and she was scared it'd ruin her reputation. \"Hey now! I understand that she caused all of you grief, myself included. But, that was the past. She's not the same person anymore. Look at her.\" Rarity then pointed to Sunset. \"She's just a scared baby, can't you look past her mistakes?! That's the whole reason I came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six girls looked between each other, confused on how to act. While they were distracted, Rarity gently pulled out Sunset Shimmer, holding her firmly. Sunset looked scared and she hid her eyes. Sunset's head not facing them. \"Its alright, don't worry Sunset. They'll forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See girls, look what you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl looked guilt stricken, and soon, one by one they cracked. First Paisley, then Apple Fritter, Naomi, Aqua Blossom, Cloud Kicker, and lastly Mystery Mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley said \"There, there. I forgive you. I know you feel sorry, and, in truth, thats all that matters.\" She pat Sunset's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Fritter \"She's right. The past is the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi \"Yeah, I agree..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua Blossom \"I suppose, she's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud Kicker \"I hated the old Sunset Shimmer. But, shes.. just a baby now. I can't stay angry at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Mint grumbled \"Augh, fine. I forgive her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one pat Sunset's back, eventually causing to perk up. Rarity turned Sunset around, \"See Sunset, I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tank youa..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls then, showered her with compliments and baby talk. \"Awwwww, soo cute.\" <br>\r\n\"You might just be the cutest baby I ever met.\" <br>\r\n\"Coochi coochi coo\" <br>\r\n\"What an adorable baby waby\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, you're ticklish little gem\"<br>\r\n\"Good girl, such a cute baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset truly was taking in all the praise, and she was the happiest she'd been in months. She relaxed, intentionally pooping in her diaper. It came out with a big fart noise. The praise was suddenly interrupted in both sound and smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww gross! Did she just poop?!\"<br>\r\n\"I think she did, it smells terrible.\"<br>\r\n\"Rarity, please tell me you packed some spare diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything, her entire redemption, changed like that because of a simple bowl movement. Sunset Shimmer quickly started to tear up as they commentated on it, and finally wailed at the mention of \"diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity yelled \"YES! ONE MINUTE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the baby back, and carefully moved Sunset into the bathroom. Luckily there was a changing station. </span></div></div>",

So many people around to comment. Very embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she hurried along more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndid the tapes, Rarity lifted Sunset's legs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset began to cry as the wipes were used, hating the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity cooed, \"You're okay, baby. You're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the wipes and dirty diaper were thrown away with one hand. The other still held Sunset's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the fresh diaper under Sunset's bum, Rarity could now finish the whole process off with a hefty amount of baby powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaper pulled over, Sunset heard the noise of tapes being stuck on her cloth's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity deposited every supply back into the bag, and brought her baby up into her arms again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled her sweet-smelling child, saying, \"Oh, aw!

The warmth also assisted in keeping her calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity slowed unlatched Sunset's grip on her, so the baby could be put back in her stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuckling her up once more, Rarity strolled out into the eating area again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls from before had made room for the mother and child. Rarity didn't expect that to happen, but went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheeling the stroller over, she released Sunset from the protection. Sitting down, Rarity pulled sent into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Mint commented with worry, \"Is Sunset...going to...go again for some time? 'Cause I don't want to be eating, then have to smell-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity rolled her eyes, \"Since you asked, she's fine for right now. Will take a bit before she needs another diaper. Honestly though, it would be more uncomfortable for her to sit in it than your nose to smell. Please, leave any talk of her going potty out of the conversation for right now. I don't want her getting upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kindly, don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Mint shrugged, seeing the mother's aggressive side take hold at the thought of getting Sunset crying again when it could be avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley decided to start an entirely different discussion, to cool off the anger that began steaming off Rarity, \"Sooo...did you want us to wave the waitress over? We had ordered before you two even came. I'm sure the cook can get a couple more orders in with the rest of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity said with a grin, \"Why not? Though, Sunset can't eat the food here. Her teeth haven't even grown in yet. Still on the bottle, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, I'll just get her attention, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley tried to wave calmly, at first. Yet, when two minutes went by, her arm started to hurt from being in the air for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, \"Ugh! Sick of this! Goin' in, gals! Wish me luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, got up from the table, and literally marched into the kitchen herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi said in fright, \"I hope she'll be okay. I would hate for her to get thrown out. That's why we don't go to the computer room anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery spoke with a sigh, \"Don't forget the restaurant that opened up a few weeks back. And, the lost-and-found table. ...The boys' locker room, too. Though...we weren't supposed to be in there in the first place, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud decided to intervene on the yelling in the kitchen before things got out of hand, \"Be back soon. I swear that girl's more trouble than a school bully sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, left to deal with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Fritter was wondering something, asking, \"Rarity...does Sunset think being a baby's...fun? I mean, it...doesn't sound horrible. Kinda...a sweet deal, actually. My opinion on the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery, Naomi, and Aqua gave the girl a confused stare each, to which she said in defense, \"What?! Sounds cool. Naps whenever, playing with toys whenever, everyone calls you compliments! I even heard babies have better senses, so...maybe a common bottle of milk tastes ten times better! ...And, a diaper feels basically just like a pillow, I'd bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more confused stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at them, \"It's not weird to wonder! You all need to be more open to other points of view!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said with a crossing of the arms, \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggled, responding, \"Apple, dear, I wouldn't know about that. You're free to ask Sunny in a few days though. Don't try right now. She needs to get better adjusted to her new age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud now brought a mad Paisley on her return to the table, with the captured girl frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls switched spots at the request of Cloud, saying Paisley isn't allowed on the end anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the food was brought out, with the waitress giving Paisley her's last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity asked the woman what the bill would be for her own meal, which the worker said, \"No charge. Your...friend's very persuasive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley grinned, winking at Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity had been given a cucumber sandwhich, with olive oil dressing on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't dine until her little one had her fill though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a pre-made bottle, she lifted Sunset with her chest and arm as support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was surprised by how thirsty she had been. Her arms attempting to snatch the bottle away, so she could down it as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua grabbed Rarity's attention, ceasing the descent of the bottle into Sunset's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed, asking, \"...Can I feed her? I...would really like to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity saw no issue, so passed the baby off until she reached Aqua's awaiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle was handed over, and Aqua immediately began to feed the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset stared up at Aqua while drinking, not really paying much attention to her aside from the deep smile the girl showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua said softly, \"You're so cute. Wittle baby loves her milky-wilky. Yes, she does. I'm sure she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued breathing out soothing words, which added to the sleepy effect the bottle had on Sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk did taste delicious. So, so tasty. A little bit of sugar had been poured in before, giving the milk a kick of sweetness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slowly closed. Her suckles on the bottle slowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was soon uanable to stay asleep with everything nice going on around her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Rarity out of town for the week, Sunset asked if she could help out with some of Rarity's designs. To many peoples' surprise, Sunset actually had an eye for detail and design. She came up with good ideas in the past, so Rarity was more than happy to receive her help. Rarity gave Sunset a key to the house and early Sunday morning Sunset went over to Rarity's house with a medium sized sleepover bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Sunset Shimmer realize though that a surprise awaited her at Rarity's house. When Sunset opened the door, Sweetie Belle and her two crusader friends were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle happily greeted Sunset with her friends behind her \"Hi Sunset Shimmer. My sister asked me if I could help you help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was a little surprised, but kept her cool \"Um.. sure, I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie quickly asked \"So, would you like a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please. Whatever you have is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! I'll make you some hot coco then. Rarity's room is upstairs second room on the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach went about their business. Sweetie Belle and the crusaders went to the kitchen, while Sunset went upstairs. About 10 minutes past before Sweetie brought Sunset the hot coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are Sunset. Tell me what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was just brainstorming when Sweetie Belle came in and said \"Thanks Sweetie Belle.\" Sunset then took a sip and the coco was just right. \"Aww, that tastes good. Thanks Crusaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three crusaders said in unison. \"No problem, want anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset shrugged \"Not really. I guess you could just stay here so I have someone to bounce ideas off of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie \"Sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was a little disturbed. Sweetie Bloom was taking what was an easy task to be crucially important. 'Oh well\" Sunset thought \"it doesn't harm anyone.\" For the next two hours, Sunset Shimmer came up with ideas, occasionally asking for feedback. It was rather boring for Crusaders' though. They wanted to do something for Sunset that was more.. active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sweetie Belle spotted the perfect opportunity to help. Sunset yawned \"aaAAAaah,\" which prompted a series of questions from Sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perked up \"Are you tired Sunset? If you are tired, don't hesitate to rest. We have a guest bedroom and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset wasn't really paying attention though \"Huh, what did you say Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie sighed \"I said \"Are you tired Sunset?\" And the answer is obvious, you are. So, follow me to the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was surprised. Sweetie Belle's response came out of no where and was unnecessarily authoritarian in tone. It almost felt like Sweetie was talking down to her. Sunset didn't know how to respond though. Normally she'd give a strong \"no,\" but this was Rarity's little sister. As a result, Sunset's response came out pretty timid. Fluttershy levels of timid. \"B-But.. I'm fine..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie gave an assertive motherly response \"No your not! Come with me, your going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sunset knew it Sweetie was holding her arm and walking her to the living room. Scootaloo and Applebloom just looked at each other with annoyed expressions. Sweetie was at it again, being as overbearing as can be. Scootaloo and Applebloom just followed them silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, Sweetie Belle and Sunset Shimmer were in the living room. Sweetie sat on the couch and motioned Sunset to the same couch. Sunset nervously laid on the couch, resting her head on Sweetie Belle. Sweetie then rubbed her sides. Next thing Sunset knew, Sweetie Belle was singing a lullaby. \"Rock-a-bye baby in the treetop...\" Strangely though Sunset fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie then quietly demanded Applebloom get a blanket and Scootaloo a baby bottle. Sunset was now helpless and Sweetie was going to take full advantage of that. Sweetie was no longer a helper, she was a babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be in good hands. By that, I mean mine. And, the other girls. When they get back with the supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, peeked into the blanket's front, then the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her checking was done, she placed Sunset against her shoulder, bouncing the baby lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said in relief, \"Glad you haven't...'went' yet. I don't have any diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset blushed, realizing Sweetie just peeked into the blanket, which apparently was the only clothing keeping Sunset from being naked, to check for accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,</span></div></div>",
