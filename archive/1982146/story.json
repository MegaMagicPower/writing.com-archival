            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Two days in and there's no denying it now,</i> Ally thought as she stared at the heavy bulge her stomach had become.  She pulled a loose shirt down to hide it, left her jeans unbuttoned, and for good measure threw on a hoodie.  Those that know her might think she had just gained a few pounds.  In her current gettup they wouldn't be able to tell it was mostly in her middle.  And in another day it'd be impossible to hide.  If she didn't solve this now there would be no way to pass the curse on to somebody else, and she'd be forced to go through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terms were simple; nine days of pregnancy ending in a birth of unknown number unless somebody takes the curse from you.  Ally had it all spelled out for her by her hugely pregnant, long-lost \"friend\" amid mocking laughter.  She saw her shrink down to her former size and walk off, leaving Ally confused.  Within minutes she was feeling sick, then hungry, then sick, then starving.  She ate herself to sleep and woke up more bloated than when she went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was two days ago, and now Ally knew she had to do something.  She had no idea what would happen when she came to term, and she really didn't want to find out.  She called Heather, who had given her this situation, begging her to explain what to do.  Heather just laughed, telling her that there were other ways to lift the curse, but that this was just the easiest.  The only hint that she gave was that it would require performing tasks, obtaining some strange objects, and that neither of them would have the means to go about doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ally knew somebody who did.  She was a frantic one when backed into a corner, and just two days of an accelerated pregnancy were enough to make her pick her target and strike, before she got any further along.  She felt some pangs of guilt, but as the second day drifted toward the third, and her belly poked out further, the weight settling uncomfortably on her hips, the sudden spasms of uncontrollable hunger that turned her into a binging maniac until her stomach was satisfied.  Granted, the friend she chose to pass this onto might panic even more, but with Ally to help the two of them might be able to stop the curse before the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, Ally had been trying all day calling her old friend and was getting nowhere.  She knew she was in town, but she was in the middle of a pretty major movie, and just didn't have a lot of time for a social life.  As Ally approached the end of her first rapid trimester she finally broke down, leaving a tearful message that she had to see her old friend Scarlett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Scarlett Johansson, however exhausted she might be from filming and physical training for the role, was just decent enough to at least take the time that night to invite Ally over to talk.  Who knows?  It might be good to get away from work for a night, and it never hurts to help a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a moment too soon for Ally.  Approaching Scarlett's home, she felt a series of distinct fluttering movements inside of her.  She had to stop and steady herself until they stopped, and then, taking a deep breath, approached and saw her beautiful friend already opening the door to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally!  Come on in and tell me all about it.\"</span></div></div>",

It made Ally feel even more guilty, but not any less willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are friends for?\" Scarlett said, \"Production's winding down anyways.  I only wish we could have spoke sooner, it's been so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has,\" Ally took a deep sigh.  She would do the same thing Heather had done, just trick Scarlett into saying she'll accept whatever troubles she was having.  Ally felt so stupid for falling for that now.  Even then she thought Heather was phrasing things in a really weird, awkward manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, I have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant?\" Scarlett asked.  Ally was surprised, then realized that of course Scarlett could tell.  Ally might be able to hide the so far subtle changes to her body from most people but her friend was somebody that was obsessed with her own figure, and so of course would notice that Ally was thicker in the middle than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no, it's not that.  I have a, um, a burden . . .\" Ally paused, feeling stupid in how she was saying this but not knowing any other way, \"and I don't know who to turn to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, you can talk to me about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to unload this on somebody, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I know, just let it all out.  I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly got frustrated.  She couldn't exactly ask Scarlett, \"Hey, will you take this burden from me?\"  She'd sound like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett saw her distress.  \"Hey, it's okay.  Just tell me what's wrong.  We'll figure it out together.  Your problem is my problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly sat up straight as a unsettling, whirling feeling went through her stomach.  Without thinking she gulped and grabbed her midsection.  She felt it shrink down, felt the weight leave her, her jeans growing loose again, her body returning to its old self.  The change was not nearly as dramatic as with Heather, though to Ally it was just as relieving.  Apparently, Scarlett had stumbled onto a way to say \"I accept your curse\" as well as anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett looked confused by Ally's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just, um, hearing you say that, really takes the weight off my shoulders,\" she said, smiling brightly.  She understood why Heather was so gleefully pleased when she passed the curse onto Ally.  Ally felt like she could just leave and be done with, she was so relieved.  Even her friend's genuine concern for her seemed inconsequential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett placed a hand over her stomach as it gurgled.  Ally knew what she was feeling.  Some queasiness, nothing big right now, but it would probably get worse soon.  All Ally knew was that, at least nominally, this was Scarlett's problem now.</span></div></div>",

She could see Ally could hear it and saw the look of concern, that had just quickly vanish, return.  Something else had changed about her in the last few minutes, too.  It really looked like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, but it was more than that.  Did she look different than when she had come in?  Scarlett could have sworn her slim friend had looked a little puffy just moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, I have something tell you.  I'm really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, like I said you can tell me anything.  I'm here for you,\" Scarlett felt a lurching sensation in her stomach.  \"Ooh,\" she moaned softly, doubling over as it passed as quickly as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" Scarlett repeated, this time in apparent understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand.  I was pregnant just a few minutes ago.  I was a few months along.  See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly stood up and lifted her hoodie, revealing her flat stomach and unbuttoned jeans.  She rebuttoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look pregnant.  What do you mean a few minutes ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, well, you see, it was a curse,\" Ally said, grimacing at saying the word, \"My friend Heather, you remember her, you two met once or twice, passed it to me.  And I'm so sorry, but I didn't know what to do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, ow,\" Scarlett said, holding her hand up to signal Ally to stop for a moment as another wave of nausea hit her.  \"Sorry, go on, I'm not feeling so great right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because now I . . . I passed it onto to you.  And unless we follow some steps in a few days you're going to be full term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett looked at Ally in silence.  Ally couldn't tell what she was thinking, although it was clear the waves of nausea coming and going were distracting her from this conversation.  After considering it for a few minutes, Scarlett spoke.</span></div></div>",

I've seen people having trouble like this before, and it's always easier to just go along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly saw where she was going.  \"You don't understand, I'm not crazy.  I mean, you already feel sick, don't you?  That's morning sickness starting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's stomach growled as another bout of nausea had her doubled over before it passed.  She shook it off the best she could.  She continued in that firm but caring tone Ally had heard her take before when giving tough advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get help, Ally.  I'm sorry to have to be so blunt with you but trust me it's for the best.  I'll still be here for you, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds crazy, but I'm serious.  We need to do something fast,\" Ally was starting to sound frantic, crazy even.  She felt even guiltier now seeing that Scarlett was concerned for her mental well-being, but didn't get mad that she had tried to pass a curse onto her to save her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do.  But not tonight.  Look, I'm going to be busy for the next few days finishing up this film but I want you to know that you can call me at anytime and we can talk.  Tomorrow night we can see each other again, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett stood up, and Ally rose with her.  Scarlett was hunched over, her stomach in growing pain, a pulsating queasiness turning into a constant sensation rather than coming and vanishing as it just was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, this is serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally!\" Scarlett said, snapping as she took hold of Ally's shoulders.  She knew she had to be firm but wanted Ally to know that she really did care.  She wasn't just trying to throw her out and forget about this.  One of her oldest friends was clearly having a mental breakdown.  Scarlett was feeling horrible right now but she wanted Ally to know that she wasn't going to abandon her.  \"I need you to go home, okay?  We'll talk about this more tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly stammered.  She had no idea how to convince her friend that this was real and not just delusional ravings.  She pressed her hand against Scarlett's groaning stomach, causing Scarlett to jump back, apparently in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, calm down.  Go home.  Get some rest.  Call me tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett moaned as her stomach gurgled and sickened under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly didn't know what to say.  On the verge of tears, at what she had done to her friend and her friend's inability to believe her, she turned to leave.  They exchanged hugs, and both promised to speak tomorrow.  Ally thought that by tomorrow night Scarlett might be more willing to listen, and Scarlett thought the same about Ally.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlett was ready for bed.  She had to do some more final shots tomorrow and wanted to be rested.  But first, this sudden stomach bug had to be dealt with.  She dry-heaved on her bathroom for ten minutes, gulping down peptobismal, until she picked herself up and walked off to bed.  Her stomach growled at her.  Inexplicably just as she was starting to feel the nausea pass, she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was worried about her friend, of course, but Scarlett's first priority was finishing this movie.  There was definitely a Black Widow franchise waiting to start if her first solo picture was a hit.  Her part in all that was almost done.  After that she could give her full attention to Ally.  She had seen friends go off the deep end before, but never as suddenly as Ally seemed to have done.  Scarlett drifted off into a fitful sleep, her hand gently rubbing her groaning tummy . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Scarlett, stand still, we just have to do one final fitting,\" Marie the costume designer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am standing still,\" Scarlett said, but she fidgeted.  The costume was skin tight, and while not uncomfortable was not the easiest thing to wear.  Today it felt particular troublesome.  She tugged at it until Marie slapped her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that,\" she said.  Scarlett's hands came to rest of her stomach.  Her focus was there for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always so worried because you gain in your stomach first,\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Scarlett said, not in the mood to teased.  The costume did feel a little snug around her middle, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.  I think we'll have to take it out a little here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie poked Scarlett's stomach.  Scarlett looked down to see that, indeed, she looked bloated.  She covered it self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, this is not my day,\" she said.  She felt, and heard, a creaking from her middle as the tight fabric grew even tighter across her stomach.  \"Oh, come on, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked over, along with some of the crew.  She smirked and said in a mean voice Scarlett had never heard her use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let it all out for us, Scarlett,\" Marie said, to the chuckles of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett hid her stomach with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny,\" Scarlett said, then the wind was knocked out of her.  She felt her stomach jump forward into her hands.  The belt buckle of her costume flew off, and the fabric seemed to stretch enough to not tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god!\" Scarlett yelled as she held her now round stomach in her hands.  It felt full, heavy, firm.  \"Somebody get help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew laughed, their expressions saying that they saw this coming all along and that Scarlett only had herself to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't normal, something's growing inside me!\" Scarlett yelled at them, still holding onto her stomach.  Another pressure went through her, and her belly jutted out even further.  She looked, and felt, very pregnant.  It knocked her back into the make up chair behind her.  The zipper on her costume was straining to rip open.  She gripped her belly in a panic.  Without warning the crew had surrounded her.  Scarlett tried to get up, but another burst of growth pushed her back into her chair.  She felt wiggling inside her, each little kick feeling like it would be too much for her already taut skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It . . . it's too much!\" she said, pleading with her eyes for them to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have waited until after filming was done?  Now we'll have to use CG to make you look normal,\" the director said, shaking his head.  Nobody seemed to understand how terrified Scarlett was.  Another wave of growth hit her.  Her stomach was at full term or maybe even beyond that.  She was bound to the chair by it, unable to move.  She shook her body, grunting and yelping, trying to get up and maybe get somewhere where people would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie leaned forward and placed a calming hand on Scarlett's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help,\" Scarlett pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I think they're coming,\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett threw her head back in pain as every muscle in her body contracted.  Her belly throbbed inward, and then expanded again.  She gritted her teeth to keep from screaming.  With ever breath she was her stomach grow, her zipper tearing open revealing her taut, pale belly.  It grew, and grew, and Scarlett knew she couldn't take anymore . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett woke up, groggy and in a cold sweat.  The dream, or nightmare really, faded from her mind.  All she remembered was that she dreamed somewhat was wrong with her body, that it would impact filming, and that nothing she could do would make it better.  Her mind, and hands, seemed very oddly drawn to her midsection this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrrrrrrg . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her stomach.  She remembered she went to bed hungry, so a big breakfast was in order.  Exactly how big she didn't realize until she slowly made her way to the kitchen and realized that two bowls of cereal, a stack of five waffles, and half a gallon of milk weren't doing the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with you today?\" she said softly to her stomach.  She could either keep eating until it was settled--a prospect that unnerved her given her troubled history with keeping in shape--or ignore and get to work.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't help but thinking that the gnawing hunger was just a strange stomach ache.  But, hunger it was, and Scarlett had never had any trouble giving into her appetite when it called.  She was already full by the time she finished her unusually large breakfast.  Her stomach pressed lightly against the belt of her robe, feeling full and a little bloated.  She patted it and growled.  She might give into her urges between films, but this last one was just nearly finished.  And it was getting harder and harder to get back into shape, she knew, so it was more important than ever to keep her figure in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Scarlett scoured her kitchen for something to eat.  A bag of potato chips, mostly full, looked oddly appealing.  Without thinking she grabbed it and began shoveling the chips into her mouth without even sitting down, crumbs and grease covering her hands.  She thought little of wiping them on her silk robe afterwards.  Minutes later, she was done, and looking to the next item in her cabinet.  Her stomach growled and rolled, demanding even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, this is ridiculous,\" she whispered in annoyance.  Next to the chips was an unopened box of muffins.  This she took down and took the trouble to actually sit.  One by one she took them out, finishing each in four or five bites.  She was beyond her normal level of full, even for when she'd let herself go after staying in shape for a production.  She wasn't even tasting them, just biting, chewing, and swallowing, just trying to get as much nutrients into her body as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Scarlett had decided enough was enough.  Or rather, her stomach decided.  The last few muffins had to be forced down like her stomach was getting so full only a superhuman effort could pack any more food into it.  Unsteadily, Scarlett went to get dressed.  She found walking uncomfortable on such a full stomach.  Her breasts, too, she found oddly tender and a little swollen.  If she could just put off the onset of \"Fat Scarlett\" for two more days she could finish filming and focus on maybe not turning into a blob after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Scarlett thought walking on a full stomach was uncomfortable she found her clothes to be even more so.  She groaned, sliding up a pair of tight jeans over her legs and finding the button just not clasping.  She tried sucking in and couldn't.  It was fat--yet--it was food.  With much struggling she finally closed her pants, although sitting down would be problematic for at least a few hours.  A loose-fitting t-shirt mostly hid her food baby.  She just hoped it would go down before she had to be in costume.  She couldn't remember what she'd be wearing on the set today, but she dreaded having to wear it if this bump was still showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe massaged her stomach through her shirt.  That soothed it somewhat, although the thought that this is what pregnant women often do made her stop.  She recalled Ally's crazy warning the night before.  Could that have effected her somewhat?  She hoped not.  Scarlett was sympathetic towards Ally's breakdown, although would be less so if that breakdown was making her binge uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's stomach began rumbling again as she went to her car to get to the set.  She rolled her eyes, rubbing it again to calm it.  As carefully as she sat down, Scarlett couldn't avoid her jeans popping open.  She moaned in frustration.  At least once her food baby went down, the day would go smoothly from there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlett felt many temptations to stop and get more food along the way.  She resisted them, though, her unbuttoned jeans a crude warning of what lay on that path.  When she arrived on set she made sure to suck in her stomach as much as she could and rebutton her pants.  It was uncomfortable, and she kept rubbing her full stomach unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived on set and right straight to costume.  Marie was waiting.  She looked her up and down.  Did Marie notice Scarlett's food baby?  It made her annoyed that it must be readily apparent that she had been pigging out all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Morning, Scarlett,\" Marie said.  She had a slinky cocktail dress ready.  That's right, Scarlett remembered.  They needed some insert shots for a party scene early in the movie.  There were only a skeleton cast of extras for this.  Nobody really had any lines at least for this scene.  Scarlett just had to look pretty, something she was normally perfectly confident she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that today the dress was snug around her middle.  She cursed her reflection.  She had gained weight before and knew the signs, the just didn't usually come on so quickly.  Not to mention that the top was feeling too tight around her breasts.  She had worn this same dress not days before and it fit like a glove.  A sexy glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hoped nobody would notice.  She left her dressing room to have Marie approach her with a look of exaggerated surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, just one more day then you can eat whatever you want,\" Marie said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett glared and was about to come back with a snarky comment, but then Marie playfully patted her stomach.  When Scarlett was in a bad mood like this, should could lash out if rubbed the wrong way.  But instead of slapping her hand away as she wanted to do, Scarlett just accepted the unwelcome patting.  Maybe Marie could tell that it was hard, the sure sign of eating recently and not of fat, and maybe she couldn't.  But Scarlett had no comeback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to make-up,\" Scarlett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Marie mutter something about make-up not being used on her gut, but she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting for a half hour in the make-up chair was no more comfortable.  Her tight dressed pinched her middle and she was positive her breasts would spill out.  They didn't, and she survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anybody else noticed they didn't say anything.  Famed Swedish director Hans Petersen didn't, at least, and he was a stickler for continuity.  The first half of the day was mostly taken up with setting up shots and then filming for a few seconds, setting up again, filming again.  Scarlett grew antsy, irritable.  The others must have sensed it because they steered clear of her.  It was unlike Scarlett to be snippy with her co-workers, and even she wasn't sure why she was so generally angry today.  It wasn't just her clothes not fitting, although the sensation that her dress was somehow getting tighter as the day wore on didn't help.  Something else was bugging her.  It could only be Ally, she thought.  She was worried for, and annoyed by, her friend.  But Ally certain didn't make Scarlett eat so much that morning.  And she wasn't causing Scarlett to constantly touch her stomach.  She would have sat on her hands to stop herself if she was sitting.  Eventually the director called her over and said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, don't touch your belly so much, it makes me think that you are pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett reddened, and stopped herself from exploding at him.  \"I'm just really full, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell,\" Hans laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett was famished by lunch time.  She went to leave the set to get some food.  On the way she passed by Hans and his editor looking at shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped short when she saw two shots of the same sequence, filmed three hours apart.  They both showed her in full profile.  She started rubbing her stomach gently again.  There was no denying that her stomach looked just a little bigger on the later shot than before.  The director noticed it, too.  He shook his head and said, quietly and in his thick Swedish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another day and she can get as fat as she wants until the next Avengers,\" and then laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett didn't laugh, though.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlett changed into her regular clothes before going to lunch.  The dress had gotten too uncomfortable, and she was disappointed to find her jeans were no better.  Her stomach was puffing out, no question about it, and even buttoning her pants was a chore.  Fortunately her shirt was long enough to cover it.  If someone really looked at her they could tell she was bloated, but at a passing glance she still looked like the same slim, sexy Scarlett.  Every few steps her jeans popped open, and after a few tries she gave up.  It was hidden at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's stomach grew louder as she drove down the street looking for food.  She knew it was a mistake, but light headed from hunger and feeling pissed off at everything, she pulled through the drive through of a burger joint.  She simply couldn't help herself.  She ordered three large burgers, and a bag full of fries, then a large soda.  The only bright side was the surprised smile she got from the cashier at the window.  He must have been knew, she thought, since otherwise he wouldn't be phased by actors coming by.  Still, it made her feel good to be looked at like that considering how gross she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate in her car in the back of the studio parking lot.  \"Ate\" is somewhat inaccurate, \"devoured\" would be a better term.  She showed some restraint with her first burger, but the other two went down like there was no tomorrow.  She slurped her soda, too, shoving fries into her face.  It was like she couldn't stop herself, as though some outside force was telling her she really needed to eat all this and then some.  With still half her lunch break to go, Scarlett was done.  The seatbelt was digging into her stomach so she undid it and rubbed her tummy, gently moaning.  Once again, she had stuffed herself as full as she thought she could possibly be, and there was no way the effects wouldn't be obvious.  Her stomach was hard to the touch.  Slouching back in the seat her food baby poked up from her shirt, however loose it might be.  Scarlett groaned, belching to let some of the pressure out.  It didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, she lifted up her shirt to look at her puffy stomach.  She could joke about her \"Fat Scarlett\" mode after the fact, but seeing it come on so quickly and at the very end of a production was depressing.  She knew she had better will power than this.  Her stomach felt not only bloated, but sore and heavy.  The skin felt stretched even.  It wasn't any consolation that the puffiness was firm, and not soft and jiggly.  She rubbed her stomach, soothing it, although very self conscious by what the director had told her that looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett eventually worked up the courage, after her stomach had settled again, to go back to costuming and get ready for the next half of the day.  As before, there would be more insert shots.  Most of the extras had already left, actually.  She passed by her body double on the way inside.  She shuddered.  She was wearing the sexy spy suit, which meant that Scarlett would have to stuff herself into that same suit.  It was a little stretchy, so she should be able to handle it, but the pressure on her poor stomach, and whether or not the zipper would hold were another matter.  She didn't feel like she could do anything too acrobatic today, should the director call for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Skinny bitch,</i> Scarlett found herself sneering inwardly at her body double.  The uncharacteristic sentiment must have shown on her face, since her expression went from a friend wave and a smile to looking away, confused and a little annoyed.  Scarlett was getting angrier at Ally (who had left half a dozen unchecked messages on her phone by this point) for her crazy outburst last night.  No doubt Scarlett wouldn't be in such a rotten mood if not for her.  In the back of her mind she knew that was unfair.  Ally might have thrown a damper on her night, but she was clearly having emotional problems, and it's not like Ally was making Scarlett stuff herself with grease and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Scarlett, let's get you . . . into this,\" Marie said as Scarlett arrived in the costume department.  There was an infuriating smirk on Marie's face that Scarlett suddenly felt the urge to smack off.  She subdued it and answered calmly, except that to calm herself her hands went instinctively toward her stomach, rubbing it through her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Scarlett said as she took the costume, \"I can do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need help with the zipper,\" Marie said.  There was some hidden smirks, and some giggling, all around.  No doubt Scarlett's pissy attitude all day didn't make anyone sympathetic to her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett whirled back around and said, knowing she should just ignore it but not able to help herself, \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's eyes went wide and her smile vanished, \"Nothing, Scarlett, I'm just saying if you need help that's why we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Marie backing out and the other crew members pretending to go about their business, Scarlett wouldn't--or couldn't, her emotions flaring up in a frighteningly uncharacteristic fashion--let it go.  Actually, everybody had mostly gotten along during the entire shooting.  Marie could be snooty sometimes but Scarlett never let it bother her before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to dress myself,\" Scarlett reddened as she continued, the rational part of her pleading with her to stop talking and get dressed, \"If you're implying that I'm too fat for this now then you are sadly mistaken.  I'm a professional, and I don't blow up the last days of shooting, and just because I'm a little bloated doesn't give you the right to treat me like I'm some new kid who doesn't know how shoot a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie was leveling her hands in a calming motion as Scarlett spoke, her voice becoming shrill and trembling, like she was about to cry.  She could tell Marie felt bad, even though they both knew that if any offense was intended it was nowhere the amount Scarlett was taking out of it.  Without missing a beat Scarlett looked ashamed at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Marie,\" she said quietly, and then walked quickly to her dressing room, \"Sorry, sorry . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Scarlett!\" Marie had to yell so she would hear Scarlett had left so quickly.  She shrugged and looked at the others.  \"So, we're pretty much all in agreement?  She's pregnant right?  Mood swings, swelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded in understanding.  Despite her teasing, Marie had worked with Scarlett on other pictures and actually did like her, and wanted to make sure everyone who didn't work as closely with her as she did that this was definitely not normal behavior for the actor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a rare, but familiar, few moments of further self doubt, Scarlett had to stare at herself in the dressing room mirror and convince herself that she looked fine.  Fantastic even.  Just as gorgeous and sexy as always.  Her stomach was obviously puffy, there was no getting around that, but the rest of her was still perfect.  She tried to suck in her stomach again but was unable to.  With a deep sigh, she put on her spy suit. Since everything else fit like a glove, she hesitated as she zipped up and clasped the belt.  It zipped, but felt too tight.  Fortunately the suit was somewhat stretchy in areas, otherwise she knew she'd have no hope of getting it over her tummy.  As she noticed before, it was too tight around her chest, too.  Still, it looked great on her.  Even if others might notice her fullness they could get still get on with filming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, let's do this,\" Scarlett left her dressing room with a broad smile, forcing herself to be in a better mood.  As full as she was she could still sway her hips in that mesmerizing way that such an outfit encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew stood ready.  Scarlett was thankful there would be no acrobatics today, and if there were her stunt double would take over without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director did, however, have to take her aside and remind her to stop rubbing her belly.  She wasn't even aware she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix grueling hours later it was a different story.  Everybody gets tired after working so long, and some even get cranky, but Scarlett was feeling more exhausted than she remembered.  Worse yet, her costume felt tighter around her middle.  She thought her stomach was going from puffy to outright bloated, and she hadn't even eaten anything since lunch.  Maybe that was the problem, she thought.  She was starving, growing short with people again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came time to close up shop for the second to last day, the director gave some words of encouragement, but Scarlett wasn't listening.  She stormed away just as he finished to her dressing room.  She unclasped her belt, which flipped away from her middle, and then unzipped the suit.  She breathed easier now.  Until then she had no idea just how tight it had gotten on her.  She slumped down on the dressing room couch and rubbed her bare stomach, staring at the ceiling, listening to the growls of hunger filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett?\" it was one of her assistants, an intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett stood up and attempted to zip up her suit.  It pinched her skin, and she couldn't get it past her naval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second!\" Scarlett grabbed her robe and it threw it on over her outfit.  She opened the door a crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, what's up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brought you a sandwich,\" the intern said sweetly, \"You sounded hungry there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett grabbed it like she hadn't eaten in days.  \"Oh, thank you!\" she said, sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wel-\" the door closed.  The intern shrugged and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cramming what seemed to her to be not enough food into her mouth, Scarlett returned to her street clothes.  She was having less luck buttoning her jeans than before.  She resigned herself to leaving them open and just tugging her shirt down again.  As she walked to her car, avoiding everybody and pretending to ignore those she couldn't, Ally called again. Scarlett was in no mood to deal with Ally now.  She was concerned for her friend as before, but had gotten it into her that Ally was the reason she was so bloated today even though she knew that was ridiculous.  She hesitated to answer.</span></div></div>",

Strapping her seatbelt across her uncomfortable full stomach, Scarlett got home as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed her clothes, each article a relief.  Her jeans were pinching not just her stomach, but her thighs and behind as well.  He shirt, while it was loose enough, was too snug around the front.  And she had no idea just how swollen her breasts were until she undid her bra and was able to breath relatively easy.  She avoided the mirror.  She just put on some sweat pants and a tank top, accepting the fact that she was showing some bloated midriff, and headed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is wrong with me?</i> Scarlett thought even as she made a massive sandwich.  <i>I'm so bloated I can barely fit into my costume and I'm still eating.  Can't I go just another day and then worry about working this off?  What happened to my will power?</i>  But she felt powerless.  Filling up on snacks and her dinner, she sat herself down in front of the TV and spent the rest of the night eating.  Ally, and a few others called, but she ignored them.  Every now and then her stomach would gurgle, the food inside her seeming to shift, and she would look down and be reminded that she was bigger than she was even yesterday, she thought.  At least the nausea from that morning had passed.  With the TV playing softly in the background, Scarlett soon passed out on the couch . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scarlett was in her sweats and tank top like when she went to sleep, but now she was working out.  She ran on the treadmill for what seemed like an hour, then went on the elliptical, then did some sits ups and push ups.  The entire time she could feel her belly jiggling, knew that it was sticking out and wrapping around her sides, but she refused to look at it.  Only when she got on the scale did she actually look down and see her dimpled naval peeking out, and her flabby sides in plain view.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The scale read 140, 15 above her usual.  She looked at the ceiling and grunted in frustration, holding her puffy belly in her hands.  She felt it bulge out into them, pushing her sweatpants down and her shirt up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the hell was that?\"she said, looking past her now larger breasts and belly to see the scale read 150.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No way, that can't be right,\" she said, shaking her head in denial.  Still holding her belly, it bulged yet again, this time she felt her shirt grow tight around her sides, and her sweatpants filled out as her legs grew thicker.  The scale now read 160.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's impossible!\" she yelled, backing away, feeling her body jiggle and sway awkwardly.  She whipped out her cell phone and dialed for an ambulance.  There was no way this was normal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hi, this is Scarlett Johansson and I need an ambulance here right now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's wrong, m'am?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I-I think I'm getting fat,\" she said, feeling her body once again tingle and swell, this time her face was included.  Even though she was no longer standing on it, she could see the scale reading 170, then seconds later 180.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hurry!\" she screamed, panicking.  By now, she was half aware she was dreaming, but couldn't wake up.  She heard some chatter on the other end.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ms. Johansson we're looking at your report and we don't think you're getting fat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What are you talking about, my report?  I'm blowing up!  Send someone to help!\" Scarlett felt a tightening sensation all around her, knowing another growth spurt was coming.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Calm down, m'am, you're just pregnant.  Nothing to worry about.  Some minor weight gain is to be expected even if you are a noted celebrity.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The line hung up, and Scarlett stood there.  Suddenly, her chubby body had vanished, leaving her thin once again.  There was no time to think about that now, as the quivering feeling in her stomach rose, followed by a bloating feeling as her now flat stomach began to round out, pushing its way past her shirt.  In seconds, it was beyond her breasts, and growing so heavy that she fell down, holding it in her hands.  She couldn't speak, or scream, just push back against the relentless belly as it grew.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scarlett was full term now, trapped on the floor and grasping at her belly, yelping at every kick inside her.  She then knew Alley was there, watching her.  Ally walked up to he rand knelt down.  She was wearing a bikini for some reason.  She pressed her hand on her own stomach and then on Scarlett's, causing a wave of kicks and squirms to powerful Scarlett couldn't respond as Ally spoke.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Isn't it obvious by now, Scarlett?  You see why I couldn't let it happen to me.  If you just listen I can help you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scarlett could only gurgle in response as Ally walked away, leaving her helpless and writhing on the floor as her stomach expanded again.  She didn't think she could take anymore, and finally, as she fell on her back in resignation, she woke up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's first impression was that it was morning.  She had fallen asleep on the couch, surrounded by the remnants of last night's binge.  She moved forward to stand and found it harder than usual.  <i>Of course,</i> she thought, patting her stomach.  It was still full, and looked even more bloated than yesterday.  But it felt firm, not soft, so at the very least it wasn't turning to fat yet.  She shook off the dream as she got up to get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving felt different.  All that food was settling heavily in her stomach, making her walk slightly unsteadily.  When she got to her bedroom and prepared to get dressed, she audibly gasped at what she saw in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn profile, her stomach stuck out like a sore thumb.  It wasn't huge, but to her it was massive.  It was also rounding out, and she was able to cup the curve of it gently in her hands.  And from the front it was no better.  Her hips looked wider still.  She started to panic now.  She had barely fit into her outfit on set yesterday.  There was no way she'd get in it now.  She was just too bloated.  She cursed her lack of will power, and Ally for getting her in such a state with her crazy stories.  She hated to do it on the last day of filming, but there was simply no way it was going to happen.  Rubbing her stomach, since she found she couldn't help herself, she picked up her phone to make a call.</span></div></div>",

In fact, her stomach was probably bigger when she first started getting big, really, and nobody said anything was wrong with that.  So she might not be able to do any wide shots today.  It was a little embarrassing, to be sure, but she'd feel pretty stupid later on if she missed the big wrap up because she thought she looked too fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And nobody's going to think I look fat,</i> she told herself, although she found it hard not to keep looking at her stomach, and, annoyingly, from gently rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a larger pair of jeans that she actually was able to button, a shirt that was long enough to cover her midriff, and had a healthy, giant breakfast.  She regretted it immediately.  A full forty-five minutes of making, then eating, then making more pancakes eventually ended with her licking the syrup off the plate.  And she was still hungry.  She rubbed her full, hungry stomach.  The jeans were already feeling tight again, as if she hadn't even bothered to find the largest pair she had.  Of course, she could have went to the back of her closet, the dark, forbidden area where \"Fat Scarlett\" kept her wardrobe, but she wasn't willing to do that quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn set, things were tense from the start.  Marie barely spoke to her, and Hans seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.  Apparently her outburst yesterday had not been forgotten, and she couldn't blame them.  She would have apologized but thought it best just to keep a straight face and soldier through.  Even if the cocktail dress she had to wear again pinched her tummy uncomfortably, and her breasts nearly popped out of it.  Or that Janelle, her body double, seemed more ready to jump in than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, just a few more shots and we're done.  Can you, ah, put on the suit then?\" Hans asked, trying not to sound hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett sighed, but smiled.  \"I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's best did the trick.  Barely.  The zipper was extremely tight around her middle, as was the belt.  She felt like a stuffed sausage in it, more so than usual.  She didn't think she could bend down.  She breathed in as best she could, and walked out on the set, doing her best to project the confidence that she was the sexiest thing within a ten mile radius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so where do I stand?\" she asked, noting the pleased look of the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just over there,\" Hans began directing her as the crew got into place.  Scarlett strutted over to her mark, past a few extras in military garb.  She spread her legs to start an action pose, half joking, and then heard a loud snap, a tear, and felt great relief in her middle as her belt flew open and the zipper of her suit tore right down the middle.  Her stretched naval poked through.  Scarlett turned beat red while everybody around pretended not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire set went quiet.  Hans forced himself not to slap his forehead in frustration.  Marie and the rest of the make up and costuming crew held their breaths, preparing for a breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett thought fast.  She stood up straight and rubbed her stomach.  She tilted her head and smiled, sighing loudly, \"This has been one of those weeks,\" she said.  Not a great line, she knew, but she said in such a casual way, that the crew chuckled, and the tension from early died down.  Scarlett made way for her body double, and even patted Marie on the shoulder as she passed her by to her dressing room as if to say \"sorry for yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her dressing room, Scarlett breathed a sigh of relief that she had handled that better than she would have yesterday.  She looked down at her tummy, rubbing it, trying to sooth its moaning.  She was hungry again and she didn't know why.  If anything that public humiliation should have taken away her appetite.  At the very least, she had shown them that she was not insane and emotional.  She changed back into her regular clothes, noting that it took some effort to button her jeans yet again.  She took a few minutes to herself in her dressing room.  She sat, rubbed her stomach.  It calmed her, somehow.  It felt hard as well as rounded, which made sense since she had been stuffing herself nonstop since yesterday.  As if answering her thoughts, her phone buzzed.  Ally had sent her a text sounding desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please meet me today.  We really need to talk.  I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett shook her head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlett read Ally's text with a resigned sigh.  It was time to deal with this.  She just called her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, I'm so glad you called, listen-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, wait, let me talk,\" Scarlett said, calmly, \"We're both going through some things, but I think you worse than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end.  Then Ally spoke, her voice concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not worse than you.  Answer me honestly, Scarlett.  Are you rubbing it right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett tore her free hand from her belly.  She had, in fact, been unconsciously massaging it, as she found herself doing constantly the last two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubbing what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And are you, um, are you able to fit into your pants still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett almost yelled into the phone.  \"I put on some weight but it has nothing to do with what you said the other night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having the dreams?  The ones where you're growing out of control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett found herself breathing heavily, trying to hold back anger that was more than half really fear.  Scarlett felt her firm, rounded tummy under her shirt.  She clenched her teeth, practically growling into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly sounded genuinely sorry, her voice pleading.  \"Please, Scarlett, I'm sorry, can we just meet and talk about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why, so you can make me even fatter?</i> Scarlett almost said.  She stopped herself.  She still hadn't fully accepted that something supernatural was happening, and yet still didn't even try to think of any explanation for how she started eating like a horse and outgrowing her clothes the very day Ally came to her with insane stories about passing a pregnancy along to her.  Her hand shook as she held the phone.  Her mind started to accept that something very strange was happening, and that part of her understood how scared Ally herself must have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to stop it.  My . . . friend told me,\" Ally said after a moment of uncomfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett lashed out, \"I burst out of my costume on set in front of everyone today!  The director said I looked pregnant!  I spent a good part of the last two days of my free time eating like a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, please, I'm sorry,\" Ally pleaded.  Scarlett softened at her tone.  There was sincerity in it, and Scarlett's calm part understood.  But her emotional part, the part she was having trouble controlling with alarming infrequency lately, just got more furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two days of filming left, Ally!  You couldn't wait until then to screw me over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can fix it, we just need to hurry,\" Ally said, and Scarlett could hear her holding back tears.  She might have passed this curse to Scarlett in the heat of the moment, feeling there was no other option, but Scarlett got the impression that now she would do anything to undo what she did.  Scarlett forced herself to calm down.  Acceptance grew in her, it took a lot of will power to overcome the sense of betrayal she felt.  She couldn't resist one last jab at Ally's guilt, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally,\" Scarlett said, her voice lower, in control, \"Why me?  You know how hard it is for me to stay in shape and you go and intentionally make it impossible?\"  She couldn't quite admit to herself that her finding it harder than ever to stay in shape was due to a sudden, mystical pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I wish you could understand how sorry I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm getting fatter by the hour.  If you were going to make me live through one of my worse recurring nightmares you couldn't have done a better job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hear 'sorry' one more time I'm going to be even sorrier,\" Scarlett said, not sure what the threat meant.  \"Meet me at home.  And bring . . . bring a couple of pizzas.\"  The last part had a bit of humor in it, as much as Scarlett could have humor in her voice.  She could hear Amy smiling meekly on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.  Your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Scarlett hung up.  She'd miss the wrap party, but had a feeling everyone would understand why she wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Scarlett changed into sweatpants to give her stomach room to breath.  Not just her stomach, of course.  Her hips were noticeably fleshier from two days ago.  They had been thicker in her heavier days, but having them grow even a little bit again was a blow to her vanity.  She kept her shirt on that covered her belly, even if it make her look bloated.  She imagined by the end of the day there would be no hiding it.  And by tomorrow . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smelled the pizzas Ally brought even before Ally entered.  She moaned in anticipation, her stomach answering with a groan.  She got up--a slight wobble to her step.  It was the first time she felt that her walking was a little off, that there was some extra weight in her middle.  She didn't want to dwell on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Ally said, barely able to look Scarlett in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me those,\" Scarlett took the four pizzas and went to sit down, placing them on the coffee table.  She started eating immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought four might be enough.  On my second day I was eating about that much every meal,\" Ally said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Scarlett said between bites, \"You looked huge when you came by.  Am I going to be that big by tonight?\"  There was accusation in her tone, but also concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Ally said, staring at Scarlett's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop staring at my belly,\" Scarlett said, rather calmly she thought.  \"Now talk.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlett couldn't get the pizzas down fast enough.  She was folding slices and eating them in three or four bites each.  With everything out in the open now, she cared less about what she looked like in front of Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly took out two folded sheet of papers.  The looked to be old photocopies of even older papers, the folds and tears impressed on the image.  The first one was a crude drawing of a statue.  It was abstract, looking like some kind of obscure award or some simple piece of modern art.  It had a sturdy, square base, and then a slim funnel shape rose up to a ball on top.  There were lines across it, one at the base and one at the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Scarlett asked, her mouth full.  She swallowed, belching with her mouth closed.  She patted her chest with her fist while rubbing her stomach.  It gurgled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's some kind of statue.  My friend wasn't too clear on what it was.  But it's been broken into pieces and have to find it.  Apparently it has something to do with what started this, ah . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I think the reason the pregnancy was transferred to someone else, and then someone else, and never, you know, finished, was because this thing was broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of pregnancy would need a statue?\"  Scarlett stuffed the last slice of the first pizza in her mouth.  She looked at the empty box on top of the others and moaned.  Even at her worst she never ate like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  But not a normal one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett nodded as she tossed the empty box aside and opened the other one.  The smell rose up and hit Scarlett in the face, her stomach rumbling in anticipation.  She closed her eyes and sighed.  Then she opened her eyes and placed both her hands on her stomach.  She was at that early stage where she didn't look pregnant yet, just unusually tubby and bloated.  She felt the firm roundness of her stomach beneath her hands, stretching her shirt tighter than it should.  Suddenly, she looked surprised, or scared, as the realization hit her.  She looked down beyond her breasts and to her bloated stomach.  She saw her naval visible through her stretched shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm pregnant,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah . . .\" Ally said, fearing Scarlett was about to freak out on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you know, and I know, but . . .\" she held her head in her hand, shaking it slowly.  \"We're going to have to fix this fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're here.  I know what you're going through-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett glared at her, \"Then why don't you take it back if you feel so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly paled at the idea, \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Ally?  Afraid of something that you have no idea what it is growing inside you, or that you'll turn into a giant waddling blob in front of millions of people?  Because both of those options are pretty scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett . . .\" Ally didn't know what to say.  Scarlett backed down, raising her hand in a truce.  She started on the next pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it,\" Scarlett knew she had every right to be upset, but she also knew that her moods were not her own right now, and getting angry wouldn't solve anything.  \"Just tell me what I need to know and what we have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Ally showed her the second sheet, her hands shaking.  Scarlett saw what it was immediately.  It was a list of the three pieces of the statue, each one followed by a list of dates and locations, as if they were given away or sold off or temporarily lost through the years.  The earliest date there was in the 1920s, which meant that this pregnancy could have been passed along for nearly a hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the three pieces and where they're supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that,\" Scarlett said through yet another mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The base is apparently in somebody's home, this Pratchard mansion . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St. Simon's Manor,\" Scarlett said, \"It's in the hills about an hour north of San Francisco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know.  Of course you know,\" Ally managed a smile, \"Rich famous people go there, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.  The place is abandoned.  But I heard about it because, you know, it used to be a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the base is the closest to us.  The middle part looks like it's in England, though.  And there's coordinates.  I looked them up.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Why would they even put coordinates unless it was somewhere so isolated that there weren't any towns or landmarks.  Can we get to England?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can get to England, Ally,\" Scarlett said.  She was more than halfway done with the second pizza.  Her arms and jaw were tired from eating so much so quickly.  And her stomach felt full, and looked even fuller.  She rubbed it and couldn't suppress a whimper.  Ally looked sympathetic and, Scarlett was at least partially pleased to see, awfully sorry.  \"How far is this going to stick out by tomorrow?\" she said, not expecting an answer.  Ally hadn't got her second day, apparently.  Scarlett remembered her looking bloated when she saw her, so she gave this curse away before she could be really inconvenienced by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you eating like this for the two days you had this?\" Scarlett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Ally said.  With some hesitation, she slowly lifted up her shirt.  Scarlett raised an eyebrow.  Ally's always flat tummy looked softer, bulging just a little over her jeans, which Scarlett was surprised to see were actually straining somewhat.  \"Some of it stuck with me, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not enough,</i> Scarlett thought, but still, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said.  \"So where do we go first?  The closest or the furthest?'</span></div></div>",

Scarlett had already finished off two of them, and was opening the next box.  She sighed and rubbed her stomach, wiping the grease from her hands on her too snug tank top.  She dug in yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" Ally said.  \"Can we get a flight out tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow? Uh, no,\" Scarlett swallowed, \"We'll get a flight out tonight-uurrrp!\"  She blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm blowing up like a balloon, Ally,\" Scarlett snapped, letting go of her pizza to grab her tummy.  It was still in that puffy, not-quite-pregnant-looking phase, but even as they sat their eating she could feel it getting fuller and firmer.  \"We're going to take care of this as fast as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it,\" Ally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett took out her phone and looked up local, small flights.  After a minute, and another slice, she found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  We can get a flight to San Francisco in an hour, I am arranging a car to rent right now, and we can get to the mansion by five in the morning.  We'll sleep on the plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly was impressed.  \"I knew you'd be able to handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Borrow a bag and some clothes if you need them,\" Scarlett said.  She finished off her slice and stood up with a wobble.  Her shirt rode up revealing the lower curve of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett hurried to the back of her closet, pulling out a pair of \"Fat Scarlett's\" jeans which were actually loose on her, although somewhat snug around her ass.  She even needed a belt to keep them up.  She threw some sweatpants and some of her larger sweaters in a duffle bag while Ally did the same.  With a look of determination that impressed Ally all the more, they were off to the air field.  The whole time Scarlett suppressed her belches as much as she could.  Ally wouldn't say anything she knew, but they both knew all those empty boxes on her coffee table were a bad sign.  Scarlett could certainly blame Ally for this but she knew she had quite the appetite that needed to be constantly in check.  She couldn't help but feel Ally eyeing her with at least some satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scarlett was sitting on her couch, a stack of pizzas in front of her that went over her head.  Ally paced nearby, a solemn expression on her face.  Didn't this just happen, Scarlett thought, when Ally interrupted.  She was opening the top box and taking out the full pizza in her hands.  She began to messily roll it into a tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?  We have to get going,\" but Scarlett didn't stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need carbs for the trip,\" Ally said, inspecting her pizza tube, \"Now open wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her will Scarlett leaned her head back and opened her mouth wide.  Ally proceeded to force the tube of pizza into her.  It slid down her throat and landed in her tummy with a gulp.  Scarlett shook her head and held her stomach.  It gurgled, swelling with the new meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, Jesus, Ally.  Let's get moving now,\" but Ally already had another rolled pizza ready.  \"Seriously, I've had enouuuuuu--- \" Scarlett's mouth opened wide again, and again received the pizza despite her protests.  This time, her stomach bulged out further, a horrible stretching noise accompanying the gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Scarlett said, panting and rubbing her sore belly, \"I know I pigged out but now I-I think I had enough-bwuuuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett vividly remembered, even in her dream, how she had been pigging out, and now felt ashamed of herself.  Also, the little bit of pudge she saw on Ally's stomach the night before was gone, while hers was even more pronounced.  Despite feeling stretched to the limit her naval was deep and fully exposed as her shirt rode up with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This . . . this pregnancy is . . .  it's making me eat like a pig,\" Scarlett said, and was about to turn on Ally when she saw yet another pizza coming her way.  This time, she kept her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame the pregnancy, honey,\" Ally said, \"You always were a bit of a pig when you let your guard down, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett opened her mouth to speak and a loud, sudden \"Oink!\" came out.  Ally stuffed the pizza in, her stomach bubbling and bulging, growing not just up but wider as well.  Lovehandles oozed over her sides.  Scarlett wimpered, holding the detestable flab in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide!\" Ally said with uncharacteristic glee as she rolled another pizza and rammed it into Scarlett's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink!\" Scarlett said again, now starting to feel ridiculous as well as afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly knelt down and grabbed Scarlett's swollen belly in her hand, looking into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we can fix this pregnancy you think you'll recover from what it does to your body?\" she said, voicing just one of Scarlett's current fears.  Scarlett tired to speak, and in classic nightmare fashion couldn't.  She could only grunt and squeal, holding her belly while Ally readied another pizza . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, Scarlett's first sensation was the plane's seatbelt digging into her stomach.  She realized she must have grown yet again in the night.  To her dismay she found Ally leaning on her asleep, her hand resting heavily on her stomach which she had tried to hide with a thick coat.  It moved slowly back and forth.  Even though the coat Scarlett's overly sensitive skin was soothed.  It felt strangely good having someone else massage her belly like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed Ally away without any gentleness and rubbed the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We landed,\" Scarlett said.  \"Get up, and get your hands off my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry . . .\" Ally said.  There were maybe a dozen others on the small plane, most looked like business types.  A few did look with interest at Scarlett, but apparently they were all on private or secret business, and everybody kept to himself.  Ally reached up to pull their bags down.  Scarlett was pleased to see her slightly puffy stomach was still there.  She shook the dream off.  They were getting stranger and stranger, not to mention less helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scarlett stood up she had to steady herself.  Her back ached slightly, a feeling she knew wasn't entirely from the flight.  She could feel herself being forced forward by the weight growing inside her.  Her hips were definitely wider.  At least, she wasn't banging them on every other seat when they boarded a few hours earlier.  This would be the third day, which by her count would make her in her third month.  She wasn't sure if she was the right size for being that far along, but she felt massive and was certain her belly would be pushing past her breasts if they also weren't swollen to an even more ridiculous size.  She wanted to get on the road and away from anyone who might see her.  She also had to unbutton her coat.  It was too warm, and in her condition she was getting hot easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly couldn't suppress a gasp at her size when they were off the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Ally, I'm enormous, can you please stop looking at me like that,\" Scarlett snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not that big yet,\" Ally said optimistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet!?\" Scarlett snapped, realizing that if they didn't hurry she would be a lot bigger by the end of this.  She forced the image out of her mind.  \"Come on, our car is waiting.  You drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, because of your uh . . . sure, I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's tummy growled with hunger.  It had been only a few hours and yet she felt like she hadn't eaten in days again.  She pouted as she pressed her hands into her taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is absurd,\" she said as they pulled away.  They had to get moving, and yet with each passing minute her every thought turned to food.</span></div></div>",

Scarlett could only ignore the hunger for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull through there,\" she said to Ally flatly, indicating a McDonalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wolfed down three quarter pounders.  Fifteen minutes later her stomach was rumbling again.  A Taco Bell passed by.  She made Ally turn around and go there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened three times, stretching their drive to almost two hours.  Before they were there, Scarlett suddenly grunted and opened her coat.  It wasn't tight, but all that eating had caused even her loose jacket to feel restricting.  She rubbed her full belly.  She didn't think it was possible to feel and look as full as she did.  Her shirt was riding up, a gap between her tank top and yoga pants showing her milky skin.  She tugged it down.  She was starting to get an underbelly.  She imagined by now she was beyond looking merely pudgy and looked pregnant, and yet that wasn't all.  She felt subtle folds of flesh at her sides, and her thighs beginning to touch.  That she had felt before whenever she put on weight, but it was all the more unnerving to have it happen so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Taco Bell, she couldn't stop belching until they arrived at the mansion.  Ally found it unsettling seeing her friend bloated and gassy, and apparently it showed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop looking at me like I'm some kind of-uuuurp!-freakshow?\" Scarlett snapped.  \"I know I'm huge, and fat, and gassy, okay?  You don't have to rub it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly murmured an apology under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road to St. Simon's was long and passed through a forest that once must have been meticulously cared for, but now looked overgrown and natural.  It soon opened up to an vista showcasing the enormous, European-style mansion.  Even from a distance, the place looked abandoned.  The first gate had been broken, and the second one leading to the driveway was just open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of the car.  Scarlett stretched, arching her back and rubbing her taut stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look bigger?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah . . .\" Ally said.  Scarlett growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bigger,\" she added.  They walked towards the door.  Scarlett was starting to feel the extra weight as her center of gravity shifted.  It wasn't serious, yet, but it did give her steps a slightly awkward wobble she wasn't used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the ornate doors.  Inside, there was furniture, old oil paintings, statues, and other relics, mostly covered in white sheets.  A chandelier  hung overhead, and two staircases reached up to the second floor, meeting in the middle.  Scarlett tried a light switch.  It worked, to their surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this place still have power?\" Scarlett asked, rubbing her stomach despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I still pay for it to, that's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett and Ally whirled to their left.  A young man, probably younger than them, dressed halfway decently but with a ragged look about him, approached from a side room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The family hasn't lost all its money, you know.  Well, I'm all the family, and I still have some left at least,\" he seemed friendly enough, and spoke with a sort of vague upper class accent.  He looked from Ally, and then his eyes fell on Scarlett.  He pointed at her as if trying to remember who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey,\" he said, taking a few steps forward.  Ally stepped back, but Scarlett held her ground.  She crossed her arms to stop herself from rubbing her stomach.  \"You're not Scarlett Johansson, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Scarlett said, smiling.  The man shrugged and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, well, this is weird.  I almost didn't recognize you, ah--\" he stopped, his eyes darting to her bloated stomach.  He stumbled over his words, apparently believing he had committed some sort of faux pas.  \"Well, what I mean is, you look smaller in the movies,\" he smacked his head.  \"I mean, you know, taller.  You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett smiled, standing with as dignified and air as she could with her belly poking out almost as far as her breasts.  She tugged her shirt down.  That part didn't feel dignified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry for breaking in, we didn't think anyone lived here.  I heard it was abandoned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.  But I decided to fix it up, for the family honor or whatever.  I'm Warren Pratchard, by the way,\" he stepped towards them and shook both their hands.  Ally had said nothing, and he kept looking at her expecting her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Scarlett.  This is Ally.  We really are sorry for the intrusion,\" Scarlett started unconsciously talking like Warren, influenced by the crumbling yet rich surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?  How many guys would go live in a mansion in the middle of nowhere and still get Scarlett Johansson and her lovely friend to show up at their place?\"  Scarlett smiled.  Even Ally did, partly at seeing Scarlett look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here for something,\" Scarlett said abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, tell me about it.  Maybe some drinks and something to eat?  I don't have a butler but I keep the place stocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's tummy growled loud enough to echo, and her insides churned in anticipation.  She winced and grabbed it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a yes,\" Ally said.  When Scarlett recovered, they made their way to the kitchen, which was a good walk from the front door.  The kitchen appeared to be completely lived in, lacking the dust and sheets of the rest of the house.  Warren, with a knowing look, began to reheat some leftovers in a microwave.  He poured three glasses of wine.  Ally gladly took hers.  Scarlett did as well, but as she tipped the glass to her lips she felt a violent bloating inside her, like a bubble had suddenly grown there and was threatening to pop her already overly tight skin.  She yelped and dropped the glass, then held her stomach until it calmed.  For a felt like her insides were punishing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have to be kidding me,\" she said, both angry and annoyed.  \"It's not letting me <i>drink</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you ladies here for?\" he looked at Scarlett's stomach, which she was still gently caressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go into the whole story.  Sorry, but we just can't.  You wouldn't believe us if we did.  But there's something we think is in this house.  It's part of an old statue.  Here,\" she handed Warren the paper, \"We think the base is in here.  It's about ten inches by ten inches, maybe inch and a half thick, should look like something was supposed to be sticking out the middle but got snapped off.  Is there anything like that in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren looked at the paper curiously before handing it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look ladies, there's a lot of antiques in this house.  Much of it's in storage.  Now, I know some places where this might be, but-\" the microwave dinged, and Warren took out a large helping of leftover pasta.  Even reheated it smelled like a gourmet meal he had specially made.  Scarlett began stuffing her face with abandon the second it was in front of her.  Warren looked puzzled, but amused.  \"Does she always eat like this?\" he said to Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly shrugged.  \"She's going through some things . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's belly rumbled, visibly vibrating enough that she had to steady it with a hand while she ate.  Her eyes narrowed.  She did not find the sensation pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, as I was saying,\" Warren sipped his wine, as did Ally, \"There are some places where this would be more likely to be.  But I warn you, this place is huge.  If we don't find it right away, we could be searching a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett went more pale than usual at the revelation.  \"Oh my god, you're joking.  We-we don't have a lot of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd better get looking,\" Warren said.  He stood up, having finished his small portion, as did Ally, while Scarlett had just finished much more than both of them combined.  She wiped her face, giving them a look that demanded they not judge her.  Neither knew what to make of this Warren Pratchard.  He seemed completely innocent, and polite.  If part of this relic was in his house he likely had nothing to do with it, even if his father or grandfather or other ancestor did, right?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, Warren, how to think we should go about looking for this?\" Scarlett asked.  She stood, feeling the strain on her back from her heavier tummy.  She rubbed it with a wince, pulling down her shirt to hide a sliver of skin that appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Warren said, careful to pull his gaze away from Scarlett's middle, \"There's a lot for rooms in this place.  And everything is basically in storage.  We have two big dining halls on the first floor here that are loaded with art and artifacts, so those might be places to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.  We'll divide up.  I say we do a quick run through the place and then if we don't find it we'll do a more thorough search.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Warren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ally agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren gave them the basic layout of the first floor.  Ally, who had been to some rather large houses with Scarlett before, had never been to one quite like this.  It was really was like an 18th century European castle.  While they were fading, the walls were still covered with antique wall paper, the ceilings with ornate carvings and electrical lighting done up expertly to look like candlelight.  If not for the fact that is was obviously mostly in disuse, the place would have appeared less creepy.  Ally wasn't going to argue with Scarlett about having to go and search alone, though.  If there was any trouble, Warren said they could just yell and he'll come running.  Both he and Scarlett didn't know what she was thinking might happen, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Scarlett and Ally diligently searching their crowded rooms, where most of everything was covered in a white sheet and shelves had been pushed so close together to hold smaller objects that Scarlett had trouble sliding through sideways, Warren ran upstairs.  He called a number her hadn't called in a while, and an old, crotchety voice answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this all about?\" the voice said.  His Great Uncle William answered.  Warren had not spoken to him a lot in years.  William was Warren's only living relative, the others dying young in accidents, or simply vanishing.  His own parents had died in a plain crash years before, and he spent much of his youth as an irresponsible, law-breaking rich kid with no responsibilities.  He still didn't have much in the way of responsibilities, but at least he wasn't using family heirlooms to cause trouble and commit petty crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle William, it's Warren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you are.  What's the problem?  Are you back in jail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren chuckled, \"Nah, I don't do that stuff anymore, you know that.  Listen, Scarlett Johansson is in my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?  What are you talking about?\" William had been losing his hearing for years, but Warren didn't want to have to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's an actress, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you dating an actress now?\" William said, sounding somewhat impressed and even interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, I wish.  No, she's here, and she's pregnant, and she's looking for the base to a statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have them searching for it now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, son,\" William said, sounding stern, \"Don't let her leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a friend with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let either of them leave.  Understand?  If I remember right the base is in one of the dining/storage rooms on the ground floor.  I think it's in whichever one has that Louis XVI dining set, or whatever the hell it is.  Should be out in the open, I think.  Won't be hard to find.  You need to stop them from finding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they do find it, do not let them leave.  You understanding me, son?  How far along do you think she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I don't know.  Uh, three months?  She's big but small enough that she still moves around like normal,\" Warren said, with the pleasant image of Scarlett moving around in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can I stop them from leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You figure it out.  What, you've done breaking and entering before, haven't you?  Ever tie somebody up?  Every use some of those mystical devices we have?  Don't lie to me, I know you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt them-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, don't hurt them!   Especially the pregnant one!\" William shouted into the phone as if Warren had just said he would assault the two women in his house.  \"Restrain them, paralyze them, distract them, just do whatever to keep them there and I'll be up there by tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay.  Can you tell me what this is about?  I mean, I heard those stories when I was a kid, with the pregnancy that kept getting passed along, the family lost track, the statue would complete it or neutralize it whatever, but I don't actually know what that all means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, son, just make sure they don't find it or don't leave if they do and then I'll explain it when I get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll do it,\" Warren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  I'll be there tonight!\" and he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren had to think fast.  He hadn't been in either of those rooms much, but he did recall something like a stone statue base in one of them just sitting on a shelf in the back, out in the open on a small end table with nothing else on it.  Was Scarlett or Ally in the right room?  He wasn't sure now, but he had to work fast before they found it.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Warren thought about the magical or just plain weird objects in this house.  Many of them he had used in his mischief-making days.  He never really hurt anyone, and in fact didn't think there was anything in the house that could cause in great harm anyways, but he definitely knew how to misuse a magical artifact to his advantage.  He had put some of them into storage himself, remembering that Scarlett had gone to one of the rooms where much of them were.  He assumed that if this base was going to be anywhere, it might just be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett wound her way around endless draped furniture and bookcases.  Some of the bookcases near the back of the room looked promising, housing not just books but lots of boxes and even other small statues.  She squeezed between them, her belly brushing some objects sticking out.  She chided herself for feeling bad about that: if anything was going to stop her from getting into narrow spaces right now it would be her breasts and ass.  Her stomach was puffy and sticking out, but not enough to be a major hindrance yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we ever going to find it?\" she asked as Warren entered.  It was a large room but his footsteps echoed, making a surprise entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do a sweep of the place,\" Warren said, his eyes darting around the other end of the room.  If he could just remember if he had even seen that base he could find it first and hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  We have about a week and each day it's going to get harder,\" Scarlett said, her bitterness evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Scarlett said.  Warren turned around and saw her exiting the shelves, holding a large, square block of stone.  She was smiling, the first time Warren had seen her do that.  He rushed towards her.  Despite his uncle's warning he couldn't help but once again feeling excited to be this close to Scarlett.  Puffy tummy or not, Warren was pretty sure if Scarlett had asked him to do something while smiling at him like that he'd find a way to do it, whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, isn't it?\" she hefted it into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren looked around frantically, seeing dozens of things that could help but really not wanting to use any of them.  But his Uncle was no idiot, and knew a lot that Warren could only imagine.  If Uncle William wanted Scarlett and Ally stalled then he must have good reason to.  His eyes fell on a book, not far from where Scarlett stood.  It was one of many esoteric works in the house, but this one Warren found particularly helpful.  His Uncle would probably give him a good talking to for using it like this, but Warren discovered early on that it was protected.  It couldn't be read without some kind of precaution, or something.  Warren had no idea what it was, nor what was in the book itself.  But he knew that if you opened it without taking off the protective spell it would knock a person out for a good half a day.  He had done it to himself on accident the first time, and then later used it to break into an ex-friend's house to get back at him.  He didn't think he'd ever be doing anything like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be!\" Warren said, trying to sound pleased.  He walked toward Scarlett and the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down, two to go,\" Scarlett said.  It looked like a weight had been lifted from her.  She put the heavy stone under her arm and gently rubbed her stomach, then blushed and stopped as Warren stared at her.  \"Sorry, er, I can't seem to help doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren sighed, wondering whether his Uncle really did have the best intentions, or if it would be better to help Scarlett and Ally on his own and head off to the second piece of the statue.</span></div></div>",

Scarlett took a few steps forward and opened her mouth to speak just as Warren opened the book directly at her.  A blinding flash filled the room.  When it cleared, Warren saw Scarlett standing completely still, her hand reaching out.  Her eyes were half closed and her mouth hung open.  She started to waver on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren rushed forward to help her fall gently to the ground.  The book seemed to have made a pretty loud noise, so he didn't want to waste any time with Ally.  He jogged to the room she was in, finding her looking helplessly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's so much stuff in here,\" she said as she saw Warren.  Warren flipped the book open at her, and like Scarlett gently lowered her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren didn't feel good about this.  He couldn't help thinking his uncle probably had something different in mind to keep them here, but Scarlett had already found the base.  What was he going to do?  Grab it from her and run around the house so they couldn't catch him?  Actually, that might have been the better option, he thought.  But it was done.  Uncle William would be here eventually, and they would both be out for at least half a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It wasn't a normal sleep, and so this couldn't be a normal dream.  Scarlett vividly remembered her nightmares the last few nights.  She recognized she was sleeping, but she couldn't move.  She seemed to be lying down somewhere, but the only thing that was clear was her own body, like she was watching it from a distance.  Her stomach looked round and bloated, as she remembered it being.  As she watched her body curiously, she saw it changing.  Her shirt grew tighter and began riding up as her belly rose.  Her yoga pants stretched outward as her hips flared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, stop!\" Scarlett cried out to her body, but it didn't listen.  Her belly went from merely puffy to obviously pregnant.  Her breasts swelled with her belly, and soon her shirt looked like it might rip open.  But she remained completely still.  She was helpless as she watched her figure balloon in all directions, filling the couch and shredding her clothes.  Even her arms grew enough to tear her jacket sleeves.  Scarlett cried out as she saw her cheeks puff out and her beautiful face grow rounder.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream and reality merged together slowly.  Scarlett still couldn't move, but she knew she was lying on a couch.  She could see around her, and hear voices.  She felt the cool house air on her lower tummy.  Craning her eyes she saw that her belly was grown.  The skin felt tighter, and her shirt had ridden up a little more.  As her bra was yet tighter still she gathered that if her breasts hadn't grown she might be able to see her belly looking even larger from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices drifted in and out nearby.  One was Warren.  The other was the voice of an old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett could see Ally lying just as still as her on another ornate couch nearby.  The room filled in around her.  It was a sitting room of some kind, somewhere she hadn't been in the house yet.  Finally, Scarlett blinked, the first movement she was able to make.  She lie still, listening to Warren and this other person.  What were they talking about?</span></div></div>",

And it won't be easy as this makes it look.  This . . . curse, so to speak, has been traveling around for eight years.  You know, when it was first cast, it took a year to come to term?  Now, it's down to a week.  Soon, it will be instant, and there will no stopping it.  We have to stop those things from being born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett sat up as quickly as she could, finding that her stomach was now sticking out far enough to just begin resting in her lap.  She pressed her hands into it, pulling her tank top down and shuddering.  She felt even heavy now.  Her breasts, big as they were to begin with, had a distinct extra bounce as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things?\" she said as her voice returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam and Warren turned to her.  Warren approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Scarlett Johansson, is that right?\" William asked.  \"Pleasure to meet you.  I am William, this young layabout's uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'things'?\" Scarlett repeated.  Her hands remained firmly planted on her belly, rubbing it in a futile effort to make it go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may feel human, and even look human, but make no mistake, miss-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's temper flared.  She stood up, with a slight but her very disconcerting wobble due to the extra weight up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me what I have to do to get these things out of me now,\" Scarlett's commanding voice caused Warren to stop in his tracks.  He didn't expect this.  She was generally pretty soft spoken in her movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're, ah, working on it,\" Warren said.  William shook his head and approached.  He was a dapper old man.  Scarlett guessed he was probably Warren's great-uncle rather than just his uncle, judging by his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Working on it,' huh?\" Scarlett said.  She stood with her hands on her hips hoping that her enlarged stomach didn't detract from how intimidating she was trying to look.  It didn't.  \"How much long do you have to be 'working on it,' because I feel bigger than I was when you knocked me out--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I wish you hadn't done, my nephew, you do <i>not</i> play with magical objects you don't understand,\" William interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-so much bigger am I going to get before I pop, huh?\" Scarlett betrayed her fear in the quiver of her voice.  \"What did you do?\" she said to William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam sighed, then sat down.  \"I'm sorry, miss.  This was never meant to go on for so long.  We, or rather, my parents and their siblings, only wanted to stop  beast from being born.  We had no idea it would be so prolonged, or that innocents would be caught up in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get it out of me?\" Scarlett asked, her voice softening, her hands moving from her sides-softer now, she noted with distaste-to her firm, round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can, but we will have to work fast.  If you come to term before we are prepared, we will have to transfer it yet again.  Presumably to your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly, who had sat up but remained silently, finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no,\" she said, with a horrified tone that made Scarlett roll her eyes despite the seriousness in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some things we might able to do, but the best solution is to try to assemble the relic within the next five days,\" William said.  \"If you like, there are some spells I can try to stave off the birth, but you might not like the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of anything I would like less than this,\" Scarlett said, indicating her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be able to accelerate the pregnancy to term, then hold it in place.  That will buy us a few more days.  But the effects might be damaging, both to your body and mind.  But if you want to do that, we have to do it soon.  The long we wait the less time we can buy by such means\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett turned to Ally, who had nothing to add, and thought.  Scarlett still had so many questions to ask, but what was happening to her body was first on her list of priorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Near her place was an old antique shop that she had been meaning to check out. She had money and she had time, so she decided that today was the day to have a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the shop, her nose was immediately assaulted by a number of smells. She recoiled briefly before getting over the smell. She passed the counter, where an ancient man was tending the till. He smiled at Jennifer. <br>\r\n\"Welcome! If you see anything, don't hesitate to ask me about it\".<br>\r\nJennifer thanked him before beginning her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter perusing most of the shelves, her eye was drawn to a necklace. It had a silver chain with a diamond heart. Lifting it, she thought she saw the diamond glow but dismissed it as a trick of the light. <br>\r\nTaking it to the man, she asked, \"What's the story about this necklace?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it was once owned by a princess, years ago. Her fiancee gave it to her as an engagement gift, so she wore it everyday. Sadly, before their wedding, the princess discovered that she was pregnant. Her fiancee abandoned her because of it. In her grief, the princess took her own life. I can only assume that someone stole the necklace for it to have ended up her\", explained the man. <br>\r\n\"How much?\", asked Jennifer. <br>\r\n\"For you? I'll take 50 dollars because you are one of the only people to have visited my shop in a while\", replied the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding over the money, Jennifer slipped the necklace over her head. Once again, she thought she saw the diamond glow, but she ignored it again. Thanking the man, she left the shop. <br>\r\nHowever, on her way back home...</span></div></div>",

Looking around, she briefly thought that it was thunder before dismissing it. As she continued on, a small craving for food began to creep up. She ignored it, until...<br>\r\n*RUMBLE*<br>\r\nShe stopped again and looked at her stomach. <br>\r\n\"Was that... me?\", she questioned. Another rumble answered her. <br>\r\n\"I guess I haven't eaten in a while. It wouldn't hurt to stop somewhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spied a restaurant across the street. Trying to not look too desperate, Jennifer hastened her pace. Opening the door, a number of people all turned to look at her. Within seconds, she was surrounded by a number of fans, all clambering for an autograph or picture with their favourite actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing a number of napkins and smiling for many pictures, the crowd around her slowly dispersed. Finally, everyone had left, allowing Jennifer to locate a table. A waitress hurried over. <br>\r\n\"Hi there, what can I get for you?\", she asked. <br>\r\nLooking at the menu, Jennifer was spoiled for choice. Eventually, she had decided. <br>\r\n\"For my starter, could I have the Garlic Bread? For the main course, I'll have the Sirloin Steak. Could I also get a cheesy chip as well?\", she finished, giving the menu to the waitress. <br>\r\n\"And... Cheesy Chip. And your drink?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll have a Diet Coke\", she answered. <br>\r\nAs the waitress walked off, Jennifer tried to silence her growling belly. <br>\r\n\"Be quiet... Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the Garlic Bread arrived. She quickly wolfed it down, pausing only to take a swig of coke. The waitress, who had finished serving someone else, walked past her table and did a double-take. The plate she had just given to Jennifer was now empty, with her sitting there rubbing her belly. She took the plate back, slightly amazed at how fast the celebrity had finished her starter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the steak and the cheesy chips arrived. Jennifer quickly cut her steak into pieces. She then started to eat the steak and the chips at the same time. She wasn't paying any attention to the bloated feeling she was having in her belly. If she had been, she would've seen that it was pushing out slightly and that her breasts were slightly bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her meal and paying for it, she left the restaurant, still oblivious to her bigger belly and breasts. Other people noticed it, prompting whispers to start. Jennifer noticed these, and just hurried home faster.

I just fed you,</i> she thought.  She patted her growling stomach as she walked, quite automatically, to the kitchen.  She sighed.  It wasn't like her to be so hungry, and certainly not to eat so much in one sitting.  She went to her fridge and took out some leftover pizza from a gettogether with her friends the night before.  Her stomach rumbled with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even reheating it, or even sitting down, she wolfed down a slice.  She turned back to the fridge, her stomach still felt empty, demanding, and yet oddly full.  Not surprising, given how she had just eaten as much in a morning the she would normally eat in a day.  But still, that hunger . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo slices later and Jennifer's mind was finally free of enough of hunger to think straight.  She sat pulled up a chair to the kitchen table where her laptop lay and sat down when her jeans button popped open.  For a moment it didn't register.  She squinted quizzically at her stomach, below her breasts, which themselves felt a little swollen.  She rubbed her tummy through her shirt.  Yes, she was definitely sporting an embarrassingly obvious food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is great,\" she muttered, standing up and looking at her profile in the oven door.  There it was, her lower stomach puffing out against her unbuttoned jeans, stretching her t-shirt out.  She grimaced as she held it in her hand, forcing herself to admit that her always strong will power might have failed lately for her not to notice this sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what everyone was snickering about,\" she said.  She sucked in her stomach and was able to redo her jeans, but then she was struck by such a cramp that she doubled over, causing them to undo themselves again.  This time the growl that came from within her wasn't hunger, but nausea.  Holding her bloated middle, Jennifer ran to the bathroom and spent the next fifteen minutes heaving over her toilet, emptying herself of the massive amounts of food she had just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better, but just barely, Jennifer washed her face, took some pepto to settle her stomach, and once again eyed that unsightly bulge with disapproval.  She was too young, she thought, to have her metabolism turn on her, and was certain a few weeks of harder exercise at the gym would prevent this from getting any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, when she prodded that little bulge, it felt somehow full, disturbingly so.  For the moment, not wanting to upset her stomach any further, Jennifer pulled her shirt down and left her jeans open.  For good measure, she tugged at her bra.  It was feeling nearly painfully tight today.  Thus uneasy, but at least temporarily certain that it was a temporary problem, Jennifer went to look at her calendar to see what the rest of the day held.</span></div></div>",

She picked it up, and was greeted by a shrill voice on the other end.  \"Jen, where the hell are you?\" the voice asked.  It was Melissa, her manager.  She was a bespectacled blonde haired lady, who was in her mid 30s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer paused, then decided to respond.  \"I'm at my house, why?\" she asked, placing a hand on her bloated middle, noticing its firmness.  \"You were supposed to be at the GQ photo shoot twenty minutes ago!\" Melissa said, anger tinging her voice.  \"I completely forgot!  I was just...preoccupied!  I'll be there as soon as I can!\" she said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer buttoned her jeans and hurried to her car.  After a ten minute drive, she arrived at the photo shoot.  She saw Melissa and the photographer, and walked towards them.  \"About time you showed up, Jennifer!\" Melissa said, still quite annoyed at her.  \"Alright, so just get changed real quick, and we'll get this started.\" the photographer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed into the lingerie that was set out for her, and returned to the set.  She was still wearing her necklace, as she thought it matched with the lingerie.  Unsurprisingly, her bulge protruded over her underwear.  As Jennifer posed for the photographer, he and Melissa had a conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...uh...she's got a bit of a belly going on, huh?\" he muttered.  \"Yeah.  Could you just, like, photoshop a six pack onto her or something?\" Melissa asked.  \"Sure, it'll cost you though.\" he said.  \"Ugh.  How much?\" she asked.  \"$250.\" he replied bluntly.  \"Fine.\"  After twenty minutes, the shoot was over, and Jennifer changed back into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Jen!  Hey, could we talk about something?\" Melissa asked, as the walked outside.  Before Jennifer could respond her belly rumbled.  \"Could we discuss it over some dinner?\" she asked.  The two drove to a nearby burger joint, and went to order their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have two double cheeseburgers, an extra large fry, and a large chocolate shake.\" Jennifer said, her stomach rumbling.  Melissa's eyes widened.  \"I'll just have a cheeseburger and a small fry.  Oh, and a bottle of water.\" she said.  The two got their food and found a table, and Jennifer quickly chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jen, I don't really want to beat around the bush.  But, you've kinda...packed on a few pounds.\" she said, watching Jennifer scarf down her food.  \"I just finished a pretty intense role, I thought I'd relax a bit, is that a problem?\" Jennifer asked.  \"No, of course not.  But if the paparazzi get a look at you, they'll destroy you.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, this belly is just bloating.  I've been...eating a bit more lately, but after this meal I'll slow down a bit.  Tomorrow, when the bloating goes down, I'll start working out.  Fine?\" she asked.  \"Yeah, sounds good.  Thanks.\" Melissa said.  As Jennifer finished her meal, a wave of nausea overcame her.  She darted to the bathroom and entered a stall, emptying the contents of her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, still sick.\" she muttered.  When she stood up, she noticed that her stomach was slightly bigger, making her look nearly four months pregnant.  \"Yep, definitely need to start working out tomorrow.\" she noted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the left the restroom, she and Melissa parted ways, and Jennifer walked to her car.  Her rounding belly gurgled, and Jennifer placed a hand on it, rubbing it to try to calm it down.  Unbeknownst to her, a member of the paparazzi was hiding in a nearby bush, snapping pictures of Jennifer in the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer arrived at her house, and went to her bedroom to change into something more comfortable.  She put on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, her belly pushing out the fabric.  She put one hand on her belly, noticing that she was doing it more often, and sat down on her couch, relaxing.  She turned on the TV and started channel surfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she received a text from Melissa.  TURN TO E! NEWS NOW!!! it read.  Startled, Jennifer turned the channel, and after a brief commercial, there was a special report.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Hunger Games starlet Jennifer Lawrence have a baby on the way?  Earlier today she was spotted caressing what looked to be a baby bump.\" the reporter said, as the picture in question appeared on the screen.  \"Sources close to Jennifer denied to comment on the issue.  Though given how much time she spends in the spotlight, it's only a matter of time until we find out if she has a bun in the oven.\" the reporter said, ending the report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer called Melissa, who picked up right away.  \"Pregnant?  They think I'm pregnant?!?\" she asked, exasperated.  \"Listen, Jen.  Whenever a female celebrity has too much to eat and makes a public appearance, the media always jumps to the \"pregnant\" angle.  That's just how it goes.  Look, if it's bloating, like you say it is, it'll go down tomorrow.  I've already scheduled an interview with E! News for you tomorrow afternoon, so you can deny the claims there.  Then we'll be done with it, alright?\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine.\" Jennifer said, hanging up.  She rolled up her shirt, inspecting her bloated belly.  \"Pregnant...how ridiculous is that?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course it was absurd she'd be pregnant, but looking at her rounded belly peeking out from her shirt made her realize that she certainly looked it.  Jennifer was certain within a few hours celebrity gossip sites would be posting those pictures of her next to photos taken just weeks because of her normally trim self.  She shuddered at the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I need to get back into shape,\" Jennifer, slower than usual, stood up, and wobbled a little.  She had to catch herself on the couch arm.  \"Well, that's new,\" she grunted.  Could she really have gained so much without realizing it that merely standing took a little extra effort?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer made for her exercise bike but didn't quite make it.  Little things starting distracting her.  She noticed yet again how tight her bra felt, and how her breasts felt noticeably heftier than usual.  She looked down, her belly not quite large enough to be seen past them, and took the necklace in her hand.  It really was a beautiful piece, more like an antique in a museum than something bought in a store, and yet not gaudy or out of place.  She was still walking, but had gone past her bike, and into the kitchen.  Standing in front of her fridge yet again, staring intently at the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's belly rumbled.  She rubbed it, noting her shirt riding up, her lower belly pushing against her shorts.  She must have rubbed the growling ball her stomach was becoming for a full minute before she yanked her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop doing that!\" she said, both to her wandering hands and her stomach.  No wonder everyone thought she was pregnant if she kept rubbing her stomach like that and stuffing her face like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even a conscious thought on her part, she simply opened the fridge and, as if obeying some law of stereotypes, took out a jar of pickles and began eating them, one by one, nearly a dozen of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp,\" she covered her mouth, tossed the pickle jar into the sink, and reached back into the fridge.  She kept it open, feeling rather warm and enjoying the cool air.  She rubbed her stomach listlessly, wondering what to eat next.  She felt the heaviness of the food inside her, but there was no denying a growing softness over that.  She didn't even look down at that unsightly pudge before taking out a nearly full container of cottage.  She got a spoon and wolfed that down, returning to the fridge, her stomach still demanding sustenance.  That too she tossed into the sink, and returned to the fridge.  She grew frustrated.  She had plenty of ingredients and snacks, but very little actual food since she had finished that left over pizza earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought made her quite full stomach quiver with hunger.  But no, Jennifer thought as firmly as her confused mind would allow, she at least had that much self control.  She brooded over the thought of ordering some pizza, or any delivery for that matter, while scooping ice cream right out of the case into herself.  Scoop after scoop followed, calming and filling her belly, cooling her whole overheated body.  She was glad she was still standing in front of the open fridge, although her feet were starting to feel a little sore, and she had an odd feeling of pressure on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be the extra weight,\" she said shifting her feet, and then chiding herself, shoving the now empty ice cream container into the garbage.  \"Oh, come on, I'm not that fat!\" she then amended that, \"I'm not <i>fat</i> at all!\"  She tugged down her shirt again, as more of her of her midrift had grown exposed.  This was getting out of hand.  She stormed from the kitchen, subtly aware of a new, slight sway to her hips.  Jennifer plopped herself down on the couch, aware that her earlier decision to work out had turned into another binge fest.  The worst part was she was still hungry.  Her stomach would not let up.  No matter how much she caressed it, trying to calm that damn round thing down.  Now it felt somewhat firmer than before, and somehow made sitting a little uncomfortable, forcing her to lean back, slouching in an almost slovenly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her stomach, feeling both depressed at its presence and determination that she would have to work out, start eating right again, if she didn't want this to get worse.  It hiccuped under her hands.  She dialed a familiar number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, hello, I'd like to place an order.  . . . . Yes, could I get two orders of fried rice.  Two, no three orders of sesame chicken . . . Wait, make that four.  How many dumplings are in an order . . . ?\"</span></div></div>",

She looked around the room, and noticed that she was still in her living room, covered by a blanket.  On the table next to her sat a decent amount of Chinese food cartons.  She looked at the clock on the wall, and noticed the time.  \"Jeez, 9:30 already?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of last night were a bit of a blur for Jennifer.  She remembered ordering the food and eating it (all of it), but after that, she couldn't remember.  She realized that she left the TV on, so she decided to flip to E! News to see if they were still talking about her \"pregnancy\".  Sure enough they were, and they now had a so-called \"celebrity pregnancy expert\" as a guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were showing two pictures of her, one with the bump, and one without that was taken a week earlier.  The camera was zoomed in on Jennifer rubbing her belly, and the expert went to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've heard some people saying that she's just gained some weight, because she's mentioned many times how much she loves food.  But look, look at her belly.  Do you see how tight and round it looks?  If she were actually gaining weight normally, it would sag a bit, it would be less compact.  Not the case for Jennifer.  I take my job very seriously, and I must say that she is most likely pregnant.\" he concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's hard to deny that opinion right there.  As Bump Watch continues, we are pleased to announce that we have snagged an exclusive interview with Jennifer later today.  Stay tuned...\" the reporter said, as Jennifer turned the TV off, slowly removing her blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.  Can't wait to see their faces when they see that my belly is--\" she froze, actually getting to see the belly in question.  It had gotten larger over the night, making her look at least six months pregnant.  \"Bigger.  My belly is...bigger.\" she finished, shocked at the round ball of flesh protruding from her.  She heaved herself from the couch, which was pretty difficult, and waddled into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of her mirror and rolled up her t-shirt, which was already displaying a decent amount of her belly, and observed it.  It was as tight as a drum and as round as a basketball.  Her skin was perfectly smooth, and her belly button was starting to shallow.  In addition, her breasts as well as her butt had gotten slightly bigger, but that was the least of Jennifer's worries right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this be a tumor?  Or...or maybe it's an allergic reaction to some of the food I've been eating.  Yeah, yeah...that's it.  But there's absolutely no way that I'm pregnant...\"she trailed, one hand slowly rubbing her belly.  \"Ugh, stop that!\" she grumbled, as her cell phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fished it out of her shorts pocket and saw that it was Melissa that was calling.  \"Hello?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Hey, Jen.  So that bloating's gone down, right?  No more belly?\" Melissa asked.  \"What?  Uh, yeah.  No more belly.  Right.  What's up?\" she asked, resting her free arm on top of her protruding midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to check in on you, making sure that you're ready for the interview today.  You know, the usual.  Anyways, I've got a bunch of errands to run today so I'll talk to you tonight, okay?\" she asked.  \"Yep, sounds good.  See you then.\" Jennifer replied, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer plodded back into her living room, approaching her exercise bike.  \"Maybe I can work this belly off...\" she pondered.  She got onto the exercise bike and started to pedal.  Unfortunately, her larger belly occasionally bumped into the front of the bike, which made things pretty uncomfortable for her.  After a couple of minutes of pedaling, she stopped, annoyed by her stomach's hindrance.  She tried to do a few sit ups, but that went even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that brief amount of exercise, her stomach rumbled loudly. \"I've worked out hard enough, I guess I could get something to eat.\" Jennifer said.  She raided the pantries and fridge for ingredients, and began to make some food, finishing off the leftover slice of pizza as she did so.  Her finished result was a pretty large amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually ate all of it, and decided to check the time, as her belly gurgled in content.  \"1:00 already? I spent that long eating?  I gotta get going!\" Jennifer said, not wanting to be late for the interview.  She made her way to her bathroom, and began to take a shower.  She spent most of the time rubbing her belly, her hands unable to be drawn away from it.  Afterwards, she dried off and went to put on some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was able to shimmy into an incredibly tight pair of jeans, and put on a light brown t-shirt, which was actually the largest one she owned.  Now, her pregnant-looking stomach was pushing it out, making the shirt look skin-tight.  \"I might have to get some larger clothes if I keep getting bigger...\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer grabbed her car keys and walked out of her house and into her car, her hips swaying to and fro along the way.  She plopped into the driver's seat, and was disappointed to find that her belly grazed the steering wheel.  Starting the car, she headed off to the interview.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If driving as uncomfortable, so was getting out of the car.  Jennifer had to try twice to stand, and when she did she found herself steadying herself against the door and, holding her belly to keep from falling forward.  What grace she had was being undone by this weight gain.  It was all the worse that it was centering on her middle.  Her whole body felt wobbly and difficult to control.  Walking across the walled and covered parking deck to the E! News studio was made bearable only because she didn't have to deal with hundreds of onlookers watching her tug at her shirt and stumble every few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention even such a short walk winded her.  She was breathing heavy when she got to the receptionist.  Her back was starting to ache.  Her jeans were low enough that her belly wouldn't bust the button like before, but her ass felt like it was going to tear them anyways, not to mention her hips and thighs were painfully restrained.  For the moment her larger concern for the cause of her bloated condition was dwarfed by her increasingly foul mood.  She felt a growing desire complain loudly and angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the front desk.  It was a skeleton staff today, she noted, at least in this part of the building.  Which was good.  Millions might see looking like this on TV, but that was better than dealing with them in person.  The receptionist looked her right in her belly and then recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lawrence, thank you for coming by.  We have the room set up, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to do a five-minute interview,\" Jennifer snapped despite herself.  She felt bad immediately, blushing brightly, and would have apologized except for a sudden wiggling, gassy sensation inside her.  She patted her stomach and stifled a little belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, right this way,\" the receptionist couldn't take his eyes off of her, but at least he wasn't fazed by her rudeness.  Jennifer followed slowly, still rubbing her stomach while trying to act like she wasn't.  These gas bubbles wouldn't quit, and Jennifer didn't even feel like burping.  They settled down by the time they entered the studio, a small crew standing ready.  There was a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, different from the usual interviews she had done, that it made her feel temporarily at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Sadler will be with you shortly,\" the receptionist said, turning briskly and leaving.  As he left, Jennifer saw him glance behind himself and very obviously gape at her swollen behind.  Jennifer blushed again, glaring at the back of his head as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt Sadler, who Jennifer had met several times and interviewed with before, ran over to greet Jennifer.  She smiled, but it was tempered by her obvious surprise.  She took Jennifer's hand while speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, it's so good to see you again!  What's wrong?  Are you . . .?\" Catt couldn't help but notice Jennifer wasn't rubbing that new belly of hers, and that her shirt was riding up, revealing how tight her skin--and jeans--were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not,\" Jennifer snapped, nearly yanking her hand away.  She tried to soften her expression, but every second seemed to make her more frustrated.  She just wanted to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Catt asked, smiling and not seeming to pick up on Jennifer's irritation.  The two began moving toward the chairs in front of the cameras.  Like clockwork, the crew was ready.  Catt had some last minute make-up applied, but Jennifer waved them away.  She knew she wasn't looking her best, but just wanted to get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" Jennifer sat slowly, sighing with relief.  That relief was short lived when she saw that even sitting straight up her belly was out as far as her breasts, which themselves were bloated and straining her shirt.  All at once, in front of Catt, a camera crew, and the cameras, Jennifer felt enormous.  She wanted to curl up and hide her swollen figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was I thinking?  I can't sit next to Catt and expect people to notice I'm turning into a cow before the whole world.  No wonder they think I'm pregnant, I look like a blob next to her.</i>  Jennifer tried not to glare at Catt, but couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Jennifer, you know the drill.  Quick back and forth, I ask you about the rumors, you, er, deny them, we cut to commercial.  Simple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God,\" Jennifer shifted in her seat and tugged at her jeans pinching her softer sides, \"You have no idea how uncomfortable I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I know how it is,\" Catt put a comforting hand on Jennifer's shoulder and motioned for the countdown to begin.  She shot back to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Catt Sadler with an E! Hollywood exclusive.  Jennifer Lawrence has been dogged by pregnancy rumors lately.  We ask the young star herself to put these rumors to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Catt.  These rumors happen every time a celebrity puts on a few pounds,\" Jennifer dropped her pouty attitude, and was able to hide her current self-consciousness.  She was actually a little glad to be on TV now, flat out saying that it's okay to gain a little weight.  Of course, she was fully aware this was more than a little weight, but for the time being she could ignore that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt laughed lightly, \"That is true.  So are you denying these rumors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Jennifer said.  Her stomach growled, her cravings of earlier returning suddenly and powerfully.  She discreet held a hand over her rumbling belly.  \"I know, I just got through a few very intense rolls and have relaxed lately.  I admit, I guess I should have stuck to my gym regimen,\" she gave a fake chuckle, \"but saying I'm pregnant just because I skipped a few workouts is ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you have it,\" Catt turned to the camera, \"Jennifer Lawrence is not pregnant.  This is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I haven't even gained that much weight,\" Jennifer interrupted, despite the brief interview already being over.  But the cameras were still running.  And Jennifer quite clearly wasn't thinking straight.  \"It's mostly just bloating.  Maybe an allergic reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well-\" Catt started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer slouched further in her seat and continued.  \"I mean, I'm in great shape, all the time, everyone knows it, and I slack off just a little and suddenly everyone assumes I'm pregnant just because my stomach isn't as flat as it always is?  This will go back down, Catt.  Just a little extra exercise and I'll be in as good of shape as I always am.  What?  What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jennifer's addled brain finally registered Catt's confused expression, she realized what she was doing.  Her hands had been developing a life of their own lately.  They had moved under her shirt and were gently caressing her belly, moving in wide circles over her tight skin.  Her increasingly shallow belly button had come into view.  Jennifer stopped, blushing bright red, and became silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Catt Sadler with E! Hollywood news,\" Catt said, officially ending the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a rap,\" a crewman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of awkward silence followed as Jennifer tugged her shirt back down, unable to fully cover her orb of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're really not pregnant?\" Catt finally said, her skepticism obvious and, Jennifer, a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer felt like both crying and yelling.  But all she really wanted to do was flee, and then eat, and then hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just fat, okay?  Happy?\" Jennifer stood as fast as her larger body would let her, and she stormed out.  She vaguely recalled Catt trying to apologize, but Jennifer was in no mood for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was almost waddling to her car.  The steering wheel pressed against her stomach, causing her to grunt and pound on the seat adjustor.  She was hungry, humiliated, and confused.  The only thing that would make her happy now would be to wake up and to have the perfect body she had had only two days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two days ago?</i> she thought with wonder mixed with fear as she rubbed that distended stomach she was hating more every second.  <i>How could all this happen in just two days?</i>  She wasn't just thinking of her stomach, although that was the biggest change, but her wide hips, her bloated ass, her tender, swollen breasts that were getting so sensitive even the amulet resting above them seemed to cause them to tingle.  Jennifer started her car and left, fully aware that she was not at all fully aware of what she was doing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First things first, Jennifer needed some bigger clothes.  As it stood right now, she was nearly bursting out of her jeans, and her shirt revealed a small amount of her rounded middle.  If she got bigger, she wouldn't have anything to wear.  Jennifer drove to the nearest mall and ducked her head, hoping to avoid anyone recognizing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled inside, she noticed that the mall was fairly empty.  She gave a sigh of relief.  <i>Thank God.  Now I just have to get some clothes and then leave.</i> she thought.  Jennifer waddled to the nearest clothing store, and went to buy some clothes.  Inside the store, Jennifer went to get some larger jeans, shirts, sweatpants, and bras, which she was desperately in need of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer headed towards the changing rooms to try them on, but was interrupted by her stomach growling violently, demanding food.  Not wanting to keep it rumbling for much longer, she quickly paid for her clothes.  \"Ma'am, are you sure you won't be needing maternity clothes?\" the cashier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not pregnant.\" Jennifer replied, her belly continuing to rumble.  The cashier immediately noticed her mistake, realizing who she was.  \"Oh!  M-my apologies!  I just saw your interview.  Big fan!\" she said.  \"Thank you.\" Jennifer said, giving her a fake smile.  She completed her purchases, and waddled to the food court as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe multiple scents emanating from the food court were irresistible, as Jennifer's stomach rumbled loudly.  She made a stop in every restaurant, piling her trey with pizza, Chinese food, burgers, and more.  She found a table secluded from everyone, and took a seat, her stomach grazing the table.  Grunting, she scooted back, beginning to wheeze at the amount of effort it took.  She took a moment to catch her breath, as an alarmed couple walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you alright?\" the girl asked.  \"Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Just...a little out of breath...\" Jennifer huffed, one hand absentmindedly rubbing her belly.  \"Oh, alright.  Just making sure everything was okay.\" she said, walking away.  Jennifer began to dig in, as the couple got out of her hearing range.  \"Was that...Jennifer Lawrence?\" she asked.  \"I don't think so.  Just some pregnant lady.  Kinda looked like her, though.\" her boyfriend replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer ate ravenously.  She devoured everything on her plate in minutes, like she hadn't eaten in days.  When she finished, she stifled a burp, immediately covering her mouth.  Once again, those wiggling, gassy sensations continued.  Jennifer rubbed her stomach, hoping to ease it down.  They subsided, and Jennifer waddled out of the mall, returning home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jennifer approached the front door of the house, she noticed that the lights were on.  \"Huh, I thought I turned those off.\" she muttered, opening the door.  She was greeted by Melissa, who was sitting on the couch.  \"What the hell, Jen?!?\" she asked, astounded at Jennifer's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Melissa.  How was your day?\" Jennifer asked, putting her bags of clothes down, trying to dispel Melissa's anger.  \"You told me the belly was gone!  It's not!  I saw the interview when it aired, and they've been tearing you apart!  They're still saying you're pregnant!\" she said.  \"Really?  But I thought the interview would help...\" Jennifer said, sitting down on the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!  It's only made things worse.  And not to mention you were rubbing that thing the whole time.  Just be honest with me, Jen.  ARE you pregnant?\" Melissa asked.  \"NO!  I mean, I haven't even had sex in, like, a year!  It's impossible!\" Jennifer responded, growing increasingly frustrated.  \"So what do you think it is?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Maybe it's a tumor.  Or maybe an allergic reaction.\" Jennifer replied.  \"Do...do you mind if I felt it?\" Melissa asked.  \"You want to feel my belly?\" Jennifer asked.  \"I just wanted to see what it felt like.  Maybe I could figure out what's wrong.\" she said.  Jennifer sighed, rolling up her shirt to reveal her belly.  It was so round and tight, it was like she had a bowling ball stored inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa ran her hands across Jennifer's swollen stomach, feeling its tightness.  \"Wow, it's so hard.  Is it uncomfortable?\" she asked.  \"Uncomfortable is a bit of an understatement.\" Jennifer grunted, shifting her position as her heavy stomach provided a large amount of discomfort.  A few minutes later, Melissa was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Jennifer asked.  \"I don't know.  I mean, you can't be pregnant if you haven't had sex in over a year, but...I don't know.  It's weird.\" Melissa said.  \"You're telling me.  Hey, Melissa.  Do you mind...staying the night?  To be honest, I'm just kinda scared about this whole thing.\" she said, resting her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure!\" Melissa replied, giving Jennifer a reassuring smile.  \"Thanks.  I really appreciate it.\" Jennifer said, stifling a yawn.  It had been a busy day for her, and her energy was essentially drained, both physically and mentally.  \"I'm actually kinda tired.  I think I'm gonna get some rest.\" she said.  \"Okay.  I guess I'll sleep on the couch?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.  It's pretty comfortable.  I slept on it last night.  I'll get you some sheets and a pillow after I get changed.\" Jennifer said, waddling into her bedroom. She put on some sweatpants and a t-shirt, noticing that half of her belly was displayed.  She rubbed it, noticing that the wiggling sensations returned.  \"What is that?\" she asked, as the feeling slowly faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer returned to the living room with some sheets and a pillow, giving it to Melissa.  \"So I just confirmed a doctor's appointment for you tomorrow at 11:30.  Hopefully we'll find out what's going on then.\" Melissa said.  \"That sounds good.  Good night.\" Jennifer said, scratching her belly.  Melissa bid her goodnight, and Jennifer returned to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the right position to sleep was pretty difficult.  She tried lying on her back, but felt weighted down.  Eventually, she had to put a pillow underneath her, as she lay on her side, which was good enough.  Eventually, she drifted off to sleep, the wiggling sensations continuing to persist.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It must have been the combination of that increasingly wiggling feeling inside her, and her insatiable hunger, that woke Jennifer in the middle of the night.  The first sound she heard was her stomach roaring with hunger.  Groggily, she grunted and rubbed it.  She flinched and pulled back her hand.  The skin around her swollen middle felt tight, overly sensitive.  Even the supposedly larger shirt that hugged her middle sent her taut skin tingling.  She heaved herself up, huffing, and slowly stood, her hips feeling more weight than they were used to.  She had to spread her legs a little stand steadily.  Her back creaked as it arched further, the weight of her stomach altering her posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at her profile in her full length mirror and nearly teared up.  She rubbed her belly, hating it, wishing it was the flat surface she had only days before.  It had gotten bigger, too.  She knew this, since it was starting to poke up just past her breasts, and those too hard grown swollen and fat, feeling just as sensitive as her stomach.  As she pulled her shirt down as far as it would go to hide how her belly button was nearly flat, and saw very light red lines along her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is unbelievable,\" she said, almost in resignation.  Stretch marks, as if turning into a blimp in two days as bad enough, now when she lost the weight-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growling interrupted her thoughts.  She needed food, and she needed it now.  She whimpered in defeat.  In the back of her mind were thoughts of working out, getting back into shape, but up front all she could think about was that her body was demanding food and her figure would continue to pay the price.  She put on one of her new large pair of sweat pants and crept to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly led the way Jennifer kept having to sooth those wiggling feelings inside her.  They were fleeting and subtle, but growing stronger each time.  Why couldn't she just belch and be rid of it?  At least letting some gas out would relieve how full she felt.  But no, they kept popping up, then fading away with a little gentle massaging.  Funny how she didn't even want to look at her stomach and yet couldn't help but touch it constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer should have gone grocery shopping.  Still, the smell of simple ingredients as she entered the kitchen was satisfying.  She had bread?  Some lunch meat?  She made a few sandwiches, stacking them high, arranging on her kitchen table.  That wasn't enough, though.  She took out some bags of chips and and snacks, plopping them there, too.  She knew she wouldn't want to get up again, so was planning on an all-night binge without moving.  She wanted a desert, something rich, and so a cheese cake brought by a friend would do for that.  Jennifer would rarely indulge such treats herself, but feeling this hungry, and already so big, she took it without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer eased herself into the chair and started eating.  She had to lean back, but still mostly avoided getting crumbs all over her inflated chest, despite the speed that she wolfed down one, two, then three sandwiches.  She could feel a tightness deep inside her, her lower belly getting full.  She patted it and loosened the string on her sweatpants.  She did this practically without thought, just as she thoughtless tore open the chips and began, cleanly but quickly, stuffing them into her mouth.  She couldn't tell when the pain of hunger was replaced by the pain of fullness, but she was certainly she was well beyond any normal capacity now.  She slouched and rubbed her sore sides that rose up into the belly.  Still, the cheesecake was there.  Fork in hand, Jennifer proceeded to eat it, bite by bite, growing so stuffed that she thought she could feel her skin stretching with each bite.  But it didn't matter to her, not right then, because that hunger had to be satisfied.  Jennifer thought she felt the chair creak beneath her.  It was just her imagination, of course, but she was sure she must be so full now that she'd find it hard to stand, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun began to rise when Jennifer awoke from her mindless stupor.  She was exhausted, but finally satisfied.  Her stomach groaned and gurgled, that wiggling feeling returning, stronger than last night.  She leaned back in her chair, unable to stand for the moment.  Her belly had definitely grown.  With all she had eaten, it was no wonder, but Jennifer couldn't explain how it looked rounder even than last night.  Eyes half closed with exhaustion, she rubbed her her stomach and then gasped.  Her fingers reached a little bump right where her belly button should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible,\" she said, \"You can't pop out your belly button from eating,\" but her eyes saw it even if her mind couldn't believe it.  She rubbed it.  It felt just as strained and sensitive as the rest of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer!  Oh my god, what is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, shamed, worried, and surprised, looked up to see Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . .  I don't know,\" Jennifer teared up, but controlled herself.  \"I know I've gained weight, but I never ate this much.  Nobody <i>can</i> eat this much.  I know it's impossible, but it just feels so much like I'm really, you know, pregnant . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, okay,\" Melissa paced, thinking hard, glancing with unbelieving stares at Jennifer's hopelessly swollen body, \"You have an appointment in a few hours, but I think-</span></div></div>",

Melissa obliged, pulling Jennifer up with all her might.  Her belly was huge.  She looked overdue, and looked like she would go into labor if she sneezed.  But unfortunately for Jennifer, this wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exited the house, Jennifer waddling behind, getting used to her heavy stomach.  From all angles, members of the paparazzi appeared, snapping pictures of Jennifer.  \"You guys are a bunch of pigs!  Can't you respect a person's privacy?\" Melissa asked, shooing away the photographers as Jennifer sat in the passenger seat of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa got in the driver's seat and started the car, pulling out of Jennifer's driveway.  Melissa looked over at Jennifer, noticing how distressed she was.  \"You alright, Jen?\" she asked.  \"I just...don't know what's happening to me...\" she said, her eyes tearing up.  She stared down at her belly, noticing how constricted the seatbelt made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to relax.  Take a deep breath, close your eyes.  It'll be alright.\" Melissa said, patting Jennifer on the shoulder.  Jennifer nodded, closing her eyes, breathing in and out.  She was actually getting relaxed, until she felt it.  A strong THUMP coming from her belly.  She jolted in her seat, trying to locate exactly where it came from.  Then she felt it again, but in another place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Melissa asked, her eyes switching between the road and Jennifer.  \"I...I don't know...\" she replied, feeling around her rotund belly.  They arrived at the doctor's office, as Melissa exited the car and helped Jennifer inside.  Melissa checked in with the receptionist while Jennifer took a seat.  It was a tight squeeze, but she was able to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'm checking in for Jennifer Lawrence.  She has an appointment with Dr. Anderson.\" Melissa said to the receptionist.  She checked her computer, looking at the schedule.  \"The appointment is three hours away...\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  We would have come on time, but...she thinks she's...having contractions.\" Melissa lied.  The receptionist looked at Jennifer, seeing how large she was.  Now, Melissa actually didn't believe that Jennifer was pregnant.  After all, she hadn't had sex in over a year.  But any random passerby would have believed that she was definitely pregnant if they saw her, so Melissa ran with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...alright then.  Just have a seat in the first examination room to the left, and I'll go get Dr. Anderson.\" the receptionist said, getting up from her seat, her eyes glued to Jennifer's belly.  Melissa helped Jennifer out of her chair, and the two went to the exam room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Jennifer heaved herself up onto the metallic examination table, while Melissa took a seat nearby.  After a few moments of waiting, Dr. Anderson arrived.  He was a grey-haired man in his late 40s, who was the doctor for a lot of celebrities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  The receptionist told me about this, but I didn't believe her.  So you're having contractions?\" he asked.  \"No, I actually just said that so we could see you as soon as we could.  You see, Jennifer's not actually pregnant.  She can't be!\" Melissa said adamantly.  \"Really?  Are you sure?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Anderson, I haven't had sex in over a year.  It's impossible.\" Jennifer said, breaking her silence.  \"I see.  Well, there are a few medical cases that may explain what is happening to your stomach.  When did this start?\" he asked.  \"About two days ago.  It's been growing ever since.\" Jennifer replied.  \"Have you been eating large amounts of food in a short amount of time recently?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on queue, her stomach rumbled.  \"You could say that.\" Jennifer said.  \"There have been some cases of extreme bloating after eating.  That might be what's happening.  Would you mind laying down for a moment?\" he asked.  Jennifer obliged, lying down on the cold table.  The doctor pulled back her shirt, and began examining it.  \"Huh.  It's quite firm.\" he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Jennifer replied, trying to look over her belly.  Dr. Anderson pulled out a stethoscope, and placed it against the surface of the round orb that was her stomach.  He placed it in a few different places, hearing what was inside.  \"Interesting.  Very interesting.  Ladies, I'll be right back.\" he said exiting the room.  Dr. Anderson returned a few moments later with an ultrasound machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a bottle of blue gel, and began shaking it.  \"Now, this might be a little cold.\" he said, applying the gel to Jennifer's belly, who shivered.  He flipped a few switches, and grabbed a wand attached to the machine.  The doctor maneuvered the wand around Jennifer's belly for about a minute.  \"Oh...oh my...\" he said, his jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?!?\" Jennifer and Melissa asked at the same time.  \"You're pregnant...\" he revealed.  Melissa gasped, but Jennifer was silent.  She had a feeling that this was the case.  \"But how?\" Melissa asked.  \"I'm not entirely sure.  In fact, it appears that the babies are growing at a tiny rate as we speak...\" Dr. Anderson said, his eyes glued to the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  Did you say BABIES?\" Melissa asked, her eyes glued to Jennifer's impossibly swollen belly.  \"Yes.  Jennifer, you're pregnant with octuplets. A little over four months along.\" he said.  Jennifer cried.  Not only was she pregnant, seemingly at a rapid rate, but with eight babies.  It was too much to swallow.  The silence was interrupted by Melissa's phone ringing.  \"Sorry, I've got to take this.\" she said, exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Jennifer, I know how unbelievable this must seem.  But with the number of babies you're having and the rate you're growing, you might be having these babies sooner than you think.  Maybe even by the end of the week.  I don't know how this happened, but I want to examine you over the next few days to see how and why this is happening.  I'll make house visits and it'll be free of charge.  Okay?\" he asked.  Jennifer slowly nodded her head as Melissa entered the room and Dr. Anderson exited it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Catt Sadler, Jennifer.  She saw the pictures from today, and she wants a follow up interview tomorrow.  I said that you'd do it.  We'd look really, really bad if you lied about your pregnancy on camera.  We'll get through this together, alright?\" Melissa asked, placing a hand on Jennifer's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O..okay.\" she replied, still dumbfounded at the revelation.  \"Alright, so we should probably get going.  Where do you wanna go?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I need new clothes,\" Jennifer tugged at the bottom of her shirt, already tighter and riding up more than it was this morning.  Her belly button was pressing out, clearly visible.  \"I mean, more new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Melissa said, \"And it'll probably cheer you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer actually smiled.  \"Because nothing cheers up an actress like dressing up her fat body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa chuckled, then abruptly stopped when she saw Jennifer's expression had gone back to its stunned, blank state.  They drove on mostly in silence.  Arriving at the mall, not packed during the middle of a weekday, Melissa saw Jennifer shifting in her shirt, rubbing her stomach with more discomfort than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think . . . I'm growing,\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa pressed her hand to Jennifer's belly.  She felt a few kicks.  Jennifer winced, brushing her hand away.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mood didn't exactly lighten, but by walking through the mall like a normal person, she could at least pretend that everything was all right.  She could pretend this was a perfectly normal pregnancy and was just hanging out with her friend/agent.  Of course, that's not to say her mood got better, just that instead of feeling shocked and scared, she now felt frustration bordering on anger.  Every few steps Jennifer stumbled, and took great effort to steady herself without falling over.  Her hips wobbled too far to the side, her belly too far up front, as if every part of her body was conspiring to make the simple act of moving around into a humiliating and awkward challenge.  Melissa kept trying to catch her, but Jennifer just glared and snapped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Jennifer, we'll get through this,\" Melissa repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer just glared, at Melissa and the typically beautiful L.A. people around her.  She didn't seen to hear her.  \"Why did I think going to place packed with normal, pretty, thin people would make me feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reached the maternity store.  Jennifer was nearly out of breath.  Her feet and her back ached.  She had to stop and catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, I'm going to go hide in the changing room, okay?  Just bring me some clothes and let's make this fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Melissa said, but Jennifer was already waddling to the back of the store.  A salesperson or two approached her, but Jennifer shot them a look that made them back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer waited for fifteen minutes while Melissa scoured the store for pregnant versions of Jennifer's casual clothes, and a few dresses.  She knew her star client's size perfectly, and surprisingly didn't find it hard to accommodate for her recent changes.  Jennifer spent those fifteen minutes at first staring in wonder at those very changes.  Her belly was huge, looking full term, she thought, the skin so tight she wondered how she could grow anymore.  Her breasts were swollen to almost comical proportions.  Her hips and ass had swelled, too, although not nearly as much as Jennifer imagined.  Her face had started to fill out ever so slightly since the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everything have to get so big?\" she said to herself, pressing a finger into her softer cheek.  She thought that blow particularly tragic, then smiled to herself that it was the least of her that had plumped up recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jennifer, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, what do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few pair of jeans-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to fit into jeans?\" Jennifer snapped, \"Have you seen my ass lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're pregnancy jeans, the front's elastic so no more popped buttons.  And a couple of t-shirts-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they still cover my stomach by tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And some dresses for you to try on.  Here you go,\" Melissa nudged the door open and plopped the clothes down.  She didn't linger, or ask if she needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Jennifer managed to try on a pair of jeans and a shirt.  She had to hand it to Melissa, she picked well.  Jennifer wasn't pleased with how everything looked on her, but it covered her up and wasn't too restrictive.  She posed for the mirror, rubbing her belly, arching her back, like a model in a maternity catalog.  Surprisingly, it actually did make her feel better, if only because the situation was feeling more normal now.  She pushed back thoughts of how two days ago she never would have even thought of being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stepped out, now dressed like a proper pregnant woman in public.  She managed a smile.  Melissa gave her the thumbs up and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good,\" she said, and she meant it.  She stopped herself from using the word 'glow,\" but she really did think that, for all of Jennifer's self-degredation, pregnancy was not an awful look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As good as can be given this,\" Jennifer said, rubbing her belly.  \"Nice work, by the way, everything fits great.  It might not by the end of the day . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's belly growled, echoing in the changing room.  Even she looked surprised.  The hunger was on her again, going from uncomfortable to near pain quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Melissa, I . . . I . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, let's go pay and we'll get some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was going to ask you to stop me from eating.  If I start again, I won't stop until I'm passed out on the floor like a stuffed pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you need to eat, you're--well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating for nine, huh?\" Jennifer said, sighing.  She knew she couldn't resist this hunger again.  And besides, how much more damage could it do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the store, Melissa carrying several boxes and Jennifer decked out in sensible-yet-fashionable materinitywear, Jennifer stopped her waddle for a moment.  During the entire time she was changing, it never occurred to her to remove her new necklace.  She just changed around it.  But as soon as the thought entered her mind, her belly rumbled, and she pressed onward. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Predictably, it took longer than Jennifer would have liked to get to the food court.  Her confident strides had become an awkward shuffle as she desperately tried to avoid waddling.  This was getting next to impossible.  The weight of her belly forced her forward, and each step caused her increasingly wide hips to sway more to the side.  At least now she was dressed as comfortably as she could be in public.  In fact, shopping, walking around, despite the discomfort and feeling like a parade float, Jennifer was starting to feel almost normal.  She wasn't sure this was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you sit down and I'll bring you some food,\" Melissa said, setting the bags next to Jennifer at an isolated table in the corner of the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jennifer said, puffing with relief as she sat and leaned back.  She began absentmindedly rubbing her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, you sure you don't want to go some place nicer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, I need to eat now,\" Jennifer said in no uncertain terms, her words punctuated by a long growl from her stomach.  There was more wiggling inside her.  She winced, but it was freaking her out less and less.  Soon, she thought, it might even feel kind of nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Melissa said gently, \"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.  Just start at one end and start buying,\" Jennifer sighed, and then blushed, her voice breaking as her mood threatened to shift again, \"Just, forget my healthy diet for good now, it's not like I'll ever get back into shape again after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jennifer, don't talk like that.  You look beautiful,\" Melissa said, surprising herself that she meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled despite herself, surprised that it actually made her feel good to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared awkwardly at each other, aware that something strange other than Jennifer's sudden mega-pregnancy was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa made half a dozen trips, each time bringing back a tray full of burgers, or cheap mall pizza, or cheap mall Chinese food, and each time Jennifer was nearly done by the time she made it back.  Jennifer ate like a machine, as before.  Her hands methodically stuffing her mouth, only stopping from time to time to rub her swelling belly and force a burp out.  As big as she already was, Jennifer could feel herself growing heavier as she ate, forcing her further down in her chair.  Her clothes were less restrictive now, the belly band of her maternity jeans easily stretching to allow her belly to grow.  Her shirt draped down over her entire middle.  Jennifer kept wanting to pull it down to cover herself, and was relieved to see she was already covered.  By the time she was tine, her belly somehow felt even tighter than before.  She shifted from side to side, helping the massive meal to settle.  She gently rubbed her stomach, the shame gone in her dazed, satiated state.  It soon dawned on her that Melissa was talking about her interview with Cat tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hormones, herbal supplements, and a lot of food.  Just stick to your guns on that.  Cat's going to want to grill you on it and try to catch you in a lie so you're just going to have to stick to it, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sti-wha' now?\" Jennifer shook her hand, feeling her body wobble as she did so, \"Oh, right, the interview.  I can do that.  We don't have to say the title of the movie or anything, right?  I think I've been laying low since Hunger Games wrapped up so plenty of people will believe it's some small independent movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  And you're dedicated to your craft, and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the budget's so small it's less expensive to fatten me up for the part than to just use make up,\" Jennifer chuckled at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, use humor,\" Melissa said.  \"And please try to stop rubbing your belly like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer yanked her hands away.  \"I know, I can't help it.  They have a mind of their own these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you back home.  The doctor's probably going to want to have another look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer frowned.  Being examined like a science experiment would only remind of her of how abnormal this was, and she was finding it easier to fall into thinking that she was just a regular pregnant woman.  She started getting depressed again at the thought of the doctor telling her what else was happening to her, and then at having to lie to everyone on TV about how she intentionally did this to herself.  Jennifer stared down past her swollen breasts to her stomach, once again massaging it slowly.  Melissa reached over from across the table and felt it too.  They both shared a understanding expressions before Melissa took her hand away, embarrassed, and Jennifer grunted, heaving herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, god, let's go while I still feel like standing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Long time no see!\" Doctor Anderson said, giving a smile to Jennifer, who was lying down on the couch.  The doctor had bought a portable ultrasound machine with him, which was much smaller than the regular one.  He applied the cold gel to Jennifer's rotund middle, as Melissa watched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" the doctor said.  \"What, are they alright?\" Jennifer asked, trying to peer over her mountainous belly.  \"Alright?  They're in the best shape that I've ever seen for multiples!  But this morning when I examined you, they were about 17 weeks along, now they're closer to 19 weeks.\" the doctor noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell is that even possible?\" Melissa asked, her eyes glued to the ultrasound monitor, which showed eight crammed fetuses.  \"You've got me.  I already told Jennifer this, but with the way things are going, she'll probably give birth this weekend.\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This weekend?  So, like three or four days?\" Jennifer asked, her hands rubbing the sides of her belly as she felt numerous kicks.  \"It'll probably be on Sunday, if I were a betting man.  There don't seem to be any complications so far.\" Dr. Anderson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good, I guess.\" Melissa said.  \"Indeed it is.  I think we're all set for today.  I'll come by tomorrow morning to check up on you again.  If you have any questions, give me a call.\" the doctor said, packing up the portable ultrasound machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Melissa thanked the doctor, who then proceeded to leave.  Jennifer's belly gave a mighty rumble.  \"Oh, god.  I need dinner now!\" she said, rubbing her pregnant belly.  \"Sure.  What do you want me to cook?\" Melissa asked.  \"That's the problem!  I don't have any food left!  Could you go to the supermarket for me?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!  I guess you want me to get a lot of food?\"  Melissa asked.  \"Did you really have to ask?\" Jennifer giggled.  \"Right, I'll be back as soon as I can.\" Melissa said, grabbing her keys and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should probably clean up some, huh, guys?\" Jennifer asked, rubbing her belly as she heaved herself off of the couch.  She waddled into her bathroom and removed her maternity clothes, looking at her naked, pregnant body in the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she looked at it, her belly made her look nearly due with twins.  Her breasts, hadn't grown since this morning, but she noticed that her nipples were now a darker shade of brown.  \"Ugh.  I forgot that I'm going to have to breastfeed.  That'll be great.\" she said sarcastically, stepping into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower was incredibly soothing, for her and her babies, as they gently kicked inside her globular belly.  Once finished, she stepped out and went to put on something more comfortable.  Jennifer put on a pair of the larger sweatpants she bought the other day, and a t-shirt which came down to her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer waddled back into the living room, and saw Melissa cooking food.  \"Hey.  Dinner's almost ready.\" Melissa said.  She stuck true to her word, and prepared a smorgasbord for Jennifer.  It took Jennifer a few hours to eat it all, but eventually she did.  She stifled a burp, and rubbed her belly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that enough?\" Melissa asked.  \"Urgh...yeah.  God, I feel like I'm eating for a football team.\" Jennifer groaned.  \"Well, it's close enough.\" Melissa said, helping Jennifer to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began watching TV, making small talk along the way.  \"I wonder if they're still talking about me on E! News?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Only one way to find out...\" Melissa said, flipping the channel.  Sure enough Catt Sadler and a male correspondent were sitting at a table, with a picture that was taken of Jennifer being displayed in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Catt.  Jennifer told you yesterday that she wasn't pregnant, but if you look at how much she's grown, I'd say she looks ready to pop!\" he exclaimed.  \"Yes, she does.  We'll find out for sure tomorrow with my exclusive, extended, uncut interview with Jennifer tomorrow.  That is, if she doesn't go into labor before then!\" she chuckled, as Jennifer turned the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe her.  Why don't they just pick on someone else?\" Jennifer asked, pulling back her shirt to rub her belly.  \"They need someone to pick on.  Guess it's you for now.  Don't worry about it, Jen.\" Melissa said, pulling out a small bottle.  Jennifer noticed it, and eyed it quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Cocoa butter.  I've read that it helps with stretch marks.  And...well...I've noticed that you've been getting some.\" Melissa said, squeezing some out of the bottle, rubbing it on Jennifer's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Melissa.  I'm glad someone's helping me through this.\" Jennifer said.  \"Anything for a friend.\" Melissa said, finishing the application of the butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm gonna go to bed.  Being pregnant with octuplets is actually pretty exhausting.\" Jennifer said, waddling to her bedroom.  She sat down on her bed, and slowly closed her eyes, the dim glow from her necklace and gentle kicking from her babies soothing her to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer slept like a log even with all her discomfort.  She was actually surprised to find herself slowly awaking the next morning, the sun telling her that it was already getting close to noon.  With a grunt, she attempted to heave herself up from her side and fell back down.  She sighed, pulling back her covers to reveal a belly that was somehow even larger and heavier than yesterday.  She pressed the taut skin with her hands, a flurry of kicks responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much bigger can I get?\" she said softly.  With effort, she was able to sit up.  With even greater effort, she rocked herself out of bed.  Her hips popped, and she had to spread her legs and practically sway from side to side to move forward without toppling over.  She rubbed her aching back with one hand and her sore, round belly with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile brushing her teeth and combing her hair she was somewhat surprised how much calmer she was this morning.  The first two days were all panic, the next self-loathing, but today it seemed almost normal.  Well, obviously nothing about carrying eight rapidly growing babies was normal, but the harsh edge of the situation had dulled.  Now Jennifer could look at her bulbous stomach and, while certainly wishing it wasn't there, was no longer freaking out at the sight.  She might grown while pulling on a pair of sweat pants and noting how her hips and ass were unfortunately growing to match her belly, but it seemed more like an inconvenience rather than a tragedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer puffy face, though, Jennifer was still self-conscious enough to scowl at.  She might have dwelt on it had the smell of breakfast sent her tummy into a whirl of hunger.  Even the stairs were no obstacle to her, however cautiously she took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Melissa and Dr. Anderson in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good . . . morning?\" Jennifer couldn't quite place it, but something was off about Melissa.  No, not off, just different.  She turned to Jennifer and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of eggs, lots of bacon, some bagels, enough for at least nine people,\" Melissa said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jennifer,\" Dr. Anderson said, standing to help Jennifer take a seat.  She accepted while it dawned on her what was different.  Melissa was acting almost motherly towards her.  She was always a friend, but also an agent, but now, after two days of strangeness and constant contact, Jennifer could quite clearly see that Melissa was looking at her and talking to her in a gentle, loving manner that seemed somewhat out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, however, was too busy stuffing her face to think further on the change.  Besides, hadn't Jennifer changed in a much more drastic way these last few days?  She wasn't even self-conscious about her appetite in front of the doctor.  He sat patiently, eating a plate of waffles which she realized Melissa must have made for her.  If pregnancy makes Melissa want to help and take care of her, Jennifer decided, that was all right with her.  If her current growth was any indicator she'd hardly be able to stand by tomorrow, let alone the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer-\" Dr. Anderson started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food first.  Questions later,\" Jennifer muttered between mouthfulls.  If she had stopped to think she would have been shocked to see how quickly she had gotten used to eating for nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor obliged.  Finally, Jennifer sat back with a belch.  She held her stomach in her hand, shifting constantly, unable to get comfortable feeling this full and huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at the doctor, who wore a curious but not surprised expression, \"Think I'm putting on too much baby weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, although, have you grown since last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Jennifer shifted, holding her enormous stomach.  Her shirt rode up to reveal her belly button now fully popped out.  She looked more than full term now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you looked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two helped Jennifer to the couch, where they repeated the procedure from yesterday.  Jennifer was no longer cringing at each kick she felt, or at others rubbing her stomach.  Of course, she would be much happier when there was less of it to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly healthy.  You gotta' be around 20, 21 weeks now, though.  Maybe 22.  Hard to tell, though, I've never seen octuplets developed this fully.  It's like each of them is growing as much as a single fetus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's eyes popped at the realization, her morning calm shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, just how <i>much</i> are they going to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's no need to panic,\" Dr. Anderson said, taking Jennifer's blood pressure, \"Can't believe it myself, but I'm seeing it, and you're growing to fit them.  Not sure how it's possible but we're seeing it with our own eyes.  And so far you're looking as healthy as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson had Melissa bring the scale out.  Jennifer stood on it, dreading what it would read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was around 135 before, uh, this happened,\" Melissa said helpfully.  Jennifer couldn't see over her belly to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's pushing 200, but not unusual for a pregnancy, especially one this unusual,\" the doctor chuckled, but stifled it when he saw Jennifer glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer lowered herself back down while Dr. Anderson packed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, I'll stop by tonight.  Let me know when you're back from this interview.  I'll be discreet like always, no need to worry about any of this getting out from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Doctor, I really appreciate this,\" Jennifer shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks, Doctor,\" Melissa said sweetly, seeing him to the door.  Jennifer turned on the TV, predictably seeing Catt Sadler discussing celebrity gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to hate that woman,\" Jennifer said while Melissa sat next to her.  \"I'd like to see how she likes waking up a two-hundred-pound blob and still have to go out in public.\"  But there really wasn't hatred in Jennifer's voice.  Maybe some annoyance.  \"Do I really have to do this interview?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you didn't, but we agreed to it.  Don't worry, I've taken care of everything.  Here,\" she pulled aside a script, \"this was making the rounds a few years ago but then the whole Octomom thing happened and people though no one would take it seriously.  Glance through it, no need to go into details, but just something you can reference secretly when pressed, okay?  I'm making some calls to some friends, I'm looking for someone who can say he's slated to direct and produce it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Melissa, are we actually going to make this fake movie?  I think I'll have the kids by the time we get started,\" Jennifer almost laughed.  She paused when she realized it was the first time she had thought beyond the pregnancy and to the inevitable conclusion of it.  Melissa didn't let up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want it to sound real, okay?  Just read this, I'll set up some details to fill in, and you can saunter up to Catt and take whatever she throws at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer took the script, impressed and touched.  \"Change 'saunter' to 'waddle' and you'll be right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  We have a few hours, so let's not waste them.  Do you need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's belly growled.  She sighed, but smiled.  Melissa returned the expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" Jennifer said to herself as Melissa rushed off to get more food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa spent the day wheeling and dealing to get this movie off the ground.  Jennifer only had the vaguest notion of what she was doing, however.  She spent the day planted on the sofa half watching TV while Melissa brought her food.  She was exhausted and felt more lethargic than before.  Sometimes, she could swear she could feel the skin of her belly stretching tighter whenever a flurry of kicks went through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's maternity jeans feelt even tighter than they did yesterday and her flowing blouse safely covering up her belly, attempted to walk through the studio with as much grace that her lumbering frame would allow.  She knew she didn't fully succeed.  She had to keep resting her hands on the small of her back to ease the pain.  She only wanted to sit down.  But she put on a brave face, fully made-up and ready to be on camera when they arrived for the interview.  She pretended to ignore the secretary's shocked look.  She was very much larger than she was when she was here the other day, and there was no way to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt stopped in her tracks as she approached Jennifer, as unable to hide her surprise as Jennifer could her giant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jennifer,\" she said, approaching her, looking her whole body up and down, seeming to take in every change from her wider hips, swollen breasts, puffy face, and of course, that massive midsection that dominated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, I'm very big,\" Jennifer said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're here to tell us you're <i>not</i> pregnant?\" Catt said, bemused but friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked to the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain everything.  But no, I'm not pregnant, believe it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took their positions by the chairs in front of the camera.  Jennifer looked at hers and hesitated.  She would barely fit in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we, er, use the couch? I don't get along so well with chairs these days,\" she said with a faint chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of  course we can,\" Catt sprang up, Jennifer noted jealously how easy it was for her.  She motioned to the crew to focus on the couch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer lowered herself into the couch.  She would like to have sat up straighter, but the best she could manage was keeping her head high while her body sunk into the couch.  She rubbed her stomach self-consciously, not even able to stop.  She was much more mentally prepared than the other day, and she didn't dread being on film in her state as much as she would have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we go live in just a minute.  Do you need anything, Jennifer?\" Catt asked with a note of sincere concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we go . . . Hello, I'm Catt Saddler and we are here one again with Jennifer Lawrence.  She has been denying pregnancy rumors for days and she is here to to tell us the whole story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer knew that at this point viewers would get the money shot of her massively bloated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Catt, thanks so much for having me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all ours.  Now, Jennifer, you've been denying these rumors, but you can't say they're not without good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer shifted her heavy frame uncomfortably as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a good reason, Catt.  I'm not the first actress to do this for a role.  There's not a whole lot I can say since the production is under a lot of secrecy, but I can say that I am preparing for a role in a small, independent drama about a woman carrying octuplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An octomom movie?\" Catt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the script has been floating around a while, but that whole incident made people lose interest.  It's an original story, and when I read the script I felt a small movie like this was just the thing after the big budget Hunger Games films I've been spending the last few years doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine those can take a lot out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can, but it's all worth it in the end.  This is something completely different, though, and I wanted to dedicate myself to the fullest to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is you're pulling a De Niro and gaining weight for the role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and thank you for the comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody would deny that you're one of the brightest stars of your generation of actors.  But, how are you able to gain weight to look pregnant?  It seems pretty unusual that would only gain in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer chuckled, but was starting to blush as the topic of her figure came up,\"Catt, you've seen me from behind, you know this isn't the only place I've grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt returned the laugh.  \"Are you on a special diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, with strict doctor supervision.  Much of this is water weight, although obviously I'm bigger elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, after this nobody can question your dedication to your craft.  It's just a little hard to believe that after getting into such fantastic shape for your last roles, you would do this to yourself for one small role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand most people would think that.  But I really liked this script.  And I understand more of what a woman in this condition is going through than I would have before.  I have a lot more respect for mothers everywhere, I can tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it uncomfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extremely, but you get used to it.  Of course, most pregnant women have a lot more time to adjust than I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you will be able to get your old body back after the move is done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer frowned, suddenly depressed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it will be a lot of hard work, but I'm no stranger to that.  And it's for a project I really believe in.  You have to sacrifice for your art sometimes, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt nodded with approval, but there was still that questioning, suspicious look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jennifer, nobody would question your dedication.  I have one more question-can I touch it?\" she smirked as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer blushed bright red, finally stumbling in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure.  I mean, I'll have to get used to it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up her shirt, revealing the taut, pale skin of her stomach and that knobby extrusion her belly button had become.  She held her breath as Catt reached over and very gently rubbed her stomach.  She did so for a moment, as if looking for something.  Jennifer hoped it wouldn't happen, but the kicking started.  Catt pulled back, squinting at Jennifer, and she had to think fast.  With surprisingly little effort, she released quite a loud belch, covering her mouth with embarrassment.  Jennifer couldn't tell if Catt bought it, but it looked like she at least accepted it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, the whole process leaves me kind of . . . gassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's all right.  That's a lovely necklace by the way,\" Catt said.  Jennifer looked down as she pulled her back down.  The necklace had a faint glow.  For some reason, she kept forgetting it was there.  She ignored it entirely.  Ever since she bought it just before . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea struck her that she bought it just before this whole thing started happening.  She even had morning sickness after putting it on.  How had this not occurred to her before?  It almost had a few times, she knew, but something always pushed it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was already wrapping up with Jennifer returned to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all look forward to seeing this movie, I'm sure.  Are you sure there's nothing anything else you can tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Catt, I'm sworn to secrecy,\" she smiled.  \"You'll just have to wait like everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed, although Jennifer could tell that Catt wasn't fully buying the story.  She turned to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure we'll all find out when it's released . . . when did you see it'd be coming out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, that's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Catt said.  \"Thank you for stopping by Jennifer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for having me, Catt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey signed off.  Jennifer couldn't get out fast enough.  She was polite enough as Melissa heaved her out of the chair, but then she moved as fast as her belly would let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Melissa asked as they left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to sound crazy.  I think this necklace did this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's crazy, how can a necklace make you magically pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can anything make you magically pregnant?  I think we need to look into this.  I feel like it's, I don't know, been trying to get me to not look into it.  I was freaking out the other day, we both were, but now it seems normal.  How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa considered this.  Jennifer was right.  They should both be far more concerned than they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Where did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't buy it, Kevin,\" Catt said, sitting with her producer in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's farfetched, but what else can you do?  If it's not some crazy method acting stunt she's still not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"! don't know, but there's a story here and I want to get to the bottom of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to the bottom of it?  Catt, you're a celebrity gossip host, not an investigative reporter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think Jennifer Lawrence trading in her perfect little figure for this giant hippo sized one in a matter of days isn't a huge story we should be investigating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Catt, if you want to look into, be my guest.  But I think you're thinking way too much of it.  Remember all the time you wasted on Kelly Clarkson and then it turned out she just gains weight all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be more than she's letting on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin shrugged.  There would be arguing with Catt on the point.  She was going to find what was really going on with Jennifer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer told Melissa about the mysterious antique store by her place, and how she had brought the necklace there after the old shop owner told her the story of how it belonged to a princess who was abandoned by her fiance and then committed suicide from the shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they were even halfway there, Jennifer had to stop and eat.  This in itself had become quite a process.  The two could no longer hop out of the car, grab a bite, and then be off.  Instead, Jennifer's now hefty body had to be heaved out of the car with Melissa's help, and then slowly moved into the restaurant on her exhausted legs.  Once in, they had to order a massive amount of food, and then Melissa had to sit by while Jennifer ate.  She had become more adept at stuffing her face, but she wasn't a machine.  Five super sized double quarter-pounder meals don't go down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe-wuuuuuuurp!-excuse me, uh, I can't believe I'm still eating this much,\" Jennifer said, not even mentioning how delicious the greasy fast food was to her in her state.  She placed her hands on the sides of her enormous belly, \"I mean, I'm already this big, and this full, and yet somehow I can still get fuller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled politely while she herself chowed down on the fries that Jennifer was missing.  \"I think it's starting to rub on off on me.  Be careful, Jennifer.  When this is over you don't want to have thrown your appetite so far off that you can't go back to how you were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about that,\" Jennifer snapped, stuffing a burger in her face.  She finished it in three bites.  Her previous embarrassment at being seen like this in public was growing dimmer by the hour, much as the transformation her body was still going through had gone from being a terrifying nightmare to being a natural-seeming yet uncomfortable inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an hour, and another order, before Jennifer's belly allowed them to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already feel bigger,\" she said, as Melissa slowly helped her into the car, \"These jeans are starting to chafe around my thighs.  Uhg, I'm through with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the place?  It's already 7:30, think we can make it before it closes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost too late.  They pulled up to the store nearby Jennifer's house and found the old shopkeeper closing up.  They hurried as much as they could.  He turned around and they could follow the line of his sight-from Jennifer's face, to her belly, to her necklace, and then her face again-and the wonder spreading across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, miss, I, uh-\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go inside to discuss this?\" Jennifer said.  Her feet were aching, her back was cramping, and she really needed to pee.  These were constants with her now, but walking even a short while aggravated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" the man said, unlocking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went inside.  He had already drawn the curtains, and locked the door behind them.  He was shaking and nervous.  Jennifer and Melissa couldn't tell from his reaction to them how much he knew or suspected.  They waited for him to speak.  He pulled a chair up across from them as they took a seat in a musty old couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lawrence-\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you still recognize me then?\" Jennifer said, growing angry with the man as he sat there.  He had sold this to her, and now it looked like he suspected that it was magical and could do this to her.  \"I might have changed a little since I was last in here<i> four days ago</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain, I never meant anything like this to happen.  This is, well, this is, as you can see, completely unprecedented.  Nobody's every heard of such a, er, rapid pregnancy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With eight babies,\" Melissa interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not even full term yet,\" Jennifer said.  Melissa was remaining calm, but Jennifer finally had something tangible to pin her frustrations on, even if her mind was somehow forcing her to come to peace with her condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did the necklace come from?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dealer from Europe sold it to me.  I get a lot of my items that way.  And some of them have been shown to be, well . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical?\" Jennifer said, the word coming out more naturally than it would have days before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, but normally it's in the good way.  I've never had anyone come back with a complaint, and I assume when I sell something with good attributes I often won't hear anything at all about it, so I don't have anyway of knowing.  If would have known something like this could happen I never would have sold it, I assure you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed sincere, genuinely sorry, and that caused Jennifer to lighten up on him somewhat.  Melissa took charge of the conversation at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you know things like this were possible?  Do you know if there's any way to reverse it?\"  She said it haltingly.  Jennifer felt a strange kind of sadness at the thought as Melissa said.  She was actually growing attached to the eight babies growing inside her now, and the idea of them vanishing gave her a sense of loss she knew wasn't natural for a supernatural pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can and will look into it.  But not in my knowledge.  Things like this must have occurred, and it would take some research to see what happened in past cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time?  I only have a few more days before I give birth,\" Jennifer said.  \"And, if you haven't noticed, I'm not sure I can take getting that much bigger.  I feel like I'll burst as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can consult my own private library.  The necklace was from a princess in the Baltic area, and I have several works dealing with arcane objects and curses from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then start reading.  What do we do in the meantime?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Jennifer started, grabbing her stomach.  The babies were kicking up a storm again.  Their movements across the surface of her belly were visible even through her shirt.  It was minutes before they calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there even anything we can do?\" Melissa asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis flustered the shopkeeper.  He was an antiques dealer, not a wizard.  That he had more knowledge of this kind of thing helped but he was certainly no expert.</span></div></div>",

She's...interested in the arcane to say the least.  Would you like me to give you her address?\" the shopkeeper asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it wouldn't hurt.\" Jennifer said, rubbing her pregnant belly, which now was big enough to make her look nearly due with triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then.  Here.\" he replied, handing her a small piece of paper with the address on it.  Jennifer and Melissa thanked him, and were on their way.  \"If you find anything, will you let us know?\" Melissa asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  Better yet, come back tomorrow and I might have something for you.\" the shopkeeper said.  With that, the two left the shop and got in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think this Alice will know anything about your...condition?\" Melissa asked.  \"Condition?  Come on, Melissa.  I'm not sick.  I'm just...\" Jennifer trailed.  \"Rapidly pregnant with octuplets via a magical necklace?\" Melissa finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it like that...\" Jennifer said, cracking a smile.  She rolled up her shirt as she watched her many unborn children kick visibly.  Melissa smiled, and stifled a giggle.  \"What's so funny?\" Jennifer asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it's just...you're gonna get so huge!\" she said.  \"Heh.  Funny, I thought I already was huge.\" Jennifer replied.  \"Alright, even more huge.\" Melissa laughed, before starting the car, going to see Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt Sadler sauntered through the E! News office, looking to find answers.  She approached Randy, one of their members of the paparazzi.  \"Hey, Randy, get any good pictures lately?\" she asked, sitting on his desk.  \"Catt?!?  Uh...not really.  Just the usual.\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious.  Have you taken any pictures of Jennifer Lawrence recently?\" Catt asked.  \"Yeah.  Why do you ask?\" Randy asked.  \"No real reason.  Just wanted to see some pictures of my friend, taken by our best photographer.\" she said, giving Randy a smile.  He gulped nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's one taken today.  I can give you the rest tomorrow.\" Randy said, handing her the picture.  \"Thanks, Randy.  I owe you one.\" she said, giving Randy a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt looked at the picture, and saw that it was Jennifer leaving some type of store with Melissa.  \"Oh, my goodness.  Look at that big old belly!\" she said, noticing Jennifer's globular tummy, not that it was hard to notice.  \"No way in hell she isn't pregnant...\" Catt muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Catt arrived at the store where Jennifer had purchased the necklace, and went inside.  The shopkeeper noticed her, and approached her.  \"Sorry, ma'am, store's closed.\" he said.  \"Not so fast.  We need to talk.\" Catt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?  Jennifer Lawrence was here earlier today, correct?  Blonde hair? Looks like she's about to give birth?\" Catt asked, throwing in that diss.  \"Yes, why do you ask?\" the shopkeeper inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to know WHY she was here.\" Catt said.  \"Ah.  A few days ago, she had bought a necklace, and she showed up earlier today simply to ask some questions about it.  That's all.\" he said.  \"That's it?  You're sure?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  That's it.  Now, I need to close shop for the night.\" he said, ushering Catt out.  She was fairly satisfied, but felt like he had something to hide.  \"So she bought a necklace, and had some buyer's remorse?  Interesting...very interesting.\" Catt cackled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\" . . . let's just say some things fell through, mistakes were made, words were said.  The important thing is, we need to get this thing shot fast-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or look like you're getting it shot fast, from what I'm hearing,\" the voice on the speaker phone said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that,\" Melissa said.  \"But we'll pay.  And besides, you owe me.  You would have been blacklisted even worse without my help, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I remember.  All right, send me the script and you can say I'm on it.  It's kind of funny, though.  Jennifer does all this work to make herself into some kind of human blimp and then the whole deal goes through in a day.  Hey, but if anyone can salvage it, you can, Melissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear you, Joel,\" Jennifer said.  Although she actually did find his amusement more entertaining than offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, hey there, Jen!  You looked great in that interview today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sending the script over now.  Thanks a bunch,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all!\" Joel said.  Melissa hung up and sent the script through her phone.  This certainly was turning into a makeshift production.  Melissa let the supposed director believe that they were trying to save a production that had fallen through to justify why this had to be done so fast, and he bought it without her even coming out and saying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny how used to hearing people say how big I am I'm getting,\" Jennifer said with her hands resting on the sides of her massive belly.  It looked like it was pinning to her seat now, heavy, full, and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, a few days ago that would have really pissed both of us off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop by that Wendy's, I need a burger . . . or five,\" Jennifer smiled bashfully.  They did so despite Melissa's weak protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night by the time they reached Alice's.  She lived in a sparsely-populated area just outside of the city.  The place wasn't hard to find, although the driveway went through some woods before opening up onto a small cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a witch lives here,\" Jennifer said laughing.  Melissa helped her out of the car.  Jennifer felt the babies kicking again.  She leaned against the car and rubbed her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, this shirt, look.  It's getting tight,\" she said, motioning towards how strained the fabric around her middle was getting.  That morning it was loose enough, but now it looked like a few more pounds would rip it.  Her belly button poked out up front, clearly visible even through the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting bigger,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice opened the door before they arrived.  She was a pretty, older woman, probably in her late 50s, and greeted them warmly.  She made no comment about how massive Jennifer Lawrence had gotten, and that made her okay in their book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in.  You must be Jennifer and Melissa.  Sam said you'd be coming by tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Alice,\" Melissa said, shaking her hand.  Jennifer did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really, really appreciate any help you can give us,\" Jennifer said.  \"But can I sit down, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice ushered them into her quaint living room.  Jennifer found a big recliner which she sunk into.  It was as close to comfortable as she had been in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why Sam sounded so urgent, but now I see why.  So, is that the necklace then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we think it caused this.  The other day I was normal, now I'm carrying eight in here,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Alice looked closely at the necklace.  \"May I?\"  Jennifer nodded.  Alice took the necklace in her hands but did not remove it.  \"You seem very calm about this,\" she said as she examined the offending item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we both are,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first, I was completely freaked out.  But, I don't know, it just feels more . . . normal now.  I don't know how to explain it.\"  She smiled, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  Well,\" Alice let go of the necklace, \"the necklace itself appears to be normal for its origin, but it obviously isn't.  So we can rule out any kind of ancient evil or intentional curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Melissa were silent for a moment, then burst out laughing.  Alice joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will say this, it is so nice not to have to convince you I'm talking nonsense,\" Alice said.  \"May I . . . examine you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I guess,\" Jennifer blushed and lifted her shirt up.  There were light flutterings all throughout her stomach, some visible on the surface.  The skin looked tight, painfully tight, but to Jennifer it manifested more as a mild yet widespread discomfort.  Alice ran her hands over Jennifer's belly for longer than she would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Sam tells me you're not full term yet, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jennifer said, wishing Alice would stop rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're human.  And there are eight of them.  But I can--and you'll pardon me if I don't go into too much detail--feel their life getting stronger.  They're growing as we speak.  <i>You're</i> growing as we speak,\" she added.  Jennifer pulled her shirt back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Melissa said.  So far Alice hadn't told them anything useful.  \"What can you tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have them?\" Jennifer asked.  \"I mean, can I, you know, give birth to them?  Eight babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight full-sized babies,\" Alice said, \"if my hunch is right.  Do not quote me on this, but I think yes, you can.  You're body is rapidly adapting to your condition.  Whatever is in this necklace causing this I think that it means you to come to term and have eight healthy babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer breathed a sigh of relief.  \"So it won't kill me, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I don't think so.  May I take the necklace, just for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer couldn't answer, but nodded.  Alice reached over and lifted it over Jennifer's head.  Jennifer found that it took all her power to not try and stop her.  Her heart even raced as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice held the necklace up.  The three of them could clearly see a faint glow in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yes, yes, I can feel something inside this,\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, guys,\" Jennifer moaned.  She began rubbing her stomach again.  She felt the flutterings turn into kicks.  Suddenly her belly seemed to be aching, almost painfully.  It was as if all the weight, which she had been feeling of course, was now forcing itself on her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Melissa jumped to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" Jennifer was sweating now.  \"But it hurts,\" she clutched at her belly.  It was wobbling now, the kicks growing stronger.  She winced in pain.  She breathed deeply.  It wasn't contractions she was feeling, but every change that had come on her hitting her at full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice hurried and put the necklace around Jennifer's neck.  The feelings subsided, and Jennifer's belly returned to its calm, albeit rotund, state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what the hell was that?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep this on,\" Alice said, pointing to the necklace.  \"There is either a spirit or part of a spirit in there, and it's keeping you pregnant and able to be as pregnant as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that help us?\" Melissa asked, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters it's good to know I'm not going to die from having too many babies,\" Jennifer said.  \"But, Alice, what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice thought for a moment before answering.</span></div></div>",

Jennifer and Melissa looked at one another.  Now that she actually thought about it, the idea of giving birth to eight babies was not a pleasing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that all that you can do for me?\" Jennifer asked, rubbing her belly as her unborn kicked inside.  \"I'm afraid so.  Just keep the necklace on, and the rest of the pregnancy will be stress-free.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  Well, thank you, Alice.\" Melissa said, helping Jennifer out of the recliner.  The two left the house and got into the car.  \"So the necklace made you pregnant, and makes you and the babies healthy if you leave it on?\" Melissa asked.  \"Seems like it.  This thing's a gift and a curse.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get back to the house.  The doctor said he'd be by tonight.\" Melissa said.  Jennifer nodded, and they returned to Jennifer's house, where Dr. Anderson was waiting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught that interview a few hours ago.  Method acting, huh?  They seemed to buy it, though.\" the doctor noted as he began to examine Jennifer.  \"Yeah, we're actually going to start filming the movie tomorrow.  Gotta keep the media believing that this pregnancy's fake.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is definitely real.  They're bigger than they were this morning.\" Dr. Anderson noted.  \"Really?  How far along am I now?\" Jennifer asked.  \"I'd say about 26, 27 weeks.\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded.  \"So when will I give birth?\" she asked.  \"What's today, Thursday?  I'd say Sunday at this rate.\" he replied.  \"They're healthy, right?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're perfect.  It's incredible, really.  I never thought that I'd live to see an octuplet pregnancy carried to term, but you're going to do it.  It's a shame I can't tell anyone about this, though...\" he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep it under wraps for a few more days.  Thank you, doctor.\" Melissa said, as Dr. Anderson promised to see them tomorrow.  Jennifer then heaved herself off of the couch and headed towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer scoured the kitchen for food, and had what she considered to be a snack.  But at this point in her pregnancy, it was essentially just another meal.  She devoured it in no time, and stood up and walked back into the living room.  Jennifer could hear a ripping sound, and noticed that her shirt had ripped, her belly becoming too big for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh great.  This was my biggest shirt, too.\"  Jennifer noted.  \"Hey, if you've got it flaunt it, Jen!\" Melissa giggled.  \"Oh, I've definitely got it, alright.  There's no way I can wear the maternity jeans anymore, they're getting pretty tight.  Guess it's just yoga pants and running tops from here on out.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably get some sleep, Jen.  Big day tomorrow.\" Melissa said.  \"You're right.  Don't be too surprised if I wake up bigger tomorrow, okay?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Trust me, that won't surprise me in the slightest.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer went to bed, eager to start filming the movie in the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer didn't get as much sleep as she would have liked.  The weight of the babies made her uncomfortable, and it took her a while to get in a position where she was fairly comfortable.  Even when she was able to get comfortable and sleep for a small amount of time, she would have to wake up to pee due to the pressure that the babies constantly applied.  Needless to say, it wasn't a great night for Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight shining through the blinds in her room woke Jennifer up.  She groaned, disappointed that she didn't get more sleep.  She threw off her covers, getting a good look at her belly, which had grown overnight.  She now looked due with quadruplets.  Jennifer ran a hand over her globular tummy, feeling her babies kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself up off of her bed after a few tries and waddled over to her closet.  Jennifer pulled out a black pair of yoga pants and a bright blue running top.  The yoga pants hugged her rear pretty tightly, showing how large it had become in the past few days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer running top could barely contain her breasts, and displayed her round pregnant belly, popped-out belly button and all.  It wasn't the best look, but it was the only thing that fit her at this point in her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer walked downstairs, directed by the smell of food cooking in the kitchen, and was greeted by Melissa and Dr. Anderson once again.  \"Morning, Jen!  Sleep well?\" Melissa asked, preparing food on multiple plates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not really.  I guess that comes with the territory of being pregnant with octuplets.\" Jennifer replied.  \"Sorry for stopping by so early again, but Melissa told me that you were starting to shoot the movie in a few hours, and I'm stacked for the rest of the day so this would be the only chance for me to examine you.\" Dr. Anderson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, doctor.  Just let me feed these babies real quick and I'll let you look at me.\" Jennifer said, taking a seat to dig in.  She ate all of the food in impressive time, licking all of the plates clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the couch and stretched out, allowing the doctor to conduct the ultrasound.  \"Alright, so it appears that the babies are about thirty weeks along.  All perfectly healthy.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.  Is there anything else?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Well...because you're carrying this pregnancy so well, and because the babies are perfectly healthy, there might be a chance that you pass your due date.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  So I might be overdue at some point?\" Jennifer asked.  \"It's a possibility.  A small one, but a possibility nonetheless.  I'll stop by sometime tomorrow to get another examination.  I'm going to be pretty busy, but if you have any questions or concerns give me a call and I might find some time.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Jennifer thanked Dr. Anderson, and he was on his way.  Melissa and Jennifer followed suit, and were on their way to the movie set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt Sadler arrived at the doctor's office, looking for more answers.  She snuck into the Dr. Anderson's office and waited for him to arrive.  Minutes later he did, and gasped when he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Catt?  What the hell are you doing here?\" he asked, visibly befuddled.  \"I just had some medical questions that needed answering.  Sorry for stopping by interrupted, by the way.\" Catt added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright.  What's the problem?\" Dr. Anderson asked.  \"Oh, this isn't concerning me, doctor.  It's one of your patients.  Jennifer Lawrence.\" Catt said.  \"Uh...what about her?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to talk about this method acting she's doing.  I mean, you gave her dietary plans and supplements to give her the appearance of a pregnant woman for a role.  Figured that you'd be able to tell me more about it.\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Method acting?  Oh, right!  Sorry, that...must have slipped my mind!  There's not much to it in all honesty, I've just given her dietary plans that I have for many of my pregnant patients, as she wanted to really feel like a pregnant woman.  For the supplements, it just helped her gain weight faster, and kept the weight gain in her stomach area.\" Dr. Anderson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Really?\" Catt asked.  \"Y-yes.\" he replied.  Catt could tell he was beginning to crack.  \"Really?\" Catt repeated.  \"I...what do you want me to say?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want the truth, doctor.\" Catt said.  \"Alright, alright.  Jennifer's...pregnant.\"  he said, dropping his head.  \"There it is!  That was easier than I thought!  Thank you!\" Catt said, patting him on the back and leaving the office, happy that she had finally gotten the answer she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fished her cellphone from her pocket and dialed Kevin's number.  \"Kevin, I've figured it out!  Jennifer Lawrence is pregnant!\" Catt exclaimed.  \"Wait, what?  How do you know?\" he asked.  \"I pressed her doctor for a while, he finally cracked.\" she said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congratulations for actually doing some investigative reporting for once.  Now what?\" Kevin asked.  \"Call her manager and tell her I want to interview Jennifer again about the movie.  Oh, and get an ultrasound machine, too.\" Catt cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that Jennifer paid too much attention.  She was full and zoning out in front of the TV while Melissa took care of business.  Gradually some of the conversation leaked through to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it sucks that bad then unsuck it, okay, Joel?  We don't have a lot of time to get this done . . .Yeah, yeah, why don't we do that? . . Yeah, he wouldn't be available so fast, I guess . . . Well what about that Kyle kid you use in everything?  He works cheap and is good at improvising . . . Of course he'll do it, this a low-budget, independent, Oscar-bait film staring Jennifer Lawrence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa seemed to have hung up at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, you know Kyle James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been in some small movies.  Anyway, he's playing the father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds good?\" Jennifer began the process of sitting up.  Melissa heaved her to her feet as she continued.  Jennifer almost fell forward once she was standing.  Even just standing up took the wind out of her now.  She as amazed that her belly didn't automatically drag her back to the ground.  Or that her ass didn't.  Or her breasts.  There really wasn't any part of her that she didn't think was absolute huge and inhumanly heavy.  Melissa snapped at her to bring her mind back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Jen.  Also, Joel hates the script.  He says it's crap and he won't use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what, we're just supposed to shoot us standing around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We think you two will probably have enough chemistry to improvise some scenes given your characters and motivations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer chuckled, \"Um, I'm still not sure what my character is supposed to be . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant with octuplets and concerned.  Look, Joel can direct you through this.  He's got his favorite cinematographer and a few select crew.  We're shooting this fast and dirty.  Hey, and I'm kind of the producer.  How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer held onto Melissa as they started to leave.  She had to steer her lumbering friend to get her to move steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, um, what about my costume?  And make up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa groaned, \"Can we just do this, please?  And you have that whole pregnant glow thing going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled proudly.  \"It's true nobody else can be this huge and still this hot,\" she laughed.  \"Maybe I'll start a new trend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel had a lot of leeway in where he wanted to shoot, since he had gotten no direction from Melissa on that.  Basically, his understanding was that he could do whatever he wanted with as little as he had.  He took it as a challenge, which Melissa was glad of.  He thought he was saving a big Hollywood movie by turning it into a low-budget, personal one.  It was a challenge he'd relish, if only briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Melissa had to drive nearly an hour out of the city to a secluded spot on the coast.  The scenery was beautiful and devoid of people.  Jennifer, her pregnant hormones still in full swing, found the scent of the sea nauseating.  A pep talk from Melissa got her in a working mindset again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel was on the beach with a small crew of half a dozen.  The only other actor there was Kyle, who Jennifer found she didn't recognize from anything she had ever seen.  He also didn't recognize her at first.  When they came down the path to the \"set\" he actually approached Melissa first, before realizing his mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, um, Jennifer Lawrence, great to meet you,\" he said, shaking Jennifer's hand.  She found it at first distracting and then annoying the way he was looking her up and down in disbelief.  She didn't mention it, of course.  She just rubbed her belly and wobbled in place while they exchanged pleasantries.  Joel ran up holding the script, which had his markings all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  Look, I condensed all the key scenes into simple exchanges.  You two have met?  Good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember anything happening on a beach,\" Kyle said.  He was still somewhat confused by the whole thing.  If Joel was confused he hid it well.  He simply took charge with what he had to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful, at least,\" Jennifer said.  \"But you know, I'm not really up for long walks on the beach at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, your frustrated and uncomfortable, use that,\" Joel said, leading them along the rocky sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be one of the last scenes in the movie,\" Joel said.  \"At this point, you two are coming to grips with having to be parents of a lot of babies.  I know you're both great, the best, so I don't think I have to explain what would be going through the heads of two young people about to embark on such a drastic change to their carefree lives they've been living up until then.  We work this right, we can film most of the last days today, and when Jennifer slims down in a few weeks we can film a few opening shots to set it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Slim down'?\" Jennifer glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're rollliing!\" Joel had already dashed back behind the cameraman.  The boom mics were in place.  Jennifer and Kyle, wide eyed and finding absolutely nothing to say, both looked over to Melissa as if by instinct.  The only person who looked like he thought everything was going according to plan was Joel.</span></div></div>",

He started strolling slowly away from the crew, the steadycam keeping a safe distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you want me to say,\" Kyle said.  It took Jennifer a moment to realize he was already acting.  He just jumped into character.  She wasn't so much impressed as relived.  Leaving (most) of her self-consciousness behind, Jennifer began walking (waddling) alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell into easy conversation, made easier by the fact that while Kyle had to imagine himself in this situation, Jennifer just needed to think of her own situation subjectively.  Not the magically pregnant part, that wouldn't do at the moment, but that she was carrying eight babies and would soon give birth to them.  There were implications there, implications that she had disregarded even now as she spoke like someone who hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jennifer had noticed Melissa and Joel, she would have seen that they were nodding at each other.  Every few minutes Joel would stop them and set a new scene for them.  A few required that Jennifer sit on the beach while Kyle stood above her, which she appreciated.  He had trouble lifting her up, which she didn't appreciate but used that discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, people, I want to go up to the street.  Melissa, you get Jen's change of clothes, Kyle, go change yours . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing from being on her feet for hours, and her giant belly rumbling with a hunger she was growing all too used to, Jennifer went with Melissa.  Melissa had plenty of food ready, and even helped Jennifer get her hefty body into another unflattering, billowing outfit.  They would be shooting some shots on the street now, out of sequence, and this outfit was meant to make Jennifer look a little smaller so they could have this be an earlier scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if she doesn't look that much smaller just because of a costume change?  This girl isn't Jennifer Lawrence who got pregnant, she's a pudgy girl who got pregnant,\" Jennifer growled as she heard Joel say from a distance.  She turned back to her massive sandwich and blushed as she felt a hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're moving,\" Melissa said warmly.  Jennifer rubbed her belly with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all moving,\" she groaned, but smiled.  She winced a little as a few particularly strong kicks hit her hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going so bad, Jen.  If Joel doesn't pull this off he'll at least make it look like we tried our hardest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it doesn't work, I'd work with him again.  Kyle, too.  It's so much different than a big budget movie.  It feels, I don't know, more real, like we can make mistakes and it can still help the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded, \"See what happens when you stick with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid,\" Anna said.  She had thick headphones on and was aiming an audio amplifier from an alleyway across the street from a nondescript antique store.  Catt leaned against the wall next to her, dressed in black and acting like a spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not stupid, it's investigative journalism.  And anyways, when else were you going to use that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was not a spy, detective, or a professional audio person of any kind, but she loved gadgets and for once Catt had more to say about her hobby than \"that's cool.\"  She told Anna everything she already knew.  Jennifer Lawrence was definitely pregnant, as he doctor confirmed it.  She had gotten pregnant and grown to a ridiculous size in a matter of days, apparently right after buying some necklace from this antique dealer.  He rushed off without hearing Catt out, but when she returned she saw he had returned to his store.  A light was on in the upper window, and from what she could tell her was reading.  But then a woman, who Anna's spy ear told them was named Alice and was an old friend of the guy, came by with some more books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were discussing Jennifer, there was no doubt of that, but Anna could barely make out anything.  What she was thought was stupid was that Catt actually thought something supernatural was going on.  Sure, she couldn't explain how Jennifer had gotten so huge so quickly, but there are plenty of bizarre medical conditions that could do that.  Even if she was pregnant, couldn't there be something else wrong with her causing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt half-assedly conceded that, but was convinced something otherworldly was happening, and that the necklace, this antique dealer, and now this Alice were women were the key to finding out the story being Jennifer.  It would only be a matter of time before the doctor confessed his lack of discretion.  Catt hoped to have more to confront them with by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fully dark now, and several different locations around the building proved useless in getting better sound.  Anna was ready to give up.  The thrill of being a celebrity spy had worn out pretty quickly.  Catt, however, was nowhere near giving up.</span></div></div>",

They had just finished filming the last scene for the day, and by all accounts today's shoot went surprisingly well, given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we're going to meet at the studio tomorrow afternoon.  With the way Jennifer's growing, it'll probably be the last chance to film the labor scene.\" Joel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, ass.\" Jennifer replied, rubbing her globular belly as her babies kicked hard.  She was tired, hungry, and uncomfortable, and she wanted nothing more than to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.  Anyways, good work everyone!\" Joel said, as the cast and crew began to go their separate ways.  \"Not bad for the first day, huh?\" Melissa asked Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it could've gone worse.\" Jennifer sighed.  Her belly gave a huge growl, and Melissa knew that it was time to go.  The two went to Melissa's car and left the location.  \"So where do you want to go?\" Melissa asked.  \"Uh, I guess I'm in the mood for burgers.\" Jennifer replied, her stomach rumbling once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode up to the drive-thru at the local burger joint, as Jennifer told Melissa what she wanted.  She ended up ordering fifteen double cheeseburgers and three orders of extra-large fries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for the cooks to make it all, but when they finally finished, Jennifer ate the food ravenously as Melissa drove back to the house.  As they arrived, Jennifer had finished her meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...I think I'm running out of room....\"Jennifer groaned.  \"Running out of room for food?  Or to grow?\" Melissa asked.  \"Both.\" Jennifer replied.  The two entered the house, as Melissa ushered Jennifer to the couch.  As Jennifer was able to relax, her reverie was broken by Melissa's cellphone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?  Jen, it's for you.\" she said, handing her phone over.  \"Hello?\" Jennifer asked, one hand glued to her pregnant belly.  \"Jennifer?  Hi, it's me Catt!  How have you been?\" Catt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm doing alright.  About to slip into a food coma I think.\" Jennifer said, giving a small chuckle.  \"Oh, yeah.  I almost forgot about that!  That belly nice and round for the movie?\" she asked.  \"Yeah.  Is looking like I'm about to go into labor with quads round enough for you?  Anyways, why did you call?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some of our photographers got some pictures of you filming the movie today, and they got word that the shoot was going to be pretty short.  I figured that since you're almost done filming you wouldn't mind stopping by our studio to talk more about it.\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Catt I mean--\" Jennifer began, before being cut off.  \"Please?  Just one more time and then I'll be out of your hair for good.  I promise!\" Catt said.  Her spying earlier proved to be a fruitless endeavor, and she wasn't going to let this opportunity slip away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine.\" Jennifer sighed.  \"Great!  How does noon sound?\" Catt asked.  \"Sounds fine.  Goodbye, Catt.\" she said, hanging up.  \"What was that about?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt wants to interview me about the movie.  I said yes.\" Jennifer said.  \"Alright.  Just stick to the script again, alright?  Remember, weight gain supplements and all that.\" Melissa said. \"Right, I remember.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of channel-surfing, Jennifer decided to call it a night.  Tonight, she decided to sleep in the nude, as her underwear wasn't exactly comfortable anymore.  Though, at this point in her pregnancy, nothing was.  As soon as Jennifer's head hit the pillow, she went to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with everything that had happened the last few days, the sight Jennifer awoke to still shocked her.  She didn't think she could get any bigger.  It just didn't seem possible.  But here she was, staring past her giant, globular breasts to a belly that had somehow grown out even more during the night.  She felt squirming inside and rubbed it to sooth them.  She tried to sit up but couldn't.  Her stomach muscles simple weren't working, and even if they were she wasn't sure she'd be able to handle the weight.  Swallowing her pride, she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissaaaa?\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hurried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is-ooh, wow,\" even Melissa could tell that the giant Jennifer had grown even more.  \"I mean, just wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me up?  I can't . . . I can't sit up on my own,\" Jennifer blushed, trying to smirk but turning out only a frustrated frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa heaved Jennifer up to sit on the side of the bed.  She used all her strength to get her to her feet.  Jennifer wobbled, spreading her legs and waving her arms.  Her hips and legs creaked under the weight.  Still, she was able to stand and take a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have <i>anything</i> that will fit me?\" Jennifer asked.  \"And I, uh, think I might need help . . .\"  Jennifer wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much effort they got her into some yoga pants which were nearly indecency in how they stretched around her behind and hips, and a shirt that did nothing to cover her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get you a giant sundress for the interview.  That might be best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sighed and rubbed her sides.  \"My poor body,\" she said, but more with resignation than the horror she had felt when she first started growing days before.  She touched her cheeks, \"My face doesn't look that fat, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you look beautiful, Jennifer,\" Melissa said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even harder to get down the stairs.  Jennifer knew she was getting wider as well as heavier, and every doorway made her question her ability to walk through it.  Jennifer wolfed down her breakfast that Melissa had prepared.  She wanted more, the growling and churning inside demanded it, and Melissa was prepared.  Dr. Anderson showed up, more reticent than usual.  He skipped over the usual small talk and went right to the examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm sorry, it's been a rough few days,\" Dr. Anderson said.  \"But, well, I don't suppose I need to tell you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are they?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The babies look perfectly healthy.  And Jennifer, it's miraculous the shape you're in.  Any other woman in your state would be bedridden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the necklace,\" Jennifer said.  She actually was thankful for that, at least.  She shuddered thinking of how it felt when she had taken it off, and didn't want to do that again, especially at her size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about at 34 weeks now, so right on schedule.  I'll be back tomorrow for another check up.  Just call if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seemed off, I hope everything's okay,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Melissa, can you go and pick me up something to wear for the interview?  I don't think I could stand walking around a store.  And I know I couldn't stand going in public again like this,\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you just sit tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa helped Jennifer to a recliner.  \"Heh, as if I could do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa returned an hour later, finding Jennifer leaning over to the side looking herself up online.  There were few photos of her from the last few days, but a few were taken.  She sighed, looking at one from her second day of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was so huge then, remember?\" she laughed.  \"If I can get back to anything close to that after this I'll be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more days, honey,\" Melissa said, patting Jennifer's shoulder.  \"Come, we have an interview.  I've spoken with Catt.  It's not to go over fifteen minutes.  They know we have more shooting to do later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer kept rubbing her stomach.  The kicking was growing constant now, especially it had been over an hour since she last ate.  The movement no longer worried her, but it was uncomfortable.  Her skin had gotten so tight around her belly that every change inside her felt like it was just one kick too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the dress could not hide Jennifer's belly, but it at least covered her.  Melissa drove--Jennifer hadn't been able to sit behind a wheel in days, after all.  She didn't even mind all the stairs she was getting from the crew at the studio today.  She was used to it.  She wasn't proud, but it didn't bother her as much as it did before.  Catt, however, still grated on her.  She ran up to Jennifer with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jennifer!\" Catt said.  Jennifer was getting tired of hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm huge, massive, a whale,\" she said, but her tone was less snippy than her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have filming to do so we'll only be a few minutes.  I just want to ask about how the shooting is going, what's it like working with an independent director on a guerrilla project like this, just give us an all around update.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's belly growled.  She was famished again, and would just have to ignore it.  As they took their seats, Jennifer resisted the urge to ask for a bigger chair.  She rubbed her stomach softly, trying to sooth the hunger and the kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indigestion?' Catt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I've been on kind of a crazy diet lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began rolling, Jennifer uncomfortably squirming in their seats, and Catt acting with her usual confident air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, this is Catt Saddler, and we are once again here with Jennifer Lawrence to discuss her low-budget, independent film that everybody would be talking about if it wasn't so secret.  How are you feeling Jennifer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huge, but excited,\" Jennifer said.  \"This is like no other film I've ever worked on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've certainly shown more dedication than I have ever seen in an actor,\" Catt said.  \"Do you regret it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Jennifer laughed.  She patted her squirming belly and moaned despite herself.  \"Ask me again when the filming's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jennifer, a lot of people are concerned with these changes you've gone through in what seems like just a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet of them, but I assure you it's all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt interrupted her.  A woman in a lab coat with a draped machine came out.  Jennifer, and Melissa off screen, were stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want to make sure everything is fine with you, Jennifer,\" Catt said, smiling wide and, Jennifer thought, sinisterly.  \"This is Dr. Angela Brown, an obstetrician to the stars, so to speak.  We've asked her to confirm that you aren't, in fact, pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jennifer said, both in fear and anger.  Her belly rumbled, and she winced again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Angela, this is an ultrasound, we just want to make sure you're okay.  Growing like you have so quickly isn't normal.  And if you are pregnant, I can't even guess how many you must have in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was too surprised to respond as angrily as she otherwise would have.  She looked to Melissa, who looked furious.  They couldn't pull her out now, and if they let her go through with this test the whole world would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really comfortable showing my fat belly like this,\" was Jennifer's best response, delivered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dr. Brown was already pulling around a portable curtain along with the machine.  The screen was next to Catt, who stood next to it with a nonchalant pose and a knowing expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Jennifer, don't you want to be sure?\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer closed her eyes and sighed.  Without another word, she lifted up her dress behind the curtain, and the doctor clearly was surprised by her size.  Jennifer looked at Melissa off to the side, who was shaking her head in resignation.  After all the hiding they had done, Jennifer started thinking it'd be a relief to have it out in the open even if they had no rational explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor rubbed the gel on Jennifer's stomach and probed her.  She and Catt looked to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm counting eight,\" Dr. Brown said,  \"Eight babies?\"  She didn't hide her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt beamed triumphantly at Jennifer, who responded with a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jennifer, the rumors are true then?\" Catt said.  She wasn't going to try to get Jennifer to admit she lied when it was that obvious.  She had won, that was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sighed and pulled her dress back down.  The doctor shook Catt's hand and retreated to the side.  Finally, with a blend of condescension and cheerfulness, Jennifer responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, come on, Catt,\" Jennifer spread her arms wide, \"I like to think I'm at least carrying it well.\" </span></div></div>",

She winced, as her babies began to kick particularly hard, needing food.  Catt noticed Jennifer's discomfort and pressed a hand to her belly, rubbing it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I'm sorry, but I don't buy that, and I've believed some pretty bizarre rumors in my career...\" Catt said.  \"It's true.  Dr. Anderson said that I was 34 weeks during this morning's exam.\"  Jennifer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"34 weeks?  So, that means you're going to give birth...\" Catt began.  \"Tomorrow.\" Jennifer finished.  \"But how is that possible?  Going through an entire pregnancy in a matter of days?  And with octuplets?\" Catt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're guess is as good as mine.  I'm a medical marvel.\" Jennifer said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a talented actress to boot.  Well, that's all the time we have.  For Jennifer Lawrence and her growing bundles of joy, I'm Catt Sadler.  Before we go, I'd like to wish Jennifer the best of luck with her impending motherhood, as well as losing the baby weight.  Good night, everybody.\" Catt said, as Jennifer glared at her dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Jennifer asked, ushering Melissa over to help her up.  \"What?  I just don't like liars.  Especially fat ones, at that.\" Catt replied.  \"I'm not fat.  I'm pregnant.\" Jennifer stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being pregnant doesn't really excuse the double chin, honey.\" Catt smirked.  \"Oh, buzz off, Catt!  I'd love to see what you look like eight months pregnant with octuplets.\" Melissa said, coming to her friends aid.  \"I doubt I'll ever be in that situation!\" Catt scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jen.  Let's get out of here.\" Melissa said, as they began to leave the studio.  \"See ya!  Hopefully you can fit through the door!\" Catt exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Jennifer got into the car and began to drive away.  \"So that went as worse as possible.\" Melissa stated.  \"It's not like it matters.  I mean, they'd eventually find out anyway.\" Jennifer said, frowning as her belly growled loudly.  Melissa looked at her and gave her a nod, driving to the nearest drive-thru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Jennifer finished her feast as she burped loudly.  \"That enough?\" Melissa asked.  \"I don't know.  I'm still a little bit hungry, but there's not much room in there anymore.\" she replied.  \"Right.  Don't worry, Jen.  It's almost over.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, by the way, we should probably be getting stuff for the...babies soon, right?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Yeah, we should do that tomorrow.  So we'll have that and the birth.\"  Melissa said.  \"Right.  The birth.\" Jennifer said.  \"Look, I actually scheduled a birthing class for you tonight, so we'll do that after the shoot, alright?  It's a private session.  Guy's called Fernando.  You think you can do that?\" she asked.  Jennifer nodded in approval, and Melissa drove to the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the secret's out, huh?\" Joel asked as Jennifer and Melissa arrived onset.  \"Yep.  It was only a matter of time, though.  So is this scene taking place in a hospital?\" Jennifer asked as they made their way to the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it actually takes place in your character's home.\" he replied.  \"A homebirth?  For octuplets?  I mean, I guess so.  So do you want me to be wearing this or do you have something picked out for me?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the thing.  Me and some of the crew, we thought that it would be best if you did this scene...nude...\" Joel said.  \"Nude?  Oh, Joel.  I don't know...\" Jennifer responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, look at it this way.  When a famous actress like yourself does a nude scene, there's usually a lot of buzz, and with more buzz means more hype around awards season.  Wouldn't you want another Oscar?\"  Joel asked.  \"Sure, but with more buzz means more people seeing the film.  And I don't know if I'm comfortable with so many people seeing my nude pregnant body.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?  For the art?\" Joel asked.  \"Fine.  For the art.\" Jennifer sighed.  She stripped in the dressing room and headed out, as she felt many unwanted eyes looking at her naked pregnant body.  That feeling of awkwardness didn't last long, however, and she actually embraced her large maternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few takes, the labor scene was completed.  With that, the shoot was finished for the time being.  \"Alright, everyone!  It was great to work with you for the past few days!  Once Jennifer is ready to get back to work, we'll resume filming.\" Joel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa handed Jennifer her yoga pants and shirt, as she struggled to get clothed again.  After Jennifer got dressed, the two left, heading to her birthing class.</span></div></div>",

She had thought she was used to this by now, but the extent that her taut belly would bulge and squirm was getting beyond uncomfortable.  She moaned, caressing her stomach as they pulled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Melissa put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.  It's just getting too much.  I'll be glad when it's over tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, to herself, it took Jennifer a moment to realize how crazy it was to be as calm as she was now.  Melissa helped her out of the car.  They very slowly made their way to the birthing instructor's studio.  Melissa arranged for it to be private.  At the time they assumed that her condition would still be a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Melissa entered to find the instructor, Lucy, setting up a mat on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she jumped up and walked over to shake both their hands, \"You must be Melissa.  And of course I recognize you, Jennifer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer took her hand.  Lucy showed no signs of being shocked by her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for doing this,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not so unusual for more high profile people to ask for a private class.  I have to say it is unusual to have only one class one day before giving birth, though,\" she smiled slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was sort of . . . sprung on me,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard,\" Lucy said, but then dropped the subject.  Jennifer thought Melissa must have explained the situation and asked her to not drag it out.  \"Would you step this way?  I'm going to teach you some breathing exercises first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathing is something I don't seem to have any room left in me to do much of anymore,\" Jennifer said.  With both their help, she was lowered onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now-what's wrong?\" Lucy asked, seeing Jennifer's pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer didn't answer right away.  She was pressing on the side of her belly.  She was feeling the kicking and wiggling again, but this time an odd sensation was going through her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're kicking again.  But, I don't know, it feels . . . bulgey,\" she winced.  Melissa looked concerned.  After a moment, the discomfort passed, and Jennifer asked if they could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy taught her the basics, and Jennifer felt clumsy doing them.  She was convinced she must look like an awkward idiot the way she could barely change positions without help, and how after only a few deep breaths she became lightheaded.  She knew that she had changed a lot in the last few days and was once again struck by just how much her body had gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class lasted an hour.  Jennifer got the impression that Lucy wanted to go on further, but by then Jennifer's stomach growled so constantly that they all decided it was time she eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't normally do this, but would you like me to be there tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great,\" Melissa said, seeing that Jennifer was too out of breath to answer.  \"I arranged for a private room in the hospital, away from where anybody might try to sneak in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's amazing like that,\" Jennifer said.  \"Could you two help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heaved Jennifer up.  She tugged at her large shirt and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" she said, and Melissa nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer blushed as Melissa said, \"She . . . grew some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the last hour,\" Jennifer said, bits of worry reappearing in her mind, \"It hasn't happened that fast in a couple of days, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were interrupted by an enormous gurgling sound from Jennifer's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, guys, I need food.  Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again, Lucy,\" Melissa said.  Jennifer just nodded.  She was too tired and hungry to say much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the car, Jennifer turned to Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thank you,\" she said, \"I really couldn't have gotten through this without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't have to worry about it,\" Melissa said.  She rubbed Jennifer's belly gently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer and Melissa arrived home, as the pregnant actress was helped out of the car and into the house by her good friend.  Jennifer waddled to the couch and sat down, the furniture giving an ominous creak in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so since this is the last pregnant dinner for you, I thought I'd cook something up for you.  What would you like?\" Melissa asked.  \"Everything.\" Jennifer replied, her belly rumbling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Melissa cooked, Jennifer watched TV.  She noticed that every channel seemed to be discussing her pregnancy.  Which was unsurprising, considering a famous actress being pregnant with octuplets isn't exactly an everyday occurrence.  After about a thirty minute wait, Melissa had finished cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEssentially, Melissa had cooked enough for an entire family, and then some.  Jennifer thought that perhaps it was a little too much, but she was too hungry to not eat it all in a hurry.  Somehow, Jennifer was able to eat it all, but definitely regretted it.  \"Eugh...that was a mistake...\" she groaned, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to feed the babies, Jen.  Oh, I think your belly got bigger...\" Melissa trailed, placing a hand on her friend's constantly bulging and squirming pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right.  God, I can't wait for this to be over.\" Jennifer moaned, wincing at the odd sensation that she'd felt earlier.  Melissa noticed her discomfort and approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Melissa asked, looking noticeably concerned.  \"It's that same thing that happened during the birthing class.\" Jennifer replied.  \"Here, let me call the doctor.\" Melissa offered, dialing his number on her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey doc.  It's Melissa.  Jennifer's going through some discomfort right now, and we were wondering what was going on.\" Melissa said.  She handed the phone to Jennifer to let her describe what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my belly's sort of getting...tight.  After a while it goes away, but when the babies start to kick and get restless it tightens up.  It's almost like I'm cramping or something.\" Jennifer said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Well, by my calculations you should be still in the eighth month of pregnancy, so you shouldn't be having contractions already.  In all likelihood, you're experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions, which is essentially your body preparing for the real thing.  I'll be with you two all day tomorrow, so I'll be able to help out some.\" said Dr. Anderson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation ended, and Melissa helped the massively pregnant Jennifer to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Catt was outside the antique store, observing the light that was on inside.  The door was locked, but a nearby window was unlocked, as Catt carefully crawled through the window.  As soon as she was fully inside, she was met by Sam, the store's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again, what the hell are you doing here?\" he asked.  \"Doing a follow-up.  That necklace that Jennifer Lawrence bought.  I want to know the truth.  The necklace made her pregnant, didn't it?\" Catt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  N-no.  Of course not.\" Sam said, trying to fool Catt.  \"Don't lie to me.  If I find out you have, I'll have this store shut down faster than you can imagine.\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it didn't make her pregnant.  But...it did enhance it, so to say.\" Sam said.  \"Enhance?  So that's why she's having octuplets?\" Catt asked.  \"Yes.  And it's why the pregnancy has progressed so fast.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Well, sir, I'm sorry that I had to sneak in uninvited, but I'm a reporter.  And I had to get to the bottom of this story.\" Catt said.  \"It's fine.  Just, please, don't come to this store anymore.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.  Not like this store will be open in a month, anyway.\" Catt scoffed, leaving the antique store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the excitement of what tomorrow would bring, Jennifer thought she'd have more trouble sleeping.  Instead, she slept soundly for nearly twelve hours.  It was almost afternoon by the time she woke up.  She was used to waking up and having to assess the damage to her body, but today she saw that, against all reason, she was even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly and tender, swollen breasts rose before her under the blanket.  She didn't have to touch them to know how tight and sore they felt.  The weight of them pressed her into the bed even more than before.  She wobbled a little, and with some exertion found getting up was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the big day, huh?\" she removed the sheet and gently caressed her massive stomach.  She had thankfully avoided too many stretch marks, and the ones that were there were barely noticeable.  Inside her, she felt squirming and kicking the instant her hand met her skin.  She winced.  This was getting beyond uncomfortable.  She pulled her hand back and grimaced at her fingers.  They were definitely thicker than yesterday, as were her arms.  She consoled herself that this was just last-day water weight, and that it wouldn't add to what she'd already have to lose after she gave birth.  It was still disconcerting.  Turning her head to the side she could make out her rounder face in the mirror across the room.  Jennifer sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these thoughts of her figure were only a momentary distraction, oddly enough.  She called for Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Morning, Jen.  How are you feeling?\" Melissa began the process of hoisting Jennifer out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like-ugh!\" Jennifer was pulled into a sitting position, \"Like a giant water balloon with legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually . . . no,\" Jennifer smiled, \"Not wanting to stuff my face constantly is definitely a feeling I'm glad to have back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you, er, stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" Jennifer fidgeted.  With Melissa's help, they got her to her feet.  She could certainly feel the full weight of her belly threatening to pull her down, but as long as she spread her legs and moved carefully, she did move.  <i>Move like a zeppelin,</i> she thought, seeing how wide she was looking in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer largest yoga pants and t-shirt still left much of her belly in plain view, but Jennifer didn't care anymore.  Getting downstairs took fifteen minutes of careful plodding.  She waddled to the couch and unceremoniously fell into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the plan.  We're meeting Dr. Anderson and some specialists at the hospital.  It'll be completely private.  We'll try to sneak you in so nobody sees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know when the time is coming so we think it's best to get you there right away, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense to me,\" Jennifer rubbed the sides of her belly, smiling a little at the heavy kicking going on inside.  Then, she grabbed it harder and doubled forward as much as she could. \"Oh, ooow . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Melissa stood ready to jump into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that feeling again, like my stomach is being pushed out and forced in at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Melissa pointed at the necklace.  It let off an intermittent glow.  \"It hasn't done that in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why is it doing it now?\" Jennifer closed her eyes and leaned back.  The feeling wasn't passing.  It was coming in waves, each one stronger, like her belly was pulsating from within and trying to swell even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be protecting you,\" Melissa suggested, \"Remember what happened when you took it off?  I think it's preparing you to give birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope so.  Shouldn't we have Alice or Sam there?  What if something . . . magical happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point,\" Melissa slapped her forehead, \"I'll give them a call and see if they can make it.  But we have to go.  Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can waddle if I take the effort,\" Jennifer smirked.  Melissa helped her up.  She was carrying a large bag, presumably full of the regular supplies one would take to a hospital.  They drove off to meet Dr. Anderson at the hospital.  The entire time Jennifer could feel the feelings in her stomach getting stronger.  Were these contractions?  They didn't hurt enough, she thought.  Or was it something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt felt pretty good about herself.  She trailed Dr. Anderson to the hospital early that morning without him even knowing.  Of course, once she was inside she'd have to find the room Jennifer was being kept in.  But that wouldn't be too hard.  She imagined after sidelining the doctor before he probably wouldn't just lead her right there, whatever she might threaten.  So she stayed outside in the back of the parking lot, thinking she should just go in and start looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of watching she saw an old car pull up.  She recognized the antique store owner get out, but not the lady friend he was with.  Of course he would be here.  It was his crazy artifact that caused this whole thing apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt saw her chance.  She rushed behind them and sneaked in after them.  Finding the room might be easier than she thought.  This part of the hospital looked like it was more for storage and maybe a few offices, so there were plenty of corners to hide behind while trailing the two without having to worry about long, open hallways giving her away.  Catt wasn't entirely sure what she'd do when she was there, but she knew being present for Jennifer Lawrence giving birth to eight babies that gestated in way less than the normal was a story she didn't want to miss out on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somehow, Melissa and Jennifer were able to sneak into one of the side entrances of the hospital undetected.  Slowly but surely, they arrived in the birthing room after a twenty minute walk, which usually would have taken two minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Dr. Anderson, Sam, Alice, and Lucy were waiting.  \"So...is...it going to take....all of you...to get me on...this bed?\" Jennifer asked semi-jokingly, struggling to breathe after that walk.  Indeed it did, and after a brief struggle they were able to get her onto the bed, as they all noticed that the bed appeared to slowly descend under Jennifer's excessive weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa texted me about what was going on.  We came as soon as we could.\" Sam said, as Alice nodded beside him.  \"Right, well before we go any further I want to see how the babies are doing.\" said Dr. Anderson.  He wheeled the ultrasound machine beside Jennifer and began the examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit...\" was all the doctor could say.  \"WHAT???\" asked the five other inhabitants in the room.  \"I...I figured that you'd be at 39 or 40 weeks, but...it appears that the babies are currently at 43 weeks.  You're gestating faster than I anticipated.\" Dr. Anderson finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right.  Melissa and I figured that I'd been growing more often lately.  So I'm overdue?\" Jennifer asked, soothing the parts of her belly that she could reach.  If someone looked close enough, they could make out each baby moving individually across the skin of her stomach, a sight that looked extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and by a fair amount, at that.  I'd like to attach this monitor to you to get the babies' vitals.\" he suggested, pulling out a monitor that Jennifer had seen woman in labor wear in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr, Anderson attempted to attach it to Jennifer's belly, but it was far too round and wide to do so.  \"Alright then.  That won't work.  They were fully healthy anyway.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's going on with me?  Am I having contractions?\" Jennifer asked.  \"I...don't know.  It seems like your body is preparing for the birth, but something's preventing it.  We can't give you a cesarean because we're afraid about the blood loss, so we'll have to wait until your body is ready.\" the doctor concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jennifer could react, she felt her belly surge forward by an inch.  \"ARGH!\" she moaned in pain.  \"What...what just happened?\" Lucy asked.  \"Looks like she had a growth spurt.\"  Alice noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we need to figure out how to stop it.  I...don't know...if I can get...any...bigger...\"Jennifer said, her voice beginning to fade.  Melissa approached her friend and started to rub her belly in an attempt to soothe her.  She noticed the necklace as it glowed faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!  The necklace is preventing you from giving birth!\" Melissa yelled.  \"So what does that mean?\" Dr. Anderson asked.  \"We need to make it so the necklace will allow her to give birth.  Sam, Alice, look through that book of yours and see if there's anything relating to it.  Lucy, help Jennifer do some breathing exercises.\" Melissa demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all agreed, and began to do their tasks.  Sam and Alice looked through the book, looking for something that would help.  \"Let's see.  Freezes the pregnancy?  Don't want that.  Delays the birth?  Already happening.  Transfers the pregnancy?  Interesting, but no thanks.\" they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to look, Jennifer's belly pushed forward by another inch and her babies grew more restless.  Melissa couldn't stand to see her friend in such pain.  \"PLEASE...THINK...OF...SOMETHING...\" Jennifer pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying!\" Sam and Alice said.  \"Wait, why don't we just take the necklace off?\" Dr. Anderson asked.  The room went silent.  \"Didn't think of that.\" Sam said.  \"Good idea, really.\" Alice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa grabbed the necklace and slowly removed it, preparing for what would happen next.  Almost at once, a multitude of things happened to Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her belly slowly lowered, signalling that the babies were close to coming out.  \"Here it comes.\" said Lucy.  Then, her monstrous stomach pushed forward another three inches.  \"Must have been pent-up growth.\" Sam said.  Her belly started to contract.  \"Ooh, boy.\" said Alice.  And finally, her water broke.  \"It's time!\" Melissa shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer screamed as her belly contracted wildly, the outlines of each baby easily visible.  \"Okay!  I'm going to get the nurse!  Lucy, keep her on that breathing exercise!\" Dr. Anderson shouted as he exited the room, preparing to birth Jennifer Lawrence's eight babies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer's belly heaved upward and then forward with enough force that if she wasn't so heavy it might have jolted her off the table.  She screamed, and before she was finished it happened again.  Instead of holding onto her belly, she gripped onto the railings, throwing her head back in pain.  She had spread her legs and Lucy was preparing to receive the babies.  Jennifer only had the slightest idea what was going on around here.  Right now her entire world was her giant, pulsating belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, you're dilated.  Completely,\" Lucy said calmly.  \"They're coming, just keep calm, and breath easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get them out of me!\" Jennifer screamed at her as another contraction came.  Her insides felt like they were being twisted in knots, and from the outside her belly bulged and pulsated unnaturally.  The babies wanted to be born and did not want to waste any more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, remember your birthing class, just push-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooaaaah!\" Jennifer thrashed on her bed as much as her bulk would let her.  She felt her belly contract longer, harder this time, the movement was fierce and violent inside her.  She had gotten used to the increasing discomfort but did not think she could handle this much pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first one is coming, we have a head,\" she heard Lucy say.  Three nurses entered, preparing to take the babies for immediate care.  They were all surprised to see how well-developed they were for newborns, nothing like the premature infants they expected even though Dr. Anderson had explained the situation to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another forced push the first baby was born.  Jennifer whimpered with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one!\" Melissa shouted happily, \"Only seven more to go, Jen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can count, Melissa!\" Jennifer snapped as her belly, now a little lower than before, was seized by another spasm.  \"Oooh, god, not again . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, Jen, just breath, and push.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to push so fast, Jennifer, take time,\" Lucy said as the second baby immediately came after the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, it's doing it on its own,\" Jennifer said before devolving in a pained groan, growing too exhausted to do much else now.  Her grip on the bars lessened, allowing her body to rock more back and forth with each contraction.  Through her dim vision she saw the nurses take another infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here comes three,\" Lucy said.  By now Dr. Anderson had returned to stand by.  He stared wide eyed at the third already coming, and at Jennifer's massive, convulsing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now four,\" Lucy said.  Jennifer looked up, although she couldn't see past her breasts and smaller, but still gargantuan belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?  But-ooooh, again, it's happening again,\" Jennifer's eyes clenched shut as she let the contraction come over her again, her belly bulging this way and that, the kicks still there amid all the tumult.  This time, she could actually see it shrink.  She was halfway there, and could even see Lucy past her belly now.  Dr. Anderson's look of astonishment did not give her confidence, but she was distracted as her entire stomach once again tightened and squeezed downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel Melissa holding her hand now, and looked toward her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halfway there, Jen,\" Melissa said.  \"Just keep breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer tried to smile, \"I-I can feel the next one, ooooooh god . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses couldn't take the babies fast enough.  In rapid succession came five, and then six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each one a perfect birth,\" she heard Dr. Anderson say.  That at least was good news.  But it didn't make it hurt any less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wanted to pass out now.  She lay limply on the bad, her legs only remaining upright by the stirrups, and her hand by Melissa.  She looked with tired, pained eyes at Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to sleep,\" she said quietly, before her face contorted in pain as the seventh was forced out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more, Jen, just one more,\" Melissa said.  She wasn't sure Jennifer could handle even one more, though.  She had never seen anyone look as exhausted as she did and still be awake.  Her whole body was drenched in sweat, and the only muscles that seemed to be moving were in her belly.  Jennifer then saw her belly again.  It was small enough now that she could see across the room, seeing where the newborns were being kept and cared for.  With that, she let her head fall back as her body took control one last time.  This time, when the eight was born, Jennifer could only give a tired groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Jen!\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are . . . they healthy . . .?\" Jennifer asked with the last of her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" Dr. Anderson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one them needs any extra care of any kind,\" Lucy said.  \"This is the most amazing multiple pregnancy I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jennifer had passed out with a smile while they still talked.  She was glad to hear it, and she'd be glad to meet her eight babies, and to appreciate getting something like her old body back, but she had no control over it now.  She just had to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt had found the room with little trouble.  It was in an isolated area of the hospital, but it was also the only place she saw a few nurses heading, and then Dr. Anderson.  She was outside during the entire birth.  She thought it would take a lot longer, that she might have time to step in during a lull and have a few words with the new mother.  But it was so fast!  And sounded unpleasant.  She got the idea that maybe, despite her treatment of Jennifer, she might be able to get an interview with her about her unexpected motherhood.  It was a tough choice to interview now in the heat of the moment or to hold off for what could be great on-air time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she went with the latter.  So she waited in the dark hallway while the babies were taking out.  She felt just the slightest bit of happiness for Jennifer for them, she wasn't completely inhuman after all, but mostly she thought about how to get Jennifer to agree for more coverage later.  The last big name to have eight babies was only famous for that.  This would be a much different, and better, story.  The last people to leave were Sam and Alice, the antique dealer and his weird friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Melissa said and stood up after everyone else had walked down the hallway, leaving Jennifer and Melissa alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Sam said, \"Do you have any sense of decency at all?  Seriously, spying on a pregnant woman and then intruding on her like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, pops, I'm not going to bother her.  I have a question, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was all that really . . . normal?\" Catt asked, finding out she didn't really know how to phrase the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal?  There's certainly nothing abnormal about a new mother wanting to rest after giving birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To eight babies?  That she wasn't even going to have a week ago?  Involving some necklace you say is magical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugged.  Alice tapped him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know you what to tell you, miss,\" Sam said.  \"But I suggest you let the matter drop.  She's alive, and the babies are alive, and they'll be healthy.  That should be enough, even for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" Catt nodded as the two left.  Catt resisted one last urge to burst in on Jennifer, and then turned and left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, Jennifer Lawrence was back home after the miraculous birth of her eight babies.  She was resting on the couch, while two babies were latched onto her breasts.  The other six were in their cribs a few feet away, as Melissa was attending to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, I've known this for a while, but you're officially my hero.\" Melissa said, patting her friend's shoulder.  \"Ha, I kinda feel the same about you.  I mean, you're pretty much the only reason this pregnancy went smoothly.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had basically been away from all forms of outside contact since she gave birth, so she decided to turn on the TV.  On E! News, she wasn't surprised to see a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was on the air, and as expected, was discussing Jennifer's pregnancy and birth.  \"She's so strong and so inspirational for going through this experience, especially in the public eye.  I only wish that I was half as strong as her if I ever became a mother.\" Catt said, giving a fake smile to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer placed the babies down and stood up, heading over to approach the other six babies that needed attention.  As she walked, Jennifer kept her hand on her stomach.  It wasn't flat just yet, but it was definitely getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tended to her children, Jennifer noticed that Melissa had a strange look on her face, as if she was severely confused.  \"Something wrong?\" Jennifer asked.  \"Yeah...what happened to the necklace?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  It's in good hands.\" Jennifer said, turning to look at the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand cut!  Alright, let's take a lunch break and then we'll be back to discuss breaking news.  We'll start up in an hour!\" said Kevin, the producer at E! News.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras stopped rolling and the set lights dimmed, and Catt Sadler walked off the set.  As she was walking to her dressing room, she was approached by an intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-ms. Sadler?  I don't want to interrupt you, but...I've got a package for you.\" she said, handing her a small box.  \"Uh...thanks, I guess.\" she said, snatching the box from the intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt walked to the dressing room and slammed the door behind her.  She opened the box, curious to see what was inside.  To her surprise, it was a necklace.  Or, to be more exact, the necklace that Jennifer had been wearing.  Alongside it was a handwritten note.  It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Catt,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you so much for giving my new movie so much publicity.  I'd also like to thank you for the kind words you had for me on today's show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt put the note down and picked up the necklace.  \"This thing...I know what it did to Jennifer, but...that guy said that she was already pregnant...\" she trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt took a second to think.  \"I'd better not risk it...\" Catt said, putting the necklace back in the box.  She walked to the door, but paused as she was about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?  It'll look good on me.  I'm not pregnant, so I'll be fine.\" Catt said, returning to the piece of jewelry.  She carefully placed it around her neck and got a look of herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all.  I think I'll keep this on for a while.\" she said.  Suddenly, her stomach rumbled, much to Catt's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny.  Usually I'm not this hungry during lunch.\" Catt muttered.  She exited the dressing room and headed to the cafeteria, unaware of the faint glow the necklace was emitting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The E! cafeteria, while it was a cafeteria in layout, offered more quantity and quality than what would normally be associated with the word.  That day, Catt took full advantage of it.  She didn't usually do that.  When she did eat at the cafeteria, it was usually just a salad, or some other minimalist meal.  She more often went out, or skipped lunch altogether.  Catt was normally a very light eater despite her constant activity.  Maybe that was why she received some raised eyebrows as she made her way through the line, her phone crammed between her ear and shoulder, and shoveling food on her tray.  Between the three thick gyros, the plate of spaghetti, and two good sized pieces of cake for desert, she went to her seat with the tray flowing over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose around her may have thought it odd, but Catt didn't.  She was famished.  Her stomach started growling earlier and had only gotten worse.  And for Catt, who's tiny appetite had done most of the work in keeping her so thin her whole life, when you were hungry you ate, and she was hungry.  She sat down, and immediately dug in on the gyros, finally hanging up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gotten the first gyro into her eager stomach when Anna showed up out of nowhere with her camera in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Catt,\" Anna said, sitting down without ceremony.  Anna was probably the closest thing Catt had to a friend, and it was not out of the ordinary for her to show up at her work sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Catt said between bites, finishing off her first course.  The grabbed the second gyro, unable to get it down fast enough.  Her stomach still hungered for more, and even Catt, for all her lack of self-awareness, did realize that she was feeling full enough from the one that a second was unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was hungry.  Anna gave her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Catt said, swallowing.  \"You have something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah . . . that's why I'm here.  Check this out,\" Anna showed the screen on her camera to Catt, flipping through some pictures.  Catt recognized the antique store where Jennifer Lawrence had bought the necklace that she now wore immediately.  She also recognized Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Catt said, shoving as much of the second gyro in her mouth as she could, picking up the third and, with a few burps, started in on that, too.  \"She looks good for somebody who just had eight babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure does.  Must have some kind of Hollywood type trainer,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, her ass is still,\" Catt opened her mouth wider than Anna thought possible to shove the last of the third gyro in there.  After seconds of chewing, she swallowed, burped with a full mouth, and patted her stomach.  Anna now noticed the gurgling sound coming from it.  If Catt looked as stuffed as she must surely be here flowing dress and thick belt were hiding it.  \"Enormous,\" Catt finally finished, taking up a fork to dig into the pasta.  Catt sniffed it first, rubbing her stomach.  \"Mmmm, this smells wonderful.  Go get yourself some, on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, no thanks, I'm good,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you hanging around the antique store?  That story's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the area and just happened to see her.  I thought you might be interested in Jennifer still going there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Catt admitted, \"But, you know what-urp-sorry, I'm over it.  Jennifer getting huge, pregnant, lying about it, all that.  It was a great story, but that was weeks ago.  Maybe if she ever loses the baby weight we can have her on the show and talk about that, but until then I'll keep an eye out for something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like notoriously skinny Catt Sadler eats entire cafeteria?</i> Anna wanted to say.  Catt leaned over the plate, eating the spaghetti in a series of fluid motions.  Anna thought she looked like a cartoon character.  She had eaten with Catt hundreds of times and had never seen her eat anything like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You're looking at me weird,\" Catt stopped eating to ask, but only for a moment, and even then her cheeks still puffed out with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just, uh . . . that dress looks really good on you,\" Anna said.  No sense in getting Catt annoyed or upset.  Anna knew her well enough to know that Catt responded to any perceived criticism with either denial or anger, and both were frustrating to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, doesn't it?\" Catt said, \"Belt's a little snug, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled knowingly at that.  With no break at all, Catt went from pasta to cake, which she demolished as if she hadn't been stuffing her face for the last ten minutes.  Finally, as Anna looked on in a mix of awe and amusement, Catt finished.  She sat back and rested her hands on her tummy, its fullness hidden by her thick belt and loose dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, good food,\" she said.  \"Hey, you think any other celebrities go to that antique store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I didn't hang around there to look.  Maybe?  It's in the right area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, could be worth a look.  But I need to . . . oh,\" Catt stood up with a little grunt, holding her stomach.  \"I . . . I don't feel so good . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt looked nauseous, her face turning a shade of green while she held her stomach and sat back down.  She looked at the empty tray, barely any crumbs even left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you let me eat all that?\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt chuckled, but still looked very nauseous.  Her full stomach, and she now finally did feel that she was, in fact, very, very stuffed, churned uncomfortably.  <i>It'll pass,</i> she thought, trying to put it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you want to check it out maybe we can do a thing around it?\" Catt said, groaning a little as her stomach loudly protested any movement.  Catt breathed heavily, closing her eyes and leaning her head back.  Still, she tried to go about as though nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever, I'll swing by and let you know if anybody else famous goes in,\" Anna said, mostly sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good-urp,\" Catt said, her eyes closed, rubbing her stomach as best she could with her belt in the way.  She was able to rub her lower tummy better, and it did feel full and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better hit the restroom before I go back to the studio,\" Catt slowly got to her feet, hunched over and nauseous.  \"Thanks for stopping by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't mention it,\" Anna said.  The two parted.  Only when she turned one last time to see Catt leaving the cafeteria did Anna realize that Catt was wearing the same necklace Jennifer Lawrence was.  Strange that it wouldn't jump out at her.  But then, now that she noticed it, she stopped thinking it was important as soon as she left the building.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another busy day for Catt Sadler.  After lunch, she went to a location interview where exchanged a few short words with Robert Downey, Jr.  Then she drove through a Taco Bell to get a dozen tacos on the way back to the set.  Then she had a longer interview with Sofia Vergara where the two wound up discussing a healthy diet and staying in shape.  Afterwards, she felt sick again and wound up throwing up for a good fifteen minutes in the bathroom.  That passed quickly enough, and she went to the cafeteria to grab a heavy dinner.  On the way home she made and received several phone calls with tips on stories and got responses to requests for more interviews, all the while driving through a McDonald's to get a couple of quarter pounders to top the night off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the entire time Catt's always busy mind just couldn't grasp how much she was eating.  She felt her belt getting tighter, even adjusted it a few times, but she just didn't make the connection.  It was nearly midnight when she finally got home, which was normal for her when she was working up a storm like this.  She took off the belt first.  It practically popped off.  Her tummy puffed out, and even under her loose dress it would have been visible to anybody on her long, slender figure.  She threw on a more comfortable robe, only pausing for the briefest moment to glance at her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus, I'm bloated today,</i> she thought, rubbing her sore middle.  It felt oddly good.  So good, in fact, that she didn't take her hand off her stomach until she went down to the kitchen to make herself a midnight snack.  She was so busy eating that she didn't even get to the point of hunger pains all day, and late at night was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally too full and tired to stay awake, she passed out on her bed, cradling her stomach in her arms.  As she slept her last thought was to make sure she ate less tomorrow.  It wouldn't do to put on weight after all the criticism she had leveled at celebrities for doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and Catt awoke feeling groggy, hungry, and . . . fuller.  She slowly got up out of bed, finding it somewhat awkward to move.  She stretched, pushing her stomach forward, as she walked to the bathroom.  That's when she passed the mirror.  She had fallen asleep in her robe, but was otherwise naked, and so had a nearly complete view of her body in its present state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooah . . . \"she blurted out upon seeing her profile.  Her hands were already rubbing her stomach, otherwise they would have gone there to see if it was real.  It bulged out, even more so than last night.  It felt hard, so she knew it wasn't fat, which would have been ridiculous anyways.  Catt had never had an ounce of fat on her her entire life.  It stuck out far enough to compete with her breasts, which were also swollen and tender to the touch.  She prodded her stomach cautiously.  It came back to her how much she had eaten yesterday.  She spent practically the entire day stuffing herself silly and this was obviously the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the front, she thought she detected a hint of flare in her hips that wasn't there before.  She had a mostly narrow figure, which she was proud of, and the vague hint of a pair shape to it unnerved her.  She realized she was hungry again when her stomach shook and groaned at her.  Famished, even.  She tied her robe, mostly to hide the unsightly bulge from herself, and went to make breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, I'm going to be a little late this morning,\" she said in her phone, her hand rubbing her belly gently through the silk robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Catt, we can manage without you until afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she hung up.  She would have to find something to hide this bloating if she didn't want people to talk.  Realistically, she couldn't hide it completely.  Any pants she owned would be impossible, and any dress would certainly show it off just as much even if it as covered.  But Catt lacked a certain self-awareness.  She knew she ate too much yesterday, and she knew her perfectly flat stomach had suffered, but she made no connection to the necklace, or Jennifer Lawrence's recent condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wound up frying and eating all the bacon she had in the fridge, something she usually limited herself to having one piece every few days.  Had to keep grease to a minimum to stay slim, she knew.  Jennifer Lawrence might be able to bounce back after gaining some weight, but Catt was in her early 40s now.  Anything she gained was likely to stay there, which was a scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jennifer Lawrence,</i> Catt thought, resting her chin on one hand and her other chin on her curved tummy, <i>Why do I keep thinking of her?  That story's done, time to move on.  If Anna gets any scoops then I'll pick it up again, but I have to stay focused.  Got to get off Jennifer Lawrence!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to get dressed, finding the stairs leading upstairs somehow more difficult to climb than usual.  She felt almost winded once she got to the top, an unusual thing for somebody in as good of shape as her.  But then, Catt was thin and ate right, and was active enough, but probably didn't work out to stay in shape as often as she should.  <i>Have to start, if I don't want this getting any bigger,</i> she patted her stomach, her hand lingering there once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was right about her clothes.  She first tried on a pair of formfitting jeans which she knew looked sexy on her, and even did an exaggerated pout to herself when they wouldn't button.  Where they also tight around her ass?  That was absurd, of course.  Her ass was as slim as the rest of her.  She looked through her closet, not wanting to admit defeat quite yet.  She found, among her many, many clothes, a long dressy top which she always liked.  It showed off her shoulders and emphasized her breasts without being too obvious about it.  It felt somewhat tight up top, though.  Her breasts were strangely sensitive, it almost hurt putting on her bra.  Still, the shirt went down past her hips and did a passable job of hiding her temporary--or TEMPORARY! as she said to herself--food baby.  She still couldn't button her jeans, but it wasn't obvious, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her hair and make-up, taking one last look at her profile to see if she looked as hot as she knew she always did.  There was that stomach.  Of course she couldn't hide it.  It poked out too much, was too round, almost pregnant looking.  But the word entered and left her mind in a flash.  She fooled herself into thinking that she was sufficiently camouflaged, and as long as she didn't pig out today it'd be gone by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when it growled and groaned and bubbled at her, he had to stop for some more filling fast food on the way to work.  But who could blame her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole while, every time Catt would frown at her stomach, or tug at her uncomfortably tight jeans around her thighs, that necklace would glow faintly.  She barely felt it, almost forgot it was there, but it was working all the while.  But even for somebody as distracted and oblivious as Catt it couldn't keep her in the dark for much longer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though she made several mental notes to herself that those jeans were too tight, and that her tummy felt somehow \"stretched\" as well as bloated, and even though she made a quick stop in the cafeteria to pick up a sub sandwich and some rolls which she wolfed down while walking to the set, Catt still somehow managed to put her growing situation in the back of her mind.  She had already decided it was just really bad bloating and maybe--<i>maybe</i>--some slight, insignificant weight gain, and accepted any momentary discomfort as a sign of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, nobody said anything about it on set.  She was completely oblivious to a few chuckles at her expense, though.  She overheard the comment \"black is slimming, I guess\" and assumed it was unrelated to her attempt to cover up her swollen middle with a long, black top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready when you are,\" she said to the crew as she stood on the set, standing tall and confident, her hands on her hips, ready to film the show opening for later.  These would lead into the interviews from the day before, and then she would have an actual interview with Dr. Sandra Kissinger, dietician to the stars, later today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Catt Sadler and welcome to E! Hollywood News.  I was able to interview Robert Downey, Jr. on his latest project and we'll get to see some of that in a moment . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, she swayed her hips and flipped her hair, all in a subtle way.  It was normal for her, and she thought it was a subtle, ambiguous way to send acknowledge that, yes, she was a reporter and an anchor but was also aware of her sexiness.  What wasn't normal, and what she was only dimly aware of, was that her hands kept migrating towards her stomach.  She would catch herself and move them back to her hips, or gesture, but they just kept finding their way to her belly.  The thought went in and out of her head that despite successfully hiding her temporary bloating, it was still uncomfortable to her and that must be why she kept wanting to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did another few takes of the intro.  Catt always appreciated the days when she could divide the live filming and these intro segments.  After all the effort she put into the Jennifer Lawrence story a few weeks back she welcomed the break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can somebody get me something to drink?  And a danish or two?  I could really go for a danish,\" she said, her hand once again listlessly massaging her stomach.  She felt an odd sensation.  She already felt pretty full from her breakfast (and walking brunch), but this felt almost like she was getting ever so slightly fuller.  She decided it was her shirt.  Of course it wasn't pulling tighter across her middle, it was just a illusion caused by her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intern brought her a danish and a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one?\" she said with an accusative glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ms. Sadler,\" the intern said, rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the kid say \"eating for two?\" with a smirk to another intern not too far off.  Catt almost got angry, and would have responded with some biting comment, but then decided that it couldn't have been about her.  Catt, who had never had body issues her whole life and had maintained the same weight since her early 20s, couldn't imagine the idea of her appearance being referenced in anything but a complimentary way.  She ate the danish in three bites and was more than nice to the intern when he brought her two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt felt a sudden spasm in her stomach.  Or rather, it was her skin around her tummy that felt it.  She grabbed her stomach and lurched forward a little, her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Catt?\" a crew member said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt gathered herself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, why?\" and she grabbed her stomach again and winced.  She couldn't imagine what the feeling was.  It was a sort of tightness spread out across her stomach, that flared up like a pinch for an instant and then vanished.  Did she feel somehow heavier now?  She rubbed her belly listlessly, a confused look on her face, as she wondered if the feeling of fullness she now felt more acutely was there before.  She was aware that her jeans were squeezing her more tightly now, and thought that her shirt looked a little less loose than it should draping down from her breasts, which also still felt as tender as they did that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt, Dr. Kissinger is here, want to go prep her?\" one of the assistant producers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let me just--\" Catt folded the third danish unceremoniously and shoved it in her mouth, her cheeks puffing out in a cartoonish manner before she swallowed.  She gulped her coffee and walked off, flashing one of her lovely smiles to the camermen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys better not have gotten that on camera,\" she laughed at her own joke.  From behind, nearly everybody looking thought to themselves that Catt's hips looked somehow wider than usual.  Not to mention her always tiny ass looked positively stuffed into her jeans.  It was a wonder she was able to maintain that sexy walk of hers like that.  Still, not much was said about it, even if people that saw her from the side and not just the front could tell she was obviously fuller than they remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kissinger was in a dressing room when Catt entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming, Dr. Kissinger-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra, please,\" the doctor, an older woman with a dignified manner about her, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra, thanks for coming.  Now, we're going to go over first exactly what stars pay you for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Sandra said nodding.  Catt thought this interview might be a little dull, but having some down time wasn't a bad thing somtimes.</span></div></div>",

The two sat diagonally to the camera, the doctor sitting stiff and dignified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Catt, I'm glad to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra, you have given diet advice to some of the biggest stars in Hollywood with some of the best bodies.  Do you think some of these admired figures are your doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra laughed lightly, \"I wouldn't take the credit.  I can only give my expert advice, after all.  What my clients do with it is up to them.  But I am always proud to see it paying off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you are,\" Catt said smiling.  She started to wince, but hid it as soon as she felt it.  It was that stretching, pinching feeling again.  She rubbed the side of her stomach mostly away from the camera.  It felt tight and full.  She focused back on Sandra, but didn't take her hand off her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell us some of your best clients?\" Sandra asked, \"Or is there a doctor/patient confidentiality to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes there is, but many of my clients are vocal supporters of me and are happy to have people know they put every effort into taking care of themselves.  Megan Fox and Scarlett Johansson are two actresses who I work often, particularly when leading up to projects . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra mentioned a few more people but Catt found it harder to listen.  There was that dull ache all over her stomach, and gurgling noises coming from inside.  She was hungry again, she knew it.  And she had just ate.  Catt started thinking about all these gorgeous actresses her guest was mentioning with an unfamiliar feeling of jealousy.  She found herself gently rubbing her tummy, and quickly stopped herself.  She leaned forward and tried to cross her legs, but found it oddly difficult.  <i>Something</i> got in the way, and after two awkward attempts, she abandoned the effort.  Leaning forward even caused her unbuttoned jeans to strain against her bloated stomach, which she could swear felt heavier than earlier despite not really eating that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not all success stories,\" Sandra said, pulling Catt back into the interview.  \"Some people don't have the patience or will power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to remember Christina Aguilera mentioning you as her 'trainer,'\" Catt said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I helped her out, it's true.  Oftentimes it's too late for an easy solution, though,\" Sandra chuckled, as did Catt, \"Sometimes when somebody has been thin all their life they don't notice that they've gained weight until long after everyone else knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to see how somebody could be so oblivious to their own bodies,\" Catt said, aware that if anyone noticed her slight gain they might think she was being hypocritical, but also aware that she was hotter than any of them anyways, and it could only be a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother louder, longer rumble issued from her stomach.  She patted her stomach as discretely as she could.  She kept having to sit up straight, which was strange since she never slouched and yet today her body just kept going into that position.  As the interview went on she was feeling more awkward and self-conscious despite fully believing she had successfully hidden her minor changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self-deception is not uncommon,\" Sandra said, \"But at least it can only go on for so long, especially when you're in the public eye.  Eventually it could just be some little thing that makes you realize you might need some help, and that's where experts like myself come in.  We can let you know what you're eating wrong, what exercises you can be doing, what little habits you have that add up to getting out of shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt couldn't help but feel like Sandra was talking to her.  She tried sucking in her stomach as she leaned forward again to no avail.  Instead she could feel her jeans dig into her under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra, it's-ooh,\" Catt stopped, grabbing her stomach and arching her back a little, causing it to look more pronounced than before.  That feeling again.  With her hands momentarily pressed to her stomach, she could swear that, however subtle it might be, her stomach was pushing outward.  It faded, though, as it always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Sandra asked, looking around to see if any stage hands would help her.</span></div></div>",

Please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra did, for another fifteen minutes.  Catt was her usual self, or at least she tried to be.  She convinced herself that the feeling must be indigestion, which would also explain the bloating.  <i>This awful bloating,</i> she kept thinking as she continually had to stop her hands from rubbing her stomach.  She was dreading getting up at the end of the interview, convinced she must look enormous now.  In the back of her head, though, she realized that something else must be going on, but as long as she focused on her work she could ignore that warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so lovely of you to be with us today, Dr. Kissinger,\" Catt said, shaking Sandra's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for having me,\" Sandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview couldn't be over fast enough.  Catt had to get to her office and be alone for a few minutes.  But even as she rushed away from everyone her stomach's rumbling lead her to the cafeteria again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the last thing I need right now,</i> she thought as she grabbed some pasta.  <i>But this is mostly just bloating.  It's not like it's actual fat.  At least not all of it . . .</i>  Catt's mind was having to do some fancy tricks to keep her from realizing the obvious, but at the same time she found it extremely hard to admit she gained weight.  It would feel like a defeat to her.  She held the firm, round surface in her hands, refusing to lift up her shirt to see it in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied again, Catt rose to leave and stumbled.  She bumped her belly on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" she said loudly enough that some others looked over to.  She felt a cold chill come over her.  You don't bump your belly if you're just bloated, and Catt's flat stomach should be incapable of bumping anything.  And her jeans were still unbuttoned, but they felt tighter than ever.  As she walked there was an awkwardness to it she couldn't understand.  She seemed to have to lean back a little to stay stable, and her hips weren't swaying like they should.  Of course they wouldn't, they were wider than they'd ever been, and had a bit more weight baring down on them than they were used to.  She kept glancing down past her breasts to see her puffy stomach peeking out.  It wasn't just puffy anymore, though.  Now it was actually round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pace quickened and Catt got to her office, locked the door, and turned towards the mirror she so often would primp in front of.  What she saw wasn't her.  The swollen stomach sticking out just past her also swollen breasts, the ass that was stuffed into jeans that were suddenly too small, the shirt that was supposed to be fashionable and sexy now looking like a fashionable and sexy maternity shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening,\" Catt said softly.  The necklace around her neck glowed, quickly losing its power to make Catt ignore her body's changes.  With a trembling hand she reached up and grasped it, its warmth pulsating.  Catt could sense a panic attack coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her hand into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's just swollen,\" she said, her voice shaking, but even as she said it she couldn't believe it.  Her eyes widened, her breath quickened.  She slowly lifted up her shirt to see for herself.  Her stomach was definitely round, the skin taut, her belly button getting tighter.  Part of her brain started to reason that she had only had the necklace for two days, and if she really was pregnant like Jennifer Lawrence was, then Jennifer was certainly not this big by her second day.  Catt knew, she saw the pictures.  But the rest of her went into full panic mode, made even worse because the more concerned she grew the more her hands just kept rubbing the bare sensitive skin of that definitely not flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt that prickling, stretching feeling again.  She hunched over, stumbling back into a chair.  She closed her eyes until it was over.  As the feeling passed Catt found herself calm, or at least calmer than before.  Images of Jennifer flew through her mind.  She remembered Jennifer turning from the beautiful star everyone knew and loved into a massive, waddling, unrecognizable pregnant woman in a matter of days.  She remembered that even after she gave birth Jennifer had a lot of unwanted weight left over.  Then she remembered the horrible screaming coming from the room as she gave birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm really pregnant,</i> Catt thought, then to make it more real said, \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long she spent freaking out about it the worse it would get, she knew.  She stood up, a little unsteadily, and made up her mind to tackle this head on while hopefully not letting too many co-workers see her.  Her jeans chafed her thighs as she walked, but she vehemently vowed to herself that she would absolutely not change.  She would not allow herself to get that far gone.  Catt could solve this, she knew she could, and fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt looked around her office to see if there was something, anything, she could put on to cover her inflated form.  There was nothing, of course.  The shirt she wore was probably the loosest item of clothing in her wardrobe, and now it looked like a maternity shirt.  A cute maternity shirt, she said, but it was little comfort at the moment.  She decided to bit the bullet and just left her office.  She would go to Kevin and tell him what the situation was.  He would understand.  She would have to take some time off, probably only a day or two, to get this sorted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her hunger as she passed the cafeteria, Catt found Kevin alone in his office.  He was on the phone, and held up a finger to let Catt know he'd be with her in a second.  She locked the door behind.  She stood with her hands on her hips, trying very hard to not rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . yeah, we can get to that later.  No, no, I'll call you.  All right.  Bye.\"  Kevin hung up.  He gave Catt a good long, look.  Finally, with more confusion than anything else, \"What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt spoke was firmly as she could, refusing to appear both bloated <i>and</i> panicking at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain.  Look, you see this necklace-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stood up and looked Catt up and down.  Catt was insulted.  She might be bigger around the middle (and hips, and breasts, and, she finally admitted, ass) but Kevin was looking at her like she gained a hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this happen?  Weren't you, you know, thin just yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>still</i> thin!\" Catt yelled, her emotions flaring.  She took a moment to return to her calm voice.  \"All you need to know is, what happened to Jennifer Lawrence is happening to me.  And I need to sort it out.  So I'm taking the rest of the day to do that.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of the day?  Are you serious?  You have three more interviews today and an appearance at the Mini-Emmies tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt's eyes went wide at the thought of appearing in front of any more people in her state.  \"Absolutely not!  Look at me, Kevin!  I'll get this fixed but in the meantime-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question,\" Kevin said, putting his foot down.  \"I see what's happening here.  It's called a false pregnancy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and because you were so obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence now your body is, I don't know, rebelling against you.  I'm no doctor, but nobody blows up like this over night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm just a crazy woman who thinks she's pregnant, huh?\" Catt glared at Kevin, who was getting more frustrated by the second.  \"And even if I was,\" she added, pressing her hands to her stomach to emphasize its roundness, \"don't you think I deserve to not be paraded around just because people are mad at me for showing everyone that Jennifer Lawrence was lying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if she was lying.  What I care about is people think you're a bitch for exposing her like that.  Me?  I thought it was entertaining, got good ratings is what it did.  But you're in the public eye and I don't want criticism of you spilling over to me and the network, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, I'm just supposed to-to blow up on live TV?\" Catt said, her voice cracking.  The mere mental image of that was humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most if it won't be live.  But no, I'm not letting people say that we let our reporters embarrass pregnant actresses but then hide them when they might be embarrassed by the same thing.  You're obsessed brain is making you fat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>not</i> getting fat!\" Catt almost screamed it, her hands now rubbing her belly quickly, trying to calm it down as much as she was trying to calm herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!  This is contractual, Catt!  I can kick you off this network and it'll be years before anyone else hires you.  Jennifer Lawrence has a lot of adoring fans.  She's a sweet kid and people weren't happy about your little gotcha' show.  So you're going to do your interviews like you always do and then you can fix whatever is going on with you in your own time, okay?  I don't want to hear anymore about how you don't want people seeing you look fat or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Catt did something that was completely out of character for her, but she couldn't help it.  Her hormones flared up and, against all her normal behavior, she burst into tears and screamed at Kevin, her voice loud and trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me fat!  This is not fat!  Catt Sadler does not get fat!  This is something completely different, you idiot!\" Kevin jumped back.  Then Catt jumped back and rubbed her eyes.  She was as surprised at herself as Kevin was.  She sniffed a few times, and then the tears stopped as quickly as they came.  She saw Kevin looking at her with fear in his eyes.  Her eyes, however, glinted, and she resumed her usual pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Kevin said, leaning against his desk.  Whether he now believed Catt, or was scared she might freak out even more, or maybe even attack him.  Catt wasn't physically threatening but she wasn't the kind of person even Kevin would take lightly.  \"How about this?  Go do that Kelly Clarkson interview, her cameo in what's-his-name's show, at 3:00, then take the day off.  Take tomorrow off even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and the next day.  Look, I'm sorry.  We said some things.  Emotions are high.  This isn't an easy job,\" Kevin said, returning to his chair.  \"You do good work, Catt.  Take it easy for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Kevin,\" Catt said with an arrogant tone.  She turned to go, suddenly very aware that her walking away didn't feel as sexy as she knew it usually looked.  She felt some pangs of guilt, and turned one last time before leaving.  \"Sorry I yelled at you.  You, ah, that's kind of a hot button issue for me, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Kevin said, \"well, now.\"  He wasn't sure what she meant, but he was convinced that either Catt really was pregnant and growing at an alarming rate, or she really did have some kind of psychosomatic pregnancy that was effecting her in every way.  Either way, his original assumption that she was mostly faking this for whatever reason was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered the necklace.  He did recall seeing it on Jennifer Lawrence, he thought.  Or was he just remembering that from somebody else?  As the thoughts slowly fit together in his mind, he got a phone call, and then vanished as quickly as they came.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt left Kevin's office feeling pretty good despite all that was going on.  By the time the crew was gathered to go on set to interview Kelly Clarkson she started wondering why freaked out so much at him.  Sure, she knew she should be worried, what with her belly looking four, or five, months pregnant in less than two days, but somehow she had calmed down for the moment.  She even felt silly for yelling at Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wasn't looking forward to this.  She preferred actors, especially when involving a show or movie, and didn't particularly like interviewing singers who occasionally did guest spots on shows.  But the interview went smoothly enough.  Catt may have been a bit short with everyone, but it came off more as businesslike and efficient than irritable like earlier.  She even--mostly--allowed her current state to go to the back of her mind as she asked Kelly a few questions about her career, whether she asked for this roll or they asked her, the usual stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went smoothly until the end, when Kelly made what Catt was sure were veiled comments about her weight.  Catt nearly started a fight when, after everyone had packed up and was heading back to the studio, Kelly and Catt ran into each other one last time.  While the crew packed up, Kelly walked by Catt and asked, how far along she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Catt said, suddenly very annoyed and not even willing to give a fake answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, how far along are you?\" Kelly repeated, her chubby face glowing.  Catt narrowed her eyes, and before she could say another word, Kelly reached out and patted her belly.  Catt felt like she must be turning red with either anger or humiliation.  Kelly must have kept her hand there, rubbing her stomach through her shirt, for a full minute or more.  And yet Catt didn't push her away.  She gritted her teeth, breathed deeply, and at last said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two months,\" she said, knowing she looked more.  Why hadn't she pushed Kelly's hand away yet.  In fact, she listlessly rubbed the sides of her belly.  <i>Oh god, because it feels good,</i> she realized, frustrated and ashamed at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two months?\" Kelly said, \"But you're so-so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Catt snapped, not letting her finished.  She went to get in the van with the crew, \"Thanks for the interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt didn't waste any time when they returned to the studio.  It was after 6:00 and she would have to hurry.  She knew exactly who to go and see.  Somebody who had recently seen this exact same thing.  Even if he couldn't fix it he could at least let her know how she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson's office had closed already.  Only his car and some of his staff's were still in the parking lot.  Catt boldly strode up to the door and knocked on the glass loudly.  She waited, then grabbed her belly as she felt that horrible full, stretching feeling grow again.  It passed, but each time it felt worse.  It didn't help that this time it was accompanied by a very loud growl.  She hadn't eaten in hours, and she was starting to get lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Doc!\" she yelled, pounding on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist approached and opened the door a crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have an appointment?  This office is closed, you'll have to come back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an emergency,\" Catt said.  \"Now let me go and see Dr. Anderson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the young girl wouldn't budge.  \"Not without an appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Dr. Anderson walked from one door into another, looking at some papers.  He stopped when he saw Catt, his eyes bugging out when he saw her belly, and again when he saw the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Anderson,\" Catt said, gently rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her in, Molly,\" he said, approaching the door.  \"So . . . Catt, could you, uh, step into that room and I'll see you in a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" Catt gave the receptionist a snide look, and then ruined her proud walk past her by banging her hip into a desk.  They must have gotten wider than she thought, she realized.  She had been ignoring how tight her jeans were feeling all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the table in the office for only a moment before Dr. Anderson came in.  In that short time alone she was able to take stock of her figure again.  Her shirt had certainly grown tighter since earlier.  Her belly, as much as she tried to deny it, was pushing out beyond her breasts now, unmistakable pregnant and very round.  Dr. Anderson closed the door behind him.  He looked her up and down, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you put it on?\" he asked, barely concealing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt couldn't help but laugh a little, \"That's a very good question.  Can we get to the point?  You were with Jennifer through this same thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of it, yes.  When did it start?  Four days ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt started to get nervous again, \"No, uh, yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson approached Catt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lift up your shirt please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Catt did so.  She gasped when she saw her bare belly for the first time since that morning.  Light red marks were appearing along her sides.  Her belly button was inverted already.  The doctor felt around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  We'll need an ultrasound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Catt said, lying down.  In a few minutes, the machine was set up, Catt's belly covered in gunk, and Dr. Anderson moving the probe across her stomach, which she was sad to say was still moaning with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Dr. Anderson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me.  Eight babies, too?\" Catt said, her voice nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson finished the reading.  He turned around and sat next to Catt.  She propped herself up on her elbows with more difficulty than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how to tell you this, but it looks like you're carrying sixteen,\" Dr. Anderson said.  To his surprise, Catt didn't seem to comprehend this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, what?  I thought you said sixteen,\" she sat up, swinging her legs aside and pulling her shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.  Sixteen babies, and you are at nearly three months along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Catt said, taking a superior tone, \"If I was carrying sixteen babies, can you imagine how big I'd get?  I wouldn't be able to even walk by, like the fourth month, right?  And by the end I wouldn't be able to move at all.  It's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have said Jennifer carrying eight babies to term was unlikely, too, but it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she got huge by the end,\" Catt said with a light chuckle.  There was silence as she slowly started to get what the doctor was telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen?\" she asked, her voice shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm afraid so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt's eye twitched.  She sat her hands on her belly, smoothing out her shirt which no longer looked as elegant on her.  She breathed deeply, wondering exactly when she would start to panic.  Sixteen babies?  And she wasn't even a fourth of the way through, and already looked ready to pop as far as she was concerned?  It was too much.  She knew she should panic, and in the back of her mind she was, but openly, she remained unnervingly calm even if her her hands were shaking.  She got off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt, if you'd like, I can monitor you, just come by any time you think there's something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?  Like being pregnant with sixteen babies?\" Catt let out a loud, forced laugh, which seemed to frighten the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, anything at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Catt said as she went to leave, \"I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Dr. Anderson said, wondering how close to a break down Catt must be to be acting so nonchalant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt thought about it.  She looked down past her swollen breasts to that giant, growling tummy.  She shrugged at him, and left.  She moved as fast as she could back to her car, as fast as her overly tight jeans, overly heavy belly, and chafing thighs would let her.  Around her neck, the necklace glowed brightly.  With a powerful force of will, Catt decided that it was simply impossible to be carrying sixteen babies, and that Dr. Anderson must be wrong.  What does he know about mystical pregnancies anyways?  And she had all of tomorrow off to sort this out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt's third day magically pregnant and carrying sixteen went by in a blur.  She stumbled around her house, eating, resting, sleeping, watching TV without even paying attention.  Around noon she noticed the first hints of fluttering inside her.  By evening, she realized she could no longer walk like she always had, and was now waddling.  She spent the whole day in a depressed stupor, accomplishing nothing and ignoring what few calls she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd day four began with her waking up with a start.  It was a start, because she tried to sit up and couldn't.  Her giant, taut belly loomed above her, far eclipsing her painfully swollen breasts.  The t-shirt she slept in was starting to tear around the seams.  With effort, she heaved herself into a siting position on her bed.  She rubbed the giant ball her belly had become, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Catt stood up, wobbling and nearly falling with every step.  As she wiped the crust from her eyes she passed her bathroom mirror and stopped.  She backed into the wall, shaking her head in disbelief.  The face staring back at her was not hers.  It was practically round, with swollen cheeks like she had the mumps, and a prominent double chin.  She recalled what she had said to Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Pregnancy doesn't excuse the double chin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her body didn't fare much better, but she found the loss of her lovely face more devastating.  Even more than the previous day Catt wanted to crawl into a dark room and hide until it was all over.  She managed to move her hands to her giant belly, so large now that she was just able to get her hands around it, and her fingers couldn't touch.  The skin was tight, stretched, and tender.  Every little movement inside her caused her to wince.  And she could even see ripples of kicks move across her belly.  It felt like aliens inside her trying to get out.  And the more this freaked her out, the more they moved, until she was pressed into the wall, unable to look away from the image of bloated, gyrating belly before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, just stop,\" she said out loud.  If the words didn't calm the movements within, the rubbing did.  But even if only two or three were moving, it caught her off balance, causing her wobbling walk to be even more awkward.  \"Thankfully,\" her hips and legs had thickened considerably to help carry the load.  She found this a small comfort, especially given her ass would have an embarrassment to even the fattest-assed celebrities she had mocked in the past.  She must be at least as big as Jennifer Lawrence was at the end, and Catt wasn't even halfway through yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt managed, with much struggling, to get on some stretch pants and a tank top which left most of her belly in view.  She couldn't go out like this.  Maybe Megan Fox or Mila Kunis could show a little pregnant belly in public, but neither of them were remotely as huge as Catt was.  She was fully aware of her situation again, but her trademark determination still needed an excuse to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to make some breakfast.  Cooking proved absurdly difficult.  With her belly in the way, she couldn't quite reach the stove.  She strained her arms cooking up some bacon, eggs, and toast, and then once she did eat them she only wanted more.  She saw her laptop.  She hadn't looked at it since the day before when she got the news of how many she was carrying.  She hadn't gone that long without using the internet since it was invented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what the hell,\" she muttered.  The first thing that came up was a celebrity news site she often checked.  It was unpolished and mostly images, but she had gotten some good scoops there before that she turned into full stories.  She kept having to press her belly gently to sooth the movements inside.  The necklace glowed softly, serving to calm her mind even if it couldn't remove all her unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Catt scrolled down, she gasped.  There were images of her.  From the other day, back when she thought she was huge.  Now, she thought back then she actually looked pretty good with a somewhat pregnant stomach.  Nothing like the behemoth she had become in the last two days.  They were shot while she was interviewing Kelly Clarkson, who despite no longer being pregnant still looked tiny compared to Catt's current form.  But it wasn't the pictures that got Catt's blood boiling, it was the comments.  Particularly a few which expressed that, after what she did to Jennifer, she deserved to get so big she'd never be thin again.  The repetition of \"never be thin again\" repeated next to her name struck a nerve with Catt almost as much as her argument with Kevin two days before, where he repeatedly called her fat despite her being only a little pregnant then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt struggled to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiots!\" she yelled at the laptop screen, then almost knocked the table over trying not to fall down as her belly forced her forward.  Catt couldn't believe she wasted an entire day feeling sorry for herself.  She could have spent it doing her job, for one thing, even if she was huge and growing by the minute.  She could have spent it trying to reverse this.  Instead, she wasted a whole day and now was so big she could hardly move.  By tomorrow she might not be able to stand.  And tonight she was scheduled to do one of her favorite things of all, an award show.  It was all the best parts of interviewing celebrities without having to spend much time with them.  Sure, her other favorite part of those was turning heads and looking sexy, but maybe Catt could settle for turning heads by being unrealistically pregnant instead.  It might no be ideal, but then neither was going into hiding.  Jennifer Lawrence did a nude scene when she was as big as Catt was now, and here Catt was too embarrassed to go out in public.  No, none of that would do.  Catt could have thought of a million ways it could go wrong, but they were all worse than just giving up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt's mission to get back to work met with some immediate problems.  Showering proved to be difficult, even dangerous.  Doing her make up became a chore as her belly blocked her from leaning any closer to the mirror, and even if she could have she would have lost balance.  Then there was the issues of clothes.  Absolutely nothing she owned fit her in any decent way.  She bit the bullet and went to a maternity store.  She made a valiant attempt to get into her car and was nearly reduced back to her sullen inactive state by her inability to fit behind the wheel.  So she called a cab, a fancy one.  Once at the store, she was not surprised by how her size shocked everyone there.  Had she not been so intent on hurrying up and going to see Kevin she would have berated half the store for constantly touching her stomach.  It was like they were pathological drawn to it much as she couldn't stop rubbing it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the constant kicking.  There was always at least one, sometimes two.  If more than four were moving she could barely stand.  Mentally she was no longer disturbed by this, to her own surprise, but physically it was taking a toll on her.  Several times while trying things on she had to sit down and patiently wait for the massive waves moving across her belly to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she insisted on jeans, the largest they had, along with the dress she planned to wear that night.  She considered it a matter of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" she said, struggling to turn to see her ass in the mirror, \"Nope.  Still doesn't look good in these.\"  But she could at least laugh at herself as long as she didn't dwell on what would happen after she gives birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to get frustrated, Catt finally arrived at the studio by early afternoon.  She did not want to be seen, but also did not want to look like she didn't want to be seen.  She walked the halls past the studio, avoiding the astonished stares of her coworkers and ignoring the inevitable comments about how big she was.  By the time she got to Kevin's office, she rested a moment.  Her legs and back ached, and her feet were nearly numb.  She had to catch her breath.  Catt couldn't believe how much difficult it was to move her once slim, sleek body.  Of course, it was neither slim nor sleek anymore.  Finally she entered without knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kevin,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-Catt?\" Kevin stood up from his work, \"What are you doing here?  I told you to take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt found the gentle and uncharacteristic tone flattering but she didn't wan tto be handled like an overemotional actor today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get back to work,\" she said.  She attempted to sway her hips, and couldn't, almost tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin couldn't take his eyes off her stomach.  \"Are you sure you should be, you know, walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kevin, don't worry about me.  I'm just as--oooh--\" Catt stumbled and grabbed her belly.  Kicking again.  She felt the fluttering on her left side, then it cascaded all through her stomach.  In seconds, she was caressing her belly up and down through her giant maternity shirt trying to get them to calm, while she stumbled backwards ready to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin pushed a chair towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" Catt snapped, still trying to sooth her stomach.  Through her shirt she could see the movements looked as strong as they felt.  She sat down, unable to take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin leaned on the front of his desk.  \"I don't think you should go to the Mini-Emmies tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should,\" Catt said, wishing she could cross her legs and look thoughtful rather than just tired.  \"Why shouldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you seem to be in a much better mood, and I mean this with no intended insult, but don't . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt cocked her head at him and narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . think you'd look, ah, comparable next to the actors and actresses there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt's eye twitched but she kept her cool.  \"What do you mean, Kevin?  Pregnant women have gone to award shows before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as pregnant as you,\" Kevin laughed.  \"Catt, if you go stand around trying to interview all those celebrities, you're going to see the footage later and hate yourself for it, and me for letting you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it.  You know I have a way with these people anyways.  Is there anyone else you'd rather send?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can barely stand, Catt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt winced and rubbed her belly.  The movements had died down somewhat, but she was feeling that horrible stinging, stretching feeling, spread across the entire vast dome of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still stand, and walk, and talk, and I deserve to go at that show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm trying to be nice, but you know, this is Hollywood and we're a, ah, superficial people.  I don't know what's up with this pregnancy, but you look like you've gained more than the average weight.  You want to go on TV, hanging out with beautiful people, looking like you do right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was actually insulted.  Not only because it wasn't her fault this was happening to her, but also because she had made the same point unsuccessfully several times earlier in her career to sideline the competition.  Some of these points had even been made to Kevin himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm doing it and I'd like to see you stop me,\" Catt said.  She tried to stand, but the chair rolled back.  She tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, here, let me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just stand behind and push-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Catt stood, almost overshooting and falling over on her belly.  Kevin nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Catt.  I'll let you try.  But if you start feeling faint or like you can't handle it and I'll get Maria to step in for you.  She doesn't like to do these smaller award shows but she'll do it if I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Menounos!\" Catt said under her breath.  The two did not cross paths often and Catt had forgotten that they had apparently mutually decided to be rivals.  Catt shuddered now remembering how she \"jokingly\" ribbed Maria after feeling pictures her young, chunky self before she got into shape.  Even now she almost rebutted Kevin's suggestion by making a disparaging comment about her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  Deal!\" Catt said, grabbing Kevin's hand to shake it.  He took it.  She saw his other hand lifting, possibly of its own accord, and head for her belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it,\" Catt said, and waddled out of the room with back arched uncomfortably and head held high.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before anything else, Catt had to eat something.  In the cafeteria she ignored the gawking stares of her coworkers, as she was getting far too used to doing, and slowly sat down to eat an entire tray filled with every entree they had.  She ate as fast as she could, but with her belly forcing her to sit so far from the table she had to be careful to avoid dropping anything on her.  She was mostly successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling only somewhat full, enough so that the movements had lessened enough for her to stand upright if unstably, she went to change.  This required the help of her make up team, who politely made no comments about how massive she had become.  The dress would have looked beautiful on her if she had had her old figure, but she thought it looked nice enough.  It left her shoulders and neckline bare, minimizing her swollen breasts, and then draped loosely over her belly.  She thought it might be snug around her hips and ass, but then what wouldn't be at her size?  By this point, she had to force herself to accept it and move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked her make up person if there was anyway they could make her face look less bloated.  They tried, at least.  It was nice to sit down for a while, though.  The time was approaching, and Catt had to get in another large meal before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember.  You start feeling not up to it, Maria will step in,\" Kevin said.  He appeared to be unaware of Catt and Maria's rivalry.  They rarely crossed paths, and even to herself Catt admitted that it was mostly manufactured.  They just plain didn't like each other and were in the same business, and since they were forced to work together on occasion had mutually decided to dislike the other.  In normal times, Catt would not have been bothered so much by the threat of being replaced by Maria.  She thought that Maria was a beautiful woman, sure, but to Catt she was to toned, too curvy, which now were complaints she thought sounded idiotic when she repeated them to herself.  She thought they were essentially on equal terms in all areas, and that Catt just had more experience doing actual celebrity reporting and interviewing, so she had the edge.  It felt strange, and uncomfortably humiliating, thinking that if they were together right now Maria would be \"the hot one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera crew stayed close, as was normal, although Catt could sense some kind of protectiveness in them.  She wobbled as she walked, which was normal now, and whenever she overstepped the ones closest to her would make a quick move as if to catch her.  She thought it almost sweet, but more annoying.  She didn't need help she didn't ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther reporters like her were there as the stars arrived, sometimes one at a time, sometimes in groups.  Catt's feet and back already ached by the time the first showed up.  She had to look at the typical Hollywood splendor around her to remind herself to act normal and chat it up with everyone who came by.  Some who knew her came right to her.  She had to get used to nearly everybody touching her stomach, too.  Nobody was outright asking her about it, but a few told her flat out that she was huge.  She ignored it, asking the typical questions of if they thought they'd win anything, who had the best chances, or if they were only there as guests, whose guests were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed completely normal for an award show, the only difference being that she didn't walk up to anybody and just had to wait for them to come to her.  This was partly because she felt horribly awkward and unsexy when she walked now, and partly because any movement caused her already active belly to erupt into so much activity that it could not only be seen through her dress, but threatened to knock her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think is going pretty good,\" she said, getting out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how much longer before I can sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed and Catt felt the strain more than ever.  Her belly felt like it would crush her hips and snap her spine forward, not to mention the skin was feeling more stretched and sensitive than ever under her dress.  She rubbed her back and belly with a loud groan.  The necklace had been growing lightly all night.  She could even feel it working its magic.  Catt thought she now understood something, how Jennifer Lawrence blew up in front of everyone and people only thought it was kind of strange.  She only really saw because she was so focused on her.  But nobody was that focused on Catt, a fact she was glad of right now.  The necklace must emit some kind of field, she thought, that hides the strangeness of a perfectly normal woman becoming hugely pregnant with multiples in a matter of days.  It was why everyone was surprised by her size, but nobody thought it insane or impossible, unless they really thought about it.  It was also partly why Catt didn't think it so unusual herself anymore, even though by all logic she should be in a hospital surrounded by scientists being studied while they made sure she didn't explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was hard to keep that train of thought in her mind.  She was starting to get short with people, and hungry.  If everyone wasn't invited in to sit down soon Catt would just go herself.  Who would stop her?  By her estimate she was roughly the size and weight of a young elephant, and who was going to mess with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the non-stars like her started to go inside.  Catt waddled her way towards the door, only a few other actors still around her.  Then, she stopped when she saw somebody coming towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, great,</i> Catt thought as she forced a giant smile onto her face, which she was more than ever aware of how round it had gotten.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt may have been putting on the biggest fake smile she could muster, but Maria Menounos approached actually smiling, and it was one of the most sincere and infuriating expressions of glee Catt had ever seen.  Catt waited for her to get closer to say anything, irritating with how Maria's silver dress highlighted every sexy curve of her body in the exact opposite way that Catt's dress did to her.  Maria looked up and down Catt, half-circling her, apparently unable to speak.  Catt knew what she was thinking, since if their situations were reversed Catt would have been just as glad to see Maria in her own state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But at least I would have had some dignity about it,</i> Catt thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, I get it.  Hi, Maria,\" Catt said.  Maria looked like she would be jumping for joy in any other setting to see her chief rival completely blown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Catt,\" Maria said, sounding as pleased as she looked, \"I heard you had gotten big, but . . . how are you even walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got used to it.  What are you doing here anyways?\" Catt asked, letting her fake politeness drop but remaining professional.  Catt was too tired and uncomfortable to continue with their normal passive aggressive banter for more than a few sentences, which had passed.  Plus, her stomach was acting up again, slight movements growing across her insides.  Soon she'd probably have to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked genuinely surprised. \"Um, I'm giving out the award for best editing in a drama.  Catt, you know that.\"  Maria was right to be surprised, and Catt felt embarrassed for not remembering this.  She did know it, but forgot it.  \"Pregnancy brain, right?\"  Maria smiled even wider, suddenly reaching out and rubbing Catt's belly with both hands.  \"How does it feel?  It's so hard, I bet it's uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt rolled her eyes and put her hands to her sides, feeling the movements inside grow stronger.  Brushing Maria away with any force would destabilize her at this point.  Maria either ignored or didn't sense Catt's annoyance, but just kept her hands on her giant belly.  A bump pushed up and rolled under Maria's hand.  She yelped and laughed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to say it,\" Maria said, looking right into Catt's eyes, \"How much have you gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt glared at her, and then winced, holding her belly tighter.  Maria finally took her hands away.  It was that stretching feeling again.  She could even swear her dress felt tight around her sides, each kicking movement causing her belly to sting a little as her skin was even more taut than her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Catt moaned, \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably for the best, I know I wouldn't want to know,\" Maria said.  Having had to work much harder to get her figure than Catt did, weight was a more sensitive issue for Maria.  \"I'm surprised they're having you work the show and not stay at the studio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insisted.  I'm not letting this stop me from doing my job,\" Catt said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,\" Maria said, half honestly, \"If I was half your size I wouldn't show myself in public until I was back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just think some things are more important than,\" Catt winced again, holding her tummy and having to shift her feet to avoid stumbling, \"Uhg.  More important than being the prettiest girl in the room,\" she glared at Maria.  Catt was aware she could be vain, but Maria with Maria it was one of the defining characteristics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was obviously somewhat annoyed that she wasn't able to bother Catt more than she was.  Then a light lit up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.  Why don't you present the award with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt stammered, \"I don't know about that . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?  We make a great team, and it's only for a few minutes.  What are you afraid of?  Oh, I'm sure it's harder to walk up stairs, not being able to see your feet must be a pain, but I promise to slow down to let you keep up with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt just glared at her.  She had already proven that she could be in public like this, and do her job like this, but she was the end of her rope.  She just wanted to lie down and pass out until it was over.  She rubbed her back, feeling it ache with the weight pulling every bone in her spine forward.  She shifted her legs.  Her hips were getting painfully sore.  And the editing and audio awards were always the last thing to be given out.  It'd be hours from now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Maria turned to the camera crew as she stood next to Catt in profile, \"And let's get a good shot of us together.  It'll be fun,\" she said, making sure her slim body lined up exactly with Catt's now massive one.  \"So, what do you think, Catt?  Are you up for it?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through a forced smile, Catt agreed.  \"I would <i>love</i> to join you on stage, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked surprised, but not displeased.  \"Oh, great!  Come on, let's get backstage.  I'll bet you'd like to get off your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, it'll just make it harder to, er, stand . . . back . . . \" Catt let the sentence trail off as she saw Maria's face brighten at that.  Catt waddled after Maria, directing her to come along.  They had to go down some narrow halls once inside, and Catt found it impossible to let anyone pass.  People made way for her, though.  She was breathing heavily when they reached the waiting area backstage.  Catt wanted to bend down and rest her hands on her knees, but her enormous belly prevented any action that could be remotely acrobatic.  She rubbed her stomach gently, unable to fully reach around to the front.  Maria seemed to appear out of nowhere, although she was standing next to her the whole time.  Maria once again reached over and pressed her hand into Catt's belly.  The ceaseless activity inside lessened.  Catt closed her eyes and breathed a sigh of relief.  She still felt wiggling, and churning, and soft movements of all sorts, but they slackened, no longer threatening to knock her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes, an almost pleasant expression on her face.  She saw Maria looking right into her eyes wearing yet another triumphant grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>enjoying</i> this?\" she asked, rubbing her belly a little harder before taking her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt's temper flared before she could stop herself.  \"Shut the hell up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria seemed startled, but looked pleased again.  It was killing Catt how much Maria was enjoying this.  Catt was uncomfortable, humiliated, and enormous, and everything she did was making Maria's day.  Catt wished she hadn't agreed to present the award.  She wished she just let her better sense prevail and called it a night.  She already proved her point.  Now and for the next hour her whole existence would be making Maria feel good about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt tried hard not to look at all the beautiful people passing her by.  Their dresses looked so lovely on them, whereas hers felt tight somehow.  It seemed impossible that she could still be growing, but she knew the signs.  The fabric along the side of her belly was noticeably tighter.  At the start of the evening, her popped belly button was only somewhat visible beneath her dress, now it stood out like a tight bulb.  She didn't care anymore that she couldn't keep her hands from massaging her belly.  Anything to stop the constant movements inside her from getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like a lifetime, Maria and Catt were up.  Maria started walking, but Catt stopped, holding her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, wait, wait--\" she said between breaths.  It was the tightening feeling again.  Maria looked back and flashed her biggest, prettiest, nastiest smile yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting,\" she said as the pain passed.  Catt followed, and just before they left the curtain, Maria turned behind her and said in a deceptively sweet voice, \"In case I don't get a chance to say this later, Catt, you have no idea how happy seeing you as a big, waddling ball of fat has made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt glared, and wanted to shout something about it being uncalled for, and rude, and pretty pointless considering how Maria had made her pleasure at seeing Catt so pregnant pretty obviously.  But she didn't.  She knew enough about Maria that it was obviously just one last thing to get her to loose her cool, as if she didn't feel awful enough going on stage like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her head high and refusing to take Maria's bait, Catt followed Maria one stage.  Maria didn't wait for her, she walked right up to the microphone and then turned as Catt struggled to keep up.  As she stopped next to her, her belly bumped the microphone stand, nearly toppling it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" she said loudly, was Maria grabbed it.  Maria looked sweetly/evily at her as she opened the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is always an honor to present these awards to the fine men and women behind the scenes, the ones who we couldn't do our jobs without, and who make us look so good in the process,\" she turned to Catt with that.  Catt started to speak, but Maria cut her off by flipping open the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nominees are . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt winced, holding her belly tightly.  She tried not to make it obvious, but a quiet wave of sound through the crowd told her that some of them noticed.  She felt the churning inside her spike, her skin stinging, as her belly then settled down as quickly as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria apparently didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner for best editing in a drama is . . . Ralph Sporkleman for 'Don't Eat My Omelette!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as the elderly Sporkleman made his way to the stage.  Catt clapped too, knowing it looked award with how she had to hold her elbows at an angle to avoid her belly and breasts.  As the old man began climbing the stairs, Catt felt another stinging around her stomach.  She grabbed her sides, an audible \"ooooo\" escaping her right into the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria just chuckled politely and touched her belly as she brushed passed her to hand the trophy to the infamous editor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, young lady!\" he said, but was interrupted as a loud ripping sound was caught in the microphone.  Catt wobbled backwards, holding the side of her dress with one hand, the other hand not long enough to reach around to help.  She turned to the left to try to hide it, but pulling so hard caused her left side to tear as well, her soft, white sides in plain view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-wha?\" the editor, confused, stuttered.  Maria clapped her hands over her mouth to hide her glee over this scene.  Catt didn't even wait long enough to save face.  She was already walking-or waddling-in a hurried pace off the stage, down the stairs, and passed her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome actors backstage approached her to show some sympathy, but Catt would have none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" she told her crew, sounding more authoritative than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the van, Catt could finally rest.  She leaned back, holding her belly, watching it tower over her.  She playfully tugged at the town sides of her dress.  How could she have gotten even bigger?  Walking out she even felt heavier, and she didn't think that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt sighed, and turned to one of the crew, who had been mostly silent the whole time.  She could sense fear in them.  Catt could be hard to deal with, and sometimes temperamental, at the best of the times.  They did not want to risk a hugely pregnant Catt's wrath.  Somehow, this thought made Catt smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that didn't look too bad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" one of the crew-Tim, or Tom, or something-said.  \"I still think the dress looks good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt patted him on the shoulder and laughed in a friendly way.  The entire crew looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously, anyway we can find that footage and edit me out of it before anyone sees it?  Oh, right.  Live.\"  Catt closed her eyes, surprised by how not horrified she was.  She was definitely embarrassed, and would be even more so the next time she saw Maria, but honestly she was just too tired and exhausted from a hard day's work to think about it right now.  And anyways, she had still shown she could do her job even if her body was getting more out of hand every day.  That's more than she could say for Maria.  Maria would have been committed to a mental hospital after she started looking bloated the first day.  Catt could take some solace at least in that thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later, while lying on the couch eating a large variety of ordered junk food, Catt did start to feel embarrassed for herself.  Clips of her giant belly ripping her dress while Maria barely concealed her delight were everywhere.  Shots of her wide ass waddling off stage didn't help.  <i>How am I still even able to walk?</i> Catt thought, rubbing her gurgling belly.  She hadn't seen shots of her since she had gotten this big.  It was ridiculous she could still move around as well as she could.  Her legs were thicker and her hips wider, but they didn't seem big enough to handle the load her belly-and to a lesser extend her now globular breasts-must be putting on them.  And she wasn't done yet, she thought, growing depressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a short work for Catt.  Kevin didn't have to insist, Catt just got too tired from moving her massive self around.  She was also feeling more self-conscious than ever, forced to wear what amounted to an unflattering mu mu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Catt, I'm sure there must be <i>something</i> that looks good on you even at your size,\" Maria had unhelpfully said.  She was back in the studio now, and Catt did her best to avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay six arrived, having seen Catt lay stationary in bed, watching TV, only getting up for Dr. Anderson's visit late the night before.  Everything was healthy, although Catt could have done without the comments about how much bigger she was than Jennifer at this stage.  When Catt woke up in the next morning, she experienced her first actual moment of fear in a few days since this whole thing started.  The necklace had done an excellent job of keeping her calm despite her constantly changing body, but it faltered as Catt found herself worried she wouldn't be able to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke with her back already in pain, her belly looming up several feet above her.  Ripples and bumps moved across the taut surface.  She moaned, massaging what she could reach.  The movement no longer concerned her, but it was getting more uncomfortable.  She tried to turn to her side, her now normal method for getting up, and found that she couldn't.  She felt panic in the pit of her stomach.  She rocked herself back and forth, the effort causing her to break out in a sweat.  She planted her arms firmly on the bed and tried to arch her back to give it some momentum and found that her stomach had gotten so heavy she couldn't even do that.  She growled in frustration, a growl that turned into a short scream as the babies inside her began kicking worse than ever, causing her to briefly think she might finally burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many tries, Catt turned to her side, the bed creaking in protest.  Her belly stuck out from the edge of it.  Catt could feel herself slipping to the floor.  She tried to stop herself, but in the end allowed herself to fall, her legs bracing her impact, and wound up kneeling on the ground next to her bed, her giant, round belly supporting her on the floor.  She grabbed the nightstand and, very slowly, her face red from exertion, lifted herself to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt wobbled, spreading her already aching legs.  As she rested her hands on her back she moved them down to feel her ass must have grown even more, and whimpered a little at the realization.  She slowly went to the prepare, then stopped as she looked at the open door of her rather large closet, lined with clothes that were a reminder of how small and sexy she was just a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is going to fit!\" she said out loud as the implication hit her.  And when she said nothing, she meant nothing.  Yesterday was a stretch, but now, she didn't there would be any clothes in the world that would fit her.  A specialty bra might be able to contain her breasts, and there were probably pants she could get to accommodate her lower half, but there was no way anything would cover her belly.  It took up most of her body, and must account for more than half her weight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all,\" she muttered to herself, wondering what she was going to do.  The thought of staying home until it was over, which everyone she spoke with had suggested, briefly occurred to her.  But no, she couldn't back down now.  After the initial shame of being seen blowing like this had mostly passed she wasn't going to let it defeat her.  Even having to endure Maria, who had made it a point to be at the studio rather than out on assignments, would be better than admitting defeat.  But what could she do?  Even if she was willing to, she couldn't go out naked, which right now seemed to be her only option.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catt knew there would be stares.  She knew that even though a lot of the crew were kind of scared of they they wouldn't be able to suppress some laughing, or at least smirking, at her expense.  She wished more than ever that she could affect a sexy, confident walk like she could when she was thin and graceful.  Instead, she lumbered, her mammoth belly leading the way several feet in front of her, while her also giant ass lagged behind her.  She did her best to hold her head high even though she was wearing less clothes than she had ever gone out in public in.  Catt had been so proud to not ask for help and to insist on going to work that she put together the only outfit she could find that would fit: a bikini top large enough to cover up her swollen breasts, and a knee-length, stretchy skirt that she didn't even remember having and which rested completely underneath her belly, which was fully bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, she felt ridiculous and huge.  On the other, she dared anyone to comment on her.  She couldn't remember if Maria would be on set today.  Catt almost wished she would be.  Being uncomfortable, tired, aching, and enormous made her want to lash out at somebody, and Maria would be a perfectly acceptable target.  It would even look sympathetic.  Many around the studio, according to gossip columns and twitter posts, came to her defense somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pregnant, what's she going to do?\" somebody had said in response to posted images of her fleeing the stage in her ripped dress.  Of course they had no idea how many she was pregnant with.  Catt found it best to ignore that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the constant movements inside her made it impossible.  There was always something going on in her belly, and if any more than one or two started acting up she would have to stop walking.  For the first time she actually had to sit down when that happened.  Otherwise she would be knocked over.  If all of them were acting up, Catt would start to panic.  It felt like a hoard of aliens inside her trying to get out, and made her stomach feel like it would burst open.  Which is exactly what happened just as she got to set, bare-bellied and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not now, come on,\" she said out loud as bumps and ripples began traversing her globe of a belly.  She started rubbing it and sat down in the chair on set, her eyes closed.  It was starting to go beyond discomfort and into pain when this happened now.  It wasn't just the taut skin, it was the way it jerked her spin forward and to the side, and compressed her hips and lungs in rapid spurts of kicking.  Catt moaned, releasing a pathetic whine despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you something, Ms. Saddler?\" one of the interns was suddenly next to her.  She was a young, wide-eyed girl with an enviously petite figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water and food,\" Catt said, opening her eyes as the movements subsided after several minutes.  Before the girl could ask what kind of food, Catt said, \"Any food.  I mean, look at me, do you think I'm picky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave a really awkward laugh and then rushed off.  Catt felt pretty good about that interaction as she looked to the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at the crew, she suddenly realized she had no idea what was on the schedule for today.  This was another thing Catt just couldn't get a handle on.  She completely forgot Maria would be at the awards, and now couldn't remember if she was even interviewing anyone today, or covering anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I do have a schedule today, right?\" she looked around at the crew.  She saw that they were actually not preparing for immediately starting shooting, which was good.  Was Catt early?  She rubbed her temples.  She was getting a head ache and still had no idea what, if anything, was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, those in charge did step forward.  Yes, Catt was relieved to find, she was actually quite early despite how long it took her to get dressed and get to the set.  They had only scheduled a rundown for her today, and for tomorrow for that matter.  Those were easy, quick affairs, just her summarizing Hollywood news and explaining other interviews and coverage that would happen later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Catt was relieved.  The less she was on camera the better, both because she found any action difficult to do for more than a few seconds, and because while she had gotten past the initial embarrassment she really wanted to get her giant body out of eyesight as fast as she could.  With at least an hour before they'd be ready for her, Catt waddled to her dressing room and sat catching up on celebrity news while interns brought her food.  Her belly had been so full of other activities and sensations that she almost had forgotten how hungry she was.  Several interns made several trips while Catt effortless wolfed down the food set at her side.  When it came time to go out to the set, she felt quite sated and unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt wobbled in her seat, her muscles straining on the arm rests.  That new skinny intern started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Catt said, her face turning red with embarrassment and exhaustion, \"Can you . . . help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure, Ms. Saddler,\" the girl said.  She took both of Catt's arms, having to lean over and into Catt's belly to do so, and pulled as hard as she could.  To both of their surprise, Catt did come up, although it was clearly an effort on both their parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Catt said, smiling gratefully.  The intern murmered a response but left quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt went to set, having read and, hopefully, memorized the whole two minutes of news she had to do.  She wondered if they would focus on her top and let her belly be out of the shot.  Not that it would be that much better.  The only reason she could forget about how bloated her face had gotten was because she was intentionally avoiding looking in any mirrors for too long.  Her hands alternated between rubbing her aching, now fleshy back and her belly.  It looked like she was itching all over.  Small spurts of growth pains shot up all over her belly every few minutes.  She wasn't going to think about that, but she was knew what it was: she was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to stand or sit for this?\" one of the stage hands asked as the makeup people flocked to Catt.  <i>Oops,</i> Catt thought, <i>Forgot makeup.  Guess there's not a lot they can do for me now, though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt always did this standing up.  It would be weird to be sitting.  No, she'd do it standing, and it'd be over in a few minutes.  They she could sit.  She wanted to tell them that sitting was only slightly more comfortable than standing, but thought she had complained enough today about her condition to the interns.  If she was trying to project unbeatable confidence by continuing to come to work despite approaching full term with sixteen babies and wearing next to nothing, complaining wasn't going to help that image.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course I'll stand,\" Catt said, trying not to sound snide.  The crew continued to set up while Catt stood stock still in the middle of the studio.  She felt like a parade float and that everyone was gawking at her standing there, legs spread wide, constantly rubbing her giant belly.  Every moment a slow, heavy movement inside caused her feet to shift.  She wobbled, unsteady, trying hard not to let her concern show on her face.  An intern handed her the run down for the day, and then politely took it back after Catt had read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Catt, one, two, three . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt flashed a bright smile and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Catt Saddler and you are watching E! Hollywood News.  Tonight, we'll be discussing, uh, aaah,\" Catt paused as a spurt of pain and a hard, leftward kick caused her to step a few inches to the left to keep standing, \"discussing a star we thought had left acting behind for good--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had to stop and grab her enormous belly tightly.  A wave of bumps spread over the giant, tight sphere and sent her a few steps backward.  Some stagehands rushed to her, but she waved them back, then waved to keep rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, ah, uh-\" Catt tried again, but this time a series of well-timed kicks sent her to the right a few steps.  She felt her aching legs giving way, her hips too wide to gracefully maneuver.  With an angry groan, Catt allowed herself to gently fall to the floor, letting her now soft ass cushion her fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew, who had looked on with morbid interest at the shapes moving across her belly, rushed to help her up.  Catt accepted, refusing to snap at anyone for her own clumsiness.  <i>How could I not be clumsy?</i> she thought, looking down at the swollen parody of herself her body had become.  She grimaced, not sure whether to laugh or cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'll do it sitting down,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be safest that way,\" came Maria's familiar voice.  She was leaning near the back of the set, smirking melodramatically, her arms crossed.  Catt's face flashed bright red as she forced herself to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not as easy as it looks, Maria,\" Catt said as the crew moved the chair into position for her to lower herself into.  \"You should try it some time,\" she added as though it were a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria started to leave, but first laughed and threw back one last burn before she did so, \"No thanks.  And you're crazy if you think I could ever get to your size, no matter how many I was carrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt let it go with a dismissive wave.  Now that she was leaving, Catt was glad she wasn't let Maria get to her.  Actually seeing her did sting somewhat, but her words didn't have the effect she wanted.  Catt was not comfortable at her size by any means, but Maria wasn't making her feel any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's take this from the-aaaaaah-the top,\" Catt said as another wave of squirming sent her into a full minute of closing her eyes and massaging her stomach until it calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they were unable to get a full, decent take.  Catt's belly was simply too active.  Even when she did manage to get a full sentence out she forgot what she was saying and repeated it.  Her body and brain were conspiring to make this the worst work day yet, and she had just torn a dress on live television in front of millions of people just the night before last.  Catt thought they'd have to edit it together to make it look like she wasn't a complete idiot who forgot how to read a simple celebrity news report.  She was having doubts about how she'd fare the rest of the day, and if she really should just sequester herself at home until this was all over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Catt could even heave herself to her feet to call it a day, Kevin arrived with an expectant look on his face.  Catt knew exactly what it meant, but couldn't figure out why.  It was the expression he had when things were going good and he was about to suggest more, but lucrative, work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Catt said, shortly but as politely as she could muster.  She winced and rubbed a large spot on her belly that was feeling particularly active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're up for an interview?  It'll be a quick one,\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt sighed very loudly.  \"With who?  And why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll work out the details later, but I think your pregnancy is improving your image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt glared at him.  \"Which <i>part</i> of my image?\" she spread her arms around her belly.  She looked trapped under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin chuckled, then continued, \"We think people are thinking of you more sympathetically than they were after the whole Jennifer Lawrence thing.  So we'd like to milk it, er, no pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Catt looked confused, then looked down at her huge, swollen breasts, and once again glared at Kevin.  Still, she smiled a little.  Catt didn't court popularity exactly, but she wasn't fond of being actively disliked.  \"Okay, who am I interviewing with and for how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have Megan Fox coming in.  You'll just ask her about her new Michael Bay nonsense movie and that'll be that.  Maria was going to interview her but I think you'll be a better fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt couldn't hide her glee at hearing that.  Then, a thought occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, isn't she pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah.  About due, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how big is she?\" Catt asked, her eyes flashing with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh,\" Kevin started.  Catt rarely saw Kevin flustered, \"Well, obviously, smaller than you . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Catt rolled her eyes, although the frustration building in her was much less powerful than during their argument a few days before.  \"So how much fatter will I look than her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ask a few questions, you two being pregnant won't even come up,\" Kevin said, his strict producer tone returning as he turned to stride away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to get Maria to stand behind us in a bikini, too?\" Catt muttered after him, only depressing herself at the thought.  It was hard enough getting used to all the pain and discomfort of her body growing so quickly, and it was even harder doing so in front of millions of viewers, but the hardest part for Catt was having to accept that she was actually jealous of another person's body.  Despite all evidence to the contrary, Catt still thought of herself as the beautiful, rail-thin woman she was merely a week ago, and the idea that she wouldn't be the only one comparing herself to others was a blow she hadn't expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kevin was gone, and some stagehands helped Catt up into make-up again (she had sweated quite a bit despite her little clothing), Catt was looking at the bright side.  Megan was fun for short interviews, she knew.  She could ask a couple of mindless fluff questions and get something that was either inconsequential or else hilarious and dumb.  And who knows?  Maybe pregnancy was treating Megan as bad as it was treating Catt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck, Catt realized immediately upon Megan Fox's arrival.  Catt wasn't the only one who thought Megan had a sort of \"trashiness\" that detracted from her otherwise obvious attractiveness, but she was always mindful that she had a fantastic body.  Somehow, despite being unable to show her trademark abs, she still looked sexy pregnant.  She walked without a waddle, could wear jeans that still looked good, and even though she was quite far along her belly didn't appear overly large on her.  Catt suppressed a growl as Megan walked onto set, straight towards her, then stood with her hands on her hips expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Catt,\" she said, glancing around, friendly but not overly enthusiastic.  It took Catt a moment to realize Megan expected her to stand and greet her.  With a grunt, Catt pressed her hands on the armrests of her chair and was instantly seized by wave of churning inside her enormous belly.  She shut her eyes and grabbed it, feeling wave after wave of bump rise and fall all over the surface of her taut skin.  When she opened her eyes after it subsided she looked up to find a vaguely startled look on Megan's otherwise blank face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she said, stepping back, then blurted out, \"Uhg.\"  She rubbed her own belly under her sleek, stylish maternity shirt.  \"This is no fun being pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt sighed, a little relieved.  Megan patted her belly, visibly blushing.  This surprised Catt, who attempted to sit up straight while the crew prepared to shoot around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not,\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like, I thought I had it rough,\" Megan said.  Catt's heart sank as Megan looked her up and down, \"Like, didn't you used to be, you know, really <i>thin</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said the word \"thin\" like it possessed magical qualities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am carrying more than one, you know,\" Catt said.  She neglected to say how many more than one.  The necklace around her neck glowed softly.  The last two days it had been tasking itself more than ever, so much so that when too many people were looking at her, or when she felt like her body couldn't take any more, Catt could actually feel it growing warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding?\" Megan said, not sarcastically, but not apologetically, either.  She glanced around, not really paying attention to what she was saying.  \"I think I'd, like, shoot myself if I got any bigger than I am.\"  She rubbed her belly again, and blushed brightly as if the very act of acknowledging it was a huge embarrassment to her.  \"Uhg,\" she repeated with a shudder.  At least Catt could console herself that she wasn't that shallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of movements inside her belly threatened to knock Catt out of her chair.  She yelped loudly this time, causing Megan to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're rolling when you're ready,\" came the director's voice.  Catt realized she didn't know what she was going to ask.  She had no idea what the new Megan Fox movie was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, I must look really tiny . . . \" Megan started to say with a sudden smile, then trailed off when she saw Catt's expression.  \"So, we starting now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview was not quite the fiasco as Catt's solo reading.  Sure, she completely forgot what she was supposed to be talking about, but that was easy to cover.  She just asked Megan about her latest project.  Then she sat back, offering a few \"That sounds great\" and \"How did that work?\" lines while Megan replied with generic statements about how good the movie was going to be, and also implied the director was a jerk and her co-stars annoying.  Catt normally liked to lean in on leads like that.  It made good sound bites, and good viewing.  But today she just didn't have the energy.  After only five minutes of talking, Catt felt another wave of pressure building her belly, and knew in seconds it look become alive with bumps moving in and out with enough force to move the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . but I'm going to take some time off to, you know, spend with the baby,\" Megan said, finishing up, \"And get back into shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we all know how important both of those are,\" Catt said with a light laugh.  Megan smiled faintly but didn't laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard it gets harder the older you are, so I'm glad I got at least one out of the way before I was thirty.  If I was forty, or something, I'd probably get so big I'd never be thin again,\" Megan looked Catt over and then continued, with no hint of the intention to insult in her voice.  Catt was just glad Maria wasn't there to rub it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all we have time for today.  Thank you for coming today, Megan,\" Catt turned her head--since the rest of her could only move with extreme difficulty--towards the camera, \"This is Catt Saddler with E! Hollywood News.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Catt watched Megan effortlessly stand and walk away even with her pregnant belly sticking out like that, Catt realized enough was enough.  She proved her point.  She showed that she wasn't going to let being pregnant suddenly with sixteen babies keep her down.  She even showed up to work dressed in the most revealing outfit she had ever been seen in public in, and this when there was more of her than had ever been seen by anyone.  She would go to Kevin right away and tell him that she was finally taking maternity leave.  Even if she was pregnant for just one more day, that was one day more than she wanted to be in the public eye in her state.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cat didn't so much waddle anymore, she realized as her sore legs carried her slowly to Kevin's office, she lumbered now.  Slowly, carefully, she took each step with her hands firmly planted on her sides, every step putting her in danger of falling over.  She was very self conscious of the fact that her belly, bulbous naval leading the way, entered the room well before she did.  By the time she was completely in Kevin's office he was already looking into her tired face with one eye still on his screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt, glad you came up here.  Could you take a seat?\" he said.  He obviously wanted something, Catt, thought, but not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" she said between breaths.  \"I'm finally taking your advice.  I proved whatever point I was trying to make in the first place and I'm going to take some time off.  I don't know if the babies are coming tomorrow, or the next day, or,\" she shuddered, rubbing her belly as bulges began moving across the surface painfully, \"or longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stood up with pursed lips, and walked towards Catt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you earned it.  But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, whatever you're going to say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a hit pregnant, Catt,\" Kevin said, turning his monitor around to show Catt something.  She ignored it.  \"People love how you're putting yourself out there.  They almost forgot the fiasco with Jennifer Lawrence and, ah, some of your other more insulting times with other actors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then I can take a break at a high point and come back when I can actually move like a normal human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear me out, Catt,\" Kevin said.  Catt at him, but let him continue.  \"Maybe just give us another couple of days, okay?  We'll bring in maybe a Lamaze instructor and you two can do some of that, you can talk with a nutritionist-what was her name again?-about what you're eating to stay in shape-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Catt said, surprising herself even.  The sudden sound caused another uproar inside her.  Kevin continued while she winced, rubbing her stomach, struggling to stay standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and you can talk about what you're going through, how it feels.  You have to admit, this isn't the usual pregnancy.\"  After Kevin said that, he gave Catt a strange look.  Catt felt the necklace glow around her neck.  She had gotten used to it doing that more and more lately, becoming warm to the touch.  Whatever influence it was having on making people overlook the absurdity of how huge she got so quickly was waning as her body was struggling to stay together.  She glared at him.  Kevin shook his head and continued.  \"You can't tell me that doesn't sound like something you wouldn't be interested in, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt thought about it.  She was exhausted, emotionally and physically, and was finding it hard to believe she'd ever want to do anything but lie in bed and sleep until this was over.  But the idea that she would be, however briefly, the subject of attention rather than the one calling attention to others appealed to her.  She wouldn't want to be so thoroughly in the spotlight all the time, but for a little while, maybe, would be nice.  She had just appeared on TV with her huge, round body almost completely exposed to the world, and if she could do that there's nothing else that could embarrass her about this anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, now I'm just tempting fate,</i> she thought, but cut off her own train of thought before she could contemplate other ways to humiliate herself.  Kevin eagerly awaited her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Just one day, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make it worthwhile,\" Kevin said, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with a few conditions.  First of all, don't put me next to any hot thin pregnant women who barely gained any weight at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, try to avoid putting me next to any hot thin women at all if you can,\" she added with a smile and a knowing pat on the expanse of her belly.  \"And see if you can get Maria to do one of those celebrity-eats-junk-food-for-a-month-to-live-like-a-normal-person things like Claire Sweeney did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'll try,\" Kevin said, although he had an expression like that would actually be a pretty good idea, if impossible to convince Maria to even consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then set it up, send me the run down, and I'll see you tomorrow then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  Thank you, Catt.  I know I rag on your sometimes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt waved him away, but smiled.  \"Going home, Kevin.  See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Catt, very slowly and awkwardly as she was used to now, left Kevin's office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Anderson kept his nodding and mmm's to a minimum as he examined Catt, who seemed to have a sarcastic response to everything he said.  She had set herself up in a large and comfortable recliner in her living room, although she couldn't imagine ever feeling comfortable again.  The chair, for all its sturdiness, creaked under her weight, and no matter how much low she turned the air conditioning down she was boiling.  Even if clothes big enough to cover her belly existed she wouldn't wear them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson began packing up his equipment.  A few times during the exam he noticed the necklace glowing brightly around Catt's neck, which always followed by a particularly fierce movement within her.  They were always moving a little now, all sixteen of them, but they had spurts of activity strong enough to hurt every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Catt, believe it or not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I'm completely healthy,\" Catt rolled her eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have imagined your blood pressure at least would be heightened, if only from the stress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stress?\" Catt shot back.  She would have followed it with a long list of complaints, but suddenly found herself too worn out to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevertheless, I think working at all from here on out would be a bad idea.  Jennifer wasn't half the size you are, and by this point she was practically bedridden.  It was a miracle she could move at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt shuddered at that comment while her hands traced large circles on her giant belly.  It more than dominated her body now, it practically <i>was</i> her body.  Her arms and legs were thicker now but compared to the giant dome her stomach had become they looked almost spindly.  She distinctly remembered watching Jennifer Lawrence expand and her own feelings of joy at seeing the hot young star's figure ruined so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not half the size of me?\" Catt said, staring at her knob-like naval, too distant to reach.  \"I guess the jokes on me, then, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson ignored her as he prepared to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could give birth tomorrow.  Or even tonight.  I want you to call me the minute anything starts to feel strange . . . er.  And please, don't try to exert yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt glared at him.  \"Okay, Doc.  I promise.  No exertion.  And you'll be the first to know if anything happens.\"  Catt found herself faltering around the word 'labor,' and refused to even think it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Dr. Anderson left.  He left the door unlocked at Catt's request.  Before passing out she managed to eat a family's worth of Chinese delivery.  Even with all the food she didn't manage to feel full, but at least she could sleep as the TV played before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt didn't bother to set an alarm, even though she vowed to get to work in the morning.  She awoke to the motions in her stomach, rocking her back and forth in her chair.  She reached out and gripped what she could of her belly tightly with a soft moan.  Her hips groaned under her even while sitting.  She felt bigger again, heavier even.  And looking down revealed that the painfully swollen feeling in her breasts wasn't just in her head.  She had swelled enough to tear at the make-shift shirt/bra she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be even bigger?\" she said quietly as she attempted to stand, knowing it would be a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt grunted and tried to sit up.  She didn't budge.  She tried swaying herself to the right, then the left, to get some momentum.  It was no use.  With frustration building, she reached down and lowered the foot rest of her chair.  It worked, but that only put the weight of her belly onto her now thick thighs.  She started to feel panic rising within her, then the warm glow of the necklace.  She calmed down, or rather, her panic switched to annoyance.  Five days ago this would have sent her into a nervous breakdown.  Two days ago into a rage.  But now, the cry of frustration was mixed with some humor as she threw her head back at the realization.  She didn't even think about what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin,\" she said into her cell phone, finding her voice surprisingly soft.  Speaking was getting as difficult as breathing at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt, what's wrong?\" Kevin answered immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck,\" Catt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you're stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Catt paused to try to speak at her full volume, \"I can't get up.  I'm . . . I'm too big to stand up on my own.  Can you get over here and help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send some interns over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, you come.  It's bad enough walking around the crew like this, I don't want a bunch of interns trying to lift me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause on the other end.  Catt could see Kevin contemplating if taking the trouble to drive over and pick her up personally was worth whatever buzz they could get from the humongous Catt doing yoga and discussing her pregnancy diet.  Apparently, he decided in her favor, and agreed to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was there in fifteen minutes, during which time Catt could only stare helpless at the TV.  She was really starting to loath watching attractive celebrities strut around on their own accord without a bloated belly holding them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin entered without knocking, apparently assuming Catt wouldn't be able to tell him to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Catt said, craning her neck around, \"I mean it.  What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was holding up what looked like his dry cleaning, only what was under the plastic was clearly too big to be anything he owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had wardrobe search around for this.  It wasn't easy.  I figured you might not want to go bare-bellied again,\" he said, unwrapping the garment, which turned out to be a long, blue dress.  The top, with thin shoulder straps and with a cut that should show minimal cleavage, was tasteful enough, but the bottom billowed out like a tent.  Catt smirked.  She was glad for it, as she hadn't actually considered if she could wear what she wore yesterday again.  But at the same time she cringed thinking of how Kevin must have described what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, it's great.  Can you help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin rubbed his hands together and braced himself.  Grabbing Catt's arms didn't help.  Her belly was too big to allow him to grab both at once and still stand in front of her.  He would up getting behind the chair, and reaching under her to hoist her upward.  Only after she was standing on her wobbly, swollen feet, did Catt suddenly blush brightly at Kevin.  He didn't exactly look like he enjoyed grabbing her ass and thighs just now, though.  She thought about making a snarky comment about how he bet he wished he could have done that a week ago, but thought better of it.  He looked impatient, and only a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me get that thing on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt wouldn't describe herself as remotely elegant anymore, but the dress was at least tasteful.  She actually always liked showing off her arms, feeling they were one of her better features, but now thought they looked more like sausages swollen as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Catt said, adjusting the dress around her breasts.  As big as it was, it was still too tight there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt began walking, or waddling, towards the door.  The necklace glowed, and grew almost hot.  She stopped in her tracks, grabbing a table to steady herself and her belly with her other hand.  Her insides heaved in one large, round motion, as if moving first down, then back, then forward again.  Her belly rumbled, and then quickly grew tighter.  A long moan escaped Catt's lips despite herself.  Her whole body shuddered, but her belly vibrated violently, causing the dress to flow around her like curtains blowing in a strong wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt?  What's wrong?\" Kevin rushed over to her and grabbed her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh . . .\" was all Catt could say.  She winced, the discomfort turning to pain.  Then, as if it were just a cramp, it stopped, her whole body returning to its usual level of discomfort.  \"Just gas, I think.  Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

It was a slow walk into the studio but Kevin stuck with her.  Catt showed her appreciation by not biting his head off.  She wanted to lash out at everyone, though.  Maybe not viciously, but at least sarcastically.  She knew she'd be justified.  After all, she was already winded before they even entered the building, and it was already hard to breath with what felt like twice her own weight pushing up against her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay?\" Kevin asked.  Catt knew she must look as exhausted as she felt.  The mere act of walking was a massive chore now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Catt said.  \"But I'll be fine.  Just a few hours, right?\" Catt stopped again, holding onto the wall.  She felt her belly vibrating again, growing tighter, heavier even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catt?\" Kevin said, steadying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Catt tried to speak.  The sensation grew painful.  \"Aaaah,\" she winced, clenching her teeth while she grasped her belly.  It didn't seem possible, but it felt even tighter, like it must burst.  Then, as quickly as it came, the feeling subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.  I really don't know what my body's doing anymore,\" Catt smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Catt snapped.  \"I got this, Kevin.  Just some yoga classes, talking with nutritionists, right?  Easy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnancy yoga instructor, star of many home videos for the pregnant woman wishing to stay in shape, was Liz Pelting.  Catt vaguely recalled seeing her before.  She looked even slimmer, more fit, and younger in person.  Catt instantly hated her, especially how buoyant and happy she acted.  She took Catt's sweaty, swollen hands and practically bounced with excitement when meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Catt,\" she said, her smile taking up half her face, \"I almost didn't recognize you!  How many are you carrying?  Five?  Six?  That's just incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz proceeded to rub her hands all over Catt's enormous belly, pressing and prodding it, all the while wearing the most sincerely friendly expression Catt had ever seen on somebody she wanted to punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just do this,\" Catt said, waddling past her after finally getting her hands away.  Kevin gave her a look that said 'be nice.'  At least, Catt thought forcing herself to warm up to Liz, the woman didn't seem put off by her size, even if she was amazed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt went through the motions of introducing her guest, explaining what they were doing, and generally letting Liz do most of the talking.  She wished Liz would stop grabbing her belly, though.  It was tender to the touch and even her flowing dress touching her skin wasn't pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are some basic exercises you can show us?\" Catt said, her most realistic fake smile on her puffy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't we sit down and we'll show the audience,\" Liz beamed at the camera.  She plopped to the floor, her legs spread out.  She looked up at Catt, who gaped at her.  Very slowly, Catt tried to sit down.  Every attempt to move her legs caused her to wobble, almost falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, can you maybe help me out here?\" Catt said, after the yoga instructor looked at her dumbly, waiting for her to sit.  Apparently it didn't occur to her that somebody as huge as Catt would need help getting to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Liz jumped up without missing a beat.  As she took Catt around the shoulder, Catt almost doubled over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh-wait, wait,\" Catt said, grabbing her belly in both hands.  The tightness returned, greater than before.  She felt her whole, massive belly strain like it was being filled up even more.  Liz struggled to keep her standing.  There was a loud growl from inside her and, as the ever-presents movements ceased for just a moment, Catt's entire belly seemed to move lower.  She yelped loudly, the weight pulled her down.  Fortunately Liz was there to lower her gently.  Her face now serious and her voice quiet, Liz whispered in Catt's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt nodded as the pressure in her belly lessened.  She now sat, trapped on the floor, her belly between her legs and resting heavily on the floor.  The necklace glowed and then faded.  Looking at herself, and at Liz, and the cameras, Catt suddenly felt small spurts of panic shooting through her much as the ripples moved across the surface of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, Liz, what's a good way to begin?\" Catt said, wiping some sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anderson knocked for five minutes before giving up.  Catt wasn't answering her phone or her door.  As her doctor, he was worried.  She was ready to pop last night.  If she had gone into labor during the night, he had no idea what could have happened.  It was unlikely she remembered that she'd have to take off the necklace for the labor to commence.  She could be trapped in agony, helplessly stuck under her belly, unable to give birth or call out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinking feeling, Dr. Anderson explored around the house, listening.  He heard nothing, and the doors were all locked.  Catt's car was there, too.  But then, she wouldn't drive herself if she left.  He couldn't get in, and if she wasn't here the only place she could be was the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Catt,\" Dr. Anderson muttered, as he headed for her studio.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz, looking worried, began speaking but the words were quickly lost on Catt.  Her mind was foggy.  Her breathing grew heavy and rhythmic.  She was sitting on the ground, her arms back holding her up, while inside her massive belly the movements were growing stronger, more forceful, ripping her dress and shaking her body.  Soon, her breathing had grown so heavy she couldn't ignore it.  Swear dripped from her forehead.  She brushed it off, almost falling on her back in the process.  The next thing she knew, Liz was leaning over her, one hand on her giant, pulsating belly.  Only now did Catt become away that the steadily tightening sensation was approaching painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands off me,\" Catt snarled between breaths as Liz pressed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz ignored her, \"She's going into labor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt tried to reach up and push Liz away but was incapable.  Her breathing was so heavy talking became almost impossible, but she managed to force out a few works as her belly rose towards her breasts and then struck downward into her hips.  She screamed and fell back, \"No!\" she yelled, then clarified as the world went out of focus and voices rising around her competed with the gyrating mass her belly had become.  \"Not labor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done this before.  Quick, get some towels, or blankets, some-\" but Liz's instructions to the transfixed crew were interrupted by Catt falling on her back, her knees going up and spreading in a birthing position.  She hadn't meant to do this, and with her belly wouldn't have been able to, but much as her breathing was out of control her body seemed to be taking charge.  She yelped, twisting her head around, trying to make sense of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glowed brightly and warmly while the crew around her looked at her in a new light.  It was like they were seeing how impossibly big she was for the first time.  Sixteen babies in the perfectly thin Catt Saddler.  It was dawning on them, as it was for Catt for the first time in days, just how big she really was.  She looked around, her eyes wide with panic, her breathing coming in strong spurts to match the contractions rocking her belly forward and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" she said, barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned down, \"Relax, I'll work you through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Catt's mind went elsewhere as another wave of pain shot through her belly.  She threw her head back and screamed through her teeth.  She had never felt anything like this, and her mind was rebelling against the very idea.  What brought her back, somewhat, was seeing a slim figure out of the corner of her eye.  Amid the crew rushing to and fro she saw Maria near a doorway, arms crossed, an expression between amusement and actual concern.  Catt wished she could punch her out, and the intense feeling of helplessness and humiliation only subsided when another series of contractions drowned out all other thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" Catt repeated, and was dismayed to see Liz looking baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think . . . we need to get you to a hospital.  There are too many, I think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too manaaaaah-\" Catt couldn't finish.  Her belly lifted itself and forced itself back into her hips.  She screamed and kicked.  Her belly twisted and contracted of its own accord.  They wanted to come.  Her body wanted to give birth, and Catt wanted it all to be over.  But something felt stuck.  The thought that she would be forever in this state entered her head and intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeease,\" she begged Liz, \"Anything!  Do anything!\" she said as she began to sob from the pain.  She fell back and wished she could pass out, but her belly wouldn't allow her.  She heard Liz saying to try pushing, and Catt couldn't push any more than her body already was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, towards the entrance to the studio, she heard a voice she recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off the necklace!\" it said.  She recognized Dr. Anderson, but felt no more relieved.  \"Take it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, but with no other immediate option, Liz removed Catt's red hot necklace.  In seconds, a change went through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh . . .\" Liz breathed, a shudder and spasm shaking her whole body.  She felt her arms and legs, already probably twice as thick as they were before this, swell, and her breasts as well.  She let her head fall back and moaned.  The pain in her belly, unbearable moments ago, lessened even as it spread throughout her entire dome of a stomach.  She felt squirming, muscles pulsating and struggling, but she couldn't find the strength to lift her head.  She was dimly aware of others moving around her, of her belly tightening, her hips wiggling to escape the pain, and then a sudden lessening of the pressure in her belly.  Her head remained back, now under something soft placed there.  She stared upward, breathing compulsively, her eyes wide open.  Everything was out of her hands now.  She heard phrases like \"There's one!\" and \"another one!\" but only gurgled weakly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt's thoughts were mixed, confused.  She knew she must be giving birth, but had since lost any ability to comprehend or react to what that entails.  Liz and Dr. Anderson, who were now only voices and blurs, tried holding her attention, preventing her from passing out.  She didn't know when it would be over, or if it ever would.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest for Catt was a blur.  She felt her stomach moving and pushing, occasionally almost lifting her off the ground, while Dr. Anderson and Liz gave commands and counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt wrenched her head up with a burst of energy and was shocked to see the two past her belly, which had gone down significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, is this ever going to end?\" she tried to shout it threatening, but it came out tired and weak.  She fell back with a gasp as another series of alien movements inside her forced another out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt, soaked in sweat, breathing shallow, her arms lying limply at her sides, finally head the number she was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen.  That's sixteen,\" she couldn't even tell if it was Dr. Anderson or Liz talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt moaned loudly.  She thought she might be saying something.  She tried to sit up and fell back as a sharp pain hit her middle.  Dr. Anderson appeared over her with a towel, wiping her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit back.  Your stomach muscles are too stretched out to sit up.  Just sit back.  We'll get you and the babies to a hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies?\" Catt asked as the world began to fade away.  \"Sixteen was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  And they're all fine,\" Dr. Anderson said, but Catt had already passed out.  The ambulance arrived shortly after to take Catt and her sixteen newborns away.  When she awoke the next day the first thing she asked, after how the babies were doing, was whether or not they actually filmed the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest surprise for Catt was how effortlessly she embraced her new roll: working mother of sixteen.  She took a decent break from work, but used the time to set up daycare for her kids, and even started looking into their future schooling already.  She wasn't going to do a reality show of it, as Kevin suggested repeatedly, but she was more than willing to talk about her new life when asked.  It was a nice break for Catt, being the subject rather than the interviewer.  Still, she couldn't wait to get back to her old work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was also surprised by how quickly she resigned herself to the idea that she wasn't going to get her old body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body took quite a beating,\" Dr. Anderson said at her and her babies' two month check-up.  \"And you're not as young as most women when they're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt nodded.  She was upset, but not nearly as upset as she had been while the changes were happening to her.  Some of the weight had melted off, and her belly had gone from enormous to merely puffy.  Her hips and ass, not to mention her breasts, were still ridiculously bloated, though.  She barely could get used to the jiggling when she moved, and had redesigned her style to be tight but not indecent if only to cut down on the sensation.  Really, though, having to discard her entire, carefully picked, priced wardrobe was more depressing to her now than accepting her new, pear-shaped figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nobody goes back to normal after pregnancy, right?  I'll bet Jennifer's still got some pudge left on her,\" Catt said, without any resentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Jennifer's back to her pre-pregnancy weight,\" Dr. Anderson said, checking some charts.  \"She's changed some but mostly . . .oh, well, ah, but that's neither here nor there.\" He chuckled and trailed off after seeing Catt's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Doc,\" Catt said, \"The babies are healthy.  I'm healthy.  Kind of chubby, but healthy.  I can live with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your next check up is in two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything, Doc,\" Catt turned to leave.  Then, the idea came to her.  She couldn't believe she hadn't thought of this before.  \"Say, Dr. Anderson.  What happened to the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you'd ask about that.  I imagine there's one or two people you'd like to give it to, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, no, of course not.  But . . . where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone.  I got rid of it.  That things has caused me enough trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caused <i>you</i> enough trouble?\" Catt smiled.  \"Fine.  Don't tell me.  I'll be seeing you, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Catt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatt was a little disappointed.  There was one person she definitely wanted to put through what she went through, and more publicly if possible.  Maria, who still couldn't resist snide comments about Catt's ass, or belly, or every other now larger part of her body, would have been such a fun target.</span></div></div>",

As she was leaving one spot to hit up another she was able to catch E-News where they were discussing the possibility of Emilia being pregnant. A not so flattering shot of Emilia appeared on the screen, she had to admit that from that angle it did look like she had a belly. She shook her head, people would make up anything just to get a story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia turned down a street and came upon a store she had never really seen before. It most have just shown up recently, it had a strange exterior like that of a shop that had been there for decades. She suddenly felt a strange urge to go inside. Without a second thought Emilia stepped inside. What she found was some kind of antique shop but for strange oddities. Statues, suits of armor and strange knick knacks littered the building. Emilia looked around and eventually came upon a strange little wooden statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of a woman but her figure had been blown out of proportion, it had wide hips, a heavy bust, a shelf for a butt and most of all a massive belly. She felt like the statue was calling to her and the more she looked at it the more interested she became. She reached out to touch it, her finger lingering over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No touch, only look.\" said a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia jumped and spun around, not noticing as she bumped the shelf. The owner of the shop was a very small, very old woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't see you there I was just looking at this little statue.\" said Emilia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to look at the statue when she noticed it wobbling on the shelf. Emilia bumping the shelf had caused enough motion to move the tiny statue to the edge of the shelf. The owner and Emilia watched as the statue slowly began to topple, Emilia tried to reach out to grab it as it fell. It slipped through her fingers and for a second she thought she felt a prick like she had just gotten a splinter. The statue hit the ground and shattered into many pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry.\" said Emilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out!!!\" yelled the Owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out!!!.\" repeated the Owner as she pushed Emilia out the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia looked back and looked at her finger tip, she didn't see any splinters but they hurt like they were there. She shrugged it off not knowing the path is had just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Emilia the curse had begun and the effects were slowly beginning. </span></div></div>",

Letting the facade drop, she left the room redoing one of the buttons on her blouse as she did. She rounded a few corners before leaning against a wall and slowly sinking to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I can pivot to singing\u2026\u201d Alex pondered. A few moments later her phone vibrated, breaking from her reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Alex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Alex, babe, how\u2019d the audition go?\u201d Scott Blumenfeld was Alex\u2019s agent. He was a bit loud for Alex\u2019s tastes, but he kept managing to find her parts so she tolerated the occasional ringing ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot great Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, I\u2019m sure you did better than you think, what\u2019d they say?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We\u2019ll let you know.</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMajor ouch. What happened? Didya flash enough cleavage?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Scott I told you I\u2019m not gonna do that.\u201d She unconsciously grabbed at the button she had recently done-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPsh, there ain\u2019t nothing wrong with flashing a little boobage. God didn\u2019t give ya those for no reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex\u2019s eyes rolled so hard she half-expected them to fall out of their sockets. \u201cIs there something else you needed Scott?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStraight to business, eh Alex? Well alright. Now try and keep an open mind. There\u2019s this part I just got wind of, I think you\u2019d be perfect for. You\u2019d be working with a real A-list director, real big shot. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to know that he\u2019s attached just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the character is a mom. Actually, she will be one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean she\u2019s pregnant? I don\u2019t have any issues with that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just the character.\u201d As Scott\u2019s words sunk in she turned the phone in her hand to stare at it incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I\u2019d have to get pregnant? That\u2019s insane. I can\u2019t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear me out.\u201d Scott cut her off, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be real with you. Alex, babe, as much as I hate to say it you don\u2019t have much time left as the hot young thing.\u201d She inhaled sharply as if to take offense but couldn\u2019t find the words. That exact thought occupied quite a lot of real estate in the back of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaywatch might have been your last hurrah. You\u2019ve got a few years tops. I mean they already have Kendrick playing a mom and she looks like she could still be in high school.\u201d Alex again found nothing she could disagree with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do this you\u2019ll get your face back out there and gracefully slide into those milf roles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you see my point. The only question is do you want a kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I do, eventually-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? This is killing two birds with one baby. Just think of it as method acting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPregnancy is not method acting. Daniel Day-Lewis didn\u2019t actually cripple himself for My Left Foot.\u201d Alex argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen kid, I know this is a huge decision. But this could be just the thing to polish up that star of yours. Tell me you\u2019ll think about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAtta girl. I gotta run but you let me know when you\u2019re on board.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf!\u201d Alex corrected her agent but he had already hung up. On the drive home the idea bounced around her head. She did want to have a baby before she turned 35. Even if she started dating someone tomorrow, the relationship would take a while to bear fruit. Alex laid in bed, staring up at her ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d She muttered picking up her phone. Drafting a message her finger hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m in.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, she hit send and immediately powered her phone off. She laid back in head, heartbeat in her ears. </span></div></div>",

She was just finishing up some errands, and was on her way back to the mansion.  Kim had recently gone through a rough breakup, and had gone on a bit of a shopping spree.  And of course, an outing on the town of Los Angeles wouldn't be complete without the paparazzi breathing down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was soon surrounded, and had nowhere to go except for what looked to be a small antiques store. <i>Natasha's Antique Emporium</i>, the sign read.  Kim dashed inside, hoping that the paparazzi would not follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, she was met by an older woman, who was cleaning the store.  \"Hello, I am Natasha.  Could I interest you in anything?\" she asked, in a vaguely foreign accent.  \"Um, no, sorry.  I'm just trying to get away from someone.\" Kim said, hoping to not reveal that she was famous.  \"Wait, aren't you Kim Kardashian?  You have lots of money, yes?\" Natasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...yes.  Yes I do.\" Kim replied.  Natasha's eyes lit up.  \"Well, could you please, please buy this necklace?  It's been in my family for centuries, and I think that it needs to be passed on.\" she said, holding the necklace in question up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful necklace, Kim had to admit.  It was silver, albeit a bit worn down, and had green engravings running through it.  \"I'll take it!  How much?\" Kim asked.  \"For you, fifty dollars.\" Natasha replied, handing her the necklace.  Kim shelled out the cash (not that she was anywhere near running out of it) and exited the store.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then returned back to the mansion, extremely pleased with her purchase that was now hanging around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
