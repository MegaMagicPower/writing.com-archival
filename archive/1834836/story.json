See you later.\" You wave goodbye, <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile you're walking, you look up to see it's still the afternoon, you pull out the list and read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander's List and Descriptions on sources of Hypnosis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Lyth's Magic and Illusions Shop - Lyth is a blue female dragon, who enjoys tricking the mind with magic, although her knowledge on hypnosis is unknown. She is also quite friendly, and befriends any dragon who goes in to her shop, which is just about everyone. (Blue &amp; Light Blue Female Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Terra's Home - She frequently visit's the magic shop, and usually is seen in the forest or at home, but once I caught her with a hypnosis book my suspicions were confirmed, she loves hypnosis. (Green &amp; Dark Green Female Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Breeze - Hypnosis fits his personality, but its also a long shot. He once told me, he loves putting his feet in the river and feeling the water rush in between his toes, as it sends a relaxing feeling through out his body especially his toes. So he will be in the forest near the river or in his home, not too far from the river. Also is friends with Amber. (Yellow &amp; Orange Male Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Amber - A rather shy dragon who's very close friends with Breeze, so I'm not sure if she knows anything about Hypnosis, but is suspicious behavior and fits just like Breeze. Amber is everywhere, but the place she is always seen is the Dragon Library. (Pink &amp; Light Blue Female Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Cylo - Hypnosis is questionable with him and very likely, not only that, but he's a very kind dragon if you give him time. Usually is seen in the mountains, as he created a cave he calls home. (Purple &amp; Blue Male Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.Jewel - She has a fascination for shiny and beautiful objects, but never thought if she knows hypnosis. In fact, I don't think she does, but you never know until you see her. Can be found in the underground crystal caves, where she always is. (Red &amp; Blue Female Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.Krystal - A beautiful Dragon who is very adventurous and daring, she's been places and is rather fond of every dragon she meets. In fact, hypnosis was one of the first things she mentioned when I spoke with her and never hypnotized anyone, and is looking for some dragon to hypnotize. She can be found not too far from Dilex's home. (Golden Yellow &amp; Light Blue  Female Dragon)<br>\r\n <br>\r\n8. Xander (Me) - Of course I'm a dragon that loves hypnosis and wish to try it out on Dilex... if he lets me. You can find me hanging out with Dilex at his home or mine. (Red &amp; Orange Male Dragon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. If I've given this to some dragon, I recommend you watch out, as you are now treading on unknown soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: \"Well this is a very informative list &amp; I like how he put himself in the list, as if he was going to give this to some dragon.\" You read, as it seemed quite odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: \"So many choices, Let's go see....\"</span></div></div>",

You should of seen the look on your face, you looked so scared.
