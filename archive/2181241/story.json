Today is the second week of school for the year and the councilor wants to speak with you.

I did some more digging and it would seem that the pattern I noticed for the past three years is also present for most of grade school as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPattern? Are you suggesting I cheat in school?\u201d You ask upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo your grades aren\u2019t good enough to accuse you of cheating. That\u2019s the problem. You\u2019ve barely passed ever single year of school. I was talking to some of your teachers and they were of the opinion that you really should have repeated last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d You ask nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchool is almost out for the day but the principal and I both agree, and we spoke with your mother, and tomorrow you will head to the library instead of your classes so you can take a placement exam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlacement exam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what grade you belong in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat grade? I\u2019m 18 I\u2019m a senior I\u2019m graduating this year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you belong in 12th grade then that\u2019s what the test will show.\u201d </span></div></div>",

The librarian was watching you after the councilor had explained the directions and rules of the test. She had told you to just do your best and that you\u2019d have a bathroom break once every hour but weren\u2019t allowed to leave the library unless at the designated time. She also said that you had until lunch to finish and then they\u2019d grade it and they would know where you belong before you left school for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was five minutes before lunch when you felt the urgency to go to the bathroom.

At the mess you made!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and tears are pricking your eyes as you fight the urge to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You say. \u201cI\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you\u2019ll go to the nurse.\u201d She points angrily in the direction you infer your supposed to go because it in the opposite direction you should go otherwise.

The rest of the year? What happened when your mom wanted to know your graduation date or about prom or the senior project? What about next year would you be 19 starting 1st grade again? How would you explain that? Would you be in your 30s before you hit high school again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your mind registered the words AT LEAST.

Then as though your humiliation wasn\u2019t complete your bladder gives way as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your standing with your diaper on full display showing off just how much of a baby you were. You burst into tears as the situation sinks in and your stomach cramps up again and releases another load into the already full diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way you can claim to be 18, an adult when you can\u2019t even stop yourself from using your diaper like a baby. Maybe you should just give up on keeping your situation a secret and resign yourself to the fact that you are where you belong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oblivious to the fact that Mrs. Ross has picked you up and carried you to the back towards the changing tables, your overalls forgotten. She carries you into a family bathroom but puts you on a little bench and untapped your diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mostly clean when you can calm yourself enough to realize the assistant is standing there with a package in his hands that he\u2019s handing to Mrs. Ross. When he sees you looking at him he smiles kindly \u201calmost better.\u201d He coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should find the situation mortifying but the words and tone help settle you down the rest of the way to notice that the package he had handed to Mrs. Ross was a package of diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were different than the ones you had been wearing earlier. As she finished taping up the diaper you noticed it was much thicker and instead of Sesame Street characters it had teddy bears in diapers with a blue strip down the middle. As you were sat up you also realized it was louder too. Every movement caused the diaper to crinkle loudly letting everyone know it was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Ross seemed happy with them though and you weren\u2019t in a position to complain. You continued to inspect your new diaper while Mrs. Ross and the assistant spoke. Finally it seemed like they were done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mrs. Ross stood from her seat on the couch you automatically grabbed her hand and stood as well, diaper crinkling the entire time. You didn\u2019t want to leave the bathroom without pants on but seeing as you had just messed your diaper in front of everyone it couldn\u2019t get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to where your overalls had been left and Mrs. Ross helped you back into them. You had a hard time balancing on your own because of the bulk of the diaper and the overalls ballooned out where the diaper was making it obvious to anyone looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed to the register where Mrs Ross payed and received many bags. You wondered how many diapers she had bought. Then they left the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they returned to the car in the backseat there was:</span></div></div>",

As Mrs. Ross opens the door and picks you up to put you in your fears are made real. Your buckled into the car seat and the door is closed. Mrs. Ross puts all the bags into the trunk and then gets into the drivers seat all while you sit there in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can you even fit in a car seat? Your feet don\u2019t touch the ground and the padding around the headrest keeps you from really being able to look around not to mention the straps make it hard to move. The buckle at your crotch pushes the diaper into you making you hyper aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine wanting out. You do not like your car seat at all as you wriggle about. It\u2019s after about 15 minutes that you realize you probably look like a disgruntled toddler who doesn\u2019t want to be in a car seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want out.\u201d You huff to Mrs. Ross as you continue to wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour too small to be without a car seat. If we were in an accident you\u2019d get very hurt.\u201d Mrs. Ross explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stops you for a minute. Your too small? Was that why your mom never let you learn how to drive or sit in the front seat? You were too short? Those thoughts occupy you until your pulling up to a nice house and Mrs. Ross parks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frustrated when she gets the bags in the trunk first and brings them inside before coming back for you. This time she carries you like a toddler into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to watch a movie while I put the things away?\u201d Your teacher coos. You think a movie sounds nice after everything and nod. She settles you on the couch and sets up the DVD player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you realize your watching Winnie the Pooh but you don\u2019t mind. You continue to watch until Mrs. Ross is done putting the things away and the movie ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s give you a bath and then my husband should be home and it\u2019ll be time for dinner.\u201d Mrs. Ross said as she picked you up and carried you upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you probably should have seen the warning signs about what would happen but it still catches you off guard when she starts running the bath and starts undressing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can give myself a bath.\u201d You say. You would prefer a shower but a bath is nice too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Ross ignores the statement as she adds bubbles to the water. Soon enough the bath is filled and your diaper is damp. You think it had something to do with being mostly naked in the bathroom  but you couldn\u2019t help wetting yourself a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuts off the water and puts you in the tub. Along with some bath toys. She lets you play for a little bit before starting to clean you. You try to wriggle away but it\u2019s maternal instead of sexual and you find yourself giving in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pays extra attention to your privates and when you ask why she say it\u2019s because that needs to be cleaned because you are wearing a diaper and you\u2019ll get a rash is your not careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe washes your hair as your body begins to tingle and she uses the shower head to rise the shampoo out. Then she tell you to stand as she starts to drain the tub and rises you down completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you notice:</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d He says kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour a little unsure but reach out an shake his hand anyway. Your small hand seems to completely disappear in his much larger one. \u201cHi.\u201d You say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he releases your hand he stands and addresses Mrs. Ross. \u201cI brought dinner. I figured pizza would be okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds wonderful.\u201d Mrs. Ross agreed. She took your hand and you all made your way downstairs. You had a little trouble with the thickness of your diaper but holding Mrs. Ross\u2019s hand you were able to make it down the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sat into a regular chair as Mr. Ross gets you a plate. He sets it out of your reach and then pulls something out of a drawer in the attached kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure nothing gets on that pretty dress.\u201d He says. Then he puts whatever he grabbed around your neck and you look down seeing a bib. He places your plate in front of you and then grabs his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t sure how you feel about the bib but you reason that it\u2019s not really a big deal and begin to eat. As you eat you learn a lot about Mr. and Mrs. Ross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ross is the CEO of some large company which is how they can afford such a nice house. You also know that he works out every morning for an hour before leaving for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation flows around you you begin to feel like the little kid your pretending to be. There\u2019s no pressure to contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way like there would be if you were acting your age. Mr. and Mrs. Ross are so tall you feel very small sitting with them. Walking around everyday you had always felt short since most adults were at least a foot or taller than you but you feel especially dwarfed between the two Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if that\u2019s why no one looked twice at you in the store. Standing next to someone that tall dressed like a toddler everyone probably assumed you were just a tall child out with your mommy who was extremely tall herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you like to do?\u201d Mr. Ross asked you suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate answering. You can\u2019t tell him you like shopping and reading magazines or playing video games. It would be a give away that you weren\u2019t actually 5. Instead you say \u201cI like movies and coloring and building things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ross smiles and takes on a look of mock surprise. \u201cBuilding things?! You mean like buildings? Did you build mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it\u2019s ridiculous and that he knows it too but you can\u2019t help but giggle at the question. \u201cNo! With blocks.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! With blocks!\u201d He says as though he only just understood. You decide you like Mr. Ross he\u2019s funny. \u201cYou know I think there are some blocks in the toy box in your room.\u201d He says in a stage whisper as though sharing a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You ask, curious. Building blocks had kept you entertained for most of the day and you supposed you weren\u2019t against playing with them some more especially when you didn\u2019t have to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d He confirmed. He got up and removed the bib from around your neck. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go have a look while we clean up dinner?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and head for the stairs. Mrs. Ross calls after you to be careful on the steps. You take it to heart. You aren\u2019t as sure on your feet as you usually are and it\u2019s probably because you aren\u2019t used to the bulk of the diaper yet. You make sure to hold onto the railing as you climb and feel a sense of pride when you make it up without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you walk towards your room you notice that your developing a baby\u2019s waddle from having your legs forced apart by the padding. You try to correct it and walk normally but it\u2019s uncomfortable and borders on painful so you give up. You guess you\u2019ll just have to deal with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally make it over to the toy box and open it. Taking a look at all the toys your a little overwhelmed. You start by taking all the toys out and examining them. You get distracted by a teddy bear for a little bit and keep it close as you continue looking and stumble across a train set. Before you know it your completely absorbed in playing with the trains and your new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t notice the hours pass or the fact that you\u2019ve actually started talking to the bear like it can answer back. Your distracted by your stomach cramping but you don\u2019t want to stop playing and soon enough it\u2019s forgotten. The cramps hit a second time more forcefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can register what your doing your shifting your position and pushing a load into your diaper. When you finish you realize what you just did. You just willingly messed your diaper. It wasn\u2019t an accident because you knew you had to go and ignored it so you could play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can either sit in your mess or go tell Mrs. Ross that you need a change. You could pass it off as another accident and she wouldn\u2019t have to know but then you\u2019d have to stop playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you:</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t yell at you or seemed upset in anyway when you were sucking your thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behaviors that your mom had always had a problem with and berated you for were accepted as natural here and you decided you were looking forward to the time spent here while your mom was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look hard at work!\u201d Said a male voice you recognized as belonging to Mr Ross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him and smiled. \u201cUh huh.\u201d You agreed. \u201cI try really hard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet.\u201d He said ruffling your hair with a smile. \u201cDo you think I could have a look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the picture you\u2019ve been coloring. You weren\u2019t really focused when you were doing it and it looks like a 4 year old colored it because you scribbled a bit outside the lines. Still your supposed to be 5 so you guess it\u2019s alright. You nod and hand it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at it and says \u201cI think this masterpiece belongs on the fridge! What do you think?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour a little embarrassed that anyone would be able to see your horrible coloring job but excitement fills you at the idea so you nod vigorously bouncing a little in your seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ross places the picture front and center on the refrigerator and a sense of pride washes over you seeing it and you grin widely. You get off the chair and rush over to Mrs Ross tugging on her hand gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see? My picture is on the \u2018figerator!\u201d You tell her excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs good naturedly. \u201cYes little one I see it. Its very good. Now why don\u2019t the two of you run along while I finish dinner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Liv.\u201d\u2019 Mr. Ross says from behind you before he scoops you up into his arms. You squeal in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brings you upstairs into a large bedroom you\u2019ve never seen before and you realize it\u2019s the master bedroom. \u201cYou stay right there while I get out of this monkey suit.\u201d He tells you putting you down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a monkey.\u201d You say before you can stop yourself. But he just laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a saying kiddo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d You say feeling silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes into a walk-in closet and disappears from sight. You look around from your position on the bed and wish teddy was there with you so you could explore together. Before you can get too bored however Mr Ross comes back out in some sweats looking more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kiddo what should we do while we wait for dinner?\u201d He asks you. </span></div></div>",

He pats your bottom and you aren\u2019t sure how you feel about him doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t know your wearing a diaper but Mrs Ross has been doing it a lot lately to check the state of you diaper and you wonder if that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst thing we need to do is get you into a clean diaper.\u201d He says and you bury your face into his neck in embarrassment. He chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Your just not ready to be a big girl yet and that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t rush it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that he doesn\u2019t know your actually 18 but still it stings a bit even if that\u2019s not how he meant it. He has no idea how right he is about you not being ready to be a \u2018big girl\u2019. Three days ago you had no trouble making it to the bathroom and now it\u2019s been 2 days since you\u2019ve actually used a toilet like the 18 year old you should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts you down on the changing table and all of a sudden it\u2019s clear that he means to change your diaper. You whine and slip your thumb into your mouth as your laidback and your pants are pulled down and you kick your legs a little in displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise he is just as quick and efficient at changing you as Mrs Ross is and before you know it your pants are back on and your back in his arms as he carries you down the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddy?\u201d You ask as he heads towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure do you remember where he is?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, thumb still in your mouth, and point towards the dining room where teddy had sat with you while you colored. He turns around and heads to the dining room instead and your friend is right there on the table waiting for you.   You reach out from your position on Mr. Ross\u2019s hip and grab teddy pulling him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have everything?\u201d He asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \u201cMovie now.\u201d You agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping for something a bit more mature with Mr. Ross but he puts in 101 Dalmatians. Before you know it your cuddled into Mr. Ross\u2019s side, teddy wrapped in your arms, thumb in mouth, and completely engrossed in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie is dinner. Mr. Ross puts another bib on you but you don\u2019t pay it much mind especially since you end up needing it when you spill some of your drink down your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner is over and everything is cleaned up Mrs. Ross says it\u2019s time for your bath and then pjs. You look at the time and see it\u2019s only 6:30. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up and carries you to the bathroom you were in this morning and starts to run a bath. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go to bed yet.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the time your done with your bath and get dressed it\u2019ll be almost 8 because it\u2019s a weekend I think you can stay up for one show but then it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d She says firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that would only be 8:30!\u201d You whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd 30 minutes past your bedtime during the week.\u201d She says unwaveringly. \u201cIf you prove that your too tired to stay awake by fussing though you\u2019ll go to bed on time at 8 instead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning clear you stop arguing. Mrs. Ross turns out to be right though. By the time your ready for bed it\u2019s 8. She carries you down and your allowed to watch one episode of paw patrol before your wisked off to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour diaper is checked one last time and then your tucked in and Mrs. Ross is picking up the book she had started to read to you last night. Mr. Ross brought in another sippy cup for the night and he said his goodnights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second night in a row you drift off after only a couple pages. </span></div></div>",

Your stomach sinks when you realize it\u2019s your sister and a couple of her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what would be best. Keep playing and pretend you didn\u2019t know them in the hopes they don\u2019t approach you or head over to the Rosses for protection from the bullying that your sure is about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t given a chance to make a decision however because as soon as they see that you\u2019ve seen them they\u2019re headed over. As they close ranks around you, you become hyper aware of what your wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in overalls today because they were good to play in but your diaper created a bulge that was obvious. There was no way your soon to be tormentors wouldn\u2019t have noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it when I first saw it.\u201d Your sister smirks. \u201cBut I was right my big sister is just a little baby.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a baby!\u201d You shoot back stomping your foot for emphasis but even as you say it the words sound hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh! Is the baby grumpy?\u201d One of your sisters friends say in mock concern. \u201cMaybe she needs a diaper change.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr a nap.\u201d Another one suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nap time.\u201d You say reflexively and your sister and her friends burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do need a change.\u201d Your sister says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d You say but your unsure. You have no idea what kind of state your diaper is in. This is your 3rd day in diapers full time and Mrs Ross checks you so often you don\u2019t need to ever ask for a change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the baby is lying.\u201d The first friend says seriously. \u201cWe should probably check to make sure she doesn\u2019t get a rash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think your right. It would be wrong to just leave the cranky baby in a used diaper.\u201d The second say with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister swiftly unbuckles your overalls and they drop to the ground before you can react. Your diaper in full view your relieved to see that at the very least your dry but it only lasts a second cause the cool air seems to be all your bladder needs to release itself into your waiting diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to tear up in humiliation as your sister and her friends roar in laughter. Tears start to roll down your cheeks and you slip your thumb to your mouth for comfort sucking on it a few times. Then as though following a cue from your bladder your bowels cut loose and your helplessly messing yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Isabelle, you really are just a baby aren\u2019t you.\u201d Your sister says. You just continue to cry sucking on your thumb desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes and then picks your overalls up and clips them back on. \u201cThere now no one can see what a baby you are.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t stop your tears. She sighs exasperated. \u201cCome on lets  go get the baby changed.\u201d She starts to walk away and her friends follow but stops and grabs your hand when she realizes you aren\u2019t following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are your diapers?\u201d Your sister asks you shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tears are slowing now that you know your going to be changed. You scan the crowd of parents and then point out Mr. and Mrs. Ross. Words are suddenly very difficult and you really just want to be held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sisters friends hang back while your sister leads you over to the two adults. Once Mrs. Ross sees you she gets moves towards you and scoops up up into her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter little one? Did you get hurt?\u201d She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you taking care of her?\u201d Your sister asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s staying with me.\u201d Mrs. Ross answers rocking you gently as you bury your face into her. And wrap the arm that isn\u2019t attached to the thumb in your mouth around her neck. She pulls your thumb out and you whine. She\u2019s never had a problem with you sucking your thumb before. \u201cDon\u2019t do that little one, your hand is all dirty from playing.\u201d She says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls something out of her pocket and holds it up to your mouth and as it brushes your lips you open to accept it. After a couple of sucks you register that it\u2019s a pacifier. You decide you like it better than your thumb right now because it means both hands are free to hold onto your caretaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you need a change.\u201d Mrs. Ross coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIcky.\u201d You confirm. You feel safe in her arms and your episode with your sister and her friends is all but forgotten despite the fact that she\u2019s still standing right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you all cleaned up and then you can play for a bit more before it\u2019s time to head home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d Mr Ross asks the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust fine Ron.\u201d Mrs. Ross says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get the little one cleaned up could you get me her bag.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands it over and then the two of you head to the family bathrooms. When you come out holding Mrs. Ross\u2019s hand your sister is standing outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you friends with Isabelle?\u201d Mrs Ross asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m her big sister.\u201d She answers and her smile suggests she\u2019s enjoying the joke. You do the mature thing and stick your tongue out at her in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you for bringing her to me.\u201d Mrs. Ross says to her. Then she asks you \u201cReady to go play some more?\u201d You hesitate. You do want to play but your not eager to go back to being teased by you sister and her friends. </span></div></div>",

I just used my diaper. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing one. So I don\u2019t have accidents.\u201d You inform her matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t seem to know how to respond for a moment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t start wearing diapers today did you? Cause there\u2019s no way your this ok with being in a diaper and using it in front of people if you\u2019ve only been wearing a couple hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate not sure how honest you should be. Your pretty sure you won\u2019t be re-potty trained by the time your mom comes home. You might as well be honest as far as your diaper wearing goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the third day I\u2019ve been in diapers full time.\u201d You admit. \u201cI haven\u2019t used the potty in three days just my diaper. Mrs. Ross doesn\u2019t mind changing me though. Like I said she says I\u2019m not ready to be a big girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only been wearing for 3 days and what you lost your toilet training?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I think I might have lost my potty training first and then she put me in diapers. I had a few accidents in my pull-ups before she decided that I wasn\u2019t ready and put me back in diapers I haven\u2019t made it to the potty since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull-ups?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had an accident at school so they said I needed to wear pull-ups until they knew I could stay dry. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did you end up with Mrs Ross isn\u2019t she the kindergarten teacher?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m staying with her while mom is gone.\u201d You say carefully but suddenly you want her to know just how great Mrs Ross is and everything that the two of you have been doing for the past two days comes spilling out of you. How she read to you at night how gently she bathed you and dressed you like you were fragile and precious. How she never made you feel bad about using your diapers and held you while you broke down crying as she soothed you. How she made you feel warm and safe and small. You told her about your room with her and all your toys and about Teddy your friend and the adventures the two of you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d Your sister says putting her hands up. \u201cShe\u2019s the perfect mommy for my big baby sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI not a baby.\u201d You try to assert. \u201cI\u2019s a big girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister laughs. \u201cYou just stood here and told me all about how exactly you ARE a baby and now you want to claim your not?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019s not.\u201d You insist. \u201cI\u2019s this many.\u201d You blurt out holding up three fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in your mind you realize that isn\u2019t the case. You aren\u2019t 3 your 18 but right now you feel 3 and your words don\u2019t want to come out right either. Your excitement in sharing about Mrs. Ross had bubbled over and suddenly you felt something inside you click into place the trigger coming from your sisters words. Later when it\u2019s time for a nap you\u2019ll realize that it had been her calling Mrs. Ross your mommy that had done you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sister seems torn on whether or not to laugh but realizes you aren\u2019t joking. \u201cOk a toddler then.\u201d She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a tod-ler?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh. A kid whose not a baby but not quite a big girl yet.\u201d She explains a little unsure. \u201cLike you. Someone under 5.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bigger dan five.\u201d Numbers prove to be just as difficult as saying things correctly. Your aware of numbers but aren\u2019t quite sure of their order. You KNOW  your three but can\u2019t grasp in your current mindset that any one number is bigger than another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She asks curiously. In an attempt to gauge just where you are mentally she continues \u201ccan you count to five?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh!\u201d You say confidently. \u201cOne, three, seven, two, five.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles. \u201cNot quite Izzy. It\u2019s 1, 2,3,4,5. Can you remember that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmmm.\u201d You say uncertain. Your not as confident in your abilities anymore. You were sure that you were correct before but obviously if your sissy is saying it was wrong then maybe not. \u201cUh Uh.\u201d You decide shaking your head. Numbers are too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you say the alphabet for me?\u201d She asks instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident again you say \u201cA B C D E F G.\u201d Then you stop. Thinking hard. You start again and get to H before you give up. \u201cI can do it.\u201d You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you can.\u201d Your sissy agrees. \u201cDo you remember the song?\u201d She starts to sing it and you join in. It\u2019s a lot easier with help and before you know it you\u2019ve finished. \u201cGood job!\u201d She praises. You smile with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPay now?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She agrees and then you run off onto the jungle Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mrs. Ross comes to get you so you can go home. You aren\u2019t too upset about having to leave. Your just happy to be with your caretaker. Mommy. Your mind corrects.<br>\r\nYou reach to be picked up when you get to Mr. Ross. It\u2019s been a long morning and think it might be around your nap time. You drift off as Mr. Ross carries you home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your a little sad that you have to go back to school but it\u2019s not like Mrs.Ross won\u2019t be there. Mr. Ross has changed you a few more times during the course of the weekend and you\u2019ve gotten pretty used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks pass essentially the same as the last two days of the first week and before you know it you\u2019ve been living with Mr. and Mrs. Ross for three weeks. You can\u2019t tell when you have to pee or even poop anymore. You only notice when your diaper grows warm if you aren\u2019t already wet or when you sit in your own mess but even then Mr and Mrs Ross are quick to change you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest change though is that you\u2019ve fallen into your roll deeply now. You are beginning to delight in the childish prints that are on your clothes. The cartoons that you watch before and after school are starting to seem more entertaining and you enjoy the bright colors. You\u2019re also enjoying playing with your toys in your room before bed. You drank more often than not out of a sippy cup unless you were drinking out of a juice box and a pacifier was never far from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gait was well and truly a baby\u2019s waddle and you\u2019ve even contemplated crawling a few times simply because it seemed easier. Reading seemed too hard these days too so Mr or Mrs Ross often read to you. You always hold someone\u2019s hand when you leave the house and you\u2019ve started feeling safe in your car seat instead of confined. Your vocabulary now suits an older toddler instead of an adult and you\u2019ve developed a bit of a lisp from constantly sucking on a pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven\u2019t been without Mr. or Mrs Ross at all since you\u2019ve started the kindergarten class so it blindsided you when <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Miss Bear expertly finishes and begins powdering you before taping up a diaper around you and sets you on your newly diapered bum on the ground before kneeling before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little one but it looks like you will be in diapers for at least a week without any messy accidents before we can try pullups again.\" Miss Bear says happily. \"At least you look absolutely adorable in your baby diaper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes you to look down to see the cartoon prints on the very obvious diaper that clearly fit you perfectly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
