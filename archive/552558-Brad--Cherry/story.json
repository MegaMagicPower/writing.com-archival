Now he is in a new home, with Cindy and his mother.  Cindy has changed a bit, so has Brad.  Anyway, one day Brad is walking along the street when he runs into a beautiful girl.  She is #1, according to what Brad sees.  \"I wonder if this girl will like my new invention...\" wonders Brad.  Well what does Brad decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- oh by the way, Brad is wondering right now if he should tell this new girl about his crazy adventure of being 1 inch tall one year ago...</span></div></div>",

Eh, better it than us.\" You place the apple on a stool in front of the shrinking ray and activate the shrinking ray. It rumbles and whirs mechanically as you input the directions for shrinking. As you are working, Cherry sidles next to you looking over your shoulder. \"So, how did you get so good with computers like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sorta taught myself. I had a little help, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kinda cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine started up and the ray was glowing a bright blue. It was whirring faster and clanking louder. Cherry was starting to hide behind you. You kinda liked it. The ray fired a blue ray that hit the apple. The two of you watched as the apple shrunk to the size of a marble. Cherry's eyes widened as she saw the tiny apple. \"Oh my God! It shrunk! I can't believe it shrunk!\" You nod proud of yourself. She'll ask you out before the day is done. Cherry is looking at the apple. She slowly touches it. She picks it up delicately and nibbles on it. She looks at you as if you were Willy Wonka and yells excitedly. \"It tastes like a normal apple, but it tastes juicier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because... well, I'm not sure how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come the government hasn't found out about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to. You don't want to know what would happen to people suddenly knew about this. People would be shrinking other people left and right. It would be chaos.\" Cherry looked spooked by the thought. \"You aren't the kind of person who would harm someone smaller or weaker than you, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry shook her head. \"No, I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \"Good, I know I can trust you now.\" You say as you put your arm around her shoulder. Cherry was about to say something when she noticed that the shrinking machine was whirring wildly and shaking violently. \"Is that supposed to be doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the malfunctioning shrinking machine. It definitely isn't supposed to be doing that. \"This doesn't normally happen. What's going on?\"</span></div></div>",

The lights flickered on and off, and then parts started flying off the machine that you didn't even know it had.  It starts casting a strange green light that seems totally unfamiliar to you, the person who created it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" asked Cherry in a frightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you say grimly, \"but we should get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cherry break towards the door, but a gust of wind - probably coming from the machine - slams it closed.  Frantically, you try to open it, but to no avail - it's jammed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the green glow behind you turns into a flash.  Then the world goes white, then it goes black.  Pain courses through your body - more pain than you've ever experienced in your life.  A shard of metal embeds itself in your palm.  It feels strange, almost like it's alive.  Then something hits you on the head and you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you feel a terrible throbbing in your head.  You look around but to no avail - all you see is blackness.  For a second you think you're still unconscious, but then you hear sobbing coming from somewhere near you.  It's Cherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask, dreading the answer.  She says nothing, but continues sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou claw around in the darkness and find a large blade.  Feeling about, you find a weak spot in the wall and attack it with the blade.  It gives a little.  After repeated slashing, it breaks down, and what you see is worse than you imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is gigantic - far bigger than it usually is.  Turning around, you see that the shrinking machine had fallen on top of you, and the \"blade\" you used to get out was actually the shard of metal that had been embedded in your hand.  Next to it is what you feared you would see - Cherry, shrunk to the same size you must have been, on her knees, crying at her fate.  The machine was totaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're alive!\" she exclaims and throws her arms around you as if greeting an old friend one had not seen for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" you say, dusting yourself off.  \"It's a shrink ray, not a death ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it collapsed on top of you!\" she said.  \"It should have crushed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought there was a cavity,\" you say, \"but now that you mention it, that wouldn't make sense.  But that's all beside the point.  The real question is, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Cherry says.  \"I've never actually been shrunk before.  You have - you tell us what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, of course, but for some reason you couldn't remember a thing about it right now.  It must be the concussion from when the machine hit you - or shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're not about to let her know that you were as clueless as she was - she needed to see you strong.  It was the only way you would have a chance of staying motivated enough to find a solution.  Falter, and you would give up, and then you would have no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say.  \"We need to ...</span></div></div>",

When you tell, Cherry, however, she merely shrugs.  You think this is due to a bug in the machine, but something doesn't quite seem right about that theory.  Something seems amiss - but you dismiss the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the kitchen and see that your mother is preparing sandwiches for a mid-afternoon snack.  You must have been unconscious longer than you though.  Gesturing for Cherry to follow, you walk over to your mother and call up.  She doesn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you have two feasible options at this point - either climb up your mother, which could be dangerous, or go find your sister.  In the past, she has been better at noticing you than your mother, but at this small size, she might think you're a bug and ... Once again, you dismiss the though.</span></div></div>",

You consider going down, but that would take too long and not really be worth it.  After all, you don't know where your sister is.  You also consider hopping into her pocked and waiting until her ear is easier to reach, but that could be a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice her apron.  It's flailing a lot, so it won't be easy, but the material is far easier to climb than her shirt.  Plus, it ties behind her neck, so it shouldn't be too hard to get to her ear from there.  There's a lot of food on it, sure, but nothing's ever easy when you're smaller than you've ever been.  Looking at Cherry, you see you have to make a decision for her sake.</span></div></div>",

Wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching her breath, Cherry manages to ask, \"What now?\", a question which you are incredibly tired of hearing by now, even though it's only been asked three or four times in the past hour.  You see that your mother's ear is higher up than you thought - she's wearing an earring, but only one of you would be able to climb up.  If you go, something terrible might happen to Cherry, but if Cherry goes, something terrible might happen to you.  Of course, you can't just send her up without asking, and she may take a while to answer, so if it's urgent, you have to go - but that would be selfish.

This climbing is hard work. He's made it so far, though, already - turning back now would be pointless. With this in mind, Brad reaches a hand up and grabs some of the soft skin of Cherry's neck, lifting himself up. He climbs up her neck and up and over her chin (which takes a considerable amount of maneuvering and strength), then onto the top of her upper lip where he sits down momentarily to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze coming from Cherry's nostrils as she inhales and exhales cools Brad off as he sits, sweating and gasping from the exertion. After a while, he stands up again and attempts to plan out a course of action. \"I still need to get her attention somehow,\" he thinks, looking around. \"I guess I have two options. I can continue on to her ear and try to get her to hear me, or ...\" Brad looks up into Cherry's nose, with its enormous nostrils looming above him. \"Or I guess I could shove my arm up her nose. That'd get her attention, too.\" Besides the fact that such an act would be disgusting, Brad also realizes that he would run the risk of accidentally making Cherry sneeze, and that wouldn't be pretty.

He watched as she breathed in and out gently, then, just as she was about to inhale again, he stuck his arm up above his head and into her right nostril. His hand met with the moist wall of her inner nose. \"Gross ...\" Brad exclaimed. \"This should get her attention, though.\" He started to rub his hand on the wall of Cherry's nose, moving his fingers around to try to tickle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs small as Brad was, Cherry could feel the disturbance that his hand was making inside her nose.
