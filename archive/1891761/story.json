Then there was the museums, restaurants, theaters, and other entertainments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, however, they didn't make it to their destination. This could be blamed on the usual reasons for some, like an accident, a change in plans due to meeting a friend, or perhaps, on rare occasions, due to being the victim of a crime. Other times however, it was because a human got eaten by a Reptilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfectly legal for a Reptilian to eat a human, providing that they followed a few basic rules. For the most part, a Reptilian had to get permission from the human in order to eat them. If the human said \"No\", then the Reptilian wasn't allowed to eat them, but they could exchange contact information, just in case the human changed their mind. If the human said \"Yes\", the Reptilian could eat the human, but if the human changed their mind, this request had to be followed, even if the human was already in the Reptilian's stomach. The only times that permission wasn't needed was if the human had been declared Legal Prey, or had been caught trying to commit a violent crime against another. In any case, in the event of a Consumption, the Authorities had to be notified, so that the human could be declared dead, and, if the human had been Eligible Prey or Hospital Food, the Reptilian was required to start paying off any financial debts that the human might have owed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, a Reptilian could only claim up to twelve Eligible Prey per year. That being said, there was no limit on those classified as Hospital Food, who were suffering from terminal illnesses or required extensive life support systems, nor those declared Legal Prey, who had committed violent crimes against their fellow people. Likewise, if they came across a dead body that, after a proper investigation on if the death was from foul play, accident, or natural causes, was found to have no Designated Predator, they could claim the body. Likewise, if someone that they had been declared a Designated Predator for died, they could claim that body as well. Of course, if human meat wasn't on the menu, there was always beef, pork, goat, sheep, and other large animals, which made up the main diet of the Reptilians anyways, along with some fruit and vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to follow as?</i></span></div></div>",

Laying in a bed was an elderly woman, who was hooked up to a number of machines, monitoring her vital signs. She was talking to some younger people, her teenage grandchildren to be specific. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScalis was glad for this: it had taken some time to track them down, as their parents had been killed in an accident ten years back, and they'd been adopted by a pair of Reptilians, who had also gotten to claim their parents' bodies as meals. Eventually, they'd moved, and the woman had lost track of her grandchildren as a result. Luckily, Scalis had some contacts, who were able to help locate the family, and since the woman was dying from a rare form of cancer, the Reptilians took some vacation time and brought their stepchildren to see their grandmother. That had been six months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScalis looked at the Reptilians, who were also watching what was going on. They'd been friends with the woman's only daughter and her husband, which explained why they had claimed the bodies, as well as adopted the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you plan afterwards?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably head back,\" said Slish, the stepfather. \"We've made our home on the West Coast after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try locating their other grandparents,\" said Mirsh, the stepmother. \"I'm certain that they might still be alive, although Danny never talked about them much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't blame him,\" Slish muttered. He looked at Scalis. \"She did leave our children money, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScalis handed him a packet. \"Two separate trust funds, one for each of them. They cannot touch the money until they turn eighteen years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlish chuckled. \"Figures.\" He then became a bit more serious. \"What about your fee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScalis chuckled back. \"I've already been paid with plenty of money, and if what I've been paid is just an indication of what she has,  your children won't have to worry about any debt for a long time, providing that they invest their money wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Slish. He looked through the window. \"Does she have a Designated Predator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScalis nodded. \"That would be me. Once she dies, I get to claim her body. That's part of the deal I tend to make, especially in cases such as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you enjoy her,\" said Mirsh. \"To be honest, I wish we hadn't lost contact with her all those years ago. But, you know how it is, when one moves around, and change telecoms, and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they got the last six months,\" said Slish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when they heard a sound, looked up, and saw that the machines listed the woman's vital signs as none. The older teenager held onto the younger, once the truth started to sink in. The pair eventually walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we got to say 'Good-bye' to grandma,\" the younger one said, tears in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see her again some day,\" said Mirsh, as she and Slish comforted their children. \"Now, let's head on down. I'm sure that Rez and Mir are missing you while they've waited in the cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Scalis was walking home. The elderly woman didn't make much of a bulge in his stomach, especially given the way her health had deteriorated during the last few weeks. Still, he felt that he was lucky to have known the woman. She'd held on long enough to see her grandchildren, and spend six months with them, making up for lost time. It was something to be admired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he made it to a place in the wealthier section of the city. He walked up to the door, and opened it.</span></div></div>",

He then picked up a ladle, and poured some gravy over his head. \"Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiler carefully grabbed the old man, placed her jaws over his head and shoulders, and started the process of swallowing him. The gravy helped slide her meal down her throat, along with some help from gravity. Eventually, she got to his groin, and feeling a sense of mischief, decided to give him one last thrill. She could feel him squirm with pleasure, and for a moment, she worried that she might give him a heart attack, but eventually, it was clear he'd gotten his last pleasure. She then resumed swallowing. Soon enough, his body had been sent down her throat, and all that was left to do was wait. She picked up the glass of wine, and finished off what was in it. Good year indeed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ziler patted her belly as she felt her meal squirm around a bit, finding a comfortable position. \"Let me know if you change your mind,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully got up, walked over to the living room, got out a good book, sat in a comfortable chair, and started reading her book, while she waited. Her meals tended to react to their final moments in one of three ways, simply waiting, giving themselves some self-pleasure, or giving her some pleasure by rubbing her insides. It felt like the old man was simply waiting, listening to her heartbeat, as they eventually lost consciousness, passing away peacefully. Given the man's health issues, and just how painful a Natural Death would have otherwise been, it was not to difficult to understand why the man preferred to die as a willing meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiler looked at her Communicator. Once the man finally passed away, she'd have to fill out the Predation Report. Luckily, she'd already filled out most of the necessary sections, which were about both her and her meal - Name, Age, Address, Debts, Health, and so on. If the man owed money, she would have been responsible for paying off his debts, but he didn't have any debts, and instead had nieces and nephews who would have just squandered it all away, ruining his business. This way, she'd get everything, legally, and could sell it to those who would better appreciate the business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, she did have to pay attention to the old man, who sat within her. If he changed his mind, she'd have to vomit him back up. Of course, if she had felt that any monies he owed were too much for her to pay off, then she'd have vomited him up. As it was, the man didn't have any debts, or at least had paid off any he'd owed, the result being a pure profit for her, especially since his will listed her as the soul benefactor. Granted, some might call it into question, but that was where having a good lawyer came in handy, who knew all the legal loopholes, and thus the old man had declared his relatives inadequate, naming her, his Designated Predator, as his heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiler smiled as she looked at the money she was going to get, which would happen within a few weeks, once things were cleared up with the various financial institutions, and other such places. Of course, she was smart - while she had a preference for meals that were wealthy, there were plenty of those designated as Hospital Food who had no way of paying their medical bills and didn't want to pass those debts onto their children, which was where she came into the picture. One very wealthy meal could help clear the debts of a dozen poorer ones, if not more. Knowing that their deaths wouldn't be a burden to their families tended to make their Final Decisions easier, like naming her their Designated Predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiler then looked at her book, and resumed reading it. It was a good one, involving a single father trying to raise a daughter, and soon a single woman enters his life. Granted, there were a dozen more with similar plots out there, but it was always interesting how people tended to put a spin on the same story. Besides, reading was a good way to wait for the time to pass, until the old man had passed out and was considered Legally Dead, mainly because, even if she'd vomited him up at that point, revival odds were low, with odds of survival with no issues being even lower. In any case, she gave him every opportunity to change his mind, and would continue to do so, until it was too late for him to actually live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the old man had stopped moving, for the last time, and didn't even respond to any of Ziler's pattings, in any shape or form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest easy, friend,\" Ziler said. She then picked the communicator back up, and submitted the Predation Report. The old man, thus declared dead, was now nothing more than a meal for her body to digest. He hadn't been the first she'd eaten, and wouldn't be the last. Of course, like most Reptilians, she would have to do plenty of physical activity in order to work the weight off, even if he didn't weigh much more than a hundred pounds.</span></div></div>",

Due to this near-death experience, Corrine tends to shutdown when she comes face-to-face with a reptilian.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrine looked at her timepiece. Any moment now, her new roommate would arrive. She wouldn't have minded a roommate, except for one thing; he was going to be a Reptilian. She was afraid of Reptilians, although she tried to mask this with hate instead. She knew that she owed her life to one, but only because another had tried to eat her without permission. Even ten years later, she still awoke in a cold sweat at times, dreaming of going down that slick throat, this time with no way out. She could still feel those claws, and those teeth. She froze whenever one came near her. At least she could work from the apartment, and the other tenants could get her stuff, and they were all human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had changed the moment Mr. Skinetzy decided to install a new walk-in refrigerator, not to mention a new walk-in freeze, and an oven. The oven alone could hold, and cook, two whole pigs, while the refrigerator and freezer could each hold a dozen more of the same. Mr. Skinetzy never got new appliances for the place, not unless something broke and couldn't be fixed, and even then, the appliances were generally items that even Used and Second-Hand places tended to toss out. In short, she'd known that the place was about to get a Reptilian tenant, but she all but freaked out upon seeing the Reptilian-sized bed being brought into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she had argued. \"I <i>don't</i> want one of <i>them</i> in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you pay the rent this month?\" Mr. Skinetzy asked. \"For the entire room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she had admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Skietzy grinned. \"Then stop being so selfish. You wouldn't want to deny a paying tenant their right to have a roof over their head, unless you wish to be kicked out, and face all of those scalies out there. Be nice, and maybe he won't bite you. Or, maybe he'll do us both a favor and eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been two days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Corrine had to face the fact that the dream of not having to deal with another Reptilian up close was about to be shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a vehicle come into the lot. What she saw surprised her; the value of the vehicle was easily worth twice the value of all of the other vehicles in the lot, and that was if the vehicles were all new. As the Reptilian stepped out, she saw that the clothes on him were worth more than everything she had in her dressers. The timepiece on his wrist alone could have accounted for the value of the entire room, with plenty to spare for all of the other rooms on the floor. He got out his suitcase, and a few other things, each of which were highly valuable in their own rights. Then, he turned his head, and for a moment, Corrine was afraid that he'd spotted her watching him, but he looked past her, as if taking it all in. She then watched as he walked towards the door, finally losing sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who is he?</i> she wondered. <i>Why would he want to live in a dump like this when he could easily afford his own place?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese questions puzzled her, right up until the moment her door opened, and there stood Mr. Skietzy, along with the Reptilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your roommate, Miss Corrine Jones,\" he said. \"I'm sure you'll enjoy her company, although I will warn you, Mr. Zkints, she doesn't like Reptilians. Maybe you can liven her ideas up a bit. Let me know if you need any help with the rest of your things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" the Reptilian said. \"But I can take care of that myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Skietzy. \"See you later. You can join us for supper, or eat in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any issues with me having a dinner guest here?\" the Reptilian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problems either way,\" said Mr. Skietzy. \"They can come here to enjoy dinner, or be dinner themselves. I have no issues, so long as you don't make too much of a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" the Reptilian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'll be off,\" said Mr. Skietzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left, leaving Corrine alone with the Reptilian. The Reptilian looked at her. He then looked over at his bed. \"Does he buy from the bottom of the trash heap for everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy is real cheap,\" Corrine managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" the Reptilian said, walking over to it. He then sat on it. The noise was deafening. \"At least it didn't break.\" He looked over at her. \"Sloish Zkints is my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine,\" Corinne said, nervously. \"Corrine Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that you're afraid of me,\" said Sloish. \"Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid,\" Corrine said, defensibly. \"I just don't like Reptilians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish chuckled. \"I'm read good at reading people; it comes in handy for my job. That and I took psychology classes, which also helps with the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, what job is that?\" Corrine asked, as it might explain his valuable possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish grinned. \"Easy, I'm...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe you'll never get over your fear, but at least you won't freeze like a deer that has a light shining in their eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people respond to fear by fighting, others by fleeing, and then there are those who freeze,\" said Sloish. \"Basically, you're hoping that I'll ignore you, and leave you be, and once I'm away, you'll be able to relax, and you won't feel like you're trapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one who is afraid of Reptilians,\" said Sloish. \"I mean, we're bigger, stronger, and, let's face it, we do eat humans at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your kind does eat humans,\" Corrine said, as she got back to her typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone tried to eat you, didn't they?\" Sloish asked. \"You can feel their claws, their teeth, their tongue on your body, along with saliva, as well as their warm breath as they try to swallow you. Even now you feel these very things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't talk about it,\" said Corrine. \"I don't even want to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how are you going to get over it?\" Sloish asked. \"I want to help you through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine turned and looked at him. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's my job,\" said Sloish. \"I can see that you're in trouble. If I can help you lead a normal life, then I'll have done my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My life is just fine,\" said Corrine, turning back to her communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many friends do you have, Miss Jones, specifically ones that don't need to come right to your room, or use a communicator, in order to talk to you?\" Sloish asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine paused. There wasn't any she could think of offhand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Friend with Benefits kind of friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve to be able to go out there, and live your life, the way you want to,\" said Sloish. \"You desire those things, but your fear has left you trapped in this place, at the whims of a landlord who is going to get a rude awakening if things aren't up to code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that when a Reptilian expressed interest in renting a room here, he suddenly got a new refrigerator, freezer, and oven,\" said Sloish. \"I want to make sure that he got the Safe ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe ones?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose some kids are playing, and lets suppose that one of them decides that those items look like good hiding places, I'd sleep better knowing that the kid can get out without needing help from the outside,\" said Sloish. \"Otherwise, they might suffocate, freeze, or get cooked to death, and none of those are pretty pictures, and that's just when it's just pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you going to test them out?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a guinea pig, yourself perhaps,\" said Sloish. \"After all, if you can't open them, a child certainly couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine gulped at this. \"Not interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" said Sloish. \"I was willing to pay the full rent of this room for six months if you agreed. Whole process would take no more than thirty minutes at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine thought for a moment. Six months without paying for rent did sound like a good deal for just a few minutes of inconvenience. Still, was it really worth it, to be trapped in an appliance that was meant for food?</span></div></div>",

Then, when things go bad, I want them to remember those good things, so that when I have to ask the tough questions, they can trust me enough to answer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're serious about doing all of that, just to help me out?\" Corrine asked. \"And all you're asking in return is to help you test out those appliances, and go out with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You drive a hard bargain,\" said Corrine. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish grinned. \"I'm sure you'll get a better deal than I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Corrine was putting her clothes back on, hoping that her skin would turn to its normal color soon. The freezer had turned too cold too soon after the door had been shut, resulting in Sloish having to, quite literally, warm up the oven in order to keep her core temperature from dropping too low. Then, of course, Sloish asked her, once her strength had returned to a more normal level, to try to force the door open from the inside. She hadn't been able to open it. Nor had she been able to open the freezer door prior to getting too cold, nor the refrigerator door for that matter. She watched as Sloish gave Mr. Skinetzy probably the biggest dressing down anyone had ever given the man, all in front of the other tenants, who had watched the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she couldn't get out without help, you tell me how a child is supposed to get out of them,\" Sloish said. \"These things are major safety hazards. You are to replace them with current models, within two days, or else some of my friends from the Apartment Inspection Unit will pay you a visit, and you'll be having to explain to them why these things aren't up to code, and they will be checking everything else that is your responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was informed that they were up to code,\" said Mr. Skinetzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things were out of Code before even <i>she</i> was born, if not prior to that,\" Sloish hissed. \"I'm surprised that you've managed to get them up and running, as most have been decommissioned due to the very safety hazards that lead to them being banned by everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But new ones are expensive,\" said Mr. Skinetzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as expensive as a lawsuit,\" said Sloish. \"As it is, I wonder just how many other Code violations this place has; if it was just the oven, fridge, and freezer units, I'd be willing to let you off with a warning, but the fact that you, quite literally, forced one of your tenants to put up with someone she doesn't trust as a roommate has me curious. As it is, I might just call AIU, and let them deal with you anyways. In fact, I could probably be a better Apartment Supervisor than you, or hire someone to do it for me, and get everything fixed the way it should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Mr. Skinetzy said, nervously. \"I'll get right on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better,\" said Sloish. \"Miss Jones, let's take a look at your wardrobe. I want to see what you have before we go out to dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine had to laugh as she looked through her clothes, just as Sloish brought in his things. \"I've never seen anyone do that, and you never even told him that you're a Law Enforcement officer. You only told him that you'd managed to make an agreement with me to help check out those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he thinks that I have connections within the department, it might lead me to whomever it is that's been looking the other way around here,\" said Sloish. He then looked at Corrine's clothes. \"Definitely need to get you some better clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get out, if at all,\" said Corrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish smiled. \"I told you that I'd buy you something to wear.\" He then offered his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine looked at it nervously. She looked up at Sloish's eyes. There was a kindness to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll understand if you don't take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine gulped, and managed to conquer her fear long enough to place her hand in his. He gently closed his fingers, so that she could get away if it turned out to be too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a step in the right direction,\" said Sloish. \"Now, let's get you something more suitable to wear.\"</span></div></div>",

They were easily worth six months worth of rent, and that wasn't even counting the other clothes that Sloish had bought for her. True, most were casual, or even utilitarian, but there were plenty of fairly fancy clothes that were now in the back of the vehicle, just for her. The only issue was that the owner of the clothing story was a Reptilian, but the moment that Sloish had said, \"She's like Jenny,\" the owner frowned, nodded, and then pointed to some human assistants, who took care of everything else, from getting the items, helping her try them on, all while the owner stood at a respectful distance, as if to give her room to escape if she had wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who is this Jenny you mentioned back there?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me and Zeffier go back a ways, and Zeffier had an understanding with a human named Jenny,\" said Sloish. \"Still does, if you want to be technical. She loved being his pretend meal, and he loved swallowing her, and both of them loved having sex with the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that someone, who was a human-sized Reptilian, broke into the place while Zeffier was out, and Jenny was all alone,\" said Sloish. \"They did a number upon her, and were about to do worse when Zaffier came home early. He managed to save her, and ate the attacker, but the damage was done. Even now, Jenny can't stand to be touched by a Reptilian, including those she was on good terms with. She has that same look you gave me whenever I see her, like that of a mouse cornered by a cat, trying to find a way out. But, Zaffier loves her, and if that means that he can't be closer than five paces from her in order for her to still be comfortable and be in the same room as her, he's willing to stay that far away, until she lets him to come closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like he cares about her then,\" said Corrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish smiled. \"They were engaged to be married. He's willing to wait until she is ready to accept his touch, so that he can kiss her lips himself, and not hire a stand-in to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine smiled at this. Then she looked at the Club. It was the kind of place that screamed \"Exclusive! Members only!\" She looked at Sloish. \"Are you a member here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Members of the Authorities get a ten percent discount here, along with whomever they bring,\" said Sloish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they eat humans here?\" Corrine asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish smiled. \"Yes, but there's privacy screens around the booths, so you won't see, or hear, what's going on. Also, most of the humans eaten here are those listed as Hospital Food. It's a way that they can go out with style. It's rather interesting, if you ever decide to try the foodplay version of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they allow foodplay here?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish nodded. \"Ninety-five percent of those classified as Eligible Prey that come here do engage in that, and aren't permanently eaten by the Reptilian they came in with. As for Hospital Food, sometimes it takes a bit of practice, before they make the final decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if they do decide to be a meal?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the predator picks up the tab, among other things,\" said Sloish. \"Now, let's go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Corrine was sitting in a booth, which had its privacy screen open, with her close to the opening, so that she could leave if she wanted to. A human waiter came, gave them the menus, and asked them if they wanted anything to drink. Corrine ordered a water, as did Sloish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why just a water?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish grinned. \"I'm driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked over the menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine looked at Sloish. \"Are you planning on having a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They prefer it if one brings their own in,\" said Sloish.  He looked at her. \"Something tells me that you aren't ready for that sort of thing, and probably won't be for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine shook her head. \"I doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, they do a good lamb here, along with other good-sized animals,\" said Sloish. \"They also have some good slices of meats as well, to say nothing about salads and everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that I'd come to a place like this, even if I wasn't afraid of your kind,\" said Corrine. \"I mean, how can you afford all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish grinned, and said...</span></div></div>",

The smell from it was also quite lovely, and made her own mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish chuckled. \"Would you like some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine all but blushed. \"Well, I wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish took a knife, carved off a section of the lamb, and placed the piece on her plate. \"I hope that you enjoy it, Miss Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine took her knife and fork, cut off a smaller piece, and tried it. \"It's not what I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish grinned. \"Lightly seared, possibly raw with some seasonings sprinkled on it, or possibly not even skinned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, something like that,\" said Corrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish chuckled. \"I'll admit, I like raw meat, but, when I'm with someone, cooked meat is easier to share. That, and cooked meat is easier to digest compared to raw meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about human meat?\" Corrine asked. \"How do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends,\" said Sloish. \"If they had a special request, I'll do them like that. If they are dead, I fully cook them. If still alive, and it's part of their request, just a light tan, much like you yourself got. Others, a herbal-type bath might be what they want. Finally, there's those who just want to be eaten plain. In any case, with a willing, and living, meal, one has to always give them the option to say 'No', or one runs into problems. Those who don't give humans that option, they are just murderers, if not worse. Me, I could never eat an unwilling human, unless said human had made the mistake of trying to harm those I care about. Others out there, they make my scales itch something fierce when they talk about how humans are nothing more than talking meat. I enjoy eating human meat, but after I eat them, I want to think about them, read a book they liked to read, look through photos, talk to their family, and get to know them, preferably before I do eat them. In fact, most Reptilians I know actually take the time to get to know the perspective meal-to be, even becoming part of the family in some cases, or at least be a family friend. I don't like the idea of randomly asking a stranger to be my meal, because you'd barely know them. I mean, spend a few weeks with them, sure, or even longer. Something like a human, that's worth the wait, as that lets them get their affairs in order, and all of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't eat a human every month?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloish chuckled. \"More like every three months, and usually with those designated as Hospital Food. Foodplay, on the other hand, I enjoy that whenever I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt that I could help you out with that,\" said Corrine. \"The idea just scares me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you,\" said Sloish. \"However, if you ever want to try to get over it, well, I'm willing to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, they returned to the apartment. The meal had been good, and Corrine had eventually tried some wine. Admittedly, it had been a while since her last drink, and the two glasses were more than enough to make her a little tipsy.

Ok with most predation in general, although he has a slight fear of the more \u2018criminal-type\u2019 reptilians who don\u2019t really abide by \u2018human consent\u2019. Other than that, he has a few reptilian friends and sees their predation of willing, dying or outlawed humans as harmless, if not, good for society.

He\u2019s been trying to work up the courage to ask his crush out, but after he had cold feet on graduation night he thought it was all over.

She\u2019s open to others who are willing to be eaten, but she enjoys fixing peoples mouths, not getting shoved in them. This means she comes fairly close on a daily basis with the maws of many customers, some human, some reptilian. She is passionate about her work, is friendly with all reptilians, but she\u2019s not a fan of how some of her clients eye her. Unlike some humans who might cower in the face of a hungry reptilian she usually has a much more playful attitude, attempting to tease and sometimes humiliate those who get a bit too up-close and personal with her. She\u2019s willing to show anyone who thinks they can \u2018woo\u2019 her down their esophagus that she\u2019s no pushover, even if said person is six feet taller and a few hundred pounds heavier than her.</span></div></div>",

A large, female reptilian with light tan scales, a punk band t-shirt, denim jacket, and thigh-hugging leggings was now standing in the drink/freezer aisle. As she scanned her dozens of drink options, she could smell the tasty scent of human\u2026 as well as the pungent scent of arousal. The reptilian in question was an old classmate of Phil\u2019s from high school, Hixia Lyopel, a muscular female reptile who was uncharacteristically tall for a female at almost 11 feet, and a track and wrestling team prodigy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil\u2019s heart was nearly in his throat as his stomach churned in disgust, knotting together, meanwhile, he couldn\u2019t help but have his \u2018little soldier\u2019 strike a tent in his pants. The combination of him being a sexually frustrate 18-year-old human and that huge butt and thick thighs that could probably crush him to death drove the young man wild. The human somehow found a way to make his legs move towards her as he opened his mouth, \u201cU-um\u2026 Hixia\u2026 I\u2026 sorry I\u2026\u201d The huge reptiless turned her head and looked down at Phil with a grin, \u201cHey Phil. What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil chuckled nervously, \u201cI\u2026 I work here.\u201d Hixia could barely stifle a giggled, \u201cWait, really? Get out! That\u2019s um\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, that sucks.\u201d Phil shrugged and smiled, \u201cThe pay is ok. So\u2026 Hixia\u2026 could I ask something?\u201d The reptile got a sly smirk on her snout, she pointed a clawed finger between Phil\u2019s legs, \u201cDoes it have to do with the tent in your pants?\u201d Phil blushed and covered his junk as Hixia giggled, rolling her eyes, \u201cOh, mammals! I\u2019m picking up a vibe from you Phil\u2026 the kinda vibe that says you like me\u2026 either that or you\u2019re really excited to feed me.\u201d Phil blushed, she was on to him, but she didn\u2019t realize he both wanted to date her and become her little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his blush intensifying, Phil nervously scratched the back of his head, sporting a goofy smirk, \u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 funny you should say that because\u2026\u201d \u201cCLERK! CLERK! The self-check-out is broken!\u201d Phil peaked out the end of the aisle and saw an elderly reptilian woman, angrily tapping her foot against the floor, \u201cGrrrrr, this place always hires slackers. Where is that human?\u201d Phil spun back around and blurted out, \u201cHixia-Will-You-Go-Out-With-Me?\u201d Phil scrunched his eyes shut, despite Hixia being a kind and caring reptilian, he half-expected her to sneer at him and whack him into the potato chips stand with her muscular tail. But the feeling of getting flung into the air never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly opened his eyes to see a grinning Hixia, now picking out an Iced Tea from the refrigerated section, \u201cOh\u2026 were you done thinking I was going to bite you in half or something?\u201d Phil spoke softly, \u201cSo\u2026 is it\u2026 a yes?\u201d Hixia walked in front of the human, bending down and delivering a long and slobbery lick across his face, leaving a trail of reptile drool, \u201cWhat do you think tasty? I\u2019ll be waiting for you outside once your shift is over, now come ring me and this poor old lady up.\u201d After getting a mouth-full from the old reptilian woman and about half-an-hour of clean-up, Phil handed off his shift to the nightshift clerk and walked out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crickets were chirping in the humid summer night air, and sitting at a bench near the store was Hixia, chomping away at a raw pig leg and gulping down mouth-full\u2019s of her Iced Tea. The reptilian let out a nasty belch as she eyed Phil, smiling ear to ear and waving, \u201cHey there, cute stuff.\u201d She scooted over a bit and patted the bench, \u201cHere, sit next to me.\u201d Phil happily took a seat next to her, the reptile\u2019s tail came up behind the human and gently wrapped itself around his waist. Between sloppy chomps and noisy chewing, Hixia asked, \u201cSo\u2026 the night is still young; only ten at night. You up for something fun?\u201d Phil started pondering\u2026</span></div></div>",

His crush was a muscular male reptile, Juxej \u201cDragon\u201d Vivlix. He was nicknamed Draco or Dragon by his classmates and gym coach for his rippling muscular form, as well as his blood deep green scales and mint underbelly, giving him the look of a classical dragon from human folklore. Juxej both loved and hated the nickname, knowing the \u2018dragon\u2019 was commonly used by racist humans as anti-reptilian propaganda, yet that word has mostly disappeared from popular culture and most of his peers used it as a way to celebrate his powerful stature, not paint him as a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil was absolutely amazed by the creature before him, nearly 12 feet in height, Juxej\u2019s thighs and arms were nearly as thick as Phil\u2019s entire body. The human loved seeing the reptiles huge back muscles bulge and move about under his thin t-shirt. The t-shirt was wet too, and he could smell a tinge of sweat coming off of him, he must\u2019ve been going for a run on account of the light panting. Juxej picked up a large strip of raw beef and his stomach growled audibly, the hulking lizard spun around and screamed upon seeing Phil standing behind him, the reptile fell over and dropped his beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching his breath he chuckled at Phil, \u201cGeez, Phil\u2026 don\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d Picking himself up off the floor, Juxej asked, \u201cWhy\u2019d ya\u2019 sneak up on me like that? You workin\u2019 here for the summer?\u201d Phil tried to his best to keep his mind in order, \u201cUm\u2026 ugh, y-yeah. I work-I work here! Wanted to save up some dough, ya\u2019 know\u2026 So\u2026 what are you doing here?\u201d Juxej wiped his forehead, \u201cJust picking up a little snack and a drink after my nightly run. Gotta keep in shape, I\u2019m on scholarship for Mziox College. They want me to play Football for them\u2026 honestly I\u2019m more of a Soccer kinda guy, but scholarship\u2019s a scholarship am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil chuckled and shrugged, \u201cI guess so\u2026 um\u2026 so\u2026 I was curious\u2026\u201d Juxej\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou wanna ask me something?\u201d Phil nodded, he could barely control himself eying up this huge reptilian male, his six-pack under his sweaty shirt looked glorious, \u201cUm\u2026 yeah\u2026 was wondering if you could eat me-not like\u2026 digest me, eat me\u2026 like\u2026 foodplay eat me?\u201d Juxej nodded and grinned, \u201cThat sounds good to me. I never pass up a meal, and you look tasty.\u201d Juxej happily licked his lips and rubbed his paws together. Phil continued, \u201cOk great\u2026 but, um\u2026 would you also\u2026 wanna\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 go out, like on a date\u2026 as a couple?\u201d Juxej\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cReally?\u201d Phil blushed deeply and looked around nervously, \u201cUm\u2026 yeah\u2026 but like\u2026 if you don\u2019t want to we could-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuxej spoke up, \u201cYa\u2019 know, I\u2019ve always thought you were cute. Sure, why not!? You\u2019re a pretty cute human\u2026 and you\u2019ve got a nice little, squeeze-able butt on you.\u201d Juxej grinned and winked at Phil. The human grinned ear-to-ear, \u201cR-really? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s-thank you. Thank you! So my shift ends in ten minutes, how about we-\u201c Before Phil could finish Juxej\u2019s huge tongue splattered across his face, the reptile murred at the human\u2019s taste, \u201cListen, I can see you\u2019re a bit flustered. Just clean up, and I\u2019ll be waiting outside for you. Then we can start getting to know each other a little better.\u201d Juxej patted Phil on the back, as the human composed himself and turned around to start counting up the register, he could feel Juxej\u2019s claws pinch his butt and he heard the reptile snickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil eventually returned the register and handed off the store to the nightshift employee. The human\u2019s heart leapt into his throat as he stepped outside of the store and eyed Juxej, leaning against the side of the convenience store. The reptile approached Phil, his stomach still growling, \u201cHey, hey\u2026 my midnight snack has arrived. Tasty and cute. I must be one lucky reptilian.\u201d Phil blushed at his praise, he couldn\u2019t believe it. The human smirked and poked at Juxej\u2019s belly, \u201cHey, don\u2019t count yourself out big guy, I\u2019m lucky to have such a big, hungry reptile as my date.\u201d The two chuckled before Phil continued, \u201cSo\u2026 whatta ya\u2019 wanna do now?\u201d A mischievous grin formed on Juxej\u2019s snout as his slit pupils sized-up Phil.</span></div></div>",

He did feel rather unsure of himself. The warmth on his hand from Juxej's mouth felt rather inviting, and yet, he was worried. He knew what could happen if he became Juxej's meal, in that he would die. But, on the other hand, it wasn't like there were any real pressures he could think of that really gave him a strong reason to really live. He had a number of older siblings, some of which already had children of their own. He hadn't applied to any collages. He didn't have any place that he really wished to see. He didn't have a girlfriend to visit on the weekend. There wasn't any real disadvantage if he did become Juxej's meal. Also, if he'd owed any money, Juxej would have to take care of it. He'd also become a part of Juxej.

The class was waiting, obviously excited, yet trying to hold it in. After all, it was the last day of school for the year, and within a few ticks, the bell would ring, letting the students out for a few months, before most went off to higher learning, or got a job in the workforce, while a few others would end up in someone's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria Viner had a smile on her face, or rather, a sad one. It was her last day as well, the cancer being too much for her. She had made the decision to retire, which was rather painful for her, but at least she was there to see her last class make it through the day. Soon, the bell rang, the students got up, and started to leave the room. However, unlike the other days, where they normally rushed out, this time, they each walked up to her, and thanked her, telling her how much they'd miss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope to see you again, Miss Viner,\" said Zurman, a rather tall Reptilian, as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled. It had been rather touching, to see all of them thank her for helping them become the fine humans and Reptilians they'd grown into. She sat down, with a sigh. Maybe retirement would have been nice, if she was in her sixties, and was healthy. However, she was sick, and had counted herself lucky to have made it through the school year without passing away in front of her class. But now, it was unlikely that she'd make it to the beginning of the next year. She looked at the desks - almost fifteen years worth of students had graduated from her class - she'd seen many of her students's siblings come through, plenty of cousins, and a few uncles and aunts to others who'd come after them, although there were a few odd situations where couples had ended up having a late child the same time their eldest had had children of their own, which had made things slightly tricky the one year she'd thought both an uncle and a niece in the same class, with the niece being a few months older. Still, she was proud to have been there for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, she felt tired. A little nap before her friend came by wouldn't hurt. She placed her arms on her desk, folded them up, laid her head on them, closed her eyes, and soon fell asleep, without a care in the world.</span></div></div>",

He had it, and the doctor's guess that he must have given it to you when he raped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian laid back down. \"He didn't just rape me; he killed me. Dead girl walking, that's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's negativity talking Viv,\" said Zir. \"With treatment, you could live a normal lifespan of seventy plus years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who would want to marry me, or have children with me, knowing what it is I have,\" said Vivian. \"I don't want my children to have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's treatments you can take to prevent your children from getting it,\" said Zir. \"Of course, there's always adoption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd of been better off dead,\" Vivian muttered. \"Just put me in the frying pan already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZir gently squeezed Vivian's wrist. \"I'm going to call that the shock talking, and not an actual request for me to eat you,\" she said. \"I won't eat you unless you honestly want me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian looked at her, and sighed. \"I guess I'm having a hard time taking it in. I wanted to be a feisty old woman when my time came. I wanted to have plenty of children. I wanted to get married. There's a lot of things I wanted and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still have them,\" said Zir. \"Remember back in school, when I was taking my Human consumption classes, at how nervous we both were, when you were picked to be my practice meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" said Vivian. \"Names in a bowl, and you pulled my name out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember how we sat down together, to try to figure things out, and how we decided to talk about something else instead?\" Zir asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian nodded. \"Helped me to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZir smiled. \"Same here. Then, when we did it, I found that I liked your taste, and that you liked being in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian blushed. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we started playing around, using different condiments and such,\" said Zir. \"Some I thought complimented you, and others didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never do wasabi again,\" said Vivian. \"Even I had issues with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, when you took those rock climbing classes, you designated me as your Predator, in the event of an accident,\" said Zir. \"That was one of the happiest moments I've had with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that you'd enjoy me if something happened,\" said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Viv, I'm asking for you to do me a favor,\" said Zir. \"I want you to live, not just for me, Zirarne Lizar, but for yourself, Vivian Tanner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian smiled as she looked at her friend. \"You've always had a convincing manner about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to be a good Predator otherwise,\" Zir said, with a chuckle. \"That being said, if you want, I could ask the doctor to come in with the forms needed to classify you as Hospital Food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian chuckled. \"Might as well.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a world where Humans were not the only ones to evolve into sentience. For in addition to humans, there was a race known as the Reptilians. One theory is that they are, somehow, related to a group of reptiles that once roamed the land millions of years prior. Of course, like that of Humans, their fossil record isn't all that neat, so the connection isn't exactly known. However, what is known for certain is this: part of their diet includes humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly how this started is unknown, as Humans and Reptilians have co-existed for millennia. One theory is that the two groups have existed in relative harmony, and when a human was dying, from injury or sickness, they'd seek out a Worthy Reptilian to consume them. Others theorize that Humans, who evolved at some point after the Reptilians, looked at the earlier race as if they were Gods, and thus would offer themselves up to their Masters. Another theory is that, somehow, Humans were either created, or captured, in order to be livestock for the more higher ranked members of an ancient Reptilian civilization, only for the humans to either escape, or create an uprising, that eventually brought the Reptilian dominated civilization down or at least forced some sort of agreement between the two races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is known is this - Reptilians are allowed to claim Humans as a meal, but they have to follow certain Rules, which are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Rights of Consent and Refusal. A Reptilian has to gain the Consent of the Human that they want to eat in order to eat them. If the Human gives Consent, they can be eaten. However, this Consent can be Refused at any point, before being swallowed, and even after being swallowed, at least up until the Human passes out. Reptilians who do not respect the Right of Refusal, and still eat the human or do not vomit them back up if the human is in their stomach can be charged with Murder, which is punishable by being declared Legal Prey, wherein one lacks these rights and thus can be eaten without legal consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Reptilians may claim up to twelve humans classified as Eligible Prey per year. Those classified as Eligible Prey are 18 years or older, and either have no children, or have made arrangements for others to take care of their children, which can even include the Predator themselves. Should the Human have any financial debts, the Reptilian that eats them is required to help pay off said debts afterwards. They are to also report the consumption of the human to the Authorities, as well as turn in any of the meal's personal items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. There is no limit on those classified as Legal Prey that a Reptilian may consume. Legal Prey doesn't have the Rights of Consent and Refusal. Those classified as this are criminals found Guilty of Capital Crimes, such as Rape and Murder and other such heinous crimes. All a Reptilian has to do afterwards is report the consumption to the Authorities. In such cases, it's possible for the Reptilian to claim a reward if the Legal Prey was an escaped prisoner with a price upon their head - more if turned in alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. There is no limit on those Classified as Hospital Food that a Reptilian may consume. Hospital Food has the Rights of Consent and Refusal. People are classified as this, by their own Consent, if they have a Terminal Illness or require an extensive amount of Life Support devices in order to survive. Reptilians who consume those classified as Hospital Food have to report the consumption to the Authorities and are required to help pay any financial debts that the Human owed. Likewise, depending on prior arrangements, the Reptilian is allowed to adopt their meal's children. Interestingly, if an otherwise healthy Human notices that Reptilians are asking them if they wish to be eaten by them more often than usual, it is usually a sign that something is wrong with their health, and thus often see their doctor as a result - this is because Reptilians have an instinct for knowing if a human is in fact ill, even if the human doesn't realize it, which actually leads to treatment for illnesses that can be treated at early stages that might otherwise prove fatal later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Reptilians are not allowed to eat those classified as Ineligible Prey. These include those under the age of 18 years, single parents who haven't had a permanent caretaker of their children set up, people who have highly important jobs, like Doctors, Law Enforcement, Firefighting, and other such positions. That being said, the Ineligibility can be voluntarily waived, or legally taken away, except for those under the age of 18 years. Those who voluntarily waive the privilege have the Rights of Consent and Refusal, and are treated much like Eligible Prey in all other aspects. Those who had it Legally taken away, usually as part of a criminal punishment, tend to be reclassified as Legal Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Depending on the situation, a Human can designate a Reptilian that they know as their Designated Predator, in an event where they might lose the ability to communicate, such as a coma due to a severe head injury, or even a sudden death like the result of an accident, or death by natural causes such as a heart attack. In such cases, this doesn't count towards the Reptilian's limit of 12 Eligible Prey, but they might have to follow other things that their meal asked, such as taking care of their children if said children are under the age of 18, as well as helping to pay off any financial debts, not to mention contacting the Authorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. If a Reptilian finds a human body, they are required by law to report it, as the human might be the victim of a Murder, or have other issues. Should everything be straightened out, like the murder being solved, and if the deceased doesn't have a Designated Predator, the Reptilian that found the body can claim it as a meal, and it doesn't count towards their limit, nor do they have to help pay off any financial debts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. If a Reptilian comes across a violent crime being committed, like an armed robbery, or a rape, where it is clear that the offender is planning to cause harm to a victim, they may consume the culprit on the spot. In this case, if the culprit's would-be victim is able to communicate, they can state if the culprit should be brought back up to face the Law, or stay in the stomach to digest. If the victim is dead, or otherwise unable to communicate, the Reptilian makes the call themselves. In any situation, the Authorities are to be contacted, who may request for the culprit to be vomited back up if still alive to face proper Legal punishment, wherein the Reptilian tends to get first dibs on eating the culprit, or if the culprit is dead or had proven to be a repeat offender, they might allow the Reptilian to keep their meal. It is also possible for the Reptilian to claim a reward in such situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Reptilians also have a Right of Refusal. Basically, if a human asks a Reptilian to eat them, for whatever reason, if the human owes more debt than the Reptilian feels comfortable paying, or if the Reptilian believes that the human can survive their illness/injury, or the Reptilian is already at their 12 Eligible Prey limit, the Reptilian can refuse to eat the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReptilian Biology:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Physically, Reptilians resemble humanoid lizards. They also resemble them in matters such as reproduction, with each Reptilian being hatched from an egg, with up to six being laid in the average clutch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Reptilians are, on average, between 8 to 12 feet tall, weighing between 500 and 800 pounds, if in good shape, possibly more if muscular or obese. For the most part, the females are a third smaller than the males, both in height and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Reptilians come in a variety of colors, usually in shades of tan, grey, black and green, much like other reptiles. They can be solid in color, or have different patches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Reptilians are mainly carnivorous, as their bodies require a great deal of protein. However, while most consider human meat to be their favorite, they mainly eat other types of meat, such as pig, cattle, sheep, goat, and other large animals, as it isn't practical to make human meat be the main dish for every meal. Likewise, they can also eat plant matter in somewhat leaner times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Reptilians, upon reaching maturity at the age of 18 years, are more than capable of swallowing a fully grown human. This is partly due to their larger size, but also because they can unhinge their jaws to accommodate larger meals. This is also the time that they can legally start to consume humans, once they've gone through an important course in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Upon ingesting a living human, a Reptilian's stomach secretes a special enzyme, which acts as a mild sedative as well as a mild pleasure stimulant, wherein the human will eventually pass out, in a state of contentment. Of course, other outside factors, such as alcohol, sexual foreplay, or even consuming unwilling prey, can either increase, or reduce in the case of unwilling prey, the effectiveness of this enzyme. That being said, live prey <i>will</i> pass out within thirty minutes, due to a lack of adequate oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for the Interactive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Spelling and grammar are important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Oral Vore is the only Vore allowed. Likewise, Safe Vore, wherein the Reptilian vomits the Human up, such as part of a Roleplay, is allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sex between Humans and Reptilians is possible, but pregnancy is unlikely to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The interactive is to be story driven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The setting is Futuristic with an Everyday type of theme - not all dark and authoritarian, but not all sunshine and rainbows either, much like Real Life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. While human meat is a Reptilian's favorite meal, most make do on beef, pork, mutton, and other meats. As it is, it isn't unheard of for humans and Reptilians to engage in Foodplay, where humans act as a pretend meal, even being covered in condiments and toppings, gets swallowed by their partner, puts on a struggle inside of the stomach, and after a few minutes, is let out, safe and unharmed.</td>",
