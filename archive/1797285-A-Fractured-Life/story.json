In fact, I wasn't quite sure of much of anything; my mind felt clouded and broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hard as I tried, I couldn't remember. The only thing I knew for sure was that I was indoors. The room was too dark for me to make out any details; I could only tell that it was quiet and felt reasonably cool. I would have to get up and fumble around the room, trying to find some source of light, if I wanted any more information than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next question should've been simpler to answer, but I ended up just as stumped as with the first one. I could not remember any details of my life. My name... a blank. Where was I from, what did I do... all answered with nothing, along with my family, friends, and interests. Even basic things like my gender and my age didn't come to me at first (though it didn't take too long to figure those out on my own).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I was just as helpless as before on this. I couldn't quite plan anything out without knowing my situation first, could I? As I groggily tried to force myself to start remembering, I sat up, rubbing my forehead with my hand. My body felt sore all over, and the movement only made the headache worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambiguous voice in the darkness startled me, and I nearly let out a small scream. I looked around, but the room was still too dark to make any kind of judgement on what or where that voice was coming from. I racked my brain, trying to think of what I could do, but the only thing that came to mind was just to go ahead and talk to this voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right?\" the voice continued. \"Don't you recognize my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, a useless gesture in the dark but one I did by habit. \"I-I don't even remember who I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight chuckle came from the voice. \"How could you forget a thing like that?\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" I answered with mounting fear. \"Please, just tell me. Maybe it would help me jog my memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" the voice conceded, \"I'll help you. You are...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was hoping that her saying the name would jog my memory somehow, help me realize who I was and figure out what kind of situation I was in, but I had no such luck. Tanner Adams? That name didn't have any more importance to me than \"John Smith\". At least I did get some specific information about my age and what I was supposed to be doing, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanner?\" I repeated my name back, making sure I heard it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tanner,\" the voice said, this time a little more gruff. I could tell that whoever was talking was losing their patience. They also seemed to be an adult male. I decided to just play along with the situation for now, figuring things out as I went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" I said. \"I'm sorry, I'm just a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Listen, you've got twenty minutes before the bus gets here. Go ahead and get dressed, and I'll have breakfast waiting downstairs.\" The light switch flipped on suddenly, and I winced and shielded my eyes, which were not yet ready for the sudden change. \"And step on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finally got my vision back, I saw the figure of a tall man with dark hair walking out the door, letting it come to a moderately-loud slam behind him. I began to look around the room, trying to get a sense of my surroundings. The room was moderately large for only holding one child, and seemed to be decorated fairly sparsely, with only a few posters of on the walls, seemingly of some sort of Japanese anime or video game. A bookshelf to my left held several shelves worth of trophies, all with some sort of sporting equipment miniaturized and cast in gold on top of them. The desk and table surfaces, along with the floor, were all cluttered with papers, boxes, books, magazines, clothes, and various other items. It sure looked like a twelve-year old boy's room, that was for sure, but nothing in it particularly caught my attention or looked familiar in any kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, I threw off the covers I had been lying under and eased out of bed. I looked down, noticing I had been sleeping only in a pair of black boxer-briefs. Looking at my body for the first time that morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I seemed to be in good physical shape, with a lean body and the beginning stages of muscles in my chest and stomach. A medium-sized mirror was on the wall near my bed, so I went over to it and examined myself, liking what I saw. My face was still boyish, my skin smooth, but I had a good-sized nose and lips, with ears that didn't stand out too much. My eyes were a bright, almost dazzling blue color, and I flashed a smile, impressed by my pearly whites. Up top, my hair was blonde and somewhat short, but with enough length to work with if I wanted to style it. I didn't know exactly what I should be comparing it too, since I couldn't remember if this was indeed how I was supposed to look, but I liked what I saw, and I wasn't going to complain. My eyes traveled further down my reflection in the mirror, back to my torso. I flexed a little, seeing those aforementioned pecs and abs get a little more pronounced for the short time that I did, and slight bulges forming in my arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied for the time being, I walked over to what appeared to be my closet, opening the door. Inside were two racks: one full of shirts and jackets, and the other full of pants and shorts. I realized that I didn't even know what to dress for: whether it was fall, winter, or spring, and whether or not my school had a dress code. As I looked closer, however, I saw five polo shirts, three dark navy blue and two bright white ones, each of which had a logo of what appeared to be a bird on fire embroidered on them, with the words \"Lakewood Middle School\" beneath the logo. It didn't take a genius to figure out that this was what I should be wearing, so I pulled out a white shirt, and slipped it on over my torso. Looking at the other rack, I didn't see anything that stood out as being part of the uniform, so I just hedged my bets and grabbed a dressy-looking pair of khaki slacks and a black belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I finally was fully dressed (save for shoes, which I didn't find and I assumed were waiting for me downstairs), and I left the room. My bedroom seemed to be at the end of a rather long hall, and I slowly made my way to the other end, where a set of stairs were waiting. As I passed by some of the doors, I looked in to them, seeing (in order): a bathroom (which, judging by the towels, toothbrushes, and brightly-colored decor, was shared by at least three kids), two other bedrooms (one with dark blue wallpaper and one with bright pink wallpaper, but both extremely spic and span), and a nicely-furnished study/library with over half-a-dozen wooden bookshelves and two computer desks across from each other, both with very large-screened iMacs on them. Whatever kind of family I was going to find myself a part of, money didn't seem to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the stairs, I finally got a clue of what kind of family I was a part of, as a series of family portraits lined the walls. The family portraits started with a picture of a man and woman in their twenties (I guessed they were my parents), with a baby on the woman's lap. Unfortunately, the baby was too young for me to tell whether or not it was me or someone else, or whether or not it was even a boy or a girl (it was dressed in a neutral-colored white outfit, so that didn't help). The next portrait was of the same three people, all older, and the baby had changed into a young blonde-haired boy, probably not even four years old, wearing a shirt and tie. I wagered a guess that the boy was me, and the next portrait confirmed it, when the group of three became a group of five. The older boy in the portrait matched the face I had seen in the mirror earlier, perhaps five or six years younger than I was now, while two younger kids, what looked to be a twin boy and girl each around two years old, stood on a block in the middle of the family. The last portrait had to be recent, as I looked to be around twelve, and the twins were each around eight, both with light-brown hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe series of portraits had given me more info on my family, sure, but I still didn't feel like I actually knew them. I had no idea of the names of my mom, dad, or siblings, and I had no memory of what they would be like. I took a deep breath, ready to try to further unravel the mysteries, when something strange and completely unexpected happened.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon my name was mentioned, the memories began flooding back. Not only was I eighteen years old, but I had just graduated from high school, the salutatorian of my class (only .03 grade points off of the valedictorian too). I was the oldest of two sons, my thirteen-year-old brother Aaron and I both living with our mother after our father had died unexpectedly in his sleep five years ago. The wooziness and unclarity lifted from my mind like a fog lifting from a swamp. But one thing remained unclear: the hospital. I had no idea why I would be in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-can you turn the lights on or something?\u201d I asked the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d it said. As I listened closer, I could make out a hint of femininity to it. It had the sound of someone who had been alive for quite a while, but hadn\u2019t let those years jade them in any way. \u201cYou might want to shield your eyes,\u201d she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I did so, and with a flicking sound, bright stale light filled the room. My eyes took a few seconds to adjust, and when they did, I saw the smiling face of an African-American woman wearing a nurse\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nice to see ya up and awake again, hon,\u201d she said, as she started to check the machines next to me. As I looked around, I felt a dull poking sensation throughout my body, and looked down and noticed half-a-dozen tubes and cables hooked up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I asked, shifting around a little. \u201cWhat happened to me? And who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, you really don't remember me, do you?\u201d The nurse shook her head and sighed. \u201cWell, I suppose the doctors did say that you might experience a little temporary amnesia. Okay, fine. You\u2019ve been here at Assumption Hospital for over two weeks, since you were in a big car wreck. And my name is Nurse Childs; you and I have talked nearly every day since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, trying to clear it. Her name did sound familiar, and yet there was something strange about it, like I was hearing it for the first time still. Even if I wasn't quite sure who she was, I decided that I just had to fake, if only to spare her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I remember now.\" I nodded, trying to smile. At that moment, though, the sharp pain reappeared in my head, and I winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hon, lie back down and take it easy. No need to stress yourself out on my account, ya hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and did as she instructed. She continued to fiddle with the machines for a while, during which I drifted back off into sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I woke up again, the window drapes on the wall to the left of my bed had been pulled open again, and afternoon sunlight was now streaming into the room. I rubbed my eyes, sitting back up. The headache I had earlier seemed to have gone away, for now at least, and I didn't feel anywhere near as woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Erik, thank God you're okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked forward and noticed a middle-aged woman with medium-length blonde hair sitting on the chair at the opposite wall from my bed. I instantly recognized this woman as my mother. Not only was I feeling better, but my memory and my recollection must have been getting better as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mom,\" I said gingerly. She stood up and came over to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing?\" she asked, a heavy sense of concern evident on her face. \"The doctors said you've been in and out of consciousness for the last several days, and that your memory has been pretty hazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tilted my neck back and forth, my muscles and bones not nearly as sore as before. \"I think I'm doing okay,\" I said. \"My memory seems to be a lot more solid now, and I'm not in as much pain as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on mine and squeezed it tight. \"I'm so glad, honey. When I first saw you here in this bed a few weeks ago, I was so afraid that we might lose you. But it looks like you're gonna be okay. The doctors even say that you should make a full recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed in deeply and nodded, leaning my head against my mom's chest and hugging her tight, which she returned warmly. My relationship with my mother had never been exceptionally close, but I loved her, and she loved me. What more could a son really ask for, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe broke from our embrace when we heard the sound of the door opening, and a tall, dark-skinned man walked in. He looked to be a few years younger than my mom, and was slightly overweight, but seemed very friendly and upbeat. By the look of his clothes, I guessed he was a nurse, except I didn't remember seeing any male nurses yet in this hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Erik,\" he said, grinning from ear to ear, \"how was your nap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing okay, sir.\" I answered. And it was the truth; I was much better than before. I wasn't ready to run a marathon yet or anything, but I could tell that I was gonna be out of the hospital within a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Sir'?\" The nurse laughed. \"Hey, I thought we were friends, Erik! Don't you remember me? We've talked every day since you've been in here!\" He looked a little offended, but was still smiling, not seeming to have lost his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI racked my brain for a name, but I couldn't come up with one. \"I-I'm sorry, I don't remember\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, buddy,\" he said. \"It's not like you haven't forgotten my name before. I'm Nurse Childs, and I've been taking good care of you during your stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, that was odd. \"Nurse Childs?\" I asked. \"Wait, are you related to the other Nurse Childs that was here this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other Nurse Childs?\" He scrunched up his nose, seemingly confused. \"I don't know who you're talking about. I'm the only person on staff named Childs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" I responded, shifting in my bed slightly, \"this woman this morning said that she was Nurse Childs. She was an older black woman, maybe ten or twenty years older than you, and really nice and friendly. She called me 'hon' a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Childs shook his head. \"Son, we don't have any nurse on staff that's like that. There's only two other black nurses in this wing, and they're both in their twenties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't make any sense. How could I remember the other Nurse Childs so clearly, when apparently she didn't exist? Was someone playing a prank on me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged it off and turned back to my mom as the nurse began checking on my vitals again. \"How have things been going at home while I've been out of commission?\" I asked her. \"Aaron been too much of a hassle for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really,\" she answered, chuckling a little. \"He can't wait until you get home, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around slightly. \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had camp this week, remember?\" I shrugged, trying to still put back all the pieces in my memory. \"Well, anyways, he'll be back on Friday. Perhaps you'll be ready to come back home then too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I will,\" I said, smiling. Nurse Childs gave me a thumbs up and left the room, and I leaned back against my pillow and sighed, content in seemingly, finally being on the mend. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My hopes for a speedy recovery seemed to be succeeding. That evening, I walked around the hospital on my own power, not having any pain or unusual problems as I did so. The next few days went by fairly normally, the nurses and doctors still running tests and checking my vitals, but I knew that I'd be good enough to leave soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something happening to me though that I couldn't help but worry about. Every so often, seemingly random and out of the blue, I would get a sharp pain in my head, like a migraine headache, and my vision would go blurry. These\u2026 whatever they were\u2026 would only lasted for a few seconds, so I decided to keep from the medical staff, fearing it would cause my stay to be extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, each time this would happen, I noticed something change. Once, when I was eating, I had a flash while I was cutting into my ham, and when the pain had gone away, I looked down to see that I was cutting into a piece of chicken-fried steak. Another time, the night before I left the hospital, I was walking through a seemingly empty hallway of the hospital, when I got the headache and leaned against the wall for balance. When I opened my eyes, the hallway was suddenly full of patients, nurses, and doctors. It was much too quick and there were far too many of them for any normal explanation. I didn't know what to think of these things, but they seemed to be harmless, so I kept my mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Friday, I was dying to get out of the hospital, feeling like I was completely ready. Luckily, the doctors agreed. After signing some insurance papers, my Mom headed down to the parking lot to pull the van around, and Nurse Childs (still the same thirty-something African-American man from the other day) pulled up a wheelchair, motioning for me to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am glad you're all better, Erik,\" he said as he pushed me towards the main entrance. \"Someone as young as you doesn't have any business being in a hospital for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I nodded, \"you guys have been really nice and courteous, but\u2026 well, let's just say I'm not gonna miss being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Childs chuckled as we headed out the door. \"Well, we'll certainly miss you. Just make sure you stay safe out there; I don't want to see you back for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and shook his outstretched hand. \"Sure thing, Nurse Childs. You have a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" he said, then he disappeared back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got into the passenger's seat of the van and we pulled away, Mom turned to me and let out a sigh of relief. \"I'm so glad you're coming home today,\" she said. \"The house has been far too quiet. And, coincidentally enough, Aaron's bus from camp should be just getting into town in the next    few minutes. Do you want me to drop you off at home first, or go and meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an easy decision. I got along well with my brother, and I wanted to see him as soon as possible, and I'm sure he wanted to see me. \"Let's go pick him up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then!\" Mom smiled, and we made small talk during the rest of the car ride over to the youth center. The old white bus pulled up only a few minutes after we got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I stepped out of the car, I heard my brother's voice yelling my name, \"ERIK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked and saw my brother waving out of an open window on the bus, beaming wide as I'd ever seen him. A few seconds later, the bus doors opened, and as the kids started to file out, he was one of the first ones off the bus. He ran towards me, jumping up and wrapping his arms around me, giving me a huge hug. \"Thank god you're awake and safe, big bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron! Careful!\" Mom scolded. \"Your brother DID just get out of the hospital, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed as I patted Aaron on the back. \"It's okay, Mom, I feel fine.\" He wasn't too big to handle, being nearly a foot shorter than me and substantially skinnier. \"I'm glad to see you too, Aaron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat him back down on the ground, I noticed that his skin seemed to be a little more tan than before; being outside in the sun at camp seemed to have given him a healthy glow, and the black sleeveless t-shirt and khaki shorts showed off the muscles that were beginning to develop on his chest, arms, and legs, filling out his otherwise skinny frame. His jet-black hair was shaggier than ever, framing his face and nearly covering his eyes. What struck me most about him though was his incredibly broad and striking smile. Part of that was situational, I know, due to him being so happy to see me. But I couldn't help but think that this handsome smile would serve him well in the near future when he started dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erik!\" Aaron exclaimed. \"Can you take me to the mall today? I won a gift card at camp for winning a ping-pong tournament, and I have about a billion ideas for what I want to buy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, champ,\" I said, ruffling his hair with my hand and smiling. He squirmed a little but laughed, then leaned in close and gave me another tight squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad we get to hang out again now,\" he said, \"especially since you're gonna be going to college in a month or so.\" His smile faded just a little, and he looked up at me with large eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry,\" I said, \"I'll still be coming home back plenty. Remember I'll still have laundry to do.\" I winked and playfully punched him in the arm. \"Maybe I'll even take you with me to college for a weekend or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" He nearly started jumping up and down in excitement. \"Oh, wow! I can't wait!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, boys,\" Mom said, \"we'd better pick up the bags and get headed home. And speaking of laundry, with both of you guys coming back home after being away for so long, I've got a feeling that I'm gonna be spending the rest of my day in front of the washing machine anyways. Might as well get that started as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up Aaron's suitcase, we piled back into the van with me in the front seat and Aaron behind us. As we pulled away, he lounged across the bench seat, his shoes up on one end of it. Mom usually would immediately tell him to put his feet down, but she seemed to be letting it slide for now, probably happy to have both of us back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we pulled out of the parking lot, though, my vision began to blur, and I felt the sharp pain returning to my head. It seemed a bit more manageable now than before, almost as if I was getting more used to it. It only took a few seconds to pass, and once it did, my vision returned to normal almost instantly. I sighed, hoping that my head would return to normal sooner rather than later, but thankful that everything seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I quickly remembered about the small changes I had noticed in the hospital, realizing that I needed to check to see if anything like that had occurred here. Looking ahead of the car, and in both my mom's seat and mine, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. When I turned around to look at Aaron, though, I instantly realized something had changed, and something big. My mouth fell agape, and I wiped my eyes, trying to see if I was looking at a mirage or something like that. But what I saw was real; something incredible had happened to my brother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't seem possible. The van was still the same size, myself and my mom were still just as normal, but some way, some how, my thirteen year old brother Aaron had suddenly become twice as tall as he was just a moment ago, a true giant by any standards at over ten feet tall. At his new height, he couldn't sit straight up, even in a good-sized minivan like ours, so he was instead stretched across the seat, laying down. I nearly screamed in shock when I saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- Aaron what's happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" he looked back at me with a slightly confused grin on his face. \"What do you mean, Erik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't answer right away as I waited for the other shoe to drop, metaphorically speaking, but it never did. Aaron truly seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. I turned to Mom, hoping she'd be able to back me up here. \"You see it too, right mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what?\" She glanced into the rearview mirror. I was expecting a look of surprise, but she didn't seem to bat an eye.  \"I don't see anything out of the ordinary, Erik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\" I sputtered. \"But Aaron--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik, I know you've had a rough week, but please, try to keep from distracting me while I'm driving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth must've been open in shock, because I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing. I turned back to Aaron, staring at him and his huge size. Examining him for a moment, I noticed that there were only a few things that had changed about him: his height (obviously), his lying down position (which, of course, meant he couldn't wear a seat belt), and his clothing, which looked a little more ragged and torn, the hem of his shorts starting to show loose threads, and his shirt looking like it was about to pop off of him. It was a button-up shirt, except that there was no way the buttons were going to be able to come together, so instead he had left it open, revealing his skinny chest and stomach, which was just beginning to show signs of muscle development. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued to stare, he turned his head from looking at the ceiling over to me, seeing my gaze. He started to blush a little and smiled, an unusual smile for him, not one of delight or enjoyment, but of confidence and of contentment. I quickly looked away, trying to make it seem like I wasn't looking at him, but out of the corner of my eye I could see him continuing to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned back to face forward, my head was swimming with questions. What had just happened to my brother? How could he grow so much so fast? How could his clothes still even come close to fitting? And why did neither he nor my mother act as if anything was out of the ordinary. It didn't make sense\u2026 until I remembered the flashes, and what had happened at the hospital. Reality had seemed to change around me. Nothing big, of course, just little things, it seemed. I had shrugged it off then as a sign of still being a little out of it after the accident, but now, the changes, or hallucinations, or whatever they were, were continuing to happen, and in a much more noticeable way. If they continued to get worse\u2026 I couldn't imagine how I would end up. They might have to tie me in a straight jacket and lock me away for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted when the van pulled into the driveway and my mom shut off the engine. \"We're home!\" My mom said. \"Hey, Erik, do you think you feel all right enough to be able to help your brother take the bags inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to speak, but Aaron didn't even give me a chance to answer. \"No problem, Mom! I've got them all!\" He opened the door and squeezed himself out of the car, running around to the back. As I got out and walked back around there, I was stunned to see him carrying both his and my suitcases, not even breaking a sweat! His suitcase seemed much bigger than before (why didn't that surprise me?), but he didn't seem to struggle at all, running up the sidewalk to the front door, heading inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed behind him, still a little woozy and incredibly confused. I instantly noticed that some things here seemed to have changed, even if only slightly. The ceilings and doorway were all a foot or two taller, allowing Aaron to move back and forth in the house without having to stoop all the time (though his hair still brushed the ceiling when he was standing). In the living room, there was still the same furniture as normal, but in addition there was a large chair sitting off to the side of the couch, seemingly too big for me to sit on, but perfect for someone of Aaron's size. What was going on here? Had reality changed to fit the change in my brother's height? Or maybe was I the one who was messed up, and my brother had always been this big. No, that didn't make any sense at all -- did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't seem to have time to ponder this, as when I turned around, Aaron was standing right behind me, a seemingly ecstatic look on his face. It scared me to see someone so big suddenly just be there right behind me, but I quickly calmed myself down. After all, he still seemed to be my brother, still the same optimistic, hyperactive, and enthusiastic Aaron I had always known. He just was a little bit\u2026 MORE of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Aaron,\" I said, forcing a smile as I tried to make sure my voice didn't crack. \"What's up?\" </span></div></div>",

C'mon!\" Without giving me a chance to answer, he grabbed my hand, pulling me towards the stairs, almost dragging me behind him. Sighing, I followed along, having to nearly run to keep up with his big steps, as he took the stairs two at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached his bedroom, he motioned for me to sit down on his bed, which I followed. He ran over to the bag he had just brought in and pulled out a digital camera. \"I want to show you some of the photos from camp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good enough use of our time, I decided. Plopping down on the bed, the force of which caused me to hop upward, he pressed a button and the screen on the back of the camera lit up. Fiddling with a few of the switches for a few minutes, he finally found the first one he wanted to show me. \"Look at this!\" he nearly shouted, obviously excited for me to see whatever it was. The shot appeared to be taken at the lake. Aaron was standing straight up, the water only coming up to his knees. He held out an arm on either side, like he was trying to flex, but hanging from each arm was another boy about his age. Their feet were completely out of the water, and I had to say I was stunned to see how small they looked in comparison to Aaron. They all seemed to be having a great time, though, that much was for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my two best friends from camp,\" Aaron started talking, his excitement only growing. \"That's Nathan and that's Patrick. We were practically inseparable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet,\" I said, thinking that Aaron would probably not have a very hard time making friends now, at camp, school, or anywhere else. After all, who wouldn't want to be friends with someone who could toss aside a bully or lift up the backside of a car if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is us at our cabin.\" Looking at the picture he had flipped to, I noticed that this cabin didn't seem to have the high ceilings of our house, and Aaron had to be stooping a little in order to fit. I also noticed that, behind him and his friends, several beds had been pushed together, forming one larger bed. I figured that the camp must have made special accommodations for Aaron. At this, I started to think of situations where he might not be able to be accommodated. Could Aaron ride on a plane at this size, for example, or fit in a roller coaster? Maybe being a giant wasn't all great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last night,\" Aaron showed me the camera again. The picture was of the three boys in front of a campfire, holding sticks with marshmallows on them. In this picture, Aaron's head was actually cut off above the top of the frame, his body only visible from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone should've taken a step or two back,\" I said with a chuckle. Looking closer, I noticed that Aaron had his arm draped around the shoulder of one of the boys, seemingly much closer to him than the other. \"Is that Patrick or Nathan?\" I asked, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan,\" Aaron said, his voice trailing off a little at the end. Something changed in my brother's voice - I could tell there was something he wasn't telling me as soon as the word left his mouth. \"We\u2026\" He stopped himself, his eyes turning downward, clearly embarrassed or afraid of something. \"Never mind. It's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really,\" I said. I thought for a moment if I should leave it alone, but I realized I hadn't gotten Aaron to admire me so much by being aloof and distant over the past thirteen years of his life. We were closer than close, each sharing our intimate secrets with each other - and now was not the time to stop that, especially if I was going to have to come to terms with him being twice as tall as before. I placed my hand on my brother's arm and looked up at his eyes, smiling but having a serious expression in my eyes. \"Aaron, c'mon. I know you're holding something back. Remember who you're talking to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" I could feel him squirming, but he finally took a deep breath and sighed. \"Something happened that night that was a little\u2026 unusual.\" He looked at me for a moment, but I remained silent, simply motioning for him to continue. \"After the campfire was over, it was light's out, but Nathan and I sneaked off into the woods. I don't quite know why, we just didn't want to go to sleep. And, well\u2026 we talked for quite a while, and we ended up kinda\u2026\" He paused for a long time before saying the final word. \"\u2026kissing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, I suppose I could've been more surprised, as I hadn't ever suspected Aaron to harbor any feelings of that kind towards other boys. However, in the moment, it didn't seem all that out of place. In fact, it was something I sort of could tell was coming before he said it. I still had to process it for a few moments, and I could tell Aaron was staring at me, his eyes pleading for acceptance or rejection or just any kind of reaction. Finally, I simply nodded, saying, \"Interesting.\" Looking into his big eyes, which had started to tear up, the only thing that I knew I could do was smile. \"How was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was\u2026\" I could tell that Aaron seemed to be trying to put an enormous feeling inside him into words, something that had to be one of the toughest things he had ever done in his young life. \"It was amazing, Erik. I've never felt this close with anyone before. Nathan is -- he's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure how much Aaron actually wanted to talk about his first kiss. Part of me felt that he wanted to tell me every last detail, but part of me also felt that he wanted to change the subject completely. Before I could make up my mind, though, I started feeling that familiar sensation come over me. I knew what it meant - something was about to change around me. This time, though, the sensation almost felt natural, like it had become a part of my body, something that I could deal with. My vision barely blurred, and instead of a sharp pain in my head, it felt more like a warm heat, some kind of force or power radiating from my brain. Very weird, yes, but not entirely unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it passed, I immediately noticed that Aaron was no longer in the room. My heart skipped a beat - had something happened to my brother? Jumping to my feet, I began to look around in a panic, until something unexpected caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There, in my window, Aaron's gigantic, expectant face dominated the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, sharply. I couldn't help it- I was astonished. It was out before I could catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, I would quickly learn, was the wrong reaction to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, his eyelids drooped, his eyes clouded over, and the ambition to talk had dissipated. It was obvious from his face that he was very disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Forget it,\" He shot out quickly, before pushing himself to his feet. <i>Up? He'd been <b>sitting</b> with a second-story window at head-level? That's at least sixteen feet high, he must be nearly twice that-</i>  \"This was a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<i>Not now.</i><br>\r\n\"What- Aaron?\" I leaned out of the window to get a better look at him. <i>Holy crap, his legs had to be the size of- NOT. NOW!</i>  \"Aaron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that look of surprise before, Erik, I know what it means. I just didn't expect it from you. My fault,\" He shrugged, a notable frustration in his voice. \"Hey, I think I'm going to pass on the mall tonight. I'm not feeling up to it anymore.\" He turned to go into the backyard, one heavy tramp at a time. It wasn't difficult to guess where he was going- some sort of gigantic annex had <i>(appeared)</i> been added to the back of the house, that looked like it was made from barn parts.<br>\r\nI swore under my breath repeatedly as I ran through the house to fling open the rear screen door. I was just in time to watch Aaron close his own. Oh, wow, it really WAS an annex made from barn parts, complete with arched ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron!\" I ran to his barn door and began banging on it as hard as I could. Was there any other way in? No, just the barn door... one of the ones that typically are sealed with a giant wooden beam. Crap. \"Aaron, I'm sorry! I just..\" How to explain? If I told him the truth he'd think I was screwing with him; if I tried to be vague with \"something happened recently\" or whatever, he could take it the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Aaron, there's something I need to talk to you about, as well. Alright? And it's not on what you think.\" No reply.<br>\r\n\"Aaron, something's happened, something else and... I need you to have a clear head when I tell you, alright? I'm sorry I gave you the wrong idea, but I don't disapprove of anything you did or are- at all. Come talk to me in the morning, okay?\"<br>\r\nStill nothing. I didn't know whether that was good or bad. A light drizzle had begun to come out of a very overcast sky, though, so I couldn't stay any longer without getting wet. I retreated back to my room to think.<br>\r\nAnd the afternoon had started so well.<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\nIt had been several hours since I'd blundered that conversation with Aaron, but he hadn't given a response. He hadn't even shown up for dinner on the huge, covered patio that connected the main house to his barn-room. Maybe he wanted to go to sleep early.<br>\r\nI wasn't feeling particularly tired, so I just laid on my bed and thought. The more I did, the more upset I got. What the hell was that reaction? A gasp, and Aaron thought I was some sort of homophobe? What the hell? Aaron was nice, but overly sensitive? Not particularly. We were brothers, for God's sake- he knew me better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the old reality,</i> I realized. <i>There's no telling what you are in this new one.</i><br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything wrong,\" I told myself.<br>\r\n<i>You don't know that.</i><br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything wrong.\" I told myself again, louder.<br>\r\n<i>Aaron doesn't seem to think so.</i><br>\r\n\"He jumped to conclusions, I didn't do anything wrong!\" I shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<i>Unless you did, and don't know it.</i><br>\r\n\"I'm not a bad person,\" I told myself again, more quietly, less assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I remembered: \"I just expected better of you.\" What sort of Faberg\u00e9 ego would a man coming out to his brother have, not steeling himself for the worst? That's absurd. Anyone would deliver that information with a load of reservations. You wouldn't know what their reaction would be. Aaron should've been no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unless it's someone you trusted has understood you for years, and whom you would certainly trust something this big with now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig. Hah. The elephant in the room, so to speak. It all happened because of that... <i>shift</i> that occurred. It made my huge brother huger, and gave him his own 'separate' living quarters. But I'd been so fixated on them, I hadn't focused on what other smaller changes might have happened- to my own nebulous recent past, to my brother's emotional conditions... to anything, really. Whatever this was, it was all in flux. And it seemed to be getting worse. At this rate, after a while... what would happen? To me, to the world, to existence itself? What even is real, anyway?<br>\r\nI sighed and rolled over. Somehow, I managed to force my eyes closed during the rambling debate I was having within myself, but it was a long time before sleep took me. Even then, I felt the nerves in my stomach twinge with dread. What would tomorrow bring?</span></div></div>",

Her smile had disappeared and was now replaced by a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't remember me?\" She asked. \"I'm Rachel. Don't you remember?\" I was about to tell her no. But then, I was beginning to remember something. I remembered meeting her in a forest, where she was hurt. I had patched her up and we had become friends after that. These memories, they don't feel right, like they aren't true. But I remember them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... yeah, I do remember you.\" I said. Her smile returned to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" She said as she stood up. I noticed that she seemed to be only five feet tall. She wrapped me up in a hug. After a bit of hesitation, I returned the hug, she appeared to be my friend after all. We both sat down together in the grassy field, watching the stars. It felt... normal, all of this felt normal, but I can't forget that I was in a hospital just moments ago. That may have been unexplainable for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Rachel got my attention. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" She asked. Seeing no reason in declining, I accepted. As we were both getting up, I noticed something, it was...</span></div></div>",

I just remember differently.\"<br>\r\n  - \"Parallels\", <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(Season 7 episode 11)</font><br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nOur narrator wakes up, with little memory of who they are. Their memory soon comes back, but they soon become aware that something has happened to them that is causing them to start shifting between parallel universes. While some things in the new universes are the same as before, they see other things as being different. The changes could be small or large; perhaps for one shift, the narrator notices that their house is a different color, but the next, they notice that their two-level tudor-style house is now a houseboat instead, and they're out at sea (just as an example). No one else besides the narrator notices the changes; to everyone else, their universe has always been that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the narrator cope with these constant changes? Are they driven crazy? Do they want to get back to the way things used to be? Or are they more adventurous, excited about what change is about to happen next? Those choices, as with many others, are up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will not lay down any rules for this story, so please feel free to add what you'd like. Here are some suggestions, however:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Anything can change between universes, but try to keep some form of continuity from one universe to the next. In other words, the shifts shouldn't affect absolutely everything all at once, but be more gradual in nature. However, after many consecutive changes, the narrator might end up in an entirely different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* From a grammar perspective, please keep the story in the first person and in the past tense (I went to the park, I couldn't believe my eyes, etc.). If you're not the best with grammar, don't worry; I will change any additions that don't meet this criteria to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Please try to write at least a paragraph (more if possible). I appreciate if you don't consider yourself a good writer but have an idea that you would like to see fleshed out. In this case, I would ask you to maybe email me first and try to see if we could work something out together! I might be willing to write the idea into a chapter for you, or I might be able to help inspire you into writing it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, these are suggestions. Don't be offended if I modify any submitted chapters to coincide with these. Otherwise, though, feel free to write what you'd like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheck out my portfolio <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'citywalker', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100840282'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'citywalker', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: citywalker\r\nMember Since: November 19th, 2010\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">citywalker</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View citywalker's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/citywalker',%20'CommunityR_100840282',%20'400',%20'650')\">47</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/citywalker','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/citywalker\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'citywalker', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Today', 'Today', 'November 19, 2010', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100840282',   'mess100840282_1578534397', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100840282/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: citywalker [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffcitywalker\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffcitywalker', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100840282&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffcitywalker');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add citywalker to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffcitywalker\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> for my other sci-fi and fantasy stories featuring transformation, muscle development, and growth!
