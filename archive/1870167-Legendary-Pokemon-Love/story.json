Not only that, but the radio did say there would be a chance of a snow storm and falling temperatures, but since they have been wrong for 3 days in a row, you figured it was another bogus forecast. You didn't take any other pokemon with you, just the prototype Ice Pokeball designed to catch ice types with a 90 percent certainty. The snow and wind picked up, limiting your vision as you rub your body while moving, trying to keep your body warm. But the elements were starting to win as you fell to the ground. Right before you pass out, you see a hint of shimmering blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then wake up with a start sometime later. You take notice of your surroundings, noting your in a cave, safe from the snow but now strangely warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question is, are you alone?</span></div></div>",

The legendary Freeze pokemon Articuno. Some research you read that Articuno are known to appear to those doomed on icy mountains, it never said they saved them. You slowly reach out and touched its wing, being careful not to disturb its rest. The touch and smooth and cool to the touch. You pulled back when it shifted and cooed at the slight touch and it rolled over. Despite many thinking all Legendaries aside from Latias and Latios had no gender, you can now see that this bird did indeed have a cloaca. But this got you curious as to its actual gender.

You could never really explain it, but the study of Pokemon has fascinated you like nothing else. This has caused you a fair deal of frustration in life - numerous girls have openly wished you'd pay them some attention instead of all your Pokemon books and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your interests lie elsewhere. As of this moment, you're studying the ultimate Pokemon, and your favorite from the very start. A Pokemon known simply as Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was an enigma and that's why you liked it. Nobody really knew much of anything about Mew and that's why it appealed to you so much. Nobody knew Mew's gender, or personality ... all they knew is that Mew was really cute, and really powerful. Some had speculated Mew didn't exist at all, others that Mew was the progenitor of all other Pokemon. To really study Mew you had to find one, which was said to be hard as Mew could easily morph itself or hide itself. But you were pure of heart and determined to find it, which were said to be the two key criteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why you find yourself trekking through the jungle in South America. It is a hot day, but the thick jungle canopy provides much welcome shade. After searching all morning for the elusive Pokemon, you find a nice shady clearing in the jungle and sit down on an old fallen tree trunk, unpacking your lunch from your backpack and munching away on a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear a noise from above, only to see a giant Pidgeot swooping down towards you. \"Uh oh\" you say, quickly packing up your things and running as fast as you can to get away from the wild Pokemon. You run as fast as you can down the path, breathing heavily - before tripping on some undergrowth and falling to the ground. Covering your head, you brace yourself for the attack by the wild Pidgeot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can react, suddenly you feel a huge blast of energy behind you. The Pidgeot screeches in pain, as it is blasted far away to oblivion by a powerful attack. You'd felt your fair share of Pokemon attacks before but NOTHING like that you just felt. Whatever just saved you was clearly a very, very powerful Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small soft \"Mew\" call confirms your suspicions. Breathing in heavily in shock, you turn around and find yourself looking at a very cute little pink creature. And it's looking at you with big, soft blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh\" you whisper to yourself \"It's the legendary Mew!\"<br>\r\nMew blushes. \"I'm flattered\" it says with a soft, gentle voice \"Nice to meet you too, James\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can talk and read my mind, huh?\"<br>\r\nMew smiles and flies a little closer towards you. \"Sure can. And I can tell that you really like me. Well - I really like you too.\"<br>\r\nNow it's your turn to be flattered. \"Really?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been spying on you all morning\" replies Mew \"Or, a little longer actually.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\nMew smiles cutely \"I've been studying you! And what I've found is that I want you.\"<br>\r\n\"Want me how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew flies so close to you that its soft pink fur is touching your clothes, and its nose is touching yours. You stand transfixed at the impossibly cute creature in front of you, mouth open. Mew's own hot breath mixes with yours right in front of your face and you can hear Mew purring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I didn't think you'd be this oblivious! I want you to be my boyfriend, James... then you can study me all you want...\"</span></div></div>",

You've seen a lot in the books, like all the drawings, and all the information, but out of all those Pokemons, Lugia has to be by far your very favorite. But, wouldn't it be amazing to meet the legend itself in person? You recapped that for yourself, while you were looking to the waves in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what brought you here, on Whirl Islands, your wild Journey brought you here, but for some reason easier then you expected it to happen. People tell tales of the waves being furious when trying to approach the island, but for some reason, you encountered no dangerously big ones at all. Weird. Well, anyways, you came here for a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the cave of Whirld islands, and after some navigating and running away from those damn zubats, you came into an cave with an giant waterfall. You look at the sparkling water and the streaming waters escaping into the holes in the walls. You look around for an bit and sat down. This is the place where it's rumored where the great legend sleeps. You wait around for a bit, Lugia might be out for some reason, which why is maybe why there were no waves or whirlpools when travelling here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've waited for pretty long now.. you're starting to lose hope and stood up, dissapointed.

Lugia itself came flying down from the heavens as elegantly as possible. You couldn't believe your eyes! It's the real Lugia! Just one thing bothers you.. ''Why have you been expecting me, great Lugia?'' you say, trying to be as properly as possible to the guardian. ''No need to be so formal, human.'' Lugia said, when he landed in front of you. ''I knew someday you would come.'' he continued. ''Wait, what? How do you know all this, and why did you let me in so easily?'' you asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let me explain, human. Being an guardian of the seas means I am also the one who gets all the information about potential threats and allies. When talk occured in the big sea of an young boy who was deeply interested in me, I somehow felt like checking out who this ''young boy'' was. I swam to your hometown, and saw you for the first time. You looked so kind and felt an pure-hearted presence inside of you, making me feel.. ''interested'' in you.'' Lugia explained. ''Interested?'' you ask. ''Yes, Human.. interested.. I've been watching you ever since that day and now, we finally meet.'' he says. ''But, why couldn't you just come up to me earlier?'' you asked. ''I'm afraid I can't show my face around the folkspeople, I might get too much attention, and you might've too.'' he replied. You nod. ''That's actually logical..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the Lugia smiling, it seems that something is bothering it. ''What is it?'' you ask. Lugia frowns and got nervous for some reason. ''Uhm.. you know.. that ''interested'' part.. I.. that.. It's just that I.. I think I love you, Human.'' The Lugia replied, blushing. You started blushing and you were shocked. ''B-but.. you're an P-pokemon.. and I'm h-human.. we can't..'' you wanted to finish your sentence, when the Lugia held one of it's wings on your mouth. ''I know that, Human.. but there is no thing as ''species'' when it comes to love, doesn't it?'' the Lugia took his wing back again. You were mute, and you just didn't know what to do. ''But.. if you are not interested, then that's okay..'' the Lugia said, in a very sad tone, looking down and turning his back on you. This really hit your feelings pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make an choice, and fast!</span></div></div>",

''Ofcourse not! I kinda like it.. it makes you sound sweet and caring.'' you replied. The Lugia smiles and kind of ''kissed'' your lips.

''Feel free to explore.'' he said, winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you got the lord of seas all for yourself to play with. You looked at his gigantic ballsack. Man, it looked kinda soft. You started to walk up to it and rubbing it. ''Hmm.. Nathey~.. heh heh..'' you heard the Lugia saying. ''Don't cum just yet, Lugia, we only began.'' you teased. Lugia rolled it's eyes and gave you an good whack with his feet. ''W-whoa!'' you screamed while falling onto the comfy ballsack. It's a pretty good cushion for you to sit on. You noticed his paws now. You walked up to them and started rubbing them. You loved the smell that the feet gave off. You started licking them thorougly, loving every lick and taste of his paws. ''Mm.. you sure do like to treat your master nicely, no?'' he said, grinning. You smiled shyly. Now came the best part.. ''Hey, Lugia.. mind to turn around to show that nice ass of yours?'' you say. Lugia grins. ''Oh, so you're into that too, hm?'' he grins, turning around, and there it was, his amazing ass. You walked up to it, and you just kind of let yourself fall onto his buttcheeks, and you start to hug his butt. You felt the warm, soft and plump ass against your body, and it felt so great. You suddenly heard the Lugia farting on you, and you were shocked, but when you smelled the fragrance of his butt, you were in heaven. ''Oh, man.. this smells nice, man..'' you said in a relaxed tone. ''Thanks, Nath..'' the Lugia said, blushing. You know, you really wouldn't mind sitting inbetween his buttocks now, it looks REALLY comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, Lugia.. could you maybe put me between your buttocks?'' you asked. ''With pleasure, Nathey~..'' Lugia said, and quickly stood up, and began sitting onto you, rubbing his butt over the ground, trying to get you in a good position and deep enough in there. ''Hey, relax, you don't want to damage that butt.. let me crawl further inside.'' you said, as you wiggled further and further, until you were almost against his anus, and stopped there. ''Hm.. you feel so nice in there~.. Are you comfy enough in there?'' Lugia asks. ''Ofcourse I am, I've never felt so much comfort in my life, ever!'' you said. ''Good.'' Lugia said, laying down in comfort. ''By the way, Nathan.. would you mind if.. if I transformed you into an Lugia too?'' he asked. You were surprised. That would solve the size difference between you and him, and being an Lugia would be AMAZING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what will you do?</span></div></div>",

Lugia said, as you just noticed one of Lugia's ''fingers'' wriggling inbetween his buttocks and gently pushing you inside his anus, sucking you deeper inside of his body. It was very warm and smelly in here, and you liked it. Although it's kind of wet. ''Hm.. nice.. you feel great in there, Nathey~..'' he said. ''Glad to hear so..'' you say, as you head deeper and deeper inside. Eventually you came to, what you assume is Lugia's belly, it was enormous! But you got kind of nervous. ''Uhm.. you aren't gonna digest me, are you?'' you asked. ''Oh, no! No! I wouldn't! Though, there is some digestion in the process of transforming, it'll hurt for a little moment, but not too much.'' he said. You gulped. You wonder if this really was a good idea after all. ''Don't you worry, Nath.. I'll make it quick, besides, it's only an one-time thing.'' he said. ''J-Just do it.. make sure I don't die.. ..I trust you.'' you say, and you just lay down. ''All right now.. I'll begin.. now.'' he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon saw his stomach acid rising up, and you felt your skin burning. You tried to keep it in, but it burns so hard you let out some loud noises of pain. ''Come on.. almost there..'' you hear the Lugia saying, as you noticed your body melting, and you were already up to your neck before you knew it. You prayed Lugia would know what he was doing, and you fully melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you regained consciousness again, and noticed Lugia looking at you with a relieved expression. ''Nathan? Are you okay?'' Lugia says. You start to sit up, and notice you were quite big now, almost the same size as Lugia, but just somewhat tinier. You look at your hands, which were now wings. You fastly stood up and looked in the water. You couldn't believe it.. you're an Lugia now! All thanks to your friend. You look at him now, and just run up to him and hug him. ''W-whoa! Heh, okay.. You're all right, I presume?'' Lugia asked. ''Y-yeah.. Thanks, Lugia.. you couldn't have made me happier.'' you say. You notice Lugia blushing. ''Oh, it was nothing.. besides.. you've got an great ass now.'' he said, grabbing your buttocks with his hand-like-wings. You blush. ''R-really..?'' you ask. ''Yeah, why would I be lying? If it wasn't, then this boner would've already dissapeared.'' he said, grinning. You snicker and push him over. ''Well, come on..'' you said while you walked up to his mouth, spread your buttocks and trapped Lugia's mouth inbetween. ''Give them some love, then.'' you said. ''With pleasure, my lady.'' he said. You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Lugia's wet tongue licking the sides of your buttocks, playing a little first, and then you felt his wet tongue penetrating your anus, leaving you moaning. You felt him licking the insides very nicely, making it wet and slideable. You felt your dick throbbing, loving every single lick your loved guardian gave. ''Like my ass, Lugia~?'' you ask. ''Ofcourse.. the sweet fragrance, the nice taste, so comfy and plumpy, hell, I would love you to suck me in there someday, baby~.'' he answered. You blush, and naughtily let out a fart in his face. You snicker. Lugia eventually stopped licking and took his head out of your buttocks. ''All right.. that should be wet enough.'' he said, and began sitting down. ''This is your first time, right?'' he asks. ''Y-yeah..'' you answer, looking at his gigantic dick, questioning if you can even take that big boy. ''Oh, worrying about taking all this? Don't worry.. I'm sure your fine ass can handle this, just take it slow and easy, all right?'' he said. You nod. ''Good. Now, just spread your buttocks and try to position yourself..'' he said. You spread your buttocks and you put your anus on the tip of Lugia's dick, and started to let yourself sink slowly. ''There, there.. c'mon.. you can do it..'' he said. You moaned, but felt couraged due to Lugia, and before you know it, you just took all of it. ''Hey, that's my guy~.. Good job, Nathan. Now, would you mind if we took it rougher?'' he asked. ''N-no.. go ahead.. f-fuck me as hard as you want. I'm all yours, big boy.'' you answered. ''Good..'' Lugia said, as he started humping you as hard as possible. It stinged sometimes, but it felt so great. Lugia went faster and faster for the moment, and kept on a certain speed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good amount of time, you started to feel like cumming. ''Lugia.. I'm gonna.. cum..'' you said. ''M-me too.. h-here it c-comes..'' Lugia said, and soon you felt the warm sticky fluid traveling trough your anus, and you started cumming all over the place. ''Ahh.. Lugia.. That was.. good..'' you said. ''Y-yeah.. I'm g-glad we f-finally m-met.'' You hear the Lugia saying exhausted, while taking his penis out of your anus.</span></div></div>",

I figured it would be possibly longer.\u201d \u201cWe do not take forever though. Mostly water types will drag it out.\u201d \u201cAnyways, how are you Allis?\u201d Damon asks. \u201cMeh my day could be better. My team is small me, and my Eevee.\u201d \u201cOoh, an Eevee they are incredibly cute.\u201d \u201cI Agree that they are cute, I would never evolve it against its will and only when it wants to.\u201d \u201cDo you agree on that for all Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually yes I do prefer to let them decide if they want to evolve, some people would force them to evolve even if they didn\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d \u201cYeah we know what you mean we have seen a couple forced with stones. Luckily legendries don\u2019t evolve, or at least most of them some have different forms.\u201d \u201cLandorus, Tornadus, and Thunderus. If I am correct.\u201d \u201cThey do have beast forms.\u201d \u201cI am glad that we agree on some things, there will probably be some things in the future that we might disagree on or argue, but hopefully it won\u2019t destroy all of our relationships together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean *Our Relationships*?\u201d \u201cWell we are under you control technically if you caught us. So we are to be used as you see fit.\u201d \u201cWell it is true I have 2 powerful legends in my team, but I wouldn\u2019t want to abuse your powers. Speaking of Powers let me scan you in my pok\u00e9dex so I can see what moves you know.\u201d \u201cYes Mam.\u201d And as thus Lyrica and Damon line up so she can scan them. Damon knows, Dragon Pulse, Protect, Luster Purge, and Memento. While Lyrica knew, Mist Ball, Heal Pulse, Psycho Shift, and Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both have a good set of moves; your moves more likely are made for tag battles as some are used on others.\u201d \u201cWell we were meant to be with the other. In all actuality I was human at one point.\u201d \u201cWhat no way.\u201d \u201cYes way Lyrica here fell in love with me as a human and wanted me as a Mate so she changed me into a Latios while depleting most of her power.\u201d \u201cWow, I would have never guessed it.\u201d \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t think that it is possible to turn a human into a Pok\u00e9mon, But any legendary or even Arceus itself can transform a human, but only if they are pure of heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI looked at Damon and saw a *Pure Heart* and a very understanding person and that he would make an excellent mate and companion.\u201d \u201cI never realized it was possible; Wait where are your Pok\u00e9mon then?\u201d \u201cI released them; some of them were very reluctant to leave. But after a little convincing they accepted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I be transformed then?\u201d \u201cWell yeah, then we wouldn\u2019t be here at this moment, so I think it isn\u2019t necessary. We wouldn\u2019t want your Eevee to be very puzzled about its surroundings like my Altaria would be.\u201d \u201cI guess so, I got an idea\u2026 Wait can any of you call Arceus?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t as I am turned into and not an actual Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d Lyrica looks very fidgety she then pulls out from her wing a white flute. \u201cWhat? Lord Arceus gave every Legendary on to call it whenever needed.\u201d She then puts it to her lips and plays an eerie song and there is a flash of lightning as Arceus appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Latias you called me? What do you need?\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 I transformed a human into my mate as he had a pure heart, and the girl behind you wanted to talk to you.\u201d \u201cHmmm\u2026 this human does indeed contain a Pure Heart. As for you what would you like I can see you also have a pure heart.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay a Pok\u00e9mon I would like to ask if I can have the ability to become a Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d \u201cHmmm\u2026 I have never heard of this kind of request, but I can understand you wish to stay a trainer but become a Pok\u00e9mon when you want. I will grant it I will also allow you to change into a legendary if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lord Arceus.\u201d \u201cHere have this incase anything comes up.\u201d As he hands a flute to both Damon and Allis. \u201cThank you Lord Arceus.\u201d Arceus touches a stone to Allis\u2019s head and she glows a bright white color before fading and with thus exits through his portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllis decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

High above it was the sanctuary of the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon of the world, the Hall of Origin. Nobody has ever seen nor visited it before so knowledge about its splendor remains unknown. Residing inside it was the creator of the whole universe, the Alpha Pok\u00e9mon, Arceus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she feels a bit unsatisfied about her life and so she looks for her special one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is her story of how she came and united with the savior of the world, Ash Ketchum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked down from her ancient and jeweled throne. She constantly watched over the Earth, searching for any impending peril. Although she noticed some problems, it was nothing that people couldn't handle themselves. She sighed loudly to herself, slightly frustrated that nothing major happened. It had been like this for over a week now and she had been lonely, all the other legendaries were down on the Earth living out their lives the usually way whilst she was stuck here, acting as a guardian over her creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as she was scanning, a familiar little speck caught her eyes. It was a boy, around sixteen years old. She looked at him, weirdly enthralled, with more detail and noticed that it was Ash Ketchum, the Chosen One. She remembered how he was able to save her and that memory made her blush deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash\u2026\" She sighed, thinking that she and he would never be able to be together. At that time, it was considered taboo to love a Pok\u00e9mon, what more mating. But then, she was a Goddess, she could alter humans' law about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to get ideas of how she could make her day better. Suddenly, the idea entered her head to pay a visit to the Chosen One. Plus what harm could it do to leave her post anyways? It isn't like there were any immediate dangers around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a desk in the far side of the room, Arceus telepathically gathered a piece of paper and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the note, she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Legends and My Creations,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will be going on a little trip to pay a visit to the Chosen One. If anything comes up, I trust that all of you can handle it. I'll be back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Please don't fight each other. If any of you does, there's a great Judgment waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe posted the piece of paper on the door and, with a blinding flash of light, teleported out of the heavens with a smile.</span></div></div>",

The light raided quickly to reveal a larger figure who spoke in an angelic feminine voice. Its tone was so comforting and relaxing that Ash felt a bit giddy and a bit happier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Chosen One, I am here to keep you company.\" Ash rubbed his eyes to make sure he hadn't been seeing things, but the figure before him still stood tall. It felt like a dream for Ash, who had been depressed most of Time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh  gasped as Arceus herself was in front of him.

Her golden wheel that usually was around her waist was missing. Her arms are slender but has a fair amount of muscle to help her in major fights. Her legs are the same but her thighs are thicker than her fore legs. In her normal form her feet ended in golden spikes, but now they were replaced by white hooves. Her tail is three feet long just slightly above her full round, soft, jiggly rear. Her waist is slim, her belly is smooth and soft, her backside is smooth and soft as well with a good curb up from her ass to her head, making the front stand out. Her face is angelic and feminine with a loving gaze in her eyes, even though her metallic mask was still retained. Her breasts were G-G cup, and jiggled and swayed whenever she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ar...Arceus?\" He stuttered in shock at the turn of events. His jaw fell towards the ground in much astonishment, causing Arceus to giggle loudly at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Creation Pok\u00e9mon slowly moved closer to the stunned boy and nuzzled against him. Her movement startled Ash as she was nuzzling him in a loving yet somehow\u2026lustful way. She was trying to put what she's trying to make him feel through her nuzzling. She loved him, no, she WANTED him. She couldn't stand to be lonely anymore, she had to tell him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...the heavens have been lonely for me, I have been alone for over a week now. Child, I haven't seen you for quite some time. It is good to see my Chosen One again.\" Ash was a little confused, he had been told he was the Chosen One but not Arceus' herself, or even what he was supposed to do as her Chosen One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to know what he needed to do as her Chosen One. His curiosity was getting the best of him and so he asked, \"Arceus...if I may ask. What are my duties as your Chosen One?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Arceus give him a smirk as she nuzzled him some more. He was having suspicions. She wasn't usually like this, as all female Legendaries before her, except Latias, had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Chosen One, your job is to provide me with company, food, mating privileges so pretty much anything. You are like my Chosen boyfriend.\" Ash suddenly felt lightheaded all of a sudden and he fell out of his bed onto the floor unconscious with shock. Arceus smiled at her 'boyfriend' as she picked him up and proped him up back on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh awoke....</span></div></div>",

This was your fate to die all along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly- FWOOSH! A bright light swooped over your freezing soon-to-be corpse. In the midst of the ferocious blizzard, you heard what almost sounded like cackling flames. You shivered as you began turning your head, hopeful that a rescuer had found you on the brink of death, or maybe one of your beloved friends came to you, sensing danger. It was blurry from the icicles hanging from your eyelashes, but you could make out what almost seemed to be a giant bird. Oh great, some vulture, hungry for your frosty bones. Wait... Why would a vulture be in the snow? You must be hallucinating, then... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong. It had moved closer,and pushed away the snow that was covering you. You looked closer, your view starting to darken. Was it Articuno? Possibly the cause of the blizzard, here to finish the job? Wrong again, it was the fiery Moltres! Here to save you with its blazing feathers of pure warmth! Although, even with your rapidly blurring vision, you could see Moltres's feathers were dimmed by the cold just as you had... Maybe you both had no hope left. Before you could think another word, everything went dark. Had you finally died...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reawaken, only to find yourself in a still-dark place. It was much warmer though, and it felt as though your icy clothes had been removed. Feeling around with your five senses slowly regaining, you felt that it was moist... And squishy...

It was tightly pressing against you, calmly pulsating with slightly more forceful squeezes in correspondence to the mighty bird's breath. It was interestingly peaceful, it had soothed the swarming bees of thoughts back into their quiet hive. You noticed the sounds of Moltres's heartbeat, echoing around you in such a majestic way.

You could almost fall asleep again, from pleasure instead of fear and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how comfortable this sanctuary was, you had no idea if it would last.

Once, you could faintly hear an echo of her wondrous cry many months ago. You went on wishing for the best as you hiked across the barren, yet magnificent snow. It was a perfect kingdom, worthy of Articuno's rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of trekking, the cold of which you had previously grown used to turned on you. It blasted a massive gust of tiny icicles. You slid, trying to keep your grip on the surface of the snow with no luck. You fell over, collapsing into a towering bank of the puffy, white cold. A blizzard you were in no way prepared for began rising up. You at first seen it as a set-back, but this thought soon vanished as you heard a familiar shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Articuno!\" You tried shouting, your voice being muffled by the raging winds.<br>\r\nShe cried back in response, your happiness fading as you seen a huge, magnificent figure fall from the sky crashing into the blurry abyss beyond you. You gasped, cold, salty tears forming in your heart-broken eyes. You winced and trudged forward, determined to do everything in your power to save this mighty goddess from her seemingly-inevitable death. You charged ahead, the essence of your bravery pumping through your veins with immense force and hope. You wouldn't let anything happen to your beloved Articuno...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal daggers swarmed onto your face from the blizzard, another sign of her horrid pain only worsening. This wouldn't be her sorrowful fate, not if you had anything to do about it! You gathered up every last ounce of your strength, tears flying off your blushing, red cheeks behind you. With all your might, you managed to reach moments away from her savoir. You looked below you, halting and panting, seeing the immense ditch created form her long fall. You slid down the sides and trotted up to her, one of your tears staining her sparkling feathers... This was the heart of the struggle, jagged fangs of ice jutted out around the ditch you were both in. You couldn't help but cry... She was dying... She was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleeding... Her glowing, crimson poured out from several places, all places that would result in immediate death for those with slightly lesser strength... Was there any hope left at all...? Had you made it all the way here just to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly! She began rising into the air! A shimmering sapphire aura shot out from her almost lifeless eyes, and the blizzard started swarming around her, covering her view from you. It was a miracle, truly! There was absolute grace and wonder of this impossible event; she was being reborn! New life coursed through her and you, sharing the same breath-taking feeling within yourselves. It was glorious, you felt as one with her heart, feeling the same pounding quakes of love and innocence from deep inside you. You had found yourselves, and everything felt as if it were melting away. The hurricane around Artinuo vanished and she stood mighty in the air, all wounds gone and an elegant swirl of sparkling flakes hovering around her beautiful feathers. She slowly dove down, floating before you and embracing you with her grand, outstretched wings. You smiled and cried, happy to be united with her...</span></div></div>",

You looked up, holding a hand to your forehead to shield your eyes from the sun, hoping to catch a glimpse of the amazing legendary birds. You seen a glimmer of sparkles whiz by when suddenly more clouds began swirling together. You lowered you hand in awe and pulled up your fluffy hood, preparing yourself for the unforgiving cold. A swarm of flurries sprang forth from the sky and a gust of wind blasted into your eyes, blowing off your hood. With a loud crash and explosion of pure, glistening snow, the majestic Articuno shown itself before you. You were thrilled, Articuno was your favorite, and you had the chance to meet them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you come here, human?\" Shrieked a loud, flowing voice that echoed in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come here for you, oh mighty one!\" You proudly stated, shouting so you were loud enough to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" It sounded puzzled, almost happy. It was impossible for Articuno to blush, but it sounded as if it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Really!\" It was so exciting, you were actually having a conversation with your favorite legendary pokemon! And 'legendary' was no exaggeration, Articuno stood before you with such majesty and a powerful grace, you could barely contain the excitement in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you wouldn't mind doing me a favor, human?\" Articuno seemed a bit nervous, but you had barely noticed anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely took a single second to answer \"Of course!

After a few minutes of the announcer finishing his speech, they programmed your space pod and initiated the launching sequence... Goodbye Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds more of the crowd shouting furiously at you, when the vessel you were shoved into began blasting off the ground. Blazing flames erupted beneath you and pushed you through the clouds, through the atmosphere and beyond... The experience was fast and had shook the pod, sending your body flinging to and fro until you banged your head against something by accident. After waking up, you looked out of the single window provided. You were all alone. Nothing but stars and an inky blackness that stained your entire surroundings. You could barely even see Earth anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck to be endlessly drifting, cold and hungry until you died... The rockets stopped and there was nothing you could do to turn them back on, you were really just stuck here... When you looked around, there was nothing to see; when you felt around, there was nothing to turn on; when you smelled the air, there was nothing to breath but your limited oxygen; when you listened though... You listened and you could hear it... hear HIM...

It slathered its saliva all over you inside the humid confinements of Rayquaza's mouth. it brushed over your chest, played with your legs, and wrapped itself around your waist, lightly squeezing and pulling against your smooth, fair skin. It was amazing... It brought you so much pleasure and joy. You moved your mussels on your own again and rubbed yourself against his tongue. You pressed your body against it in a rhythmic pattern, hugging it and squishing it with your arms coiled around it and your face mushed on top of it. It didn't resist and even returned some of your actions. After a short while longer of this, his tongue began moving differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lifted up higher and you held on tighter. It was no use though, no matter how tightly you held, the juices were to slippery and you slid off and into the gaping throat beneath. You were at first worried, but as you sank deeper and deeper into the pulsating mussels around you, the grand feeling of pleasure returned itself to you. It compressed you from all sides, squashing your breasts tightly together. The lovely liquids carried you and helped you slither down deeper in the long gullet as the massaging walls thrust themselves tighter as result of Rayquaza taking another satisfying gulp. Eventually, you slipped into his stomach. As you fell into the spongy stomach sack, a trickle of juices dipped upon your head, only further soaking you silken hair.</span></div></div>",

If you want to get out, just tell me.\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"Have I to pass through... you know...\".<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily. I can just teleport you out if you want. But if you want to take the 'back door'...\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Teleport is fine, thank you.\" you reply, with the effect of making Mesprit giggle harder. <br>\r\n\"Could you get me out now please?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, you are standing right back on Mesprit's paw, her golden eyes fixed on you.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty clear now that you enjoy my company. And I really do enjoy yours, so I think it would be great if we stick together...\" she says gently, rubbing your head with her free paw.<br>\r\n\"Agreed. But... you know... have I to stay this small?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Again, it's up to you. If you want to be to your normal size, I'll grow you back. If you want to stay small instead, then just tell me. I find you way cuter like this though.\" the emotion pokemon says, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, ultimately, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You desire to remain tiny like that, don't you~?\" she sang cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting your lower lip, you give a nervous nod, while glancing around. You take notice that Mesprit had shifted her location from the lake where you were before being shrunk to the insides of cave. Most probably, she had opted to retreat in her own home while you were napping within her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of yourself floating in that fleshy room full of hot liquid return to you. Sure, the idea of being digested startled you a bit, but Mesprit assured you that she wouldn't have done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, true to her word, she didn't, meaning that you can blindly entrust your life to her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, images of her stomach come back to your mind. Being afloat in that hot liquid was actually really nice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself blushing thinking about it. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a confirm, my dear human. And I shall grant your wish, you may stay tiny as long as you want,\" she spoke, before giving another giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this relationship will be so fun~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... ehm... Where are we anyway?\" you ask the legendary.<br>\r\n\"This is my home, silly!\" she giggles in response, before proceeding to explain:<br>\r\n\"This cave is actually on the bottom on the lake you saw before. Oh, and the lake's name is Lake Verity,\" she tells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however focus on one particular, not taking interest in the rest.<br>\r\n\"Bottom...?\" you ask, before realization hits you. <br>\r\n\"Y-You mean... under the lake?!\" you exclaim, suddenly feeling claustrophobic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodes her head several times.<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's right. Now, don't be scared,\" her voice sounds gentle, her golden eyes fix a sweet gaze on you.<br>\r\n\"If you're going to live with me, then you mustn't be so scared of your new home, right?\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calm down a bit. However...<br>\r\n\"Wait... new home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiles.<br>\r\n\"Why of course. It is my duty to protect this Lake, and I'm afraid that I cannot leave it. So, that leaves one choice...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer logic made sense. You really had nothing to lose by moving here, and there wasn't anything bad about it either. <br>\r\n\"A-Alright. I'm fine with it... I guess...\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary closes you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"Marvelous!\" she exclaims, while gently caressing your back as she hugs you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mesprit breaks the hug.<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you around a bit,\" she says, fluttering towards an opening in the rocky walls that you hadn't noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to hold your breath.\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your mouth sealed as Mesprit, who is holding you against her chest, ascends to the surface and emerges from the water of the lake, hovering above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess rises herself of a couple feet in midair while releasing you from her embrace, letting you sit on her palm, which she had cupped for you to be comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" she instructs whole manipulating you so that you see the lake and the forest below. The moonlight shines brightly, giving the water a silvery shade, making it shine brightly as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\" the giantess says from behind you while slowly descending to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she does so, you get to have a minute to think to yourself. It is clear that sticking to this giantess is great, and yes, it is true that you enjoy spending time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is also pretty clear that she's the one in charge in this relationship. You had chose to stay tiny and accept the consequences after all, and Mesprit being in charge was one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird how life could change in a couple hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as Mesprit gently calls out for you. You return to reality, taking notice that the pokemon is now floating above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what would you like to do now, human?\" Mesprit speaks with a smile, while gently nudging your body with her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"How about you pick?\" you then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed pokemon smiled.<br>\r\n\"Eh, I say, let's...</span></div></div>",

She spots the entrance of her underwater cavern and quickly makes her way towards it, entering into her own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she asks, releasing your body from her grip.<br>\r\n\"I believe so,\" you mumble, sending Mesprit into snickering.<br>\r\n\"You'd better get used to that,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" you reply, before glancing around. The giantess gently lets you on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do I sleep?\" you ask, not quite liking the idea of sleeping on the hard, rock floor of the cave. That is another consequences of your choice, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess doesn't reply, and lowers herself as she lays down. You look up Mesprit as she adjusts her position. You find her staring right back at you. For some reason, her face seems more red than pink... you quickly realize that she's blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly understand why.<br>\r\n\"W-Wait... you don't mean...\" she giggles, interrupting you.<br>\r\n\"Sleeping together is the only thing we can do in order to keep you warm. It's not exactly too warm in here at night.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as well. <br>\r\n\"Wait, how can you sleep then?\" you question. Suddenly, an invisible force pushes you forward, towards the expectant giantess, who gets a hold of you and closes your small body in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got fur. And those... things-\" she points to your clothes.<br>\r\n\"... surely can't be even compared to it, meaning that they won't be enough to keep you warm. So, you can either sleep with me, or...\" she pauses to let a smirk grow massive on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Or?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n\"Well... you seemed to like it earlier...\" she says, rubbing her belly with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long to understand what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of sleeping in her stomach is the last you would've thought of right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, yet again, the memory of being in her stomach, doing nothing but floating around in a warm pool without any risk... you blush faintly at the perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit laughs.<br>\r\n\"I've got my confirm~\" she says, before smirking again. She enjoyed teasing you.<br>\r\n\"So, which it'll be? Me? Or my belly?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider both your choices. While sleeping with her seems inviting, you could not deny that the idea of sleeping within her again didn't sound too bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep...</span></div></div>",

She's only waiting for you to say it so that she can burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you opt to go on:<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst what you expected, Mesprit doesn't burst out laughing.

Can't say that I mind cuddling though~\" Mesprit says, her paws wrapping tightly around you, burying you in her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-like pokemon makes a good bed, you find. Her fur is smooth and, like she said, warm. Plus, the beats of her heart, the gurgling of her belly and her rhythmic breathing are crafting quite the lullaby to make you sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying yourself, I see~\" Mesprit's singsong voice calls. You are snapped back to reality, and notice that you had wrapped your minuscule arms around a small zone of Mesprit's fur. You look up, discovering said pokemon staring down at you with a wide, toothy grin, showing her pearly teeth to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you let go, mumbling some words of excuse:<br>\r\n\"Uh... so-sorry... don't know what's gotten into me...\" you sheepishly say, making the giantess smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem,\" she says. <br>\r\n\"If you don't mind losing your emotions, anyway.\" you almost choke as you splutter out:<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Mesprit is sent into a thunderous laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, when was the last time I laughed like this?\" she ironically asks.<br>\r\n\"Relax, will you? You silly human, I was kidding! Feel free to do whatever you wish!... As long as it doesn't involve funny stuff...\" Mesprit warns, her smile fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that kind of person.\" you quickly respond, your face regaining color. The smile comes back on the pokemon's face.<br>\r\n\"See? We'll get along just fine! Go ahead, cuddle as much as you want!\" she cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you extend your arms, getting an armload of fur as you embrace the giantess again.<br>\r\n\"Now, not so bad, is it?\" she asks, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush again.<br>\r\n\"Now then, sleep tight my little guy,\" the giantess leans forward, her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, you wonder what she's up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you soon find out as the pink lips of the pokemon pucker up and press themselves against your left cheek, which burns with embarrassment as the gigantic pair makes contact with your face.<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams!\" Mesprit chimes, before laying her head back down, her tails wrapping around her belly below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply, still quite shocked about the kiss she gave you. You shake your head, trying to rid yourself of the embarrassment, before laying your head down on the furry surface of Mesprit's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the mix of drowsiness and comfort claims your consciousness. Darkness falls in your mind, and you follow it without opposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit notices you asleep, and giggles silently.<br>\r\n\"Who would have expected this? I found myself a cutie~\" she chimes, before yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the giantess joins you to the dream realm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up sleepy! Time to rise and shine!\" a cheery voice calls, disturbing your slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay it no mind, and keep on sleeping.<br>\r\n\"Come on! You don't want to miss a day of fun, do you?!\" the voice chimes.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I do...\" you mumble, trying to cling to your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! Me and you are going to do lots of stuff today, and I won't take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer!\" <br>\r\n\"Well, that's all you're getting for now...\" you mumble again, snuggling deeper into your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a silent giggle, then you feel yourself moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, your consciousness returns as you experience, for a second, an immense pressure while your whole being is soaked to the bone in water. A bunch of bubbles comes out of your mouth as you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quickly pulled back, and your eyes shut open. Only to see a giant, pink headed fiend snickering down at you. You notice that Mesprit is standing - or rather floating - by the entrance of her cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that she just placed you outside, right under the lake.<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" you ask, enraged. The giantess shrugs.<br>\r\n\"Had to wake you up somehow!\" she chimes, resuming her giggling.<br>\r\n\"By the way, good morning! Did you sleep well?\" she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do that again.\" you say as you gulp down the last bite of a berry you have been eating. After her morning prank, Mesprit brought you to the surface, and she provided you a single berry for breakfast. To her, it was just a cheri berry. To you, it was like eating a boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gulps down the remains of her own meal, before turning down to you, who are sitting beside her.<br>\r\n\"No promises!\" she laughs. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a giant paw snatches you up.<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?\" Mesprit asks, pushing you against her face as she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes it was.\" you reply, annoyed. Mesprit smiles sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, how about I make it up to you? How about I let you pick what we do next?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"You can choose. But... thanks anyway...\" you say, trying to not sound ungrateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles as a few ideas take place in her mind.<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

Today we're playing with that,\" Mesprit chimes as she suddenly starts to float upwards, soon reaching the branches of a high tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays belly down on a branch, gently placing you in front of her before letting her limbs hang from the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can question about what you should do, Mesprit picks you with psychic and moves you onto her fur-covered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been a while since I got some attention there,\" she says, before looking back at you.<br>\r\n\"Now, you give my back a good pampering. And, if you're good enough, I'll be the one pampering you~\" she says cheerily, clearly enjoying the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing anything bad with this game, you nod your head and look down at the soft ground beneath your feet, trying to figure out how should you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, you look back at Mesprit, only to find that she has relaxed, her head resting on the branch like her limbs, suggesting that she's leaving everything in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you kneel down and decide to start by giving Mesprit's back a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms extend, your hands press into the fur as you start rubbing the smooth, warm skin beneath the fur. Which shakes as the giantess feels your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking on the wide surface of the giantess' back as you rub each inch of it, pleased moans starting to escape Mesprit's mouth.<br>\r\n\"That's it... keep it up...\" you hear her mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers retract, your rubbing changes into scratching. Then again into petting, your hands emerging from the fur and starting to stroke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Mesprit moans. The human is doing a wonderful job.<br>\r\n\"Yep... you truly deserve a good pampering after you're done...\"  she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, finding yourself slightly motivated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRub-scratch-pet, rub-scratch-pet, rub-scratch-pet, rub-scratch-pet, rub-scratch-pet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhh... enough...\" Mesprit says. One of her tails moves from behind you as it coils around your waist and lifts your body from her back.

You wave a hand dismissively.<br>\r\n\"Now, if I'm not mistaken, I told that I would have returned the favor if you were good,\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were wonderful. Meaning-\" you are suddenly manipulated so that you're laying belly down on the soft palm of the giantess.<br>\r\n\"Your turn~\" she chirps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel her other, free paw reaching on your own back. Mesprit starts petting your small body gently, her paw softly sliding on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself sighing as the large paw keeps moving along the length of your whole back.<br>\r\n\"You like this?\" Mesprit asks from behind you.<br>\r\n\"Mhh...\" you reply, making the giantess giggle merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some cute one you are~\" she chimes. You blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes like this, in silence, with Mesprit keeping up her petting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that's enough,\" she suddenly breaks the silence as she removes her paw from you.<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" you complain, making the giantess giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit drops you onto her belly and leans back against the tree, her arms relaxing as she gazes down at you.<br>\r\n\"Someone enjoyed himself I see~\" she snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be lying if I told the opposite,\" you admit with a pleased sigh.<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, did I make it up to you then?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember about her earlier prank.<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a pair of lips briefly pecking your head, making you blush.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, the day's still long, and we still have lots of things to do~\" Mesprit suddenly chimes.

You don't want to lose and, in order to win, you have to find a good hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly glance backwards, checking if Mesprit is still looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you spent less than fifteen hours with her, you quickly learned how mischievous she is. She could be easily cheating right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Mesprit is still looking away. You gaze back in front of yourself... only to notice at the last second that two, identical things are in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up bumping into them, falling down on your behind. Feeling a bit dazed, you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drains from your face as you notice a gigantic blue creature towering above you. It looks much like Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is its head, which is yellow instead of pink, and it's round. Its eyes are closed, you notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the creature definitely felt you as its head moves down, making you feel like those closed eyes are gazing down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hi there,\" the creature says in a feminine voice as she bends to pick you up. You quickly get back on your feet as two huge paws get a hold of you and scoop you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly squirm to get free, but at this reduced size, such task is impossible to achieve. However, the pokemon soon releases you, letting you sit onto her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? You seem like a human, but... only much smaller...\" the newcomer bluntly says.<br>\r\n\"How did you get this small, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a new voice, Mesprit stops counting and turns around, noticing a familiar pokemon holding her little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Uxie!\" she chimes cheerfully while floating closer.<br>\r\n\"I see you've found my mouse~\" she then playfully says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mesprit, what happened to this human? How did he get so small?\" the newcomer asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mesprit smiles.<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" she chimes, hovering closer to the yellow headed creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon points her closed eyelids on Mesprit. You assume that she's curious.<br>\r\n\"This human came here. According to what he said, he was desperate. So I granted him a wish,\" Mesprit explains with a hint of a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such wish required me to shrink him down... and then, we found that we like each other's company. So now, he lives with me!\" she exclaims with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon holding you opens her mouth, confused.<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks. Mesprit nods.<br>\r\nThe new pokemon looks back down at you.<br>\r\n\"... Did you agree to this?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly uncomfortable, you slowly nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggles as she senses your discomfort. She decides to fix that.<br>\r\n\"Small one, meet my sister Uxie,\" she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sister...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice to meet you,\" you say, awkwardly extending a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newcomer, who Mesprit called \u2018Uxie\u2019, seems to stare at you for a while, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore smiling a little.<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" she says, taking your extended hand in her paw and shaking it. You just seem to notice the softness of her paws...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mesprit,\" Uxie suddenly says.<br>\r\n\"You said this human lives with you now?\" she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods, blushing vaguely.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound... wrong for a guardian?\" Uxie asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, confused.<br>\r\n\"Guardian?\" you ask, before recalling that Mesprit told you she protects this lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiles while looking at Uxie.<br>\r\n\"Come on, sis, does THIS human look like a bad one?\" she asks, before smiling even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here you~\" she then says, snatching you from her sister and hugging you lovingly. Blushing slightly, you hug back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the scene, Uxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you've convinced me,\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit rises her head.<br>\r\n\"Hey, now that I think about it... why are you here in the first place?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'know, I was kinda bored...\" Uxie admits while rubbing her head. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me and this little guy were just about to play...\" she says as she looks at you...</span></div></div>",

What game?\" Uxie wonders.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Mesprit says, remembering that her sister just came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed guardian dons a bright smile.<br>\r\n\"Just before you came here, we were playing-\" Uxie interrupts.<br>\r\n\"Wait. You referred to the human as \u2018mouse\u2019 when I came here, right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods, and closes one eye. Uxie had already figured the game before Mesprit even spoke. <br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm in,\" the yellow headed pixie says with an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggles, before looking at you again. She lowers her head in her paws, and gently pecks you.<br>\r\n\"Good luck, cutie,\" she says, bending as she gently lets you down, before rising to her full height again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your shrunken size, both sisters looked like monolithic, living statues. And the fact that they're hovering in midair makes them look even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, starting now, we'll give you five minutes to get as far as possible from us,\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n\"Then, we'll come after you,\" Uxie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"How much time do I have to escape you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie and Mesprit start talking to each other.<br>\r\n\"Three hours.\" both say in unison after a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit starts to turn around, while Uxie bends over, her head reaching your level.<br>\r\n\"I know - we just met, but...\" she smiles.<br>\r\n\"Good luck, human,\" she says sympathetically. You smile back as the pixie rises back up to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, without thinking twice, you sprint away from the two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the thick forest around Lake Verity... although that with your diminished size, you surely didn't get too far. In fact, if you listen closely, you're sure you can still hear Uxie and Mesprit talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to run out of breath, and decide that this is a good moment to search for a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start looking around for a good place to hide. A rather difficult task, since you're in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, thanks to your small size, you could fit in plenty of places, like a hole in the ground or a small puddle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, human~\" a familiar voice echoes around. You recognize it as Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... that means that the five minutes you had to hide is up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frenetically start to look around for a hiding spot. And, finally, you spot a hole in the trunk of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying that it isn't the home of some Pachirisu, you run towards it and swiftly climb inside, before cowering. Right before Mesprit comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human~! Where are you~?\" Mesprit sings as she starts looking around for you. The guardian giggles to herself.<br>\r\n\"Can't hide from me! I sense your emotions!\" she says. In fact, she senses your emotions, coming straight from the tree you're hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the psychic type decides to render things a bit more interesting and pretends to be unaware of your location.<br>\r\n\"Come on out small one! I'll find you sooner or later!\" she says as she moves over a random bush, turning her back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your hiding spot, you notice her actions, and decide that this is the perfect time to try to leave. Slowly, you climb out, and hop onto the ground, before starting to walk as you try to slip your way past Mesprit, who is busy searching in the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you start thinking that you'll make it the giantess starts giggling as she senses your emotions again... only not in the same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian looks around, wearing a smirk on her face as she looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Look who I found!\" she exclaims with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the giantess starts floating around you at full speed. You let out a startled cry as you dodge her, before starting to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit starts chasing you.<br>\r\n\"Won't get away~!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, against her predictions, you find a patch of tall grass and dive into it without even thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see you any longer, Mesprit hovers above the patch, trying to spot her little one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, little does she know is that you're no longer around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally managing to make Mesprit lose your tracks, you make your way towards the lake, hoping to take a breather. Luckily, you still hadn't ran into Uxie, and she wasn't around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was what you believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, you were being watched. From the branches of a tree, Uxie smiles as she silently starts to descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to regain your breath, you don't notice a figure floating behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you turn around, noticing the pixie towering above you.<br>\r\n\"Uxie...!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie laughs.<br>\r\n\"Looks like you underestimated me. Shouldn't have done that,\" Uxie giggles playfully as she picks you up, while your brain works the best it can to find a solution to escape the pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if fate itself wanted to lend a hand, you suddenly have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I think you shouldn't underestimate that guy with the Umbreon!\" you say with a convincingly alerted expression as you point behind the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlerted, Uxie turns around. And you throw yourself from Uxie's paws, landing on the ground, the grass mercifully breaking your fall. Without losing anymore time, you sprint away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that no one was there, Uxie turns to face you... only to notice that you're no longer on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she notices you running away from her. Her facial expression shifts from a surprised one into a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you little-\" she starts chasing you while lowering herself to catch you, her paw extending as she flies closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance backwards, noticing the giantess about to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea springs up in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uxie gets even closer, you leap up. The giantess touches the ground with a surprised expression. You land onto the back of her paw, right in front of Uxie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk.<br>\r\n\"See you later, Uxie!\" you tease while leaping off her paw and running off, soon disappearing in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie remains there for a couple of moments, mouth wide open.<br>\r\n\"A human just outsmarted me...\" she mumbles, before her mouth curls into a smirk.<br>\r\n\"It'll be sweet when I catch you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have many other encounters with the two sisters. Somehow, though, you managed to make it to the lake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of time passed since the game started, and by now you're seriously considering the fact that you might actually make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat before you hear both Mesprit and Uxie calling out for you... they're close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, you look around, and glance at your last hiding spot: Lake Verity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a quick calculation, you estimate that you must hide for still a few minutes. Then, you would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced, you walk over the lake and take a deep breath, before slipping into the water and diving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you disappear underwater, Uxie and Mesprit come out from the forest.<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Uxie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"We have still a few minutes left,\" Uxie adds.<br>\r\n\"Where could he be?\"</span></div></div>",

You try your best to remain underwater as long as you can, but you find it extremely difficult to do so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you soon come to the point where you can't resist any longer. A bunch of bubbles comes out of your mouth as you swim upwards and surface, letting a sigh of relief as your lungs fill up with fresh air. You lean forward, gripping the solid ground as you get out of the water, your body soaked to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your break wasn't meant to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, trying to find you, Mesprit noticed something moving, sliding out of her lake and collapsing to the ground. She lost view of it when it disappeared into the grass, but she was sure of what it was - her little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the guardian taps Uxie's shoulder, before gesturing towards where you are resting. Uxie smiles as she floats around, while Mesprit hovers in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow eclipses your whole being. You glance upwards, noticing Mesprit staring down at you with her usual smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi human~\" she sings as she bends, one of her paws darting towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, you roll out of the way, the paw slamming into the ground where you were. It swiftly retreats back, and Mesprit is quick to bend again, both arms spread as she reaches out to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spring back on your feet and jump back, her paws closing around nothing as she hits the ground. You find yourself staring straight at her golden eyes and back up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you end up bumping into something soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously glance upwards, noticing Uxie towering above you, a smile on her face. And you take note that you actually bumped into her tail, which starts to coil around your waist, intent to bring you upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you bend, the tail now menacing to coil around your neck. <br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Mesprit exclaims as Uxie quickly stops, knowing that you might just end up dying like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?\" the yellow headed giantess exclaims as you leap away from the two giantesses.

Mesprit smirks.<br>\r\n\"Better start running~\" she says cheerfully, extending her paw towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodge it, and start running as Mesprit gets up, before she and Uxie start to chase you yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out mouse~\" you hear Mesprit shouting.<br>\r\n\"Because we're coming!\"</span></div></div>",

Gently he patted the Pichu soft on it's head, who warmed up to his touch, smiling as it rubbed its cheek on his palm, before he stood back up. Once the male was finished the Pichu hopped off to it's parents, who hugged the young Pokemon with happiness, glad to see it's healed up. All three looked upwards to the male and gave him a sincere smile, which he gladly returned. Grabbing his rucksack over his shoulder he waved gently as he walked off into the forest as the two Mouse Pokemon waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a young adult going only by the name of Ethan, with blonde hair and hazel eyes, he wore a simple jacket to keep away the cold, with an attire not worth noting, excluding the large backpack he carried. To many, he was a no one, just some wandering stranger with no house to call a home and no destination set in his mind. To those he was an mindless bum, but to Pokemon, he was seen as a saint. Friendly to all those he meets, he is remembered by the many he had met for his selfless and generous heart, always carrying food of all kinds and medical supplies as stocked up as he could, ready to share this with any Pokemon he finds hungry, help those who are lost and heal those who are hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle was known about him except his unselfish personality and his warm heart. As many Pokemon, whether he helped them or just happened to watch him, thought of him in the highest reverence, even if he would just bashfully admit he was nothing but a normal human being who simply loved helping others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was out of the forest and was walking up a rocky path, the wooded area ended right at the beginning of the mountainous area. Walking up the heightened path he peered to the side; no chain link fence supported the side, making it easy for someone to accidentally fall out, he kept to the wall side. However, this didn't stop him from peering outwards, seeing the beautiful landscape that only nature could make so beautiful. Unfortunately, walking forwards and staring to the side may not always be the best decision, as he didn't realize he had just walked into someone standing in the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden stop made him fall backwards on his rear with an 'oof', looking upwards he noticed he had walked into the backside of a large human, much too big for his age, as he looked to be the same age as him, except wearing leather and metallic studs over his clothes; the kinds of people you wouldn't want to purposely make angry. And they were three of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so so sorry.\" He apologised immediately, hoping he hadn't hurt the other man. Slowly, the male turned around, staring poison-tipped daggers at the meeker male. \"Watch where you're going, punk!\" The other, larger human spoke with a deep, intimidating voice. Ethan tried not to judge him. After all, what could would it do to judge someone without fully knowing who they were. That was what he believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry for what I had done, it's my fault for that. Please, I hope you could forgive me?\" He tried to walk past them but a hand stopped him. This one belonging to a tall, lanky male with a purple mohawk and sharp, bright glasses. \"Wat ya got in the backpack, kid?\" Another spoke, this one belonging to short, pudgy, dirty male. All three were wearing the same kind of clothing; mainly a leather jacket and jeans. He started rummaging through his sack, but in one quick motion Ethan pulled away, hoping to not offend them in some way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease don't do that. All I have in here is food and supplies for Pokemon. I have some food if you are hungry.\" Quickly reaching in he pulled out chocolate bar, but was smacked away by the third human. His body tense up with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey, guy.\" The second guy spoke in a calm, almost friendly tone, as he slide to the side of the wandering male, putting an arm around his shoulder as he brung him closer with a sly grin. \"We know what you thinking right now. I mean, you see three guys all dressed up in leather, skulking around an abandoned path and being all antisocial and the like. We know what you're thinking; 'oh my, three scary teens loitering around, they must be bad news.' Is that what you're thinking of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...no but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm guessing you don't understand our predicament, do you? You see-\" He stopped briefly as he pulled out a small object. Bringing it closer to Ethan's face he seemed to tap it slightly, only for the object to reveal itself as switchblade. The poor human's eyes widened when he saw this. \"We. Need. Money. So, before it gets a little bit out of hand here...\" He paused to drag the knife slowly across the other's cheeks. \"We'll be taking yours. OK?\" With the human stood firmly in place the mugger moved away to face the male. Snapping his fingers he called out. \"Boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two others let their presence became known again as they both moved forward to search the wanderer's backpack, but in an instant he dared to move away from them both, only to be stopped by the second who firmly grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got nothing in here for you three. I'm sorry but I've got no money.\" He called out as he tried break away, but the mugger was not having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking DARE take us for a bunch of fools!\" He yelled. \"How stupid do you think we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go! Please, these aren't for you!\" He shouted, trying to plead to them to let himself go, but unfortunately the first, bigger male grabbed both his arms from behind, halting his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! HELP! HELP! HE-\" He called out to someone, anyone. But in a single instant, he felt a sharp object pierce his chest, his breathing stopped as the words were caught in his throat, his muscles froze as he looked downwards, witnessing the mugger's knife had lodged itself in his torso. Slowly, the larger male let go, keeping a firm hold on the backpack as he pulled it off, letting the human drift backwards a few steps before dropping down in a lump, the only noise they seemed to hear was male dropping down onto the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...why..?\" He forced out before becoming silent. The first and third teen opened it up as they searched inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should not have done that.\" The second human said coldly, staring at the dying body laying on the forgotten path with a stoic expression. Turning back to his teammates the third mugger had said while rummaging through the backpack; \"The damn kid was right, there's nothing in here but bloody bandages and Poke food. There isn't a single useful piece of garbage in here. Not even a fucking single PokeDollar. The hell was that kid doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...please...\" He managed to wheeze. The second mugger crouched down cupping his hand over his ear ah seems to listen intently. \"...give those...to the\u2026..Pokemon who\u2026.live\u2026 around here...\" Giving off a laugh he stood up. He ushered the two to leave it alone, seeing as they have no use for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless shit.\" The second one said as he spat on the ground. \"We better go before someone see this.\" He announced before the three ran off, leaving the lone human to lie on the rock path, staring at the clouds as his vision blurred and he coughed up the red liquid, thinking about his prior life before this fatal moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had little regrets. He lived his life to fullest, and he was content knowing it was a fulfilling life. What life could be better than helping out innocent Pokemon? To him he only wished he could have helped more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rai?\" A soft voice called to him, daring to look to the side he saw the visage of a Raichu staring at him with tear-filled eyes. A second Raichu stood by it, followed by a Pichu, one with a plaster on it's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello again.\" He spoke softly as he feebly raised his hand over, and, ever so gently, stroked the small Pichu on it's head. \"I'm sorry, it seems I am not able to see you again one more time.\" He said with a sad smile, watching the Tiny Mouse Pokemon cry into his hand. He hadn't realized a small gathering of other Pokemon, all different shapes and sizes stood over him, all of them witnessing the kind heart he had displayed to them in some form or another. Not a single one looked on without sadness plastered on their face, all knowing there was nothing they could do. Slowly, the males stroking stopped. His arm going limp on the floor as his final strength gave out, all Pokemon looking on in shock. Turning away the Pichu hugged it's mother Raichu for comfort who returned the hug back the same, letting the tears roll down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease.\" The mother Raichu spoke. \"Please don't just die like this. You can't...just leave us like this. You are...were\u2026.just don't leave us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus above.\" The male mouse Pokemon started as he looked up to the heavens. \"If you can hear us, please, please, PLEASE help this human. Please, we're begging you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus.\" A Pidgeotto called upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus above.\" A Scyther said as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARCEUS, PLEASE HELP.\" They all said in unison, crying out to the Alpha Pokemon, there voices seemed to be nothing more than a helpless prayer, scattering to the wind, unknownst to the world as somewhere, in a void of nothingness, a being opened it's eyes as the voices of multiple Pokemon hit the creatures ears. Slowly, the creature, floating in the endless void, started to glow as it focused on the area of Pokemon calling out it's name<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is calling my name? </span></div></div>",
