We work hard every day to protect their safety and yet THIS girl is the one who gets all the attention for solving just a single crime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Littlefinger, his assistant, who was better natured and worked for HaHaPD for shorter than her boss, did not comment, just pointed at the station's television's screen.<br>\r\n\"I believe that's her, having an interview with Hollering Heights Community Channel.\"<br>\r\nThe chief's jaw dropped.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar figure of the girl detective was standing next to a hyperactive reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm standing here in front of HH Public Library with our own amazing Summer Salt!<br>\r\nMiss Salt, everybody is talking about your brave accomplishment after you entered the spoooky Featherton Manor! <br>\r\nDid you know that the previous police chief proved that the ghost was an urban hoax?<br>\r\nBut you proved that there WAS a ghost! Summer, how do you feel about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I knew why everyone always wants to tickle me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Capital! What a comeback! So, let me ask you the one question that is probably on the minds of all of our viewers! Are your feet really that ticklish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Excessively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do if I touched them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would kick you in the face and then have you fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But Chief Bullroc wan't the only one watching Summer's interview with malicious interest on this day! <br>\r\nSomewhere far off, a nefarious figure also had their eyes glued to the television screen with interest.<br>\r\nWas it the revengeful Clown Prince observing his arch-enemy?<br>\r\nWas it the Maharaja of Tinglingstan whose slave-girl traffic Summer had crushed during a previous adventure?<br>\r\nOr one of her numerous other villains?<br>\r\n\"So, Summer Salt is about to announce her plans publicly...What a great opportunity to finally get my revenge! Wherever she goes, she better be prepared, for I will be waiting! Wa-ha ha! Mu-ha-ha!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, the charming Summer and her interviewer were just about to conclude the broadcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, one last secret for our viewers.\" The reporter said. \"What's next for Summer Salt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, the next thing I think I'll do is...\"</span></div></div>",

The old grandfather clock across the room was right now her chosen enemy. Until it struck 1 o'clock, she would be nailed to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to a backwards somersault, to pass the time. Failing that, she chewed her hair, then she put both feet behind her neck. The cats were watching her with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loathed being babysat by Ms. Hobbs, but over time developed a sort of wariness of her. <br>\r\nIt was the way the senile old bat never seemed to notice anything Mouse did. Mouse was used to being caught and rather banked on adults' predictable reactions. But the way Ms. Hobbs just never noticed her attempts caused Mouse to be deeply suspicious of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Hobbs actually only knew of one way to deal with kids. She sat her down on her couch, and gave her horrible ancient imported chocolate cookies to eat. Mouse rebelled the first couple of times and fled the couch, but in time she became quite docile.  It was no accident that the Salts kept choosing her as her babysitter.<br>\r\nIt was probably the fascination that Ms. Hobbs would go through the same motions each time, regardless of the result she got.<br>\r\nIn Mouse's mind, it was long decided that Ms. Hobbs was a witch, and Mouse was determined to find her out and catch the moment when she drops her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman sat motionless in her armchair in front of the old clock.<br>\r\nMouse was watching her like a hawk.<br>\r\nHalf a dozen cats were doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of being intensely monitored, she suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n\"Ah...I believe it is time to feed Mitzi.\"<br>\r\nMouse perked up. She rather liked Mitzi who was one of the old lady's gentler cats.<br>\r\n\"Ah...On the other hand, <i>I</i>'ll feed her. You feed Mr. Tibbles.\"<br>\r\nTibbles the old tomcat stared at Mouse through his one good eye, with a pose that suggested bloodshed and murder and the loss of at least one arm if somebody tried to stroke it and call it \"cute kitty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse hesitantly took one of the bowls Ms. Hobbs brought in, and pushed it in front of Tibbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the old tabby threw itself at the food, the phone rang.<br>\r\nMouse.snatched it greedily before Ms. Hobbs could even identify where the noise was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan dear, it's mom. Can you please say goodbye to your babysitter and...\"<br>\r\nMouse darted to the door like a bullet.<br>\r\n\"Bye old hag!\" she shouted back to a flustered Ms. Hobbs. \"I'm leaving! Summer's coming back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What did she say? Summer's coming back? I better close the drapes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nSummer entered through the front gate to find Mouse jump into her arms.<br>\r\n\"You're back!\" she stated. \"How was it?<br>\r\nOoh, you'll NEVER guess where dad had planned the family holiday!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you don't say...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"</span></div></div>",

The worst possible thing to happen, had just happened.<br>\r\n\"Margaret. What are YOU doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enjoying a holiday with my girlfriends? You and your little pals can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" <br>\r\nThe girl next to her held up a hand, silencing her.<br>\r\n\"-<i>I</i>- want to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, D., she's the girl I've been talking about, the...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"If you listen to me\" Margaret whispered. \"I could tell you about some of her weak points-\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Marge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was watching the detective quartet with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer knew she had to pay special attention to this one.<br>\r\nThe girl had long raven black hair and hazel brown skin that made the other girls' tan blush with shame. She was sexy without apparent effort. (But Summer knew how much effort it took to look THIS natural.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret's swimsuit showed a lot of skin too, but her pale white freckled skin and failed attempts to control the shape of her hair seemed juvenile and desperate next to this girl's beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered them a hand.<br>\r\n\"I'm Desiderata. But you may call me Desiree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer didn't take it. She put it back on her waist and glanced around like she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are Margaret's friends. My parents own the holiday house up on the hill. How'd you like to be called over for a sleepover?\"<br>\r\nShe suppressed a yawn so fake she didn't even bother taking the deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know, we're staying here with our parents, they'll probably say...\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Don't be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey marched off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that settles it.\" Chris said. \"You know Margaret. This HAS to be a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Jamie said. \"We don't know that girl yet. She didn't act like she was Margaret's friend for real. Maybe she just genuinely wanted to talk.\"<br>\r\n\"Or to show off.\" Chris mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer decided to...Oh whatever, you know this is going to end with her attending even though she shouldn't right? :p<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer arrived. The holiday house was indeed large. There didn't seem to be a very sleepover or party mood when she entered though. Five girls just sulking around on couches and bar chairs, including Margaret who was sitting in an armchair in a corner and in a bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer! How nice of you to have come.\"<br>\r\nDesiree came down the stairs wearing pajamas that looked too expensive to be used for that purpose.<br>\r\n\"And your friends are..?\"</span></div></div>",

It's not like your family can't afford it.\" Said Summer<br>\r\n\"Having another one commissioned would take too long.

I don't want to end up tickled, or worse by some savages just because she pushes wrong button out of curiousity or something!\"<br>\r\n\"I agree that Mouse shouldn't go... but I don't trust you enough to want to be left alone with you without Chris and Jamie.\"Said Summer<br>\r\n\"And how can I trust you? You can gang up on me later, and take my processor once I get it back\"Said Pao Ting<br>\r\n\"If you really bought it through legal means then I won't take it from you.\"Said Summer<br>\r\n\"Let's do it like this then. We will split in two groups, one, composed of your sister and one of those two will stay here at the beach and in case we get captured will inform authorities. Other group will be me, you and the other one of those two. We will go into the base of those thieves and recover my shipment.\" Pao Ting finally explained<br>\r\n\"Not fair! I want to go into the thief base too!\" Complained Mouse<br>\r\n\"Be quiet Mouse, it's not a place for kids!\" Said Summer and then turned to Pao Ting\"Alright, but how will we keep in contact with the other group?\"<br>\r\n\"I have a second communicator built into a multifunctional watch like mine, I will give it to the person who stays here. Just don't break it! It's probably worth more than all of your homes combined!\" Said Pao Ting pointing at a watch she had<br>\r\n\"Why did you have two if you planned to go alone?\"Summer questioned<br>\r\n\"It would make no sense to have just one if they are supposed to be able to connect to each other, right?\" Said the chinese girl, looking away for a moment, as if trying to hide something<br>\r\n\"That's not really what I asked for...\" Said Summer<br>\r\n\"Well, if you have no more questions, decide who should go with us and I will give the watch to other person.\" Said Pao Ting, clearly getting impatient already<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only thing keeping her from ever being honest with Summer about it was Chris. She would feel terrible to try taking Summer from someone who had feelings for her for so long... that and lingering doubt that Summer would be interested in other girls. That's why she felt a bit obliged to try having the two get together, perhaps that way the aching in her own heart would stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a part of Jamie thought that what she just did was a mistake.

Why do you ask?\", \"Just wanted to check something.\" Jamie replied quickly, not having time to tell Chris about whole situation.<br>\r\nThe \"Chris\" Summer was talking to now however, didn't even touch his phone during all of that. There was no doubt, whoever was talking to Summer there, wasn't real Chris. What should Jamie do about it though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their arms were tied behind their backs, and their legs were tied together(That is each having her legs tied together, but not with each other) But they weren't alone, woman in sunglasses from before was also there observing the two. Now that they could see, aside from the sunglesses she also had long brown hair and looked to be in her middle twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look who woken up. Two girls who don't know when to keep out of adults' bussiness.\" The woman said<br>\r\n\"Who are you and why are you doing this?!\" Summer yelled<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter who am I, you Summer Salt are here because you need to realize that there's no place for meddling kids like you this town. I believe that after few days in our care, you will be willing to stop your irresponsible amateur sleuthing...\" Explained the woman<br>\r\n\"Who are you doing that for?! Clown Prince? Pao-Ting?\" Said Summer trying fruitlessly to free herself from the ropes.<br>\r\n\"Phew, I wouldn't take orders from a lowly criminal or spoiled kid who thinks she owns the world.\" Said the woman<br>\r\nSummer noted how it was rather odd for someone who seemed to operate outside the law herself to call someone \"criminal\"... but it didn't give her any idea who could the woman in sunglasses be.<br>\r\n\"Just wait when I am out of those ropes...\" Said Jamie trying to be threatening while desperately trying to free herself from the ropes as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you are so lively, I guess we can find a better way for you to use that energy.\" Said the woman, and moved closer to Jamie's feet<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare...\" Said Jamie as the woman started untying her shoes<br>\r\nThe woman said nothing as Jamie's shoes came off, leaving her only in her black socks...<br>\r\n\"Stop it! From what you said you wanted me, and Jamie just happened to come at wrong time! Leave her alone!\" Summer tried to intervene<br>\r\n\"Well, she was with you during your amateur investigations, wasn't she? This way you will also learn that your actions have consequences even for your friends...\" The woman said ominously<br>\r\nThen the woman in glasses moved one of her nails up Jamie's socket foot, eliciting a giggle from the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if your friend is just as ticklish as you, Summer Salt...\" The woman said, grabbing the tip of one of Jamie's socks and pulling it off<br>\r\nJamie's feet were a bit bigger than Summer's, since she was also a bit taller than her, her sole was looking smooth and she had nice long toes, just begging to be tickled... ironically the toes were also her most ticklish spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Jamie felt the woman's nails raking up and down her sole, making her giggle at first, but the giggling quickly was intensifying and turning into laughing...<br>\r\n\"DOAHAHAHAH YOUHOHOR WOHOHOHORST!\" Yelled Jamie as she started to laugh out loud, when the woman started to tickle undersides of her toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt terrible having to look at her best friend who was trying to help her out sorting things out with her other best friend Chris, but what could she do? Only thing that came to her mind would be asking to be tickled herself instead... and did she really want that?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am not a thief, you can keep your clothes and footwear. They will obviously be taken off many more times in upcoming days, but they will be returned to you.\" The woman said<br>\r\nIt made Summer wonder, why would their kidnapper be so concerned about breaking the law, or working with other criminals... could she be some detective herself?

I mean ma'am!\" Replied the woman called Kaklinsky<br>\r\n\"Relax Alice, I understand this is unusual operation.

In the following minutes Summer and Jamie were carried inside the hut, which turned out to be surprisingly clean and well furnished compared to how it looked from the outside, could it be that this house was used for more kidnappings in the past? The two women carried the girls down a staircase which appeared after the sunglasses wearing one pressed a few buttons on what seemed like a code locking console. Once they were there, it turned out there was a small underground facility located there. Jamie and Summer were put in a small room that was arranged into a cell, there was a single bed inside it, as well as an empty desk with a chair by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We expected just Summer Salt, so you will have to get by with just one bed somehow.\" Explained the woman in sunglasses<br>\r\n\"You're gonna pay for this!\" Said Jamie, who just regained breath after the tickling she went through in the car<br>\r\n\"I  doubt it. This underground bunker is equipped with sleeping gas spreading system, I can turn it on manually whenever I want, or it turns on automatically if you use wrong code at the console. You will walk free after you are ready to abandon your unsafe hobby, no sooner than that.\" Explained the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she undone the ropes at both girls' legs, to allow them to walk around cell freely, and locked the door to it. Finally leaving both Summer and Jamie alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I keep getting myself into mess like that...\"Said Summer while trying to do something about the still remaining ropes tying her wrists together behind her back<br>\r\n\"It's my fault this time, I shouldn't have encouraged you to go talk to Chris like that...\" Said Jamie<br>\r\n\"No it's not, you had no way of knowing that. And if you didn't go to warn me, who knows if it wouldn't be too late before everyone realized I was gone? I just feel bad for getting you into it like that... that woman tickled you quite a lot back in the van\" Said Summer<br>\r\n\"Heh, I survived much worse tickling than that! Still, not much good my warning did, we just got captured together.\" Said Jamie<br>\r\n\"Well, as they said, they weren't prepared to capture anyone more than just me. Perhaps it will give us an advantage, which will let us escape and discover who they really are!\" Said Summer<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's something weird about those two... and wasn't there more of them earlier? I mean none of those looks like they could hit me in the back of my head, and I am sure that someone did before.\" Said Jamie<br>\r\n\"Well... it seemed like they enlisted help from some criminals we helped to capture in the past. Before they put me to sleep, they started talking something about letting them leave town...\" Explained Summer<br>\r\n\"Bastards...\" Said Jamie<br>\r\n\"If I had to bet, they probably have military or police background... nonetheless I have no idea why would someone like that have interest in us.\" Explained Summer<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's just like you Summer being able to deduce quite a lot in such a short time! Now that I think... my dad works at the police station, perhaps he could have some idea, if we managed to contact him, even though I am sure they took our phones... Maybe they fired some detective recently because she had worse results than you?\"Said Jamie<br>\r\n\"That's possible... still, first we shoud get our hands free. Let's stand back to back and try to untie each other.\" Said Summer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stood back to back, and started trying to untie each other's ropes, Jamie blushed slightly feeling Summer's hands touch hers... she will have to confess her feelings to her sometime later it seems, it definitely wasn't the time or place for that now.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it's torture and it's annoying but it's...it's not like I ALWAYS hated it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...Remember that time in the mansion, when we were trapped, but you just couldn't help NOT to tickle our feet...\"<br>\r\n\"Er, I rather hoped you'd have already forgotten that...\"<br>\r\n\"How could I forget it?

No! nothing like that...Jamie - you know the reason too, right?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had to admit that she did. It wasn't that Summer wasn't happy for Chris.
