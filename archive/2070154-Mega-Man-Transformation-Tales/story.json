Maybe... Just maybe, X might even be willing to do so. He walked around, soon requesting help from Douglas and Palette in an attempt to prepare modifying X- He was, despite being the basis for all Reploids, a black box of some sort... Even if the inventor of Reploids was a Paleobotanist as opposed to a proper Roboticist, X was a constant mystery. Zero chuckled to himself, amused at the possibility of X having some kind of gender swap function. He soon caught up with X, placing his hand on his best friend's shoulders, awkwardly explaining what he wanted before gulping and waiting for a response.</span></div></div>",

The only ones who will actually know about this are the six of us. and once everything has been set in place, we mustn't talk about Megaman.\" The servbots looked confused. Servbot 30 asked, \"Why not Miss Tron?\" Tron then shrugged in disbelief. \"Because once this is finished, Megaman won't even be part of anybody's minds but ours. If any of you talk about this, it will most definitely cause problems, and the one who spoke will be in the most trouble. This has to be our little secret. Understand?\" The servbots became silent.

Just then, she saw a young woman with long brown hair in glasses. <i>'Hold on, she looks familiar.'</i> Just then an Admiral. <i>'I'm guessing that's Admiral Gundra.'</i> The admiral then proceeded to speak to the girl. \"We have reports of a ship arriving on my island. I would like you to send some men down to find it. While they're doing that, I've been told a girl wants to come in to look at my collection of scumbags who dared to piss me off. If you wouldn't mind Captain Denise, I want you to give her a tour.\" Dawn was shocked at what she heard. Denise nodded to the admiral. \"Yes Admiral Gundra. I will ensure the troops are dispatched immediately and the girl is shown the criminals.\" After the admiral leaves, Dawn looked back at Denise. <i>'That's Denise? I didn't even recognize her. She definitely matured. When Tron and I first met her, she was a pretty sad cop. Wow. To think now she's managed to become a high ranked officer.'</i> Dawn thought. <i>'I'd be more proud of her if she wasn't one of my obstacles right now.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn thought for a moment. <i>'I could easily impersonate her. Just knock her out, take her uniform, and style my hair the way hers is now.'</i></span></div></div>",

I'll show you Alpha while we wait until midnight.\" Roll then looked at Dawn. \"This is bad. If he's willing to kill Zero without any remorse, who knows what he would do to Tron.\" Dawn nodded. \"It's troublesome.

I... assume you have some business with me?\" Dawn then whispered to Roll, \"Let's keep note not to recruit this guy.\" Roll whispered back, \"Good idea.\" The admiral turned to Roll. \"Careful around Alpha, Missy. He's quite ravenous.\" Alpha then proceeded to sniff Dawn. \"You smell salty. Me like.\" Gundra then said to Roll, \"For the remainder of the tour, How about you go on ahead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll was shocked at the admiral's words. At the same time though, she saw this as an opportunity. Dawn nodded her to go. At the same time, Dawn was just as confused by the admiral's choice. After Roll left, The admiral proceeded to turn to Dawn. \"Now that she's gone, I'd like to ask. Who are you? Because you're certainly not that wimpy Denise.\" Dawn became scared. 'Oh no. busted.' she thought as Gundra put his hand on her. \"Uh huh. Very nice. I think I've taken a liking to you. Tell me something. The real Denise is locked up.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is about transformations. Namely to the cast of mega man. Let's begin with rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sex may not be detailed if put into the story (it's rated 13+)<br>\r\n2. Deaths in any written chapters will be put under review. If they are too gruesome, or are the death of somebody important to the story, it will most likely be deleted.<br>\r\n3. No crossovers. I do enjoy those, but let's keep things in their own universes and their own timelines. That said, you are allowed to reference characters from other franchises. Just so we're clear, when I say no crossovers, I mean between Mega Man universes. Note that creating counterparts of characters from other mega man series for a story in the series your writing for does not count as a crossover since every series has had their own counterparts of characters from other series.<br>\r\n4. No transformation that is Mega Man being turned into Quint. I just feel that's cheating a story, especially since it's clarified in the games the Quint is Mega Man from the future. That said, I'm not stopping stories that involve Mega Man being turned evil.... Just so long as he isn't turned into Quint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the rules. May subject to change, but for now they are what should be followed.</td>",
