You open your eyes to see that it was exactly what happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked and jumped up to see that you were on a mountain?! This seemed impossible as you looked around and saw it was most flat on top. You looked below and knew there was no way you could get down without falling and becoming a red stain upon the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the surrounding around the rock and see huge grass that were the size of buildings. You begin to figure it out. You\u2019re surrounding weren\u2019t giant.... you were tiny! You figured you at to be at least 2-4 inches. At this you began to panic more before you notice two ginormous creatures begin to walk up to the rock. They were humanoid lions! One was a muscled male that had golden fur with a bright auburn mane and a large cock that you could see peeking from his loin cloth that had a small satchel tied to it. The other was a dark tan lioness who also had a bit of muscle with large tits to match. You screamed out of fear and the female seemed to hear you. You quickly hid behind a stone. She looked around but could not find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard the male speak. \u201cIs something wrong, Sarabi?\u201d.<br>\r\nThe lioness shook her head. \u201cI thought I heard a high pitched scream coming from one of those two boulders. Must have been my imagination. Why don\u2019t we sit down?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male nodded his head and had a small smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey must be mates..\u201d you whispered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the lioness sit down upon the boulder next to yours and you gulp as you see the large male begin to sit on yours. You saw his gigantic ass and you could see his hot pink anus come upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you jump out of the way?</span></div></div>",

You certainly didn\u2019t want that so you quickly jumped but you had failed to think that his ass wasn\u2019t the only thing you had to worry about as you were soon squished by his hot and very musky sack and his large cock. The fur that covered his balls were covered in sweat and the sweat droplets fell upon your tiny form and made you smell of his musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou involuntary try to get up and you struggle against the sack for several minutes before you notice his large cock is now up and erect do to your struggling. Mufasa finally noticed the struggling and lifted up his sack and picked you up before you could run away. The male chuckled as he brought you up to his face. The blood drained from your face and you went pale as he sniffed at you. The female also looked at you with a curious expression before a smirk was shown upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill me please! I didn\u2019t mean to go under you! I wasn\u2019t able to get out of the way!\u201d You cried to the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male then smiled and told you..</span></div></div>",

I will not be harming you.\u201d He told you with a gentle smile that was meant to help calm you but as you looked at the large sharp teeth you felt a pit in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then brought you up to his nose as he held you with two of his long fingers. He sniffed at your tiny form. His nose almost seemed like it was about to suck you up like it was a vacuum. You knew he was sniffing up all of his musk from you being trapped under his sweaty sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large beast then put on a stern expression which scared you but he comforted you by laying your tiny body on his large palm and he patted your small head with the top of one of his fingers. You looked at his sharp claws and knew he could just impale you with them if he had ever wanted to.<br>\r\n\u201cNow. Tell me what brought you to my lands. I have never seen a creature like you come here.\u201d He asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped before answering. \u201cI have no idea, sir. I was at my home and I just woke up here. I didn\u2019t mean to intrude. I am very sorry and I\u2019ll leave.\u201d You shakily told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa then smiled. \u201cCall me Mufasa, little one. You are very welcome here and you do not have to worry about leaving. As I am the king of the lands, I shall make you my personal guest.\u201d He told you with a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to speak but the words would not come out. He then showed you to his mate. She warmly smiled and looked upon your tiny form. \u201cCall me Sarabi, little one.\u201d She told you before she laid her palm down under Mufasa\u2019s and motioned for you to climb down. You shakily did so and she let out a small chuckle. \u201cNow what is your name?\u201d She asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat before speaking. \u201cMy name is Edgar.\u201d You told her. At this he smiled and petted your tiny form. \u201cYou seem to be young, my little Edgar.\u201d She told you. You nodded your head. She looked at your tiny form. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that you will be our guest. As a Queen it is my duty to take care of our guest and make him welcome.\u201d She told you with a smile.<br>\r\nYou started to breathe fast before you looked up at her. Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t take this the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s alright. Please, there is no need for me to be your guest. I will try to find my way home. I do not wish to burden you.\u201d You told her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad..\u201d you muttered to yourself quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked upon you with a comforting expression. \u201cDo not worry. You will be no burden and you will be a wonderful guest.\u201d She told you with a smile. You couldn\u2019t tell if it was an order or a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi looked at her mate who was also wearing a comforting smile. \u201cWe will take very good care of you.\u201d He told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa then opened his satchel on his belt. \u201cWe need to get going since it is almost dinner time and Sarabi needs to lead the hunt.\u201d<br>\r\nSarabi smiled as she petted your head one last time. \u201cI will see you after the hunt and we can eat together.\u201d She told you before slipping you in the pouch. You gasped as you fell into it and you wanted to yell wait as Mufasa closed the satchel leaving you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began walking home. After awhile they both get pack to pride rock and Sarabi with her hunting party leave. Mufasa takes you out of the satchel making you gasp and laid you on his palm once more as he sat down on his stone throne. There was a zebra hide covering the seat and the back of the chair for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled upon you and sits you on his large muscled thigh. You can smell his musk from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looks upon you with his large smile.</span></div></div>",

Strands of saliva covered the insides of his maw as he opened it and you could feel the immense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then threw you into it and closed his maw surrounding you in darkness. The smell was horrible. It was a combination of morning breath, rotten meat and a little bit of blood. His tongue licked at your tiny naked body as you cried and pleaded once more. He chuckled as he licked you all over covering you in his smelly saliva. The King then swallowed his prey. You screamed as you were forced down the dark smelly throat. You were still alive and he could feel your squirming in his stomach. He smiled and patted his muscular stomach before turning back to his  mate and continued discussion while you were being digested.

Soon, your body began to notice the intense humidity that resonated in your body; it was fricken hot! However, that alone wasn't the strangest occurrence that you noticed while all of this was happening. You looked around your surroundings and immediately noticed that everything around you was massive compared to what you were used to. Tall blades of grass partially obstructed your view of the area and the fish you saw swimming in the water were almost the same size as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, there was no time to think as to the left of your position, three certain animals were hanging out and drinking water from the watering hole... and one of them just happened to spot you.
