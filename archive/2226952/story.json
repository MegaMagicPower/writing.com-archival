Male or Female.<br>\r\nThere will be a choice in the beginning for if you want feral or anthro.(anthros are tribal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFetishes that are very welcome: Scat, piss, All Vore, farts, paws, musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFetishes that are not welcome: balloons, slime, absorption and other fetishes like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would not prefer death but it is allowed but only after a long series of chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacros may be nice or mean. Pridelanders could be more maternal/paternal or loving if they decide to adopt your tiny form as a pet or cub while the hyenas or the outlanders could be more sexually devious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapters must he at least a paragraph. It keeps the story nice to read and interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
