An overseas transfer student from America, he is a natural Persona user who has known of his unique power for a fair chunk of his life....and used it as well(though not correctly). This got the attention of the Kirijo Group, who \u2018recruited\u2019 and brought him to Japan so his skills with a Persona could be put to use in taking down Tartarus. He doesn\u2019t mind that he has to go a Japanese school.{dropnote:\"Really, it\u2019s better then his previous school was....\"}Diego\u2019s Persona started to mainfest during the beginning of high school after a string of bullying incidents, one involving him, and it drove most people away from him for being a \u2018freak\u2018 when he had trouble controlling it. A big chunk of his airheadedness is faked, a holdover from being shunned.  He has a bad habit of getting lost in Tartarus.  <br>\r\nPersona: G\u00f6ndul. It looks like a slender, armoured  man with eagle wings for arms and talons for feet, one carrying a long sharp spike. A Combat-type Persona and that uses Garu(wind) and Pierce-type skills. Based off one of the Norse Valkyires. Brought out with the use of the Evoker, this is Diego\u2019s Persona fully unlocked. He\u2019s able to use it without an Evoker, but it can only use Garu and Single Shot.<br>\r\nClothing: Gekkoukan Uniform, white sneakers with mint green socks, those gloves Akihiko wears, wing necklace<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nHope this is aduequte.</span></div></div>",
