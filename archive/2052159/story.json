            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being a member of the White Base crew is a very stressful position. Every member of it's crew has done something to help cope with the stress, whether it be lashing out at others or staying locked up in their room, just to name a few. In Sayla and Fraw's cases, they took to binge eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRP! Oof, boy am I -UURRP- stuffed.\" Sayla groaned as she leaned back in her chair, resting a hand on her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I couldn't eat -UURRAP- another bite.\" Fraw moaned as she also leaned back in her chair, clutching her stuffed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla and Fraw had struck up a strong friendship, they bonded over the stress of the situation. At first they merely just ate together at lunch, but Fraw would soon regularly invite Sayla to her room for an extra round of comfort eating with food the brunette herself made, which Sayla often accepted. As they binged more and more, the size of their meals would increase appropriately, causing them both to gain a lot weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla had the bigger belly of the two. The orb of fat certainly lived up to the last name of it's owner. The sphere was contained with a reinforced belt and extra large uniform. Sayla's massive belly had snapped so many belts that she had to get one that was custom made just for her stomach. The belly would completely fill up her lap whenever she sat down, and would strain even her custom belt after a big meal. She had once had to pilot with her pilot suit completely unzipped, exposing her boobs and belly, due to an attack that happened right after after a big meal. The blonde's belly was always looking for any excuse to jiggle, bobbing and bouncing with every step she took. Sayla's massive belly was almost always in a state of constant jiggling and wobbling when she was piloting the Core Booster. Her bellybutton had grown much deeper, almost to he point that it now looked like a portal in the center of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla's boobs had seen some growth from her all binges as well. They were now quite a few inches bigger and fit perfectly in a bra they would've been too small to into back when Sayla was skinny. In fact, Sayla could probbaly break her old bras with her now much more ample chest if she wore them long enough. Just like her gut, Sayla's tits were very bouncy in combat, which, much to her embarrassment, could be seen on the screen that appeared during communications. Including the before-mentioned incident where she had to pilot while her pilot suit was unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde had an impressive ass, each cheek being a big sphere of soft, jiggly flab. The increased size meant plenty of bouncing, and her having to change underwear size. Because of her butt's new size, it would barely be squeezed into both the Core Booster's pilot seat, as well as the chair she used when was acting as a communications operator. Thankfully both eventually got resized, though not after plenty of discomfort and embarrassment. At least they were upgraded sooner then her old pilot suit, which she had actually ripped with her bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla's legs were pretty chunk and meaty, rubbing together whenever she walked and pooling together when she sits down, the latter of which contributed to how hard it was to fit into her chairs before they got resized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's face was very round, with soft pudgy cheeks that went along well with her double chin. A pie-like face was quite the contrast to her former angular visage but Sayla was still very beautiful, just in a chubby fashion now. The pilot's puffy cheeks and double chin didn't stop her from being taken seriously either, as she was still able to put the fear of God into Kai when he was being particularly obnoxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFraw's belly wasn't as massive as Sayla's but it was still pretty big. It was a large orb of incredibly malleable fat, making it pillowy in texture and give. In fact, it would make for a very nice pillow. Something Haro had found out. The brunette secretly wished Amuro would also find out. Haro would sometimes accidentally bump into the brunette's belly a few times, each time causing the fatty orb to jiggle like mad. Fraw always loved bumping bellies, she guessed it could called, with Haro.  Whenever Fraw poked her belly, her finger would sink in a bit before meeting resistance. Her fat would immediately go right back into place without a mark as soon as she removed her finger. Fraw's belly had a navel almost as cavernous as Sayla's, as well some deep love handles and side rolls one could fit some objects in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFraw had bigger boobs then Sayla. The orbs of fat were now now bigger, so much so they used the brunette's belly as a shelf to lay atop. The brunette's chest had destroyed a few of her old bras, back when she was in denial that she was gaining weight. Fraw's chest was even more bouncy then Sayla's, something that would be especially shown off whenever the White Base was hit. The jiggling of her breasts could often bring a blush to Fraw's face, especially if Amuro was there to see it. Not being a combat situation would keep her face from turning as red as a tomato in that case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's butt was now  bubble-esque, even bigger then Sayla's. It was an amalgam of two soft flabby cheeks easily the size of bowling balls. It jiggled with every step as a constant reminder to Fraw of how fat she had gotten. Fraw's ass had even ripped some of her old skirts and underwear. This bubblebutt was bigger then most chairs, it's flab would spill off the sides whenever she sat in any normally sized ones. And that wasn't even mentioning the chairs her fat ass would brake after particularity huge binges. The communications operator's chair was very hard for Fraw to squeeze into before it was modified into a much larger size, specifically with her butt in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commutations officer possessed some very chunky legs. So thick with fat they rubbed together and jostled with every footfall. Combined with her curvy hips, this helped to give her a very motherly figure, which was fitting given her tendency to nag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFraw's cheeks were pretty much puffed up, making her look like she was always holding her breath, and her chin was double-tiered. Fraw would cover her double chin with her scarf whenever something made her get embarrassed about it. Her face being so round and soft made Fraw look even cuter whenever she was mad about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla and Fraw's big bellies were even bigger now because of how bloated their binge made them. Both had their uniform tops unzipped and belts undone to make room for their guts. Fraw's belly completely covered her lap, while Sayla's gut jutted out a little farther then her lap. Both girls were tenderly rubbing their big bellies, moaning and burping in both pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time we do this I tell myself I'm going to eat less, -UUURRAP- and every time I end up eating -URAP- a little more then last time.\" Sayla said as she ruefully looked down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -UURRRRP- never thought I'd be able to eat -URP- so much ice -URRP- cream in one sitting.\" Fraw noted, looking at the table they used. \"We've gotta figure out some way to start losing weight, or else we'll need someone to roll us around.\" As much as she wnated to avoid that, Fraw couldn't help but fantasize a bit about Amuro being said person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming her fingers along her belly, giving another belch, Sayla proposed the obvious solution. \"Well, we could do some exercise.\" Another member of the White Base crew is gaining weight</span></div></div>",

Once she was fully integrated into the crew, she would do whatever she could to undermine them from within while still maintaining her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile faking a defection went along smoothly, the problem for Haman was that it went too smoothly. Chara soon took a liking to the more casual and relaxed way things were ran on the Argama these days. Sure she still had to pilot mobiles and fight, but she was enjoying her off-duty time a lot more now It didn't take long for her to completely forget she was supposed to be a spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLounging on a beanbag chair in Judau's room, Chara happily gobbled up yet another slice of pizza. She gave her bloated gut a slap and released a loud unladylike belch with pride. \"Man, Judau, you know where to get the best pizza!\" She said as she started digging into the next slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURP! Where I come from in Shangri-La always had the best pizza.\" Judau said as he rubbed his belly and ate more pizza, sitting in his own beanbag chair. \"Loved coming there with the others after school. When we actually went to school, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, bet that -UUURAP- wasn't often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Never claimed -UURRRP- it was.\" The brunette said with a (chubby) cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudau and Chara had grown much closer, as well as much fatter, since the latter's defection. The duo could often be found pigging out together in one either of their rooms, browsing the internet, gaming or watching TV. It was a lifestyle not out of place in a school dorm. It lead to them both fattening up to the point they each weighed in the early 200's, but they didn't really mind. If anything, they actually kinda liked being fat. Chara was belly-heavy, while Judau's weight had spread more evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara's stomach was a giant sphere of adipose, so large and heavy that the laws of gravity had caused it to hang down so much it completely obscured her crotch. Because of how big her gut was, the former Neo-Zeon pilot always kept her pilot unzipped, letting her big gut hang out. Chara's tummy would jiggle and bounce whenever it registered any bit of physical impact, especially when she was piloting her mobile suit. Her bellybutton had gotten much deeper, so cavernous it could fit a whole finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara always had a very impressive chest she was proud of, and getting fat had only made it even more impressive. Her breasts were even bigger orbs now and even more bouncy, which Chara was very pleased with. Easily capable of breaking the average bra, her perky tits sat atop her tummy. Chara's moments of shoving Judau's chubby face into her boobs, accidentally or otherwise, were more enjoyable for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a lot more junk in her trunk nowadays, so much junk her trunk was bubble-esque. Each cheek was big orb of jiggly fat, bouncing with every step she made. Her bubblebutt filled up any normal-sized chair she sat in, including the pilot chair of her mobiles suit, which was now a tight squeeze for her butt. Chara's ass went along well with her chunky legs. They jostled with very step and upper thighs rubbed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara's face wasn't hit that hard by her weight gain but it had still softened some. Her cheeks were softer and chubbier, and she had a double chin. These changes helped to make the AEUG pilot's face look a lot more cuddly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudau had a big, jiggly belly. It was an almost perfectly round sphere of fat. The orb had several layers of fat to it, making it very soft and malleable. Judau and Chara both loved felling and playing with for fun. Judau could sometimes be seen casually rubbing and messing around with his gut to pass the time when he lazily sitting down, which was often these days. He had neglected to get better fitting clothes tot keep up with is weight gain. Nowadays his gut was left completely exposed by his out-of-date shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam pilot's chest had grown into a pair of flabby man boobs. Judau's moobs were big enough to comfortably fill up a small bra. The sacks of soft adipose spilled over his belly like half full water balloons. The brunette's moobs were very jiggly, not as jiggly as actual breasts, but still quite bouncy. This was especially prevalent when he was piloting the ZZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudau's butt was huge, each cheeks had slowly grown into a pillowy orb that jiggled and jostled with every step the well-fed young man made. Fitting into the cockpit chair in the ZZ has become just like fitting into an old pair of pants for Judau. His legs had taken on a more round shape, near the thighs particularly. Like his ass, they were soft and malleable, and wobbled with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudau's face had taken on a cherubic appearance, more so then Chara's. His face was round and pie-like, with chubby cheeks that made him look like he was holding his breath. They folded and bounced whenever Judau let out a bellyful laugh, and went well with his double chin. The softer appearance his face had taken on suited Judau's goofy, friendly, and overall laid back personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two gluttonous members of the AEUG finished the massive load of pizza, they simply lazed about, rubbing their bellies and burping as they engaged in small talk. At one point, Judau let out a particularly loud burp, which impressed Chara. She belted out an even louder burp in attempt to outdo him, a competitive smirk on her face. Mirroring Chara's grin, Judau belched back, marking the start of another burping contest between them. Their burps were loud enough to be heard by anyone who was in the hallway. Something that greatly annoyed a certain other member of the AEUG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing this crap again?\" Roux barged in, her voice laced with frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You impressed? UUURRAP!\" Sporting a cheeky grin, Judau already knew perfectly what Roux's answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like disgusted.\" The purple-haired pilot then looked at all the empty pizza boxes and shook her head. \"You two are black holes, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing wrong with -UUUURRP- enjoying yourself.\" Chara said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is when it's making you balloon up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're overreacting.\" Judau said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep this up, and you'll be so fat you can fill up my bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget Roux's bras, UUUURRRP!\" Here Chara grabbed one of Judau's moobs. \"At this rate you'll be filling up my bras!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts are barely any smaller then yours.\" Roux protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara released her grip on Judau's moob and then placed her hands on breasts. \"Oh really? Then prove it! Let's bump chests!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, your gut would keep them from touching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got you there, Chara.\" Judau chimed in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's a stupid idea anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara's tummy gurgled. She belched loudly again as she happily rubbed her belly. Feeling how massive it had gotten, she thought back on how Haman was correct that \"if you keep eating like that, you'll be as big as a house\", the leader of Neo-Zeon had caught her pigging out again. Even back then, Chara had already grown a sizable potbelly, big enough that she now had to keep her belt and short shorts permanently undone. She figured that if Haman could see her, now, she'd probably chide her again and say she wouldn't have gotten fat if she stayed with Neo-Zeon because Haman would've been there to curb her gluttony. Maybe that was true, or maybe it wasn't. Chara didn't care. She wasn't just fatter as a maeber of the AEUG, she was fatter AND happier as a member of the AEUG.</span></div></div>",

Banagher went to school with his close friends Micott Bartsch and Takuya Irei. His class was going to take a field trip to the colony builder, the Snail, tomorrow. Today they were going to be given a tour at a museum after school. Banagher listened as he teacher gave a lesson on the wars. Banagher viewed war as something akin to fiction, as he was born after the One Year War ended, and did not experience the more isolated wars that followed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour, Banagher was leaving the technical school when he saw Audrey falling from the top of the colony. Banagher grabbed Haro and hijacked a Torohachi and caught her in midair. However, the Torohachi ran out of fuel and the two managed to safely crash-land near the Anaheim Electronics school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introducing themselves, Audrey asked Banagher for his help, saying that she needed to speak with someone at the colony builder in order to prevent a war. Banagher agreed to help her, he knew the place best and he heard rumors of their being a Vist Foundation mansion at the end of it, making him the only person that could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they could head there, they were both pretty hungry and stopped for hot dogs. As Banagher enjoyed his, he noticed that Audrey was looking at her hot dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't like hot dogs?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It's not that.\" Audrey said. \"I've just never eaten a hot dog before.\" She blushed a little as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been missing out.\" Banagher said as took another bite out of his hot dog, get a little bit of it on his mouth. \"Their really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey began eating hers as well. She was surprised by how good it tasted. She couldn't help but blush. Both hungry teens quickly finished their hot dog. They both burped and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to their surprise, they quickly heard both their stomachs growl for more. They both placed a hand on their hungry tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to get another?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" Audrey answered.</span></div></div>",

Banagher and Audrey had each eaten at least ten hot dogs each, and they had stomachs that were packed tight enough to prove it. Their abdomens were pressing against the hems of their pants/skirt, trying as much as possible to pop their buttons and be free. It didn\u2019t help that they each had also downed a liter of soda, leading them to start belching out belches as well as groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't think I could eat so much.\u201d Banagher said, before looking at Audrey\u2019s bulging stomach. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think you could, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave a blush, putting her hands up to her face as she looked away from the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, u-um, I \u2013UUURRRP-! Excuse me. I-I didn't mean to,\u201d she said, looking down at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s unbecoming for someone like me to just pig out \u2013URP- like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher only gave a friendly smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there's nothing wrong with relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey\u2019s blush only intensified, turning from light pink to scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Banagher,\u201d she said, letting out a bit of a sigh. \u201cBut really, these \u2013URP- belches are terribly \u2013UURRRP- gross!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Banagher noticed that this time, she was saying this with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Audrey, are you liking things here, so far?\u201d Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded, still cradling her stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this place is really nice. The air\u2019s clean, the people seem happy, and there\u2019s quite a bit of culture I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, where are you from?\u201d Banagher asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, far away from here,\u201d Audrey said off-handedly. \u201cI don't really get out that often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at her for a couple seconds. It was obvious she was hiding something, but just what, he couldn\u2019t tell. Then again, he felt it really wasn\u2019t his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you like, we could hang out later.\u201d he offered, putting on a big grin. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd like that. \u201d Audrey said, smiling. \"This is the first time I've ever \"hanged out\" with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m the first guy to get that honor,\u201d Banagher said proudly, before a small burp escaped his lips. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think my waistline\u2019ll be thanking me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes everyone you hang out with get this bloated, Banagher?\u201d Audrey asked, giving her own gut a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I gotta say, this is a first for me. So it looks like we\u2019re both experiencing something new!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm, we certainly are.\u201d Audrey looked around, wondering something. \u201cSo, besides eating, what else do you do with your friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, we play video games, watch movies, loiter around different areas, do homework together, you know, normal stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Audrey hadn\u2019t been able to actually do much \u201cnormal\u201d stuff throughout her life, due to her status as princess, and she felt the tiniest twinge of envy at Banagher\u2019s description. However, she quickly put it down. There was no reason to be envious: after all, she was hanging out with Banagher right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s about time we go,\u201d Audrey said, attempting to get up, but finding things a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was gurgling quite profusely, obviously not enjoying the sudden motion. All the food she had eaten before was weighing the princess down, keeping her from actually getting enough momentum to get off the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong, Audrey?\u201d Banagher asked. \u201cAre you having a hard time getting up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, of course not!\u201d Audrey said, getting red in the face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, just a\u2026 a little bit of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher, for his part, required a bit of build-up before launching himself off the bench, landing on his feet a good foot away with an \u201coof\u201d. Turningf around, and looking a bit red in the face to boot, he held out his hand with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, red in the face, at first just looked down in thought. Then, after a few seconds, she looked back up and nodded firmly. Extending her hand, she took his in her grasp and was lifted up (with a bit of grunting from both parties), with both giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a hurdle out of the way,\u201d Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, an interesting way to end that little conversation,\u201d Audrey added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all the good cheer in the world couldn\u2019t help with how laborious the task of walking was proving to be. Both teens were huffing and puffing, feeling the weights of all the food they had ingested sloshing around in their packed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Audrey, maybe we *huff* should *huff* find a place to sit,\u201d Banagher said, giving his belly a few rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I *huff* think that sounds pretty *huff* good right about now,\u201d Audrey agreed, and began scoping out the area for a nice place to stop and catch their breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long, as there was a perfectly vacant bench practically inviting their bloated forms to come over. Audrey and Banagher quickly walked over as fast as their gurgling middles would allow, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, to both of their embarrassment, the moment they planted their asses on the bench, the button on Banagher\u2019s pants and the button on Audrey\u2019s skirt popped off. For a moment, there was just silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Banagher said, fidgeting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That happened,\u201d Audrey contributed, looking down at her stomach in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward moment of silence as both looked at their open clothes, wondering just how to talk about it tactfully. After a few seconds, Banagher cleared his throat, a bashful expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, yeah, we might wanna cut back a bit, huh?\u201d he said, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d Audrey said, shuffling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, I knew we ate a lot, but not that much\u2026\u201d Banagher said, poking his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019ll suffer any further wardrobe malfunctions, do you?\u201d Audrey asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, both their zippers started to get undone, causing their faces to turn even redder. Attempting to bend over and look at the damage, Banagher saw his belt pop right off, no longer beign able to take the massive amount of strain his belly was placing on it. It flew a few feet away and clattered on the ground before all was silent once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That would be a no\u2026\u201d Banagher said, giving a little cough into his hand. \u201cA-anyways, at least it shows the food around here is really good, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally good is an understatement, I\u2019d say,\u201d Audrey said, attempting to cool herself down. \u201cWe obviously need to keep our appetites in check, or else they\u2019ll be rolling us around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Audrey felt a pressure build up in her chest, along with a gurgle from her stomach. Alarmed, she looked over to Banagher, and could tell that a similar thing was happening to him. In her experiences, she knew what this meant, but she had never felt so much gas at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey wasn\u2019t overly-formal, but she did have certain manners. She\u2019d been raised since birth to follow certain rules. One such tenant of her upbringing was that belches should be kept to a minimum, and shouldn\u2019t be very audible at all. However, the strawberry blonde had a feeling that rule was about to be violated right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as predicted, both Banagher and Audrey let out a simultaneous belch, which was massive enough to cause them both to blush. For several moments, both didn\u2019t know what to say or do. After all, one was a princess who was raised to be as polite as possible, and the other just belched during his first meeting with a new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" They said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after just a little bit, Banagher started to chuckle. Audrey could still see the red in his face, but he was still laughing up a storm, to the point where the red could be considered a sign of his getting tired out. He was laughing so much, that even the strawberry blonde started to laugh, and they both were sitting on that bench, laughing, for a good couple minutes before finally calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us!\" Audrey said, still laughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Excuse us? You were the louder one of the two of us,\u201d Banagher said in a playful manner. \u201cI think you\u2019re the only one who needs to be excused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, get out,\u201d Audrey said, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent, Banagher looked up at the sky, noticing just how beautiful the cerulean colors truly were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised all this is happening. We definitely ate more than enough, which is a little embarrassing for me, to be honest,\u201d the brunette commented, holding back another gaseous eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Audrey said, with a hint of a smirk. \"You\u2019re not the only one.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough what, Banagher?\u201d Audrey asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it does require quite a bit of belching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey groaned, not looking forward to this in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, well, time to do this, I suppose,\u201d she said, resigned to her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next few minutes, Banagher and Audrey rubbed their stomachs, coaxing out several large belches. They were making quite the scene, attracting several stares from passerby. But it was working, the pains were starting to leave their systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoo,\u201d Audrey said after a while. \u201cThat felt \u2013UUUURRRP- That felt good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I \u2013UUURRRP- know,\u201d Banagher said, a content smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they sat in silence for a bit, both staring up at the sky and trying to pick out cloud formations. Then, Audrey broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your pet.\" Audrey said, referring to Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Audrey.\" Haro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Haro.\" Banagher started, holding Haro up to Audrey. \"It's a replica of the robot mascot built by an ace pilot back during the war. It was the coolest thing ever when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey noticed that Banagher was as enthusiastic as a little kid wanting to show his new toy, she got the impression that he had wanted to talk about Haro to someone for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you know much about this ace pilot?\u201d Audrey asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, he was the hero of the Earth Federation! He fought with Char Aznable himself,\u201d Banagher said, looking back up at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of insane to think that stuff like that actually happened, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded her head, looking up at the clouds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and despite how distant it seems, their conflict created the world we live in now. That war wiped out most of humanity\u2026\u201d she opined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Banagher said, but then decided to change the subject. \u201cSo anyways, Haro here has a ton of cool features. His AI is really advanced, able to take thousands of inputs and come up with his own personalized responses. He has awesome mobility, and other, more expensive types actually help out Mobile Suit pilots during their flights when it comes to navigation and combat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that does seem very neat. We don\u2019t have any of those where I come from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Huh, well I\u2019m sorry to hear that. But hey, maybe they just haven\u2019t taken off yet? Maybe in a few more years you\u2019ll see everyone with these little guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey chuckled at Banagher\u2019s innocent enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had fun.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did too.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These past several hours have certainly been some of the most interesting ones in my entire life,\" Audrey mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear that!\u201d Banagher said with one of his big smiles. \u201cGlad this didn\u2019t turn into a bore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled into the palm of her hand, quite amused by Banagher\u2019s relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019d be impossible to spend time with you and not get some form of enjoyment out of it,\u201d she said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well next time we meet, I should introduce you to another friend of mine, Micott. She\u2019s really nice, I think you two would get along perfectly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very nice to know, Banagher. I\u2019m sure any friend of yours would be a fantastic person for me to know. Thank you for the offer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten seconds of silence, Banagher decided to speak up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta say, though, it looks like you\u2019ve got a lot more secrets than you\u2019ve been letting on,\u201d Banagher said sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey panicked for a moment at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? W-what do you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you can really pack it away! Maybe you and I should enter an eating contest at some point!\u201d Banagher said, giving a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Audrey gave a sigh before grinning and giving him a (very light) punch on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and ruin even more of my clothes? What a fantastic offer, I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was punctuated with even more laughter from the bloated teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Audrey, what do you think of hot dogs?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their delicious.\" Audrey said. \"I think their my favorite.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Banagher yawned and stretched before letting his hands fall. He felt something hard yet also soft in his left hand. It felt pretty nice. It seemed really familiar to him but he wasn't sure what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... B-Banagher?\" Audrey nervously said, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Banagher said as he looked at Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher saw that his hand was actually on Audrey's full tummy. Needless to say, Banagher immediately started blushing just as heavily as Audrey. Surprisingly, it didn\u2019t feel that bad for either of them. In fact, it actually feel very nice. But even if the physical sensation was pleasant, the emotional side was another story entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your hand is on my b-belly.\" Audrey uttered as they both silently stared at each other for a few awkward seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! Sorry! I-I-I didn't mean to.\" Banagher apologized as he pulled his hand away from his friend's overfed belly. \"I'm really sorry, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, you don't need to apologize.\" Audrey assured as she rested her hands on her tummy. \"It didn't feel bad at all, and besides, I know you didn't mean to. In fact, it actually felt kinda nice. I liked it.\" Audrey's jade green eyes widened as soon as she finished speaking. She said way too much, and she was too unfortunate to catch herself right before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" Banagher asked, his own eyes widening even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at the ground in embarrassment. Eventually, the blonde gained enough courage to look Banagher in his eyes as she gave her answer. \"I... I liked feeling your hand on my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, that's not weird,\" Banagher said, scratching the back of his head nervously as he blushed scarlet. \"I actually... really liked the feeling, too. I mean, it was really soft, and um, warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher? Can you rub my belly?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at Audrey's belly. He wasn't sure why but he thought she looked cute bloated. Of course, his new friend always looked just as cute. Maybe it was because it was the result of them hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. No problem\" Banagher said as he placed his hands on Audrey's belly. They were both blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can-You can start now.\" Audrey said after a few awkward seconds of silence, sounding nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I know.\" Banagher said, fighting back a gulp. \"I've just... never really done this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher began rubbing Audrey's belly, causing her to moan in pleasure as she felt Banagher's hands move around her belly, as all her discomforts began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple minutes were spent with Banagher giving Audrey several belly rubs, coaxing mighty belches out of the blonde. After a particularly loud one, Audrey stuttered a bit as her face went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-excuse me,\u201d she mumbled, looking down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher just chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re excused,\u201d he said, resuming the rubbing once more with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave him a light smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Audrey felt quite an overpowering sensation overcome her after witnessing Banagher\u2019s earnestness. Tentatively, she began sticking her own hands out to come into contact with the brunette\u2019s gut, earning a surprised gasp from her friend. However, that didn\u2019t deter her, and instead she began to slowly rub his sizable gut with her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAu-Audrey, that\u2019s-\u201c Banagher said, before a small moan made its way out of his mouth. \u201cThat feels\u2026 really nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Audrey said, a small smirk appearing on her visage as she picked up the pace of her rubs. \u201cI\u2019m g-glad you think so, Banagher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for a while, the blonde and brunette rubbing each other\u2019s stomachs simultaneously. It was only a matter of time before the belches started flying out of Banagher\u2019s mouth as well, causing him to try and excuse himself at times. Audrey only laughed and put a finger up to his lips to keep him quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it was okay with me, right? Why wouldn\u2019t it be for you?\u201d she pointed, out giggling into one of her hands as she watched Banagher\u2019s sheepish expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, good point,\u201d Banagher said, getting back to the rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey continued to happily chat and burp as they rubbed each other's bellies. They were both having an absolute blast, and it was honestly the one of the most exhilarating experiences of both their lives. There was just something so... liberating about the activity that honestly made both teens want more. However, Audrey realized she still didn't know that much about Banagher, so she decided to ask a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, B -URP- Banagher, what's your favorite video game?\" Audrey asked. The blonde barely even knew what a video game was but after talking with Banagher about them she couldn't wait for Banagher to show her his collection. She was even going to try them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Dangan -UUURRRP- Ronpa. Well, that's my favorite series. Have you heard of it?\" Banagher asked, excited to geek out with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have. Tell me about it.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bloated close friends proceeded to geek out about the game series. As soon as Banagher told her what it was about, whilst letting out some burps, Audrey was immediately interested. The characters in particular were something they both loved talking about. Audrey hadn't even seen Dangan Ronpa but she couldn't wait for Banagher to show it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely going to have to show \u2013UUURRP- me this when we're done here, Banagher.\" Audrey said, a dorky smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll be the first game I show you.\" Banagher was very happy to see that Audrey was much of a geek as he was. The only girl he knew that played video games was Micott. Playing video games with Audrey would be a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey loved rubbing the other's belly and the rubs they received as well. They actually found the other's stuffed belly cute but neither would ever admit it. As they talked, Audrey lifted up Banagher's swollen tummy a little and then let it drop, causing it to jiggle and wobble. The sight caused both their faces to go red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I didn't know I was that fat.\" Banagher said, a dorky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette then did the same to Audrey, causing them both to giggle. Their bellies were quite nice things to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while more of rubbing, patting, kneading, and jiggling each other's bellies along with belching, chatting, geeking out, and being adorable dorks, Banagher and Audrey both felt a pressure build up in their chests as well gurgles from their stomachs. The two overfed teens looked at each other but unlike before, they were both smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey both belted out a massive belch at the same time. They immediately started laughing, their faces blushing bright red. Of course, they were still embarrassed but they were having way too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha ha, I'm getting pretty good at this, huh?\" Audrey asked, covering her mouth in a mock gesture of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher concurred, chuckling. \"Although you have a long way to go if you wanna match up to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, no way! I'm definitely way past you in skill!\" Audrey said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not likely, but okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, their friendship was blossoming in a way neither thought possible. Both the blonde and brunette had never even dreamed of ever being in this situation, yet they had found themselves belching and eating galore, and having a blast doing it. Both teens wanted this moment to last forever, just to lounge around, have fun, and not have a care in the world.</span></div></div>",

While she had simply enjoyed one hotdog and a soda, Banagher had eaten over a dozen hotdogs and downed liter of soda. The brunette's big belly was pressing against the waistband of his pants, almost to the point of busting his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think I could eat so much.\" Banagher noted as he looked down at his bloated gut. He really wasn't sure why he ate so much in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you learn something new every day.\" Banagher said. \"I'm probably going to gain a lot weight from this, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! You won't gain a pound.\" Audrey said. \"You didn't eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Audrey, I'm not getting fooled,\" sighed Banagher, giving his belly a rub. \"I've really overdone it this time. I mean, I've never eaten that much in my life... ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all have those days where our appetite gets the better of us. I'm sure it won't become a habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think s-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as he finished saying that, a large SNAP! caught their attention. Banagher's belly had managed to snap his belt in half, causing his tummy to pour further outwards and his hoodie to rise above his bellybutton. Banagher and Audrey blushed heavily at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh. I didn't know I ate so much.\" Banagher nervously said as he rubbed his stuffed tummy. \"I mean, I knew I ate a lot, but, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a friendly giggle, Banagher was being too funny. \"Well, hotdogs are pretty good\" The blonde had a friendly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, they are pretty tasty.\" Banagher said, a dorky smile on his face. \"We should hang out later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\" Audrey said, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be \u2013UUUURRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he was interrupted by his own giant belch. Banagher immediately slapped a hand over his mouth, blushing heavily. While he wasn't huge on manners, he still didn't want to burp right in front of Audrey. Audrey had a look of surprise on her face. She didn't expect Banagher to just suddenly belt out a huge burp like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me. Sorry about that, A-Audrey.\" Banagher apologized. The bloated brunette then looked down at his stomach in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright, Banagher.\" Audrey assured him. \"I can't blame you for belching after eating so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Audrey assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a sigh of relief. \"Thanks, Aud\u2013UUURRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before, Banagher immediately slapped a hand over his mouth. A few seconds of silence passed before Audrey started giggling, Banagher quickly started giggling himself. It didn't take long for their giggling to become full-on laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent a little more time happily chatting before deciding to continue their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you ready to go?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but can you still walk?\" Audrey asked. She was having trouble imagining Banagher walking while being that bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I mean, I am pretty full but that's not going to stop me.\" Banagher assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, getting up was quite difficult. All the food that was within his overfed middle was weighing Banagher down, keeping him from getting enough momentum to get off the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some help?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Thanks\" Banagher said with a goofy grin on his face, he was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grunted, trying to help Audrey as best he could in his bloated state. After a couple seconds, he slowly began to rise. Unfortunately, the deep gasps of air he was taking resulted in something unexpected happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distinct straining sound, drawing in the attentions of both Banagher and Audrey. It sounded like fabric creaking, trying valiantly to hold something back, but failing spectacularly at doing so. After a couple seconds though, the answer was plain as day, accompanied by a *ping*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple seconds of blinking, both pairs of eyes were directed straight down to the ample amount of belly fat that was oozing out of the opening created by the recently-parted pants flaps. The concentrated amount of creamy flab was forcefully pushing the zipper down, although thankfully not so far that too much of Banagher\u2019s underwear was on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the brunette pulled down began frantically trying to pull his somewhat ill-fitting shirt down over his even more exposed navel, a tint of red appearing on his cheeks (that had nothing to do with exhaustion) as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably should've seen that coming, heh heh.\" Banagher noted, grinning sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll admit, it doesn\u2019t exactly seem like the chances of that happening were like winning the lottery, or anything,\" Audrey said with a giggle. \"At least in hindsight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, is that supposed to mean anything special?\" Banagher asked with a wink, forcing his blush down. \"I didn\u2019t know I was hanging out with a psychic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019ve been practicing ESP my whole life,\" Audrey teased, placing her hands on her hips. \"If I hadn\u2019t left my tarot cards at home, I bet I could easily predict that that big belly of yours is definitely going to be gurgling a ton while we walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to compliment her comment, the brunette\u2019s stomach did indeed let out a low grumble. It caused both teens to look at it once more, the blonde blushing as she realized a bit of her friend\u2019s underwear was exposed by the forced-open flap that was sans button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh he heh,\u201d Banagher said, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. \"You could probably make a career out of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that things were getting a tad awkward, Audrey wistfully looked out at the path again before dawning a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose we should get going, huh?\" she said easily. \"I've heard it isn't good to just let things sit in a stuffed belly for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher nodded, and proceeded to follow after the blonde as they began to make their way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Banagher found that walking with a big, bloated belly was difficult. The brunette rubbed his aching middle and burped as he continued walking, groaning all the while. His gut jiggling and bouncing with every step. Despite how uncomfortable he was, Banagher kept walking, he wasn't going to slow Audrey down over a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Audrey knew that preventing a war from breaking out was far more important then Banagher's stomach, it was hard for her to not help her overfed friend rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... you sure you can walk?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't \u2013UURRP- worry.\" Banagher said. \"We *huff* can't risk a war breaking out *huff* just because I have \u2013UUURRRP- a stomachache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a sigh, this wasn't an easy choice. \"I know. But we can take a break.\" Audrey then threw Banagher's arm over her shoulder. \"Let's find you a nice place to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Audrey. I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. This is the least I can do after you saved my life.\"</span></div></div>",

A burp soon escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher rubbed his belly as he and Audrey chatted, occasionally letting out a burp. While Banagher was still enjoying hanging out with Audrey, his stomach still hurt a lot. Sitting down, rubbing his tummy, and burping did help him feel a little better, it wasn't enough help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, does your stomach really hurt, Banagher?\" the blonde asked, ruffling a bit of her hair. \"Because, if it does, I think I have a solution\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis peaked Banagher\u2019s interest. He looked up, raising an inquisitive eyebrow at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey made her way over to his side, somewhat closer than she had ever gotten before. Then, she hesitantly rose her hand, placing it on Banagher's gut, and looked down at the ground as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s\u2026 um, I\u2019ve heard belly rubs are really nice for upset stomachs\u2026 I think it helps to bring the gas out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face flushed red as she described it, and was waiting for Banagher's response. Seeing her like this, Banagher couldn't help but sigh as he cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it? Well, seems like a good idea to me. You're pretty considerate, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop it,\" Audrey said, looking around frantically in what seemed like a desperate attempt to calm her nerves. \"You'd do the same for me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" Banagher said, twiddling his thumbs a bit as he looked down, before suddenly looking up with a big grin. \"I mean, compared to saving you from falling thousands of feet down to the ground? This would be easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Audrey said, her own mind flashing back to the event where they first met. \"That was... something else, wasn't it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few awkward seconds passed without any of them saying anything. Audrey didn\u2019t exactly know how to tackle that idea exactly; she definitely was extremely grateful towards Banagher for doing that, but the idea of tackling those emotions and putting them into words was an incredibly daunting prospect for her. Which was why she was incredibly grateful when Banagher shifted the conversation over to more mundane matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, start whenever you're ready.\" Banagher nervously said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right! Sorry, this is my first time doing something like this.\" Audrey said, just as nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize.\" Banagher responded, a comforting smile on his face. \"You can start whenever you feel up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded. After a few more seconds passed, Audrey began gently rubbing Banagher's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That feels really good, Audrey.\" Banagher moaned, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it does, B-Banagher.\" Audrey said, a warm smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few minutes, one teen leaning his head back and relaxing, letting his bloated gut surge out, while the other continued to move her hand in gentle circles on top. It was bliss for Banagher, truthfully, although he wouldn\u2019t dare admit it that strongly. Although, the occasional belch with a small moan of satisfaction that escaped his lips every once in a while was definitely a good indicator that he was enjoying it immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey herself was also enjoying it: the sensation of bringing her hands over Banagher\u2019s smooth, warm skin made her get slight goosebumps. This was the first time she ever had purposeful, physical contact with any sort of boy her own age. The experience was alien, yet incredibly refreshing for the sheltered princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re doing this \u2013URP- for me, what with us having just met a while ago and all.\" Banagher said, looking over at Audrey with a grateful, yet somewhat confused expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I don\u2019t need reasons to help someone, right?\u201d Audrey said, in a slightly flustered tone. \u201cYou\u2019re in discomfort, so I decided to \u2018give you a hand\u2019, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course! I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you don\u2019t like helping people, or anything. It\u2019s just \u2013URRAAP- just that, this is a little\u2026um\u2026physical, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Hmm, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s certainly a new experience for me, but I hope it\u2019s not making you too uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\u201d Banagher said confidently, giving his belly a slight pat. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little \u2013URP- new for me, too. Then again, I can't exactly imagine you needing me to do this,\" the brunette said in a goofy manner, giving his belly a lazy rub. \"After -URP- all, I don't think you'd ever be the type of person to pig out like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was surprised by the sudden break in conversation, but when the words sunk in, she donned her own happy face as she began to giggle profusely. So much so, in fact, it wasn't until half a minute had passed that she could form a proper response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly know how to shift the mood, Banagher. You're kind of weird, honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Banagher looked at her a little nervously, wondering if she suddenly thought he was weird in any way. Only to be answered by a light tap on his nose before Audrey leaned back a bit, pulling her pointer finger with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, it's probably one of your most charming points,\" she added, a small smile adorning her lips. \"After all, weird doesn't always mean 'bad'. After all, do you know what the original Old English term that it's derived from, 'wryd', means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher shook his head, genuinely at a loss (but simultaneously feeling a huge rush of heat enter his cheeks).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means 'destiny',\" the blonde said jovially.</span></div></div>",

That's what Audrey Burne has wanted to be her entire life. Born into the leading family of the destroyed Principality of Zeon as Mineva Lao Zabi, she had never known what it was like to be normal. Though she had grown up in a world without the principality of Zeon, she still wasn't free from her family. As the sole surviving heir of the Zabi family, she had been a powerful symbol for those that wanted to revive Zeon, despite her openly protesting against the idea. Still, she had no one to turn to other then Neo-Zeon, so she stayed with them. She had accepted that she would ultimately never be able to live a normal life but when she met her best friend, Banagher Links, she soon realized that was not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they had ended the Laplace Conflict and Zeon together, she finally had the normal life she had desired her whole life. She had long discarded the name of Mineva Lao Zabi, the princess of Zeon. She was Audrey Burne, Banagher's somewhat socially awkward close friend. Standing with Banagher outside of the Gundam pilot's school dorm, where they both now lived, she was now going to enjoy her first day as an ordinary girl. Though there was one problem, she didn't actually know what normal people do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll help you through this.\" Banagher assured with a dorky grin. \"Ask me whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave a small smile. \"Thanks. So what do you think we should do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" Banagher began thinking of all the things he usually did with his friends, Micott and Takuya. \"We could play some video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face lit up at the suggestion. \"That would be wonderful! I've never played one before, I would love to try them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a huge collection, we'll be playing games until tomorrow morning!\" Banagher said, thoroughly excited to geek out with his blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see it! Though maybe we should do some other things first.\" The geeky blonde suggested. \"We'll probably spend so much time playing video games we won't have time to do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Banagher said as he began thinking of other things they could do. \"We could watch TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TV! TV!\" Haro, who Banagher was holding, excitedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice but I already watch a lot of TV so is it alright if we save that for later?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem. Now, what else could we do...\" Banagher almost immediately came up with the perfect idea. \"I've got an idea. How about we try out all the different food this place has to offer? I already know you love hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! Though I'm a bit worried about our waistlines.\" Audrey looked down at her flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Banagher assured his friend with a grin on his face. \"Let's just focus on enjoying ourselves. We've earned it, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Banagher.\" Audrey said with a small smile of her own. \"Besides, if we gain any weight, we can just work it off. Where should we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a great ice cream parlor. The stuff there is amazing.\"</span></div></div>",

Audrey was having chocolate ice cream while her brown-haired friend was eating vanilla ice cream. It wasn't too hot outside right now but ice cream was always delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame they couldn't come.\" Audrey stated in a disappointed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I really wish they didn't stay on the Nahel Argama.\" Banagher, disappointment obvious in his voice. While Banagher and Audrey returned to Industrial 7 as soon as the fighting ended, Takuya and Micott choose to stay aboard the Nahel Argama to help with it's repairs. It would only take two to three days for the ship to be fully repaired Banagher really wanted them to come back home with him. And Audrey wanted to get to know them better. Marida had also stayed behind, along with the rest of the Garencieres' crew. The Nahel Argama lost quite a few members of it's mobile suit team during the final battle, so Marida and the rest of the crew of the Garencieres stayed with the ship to fill in for them in case of an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Banagher's mood had a taken a turn for the worse, Audrey said something to perk him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Haro's here.\" Said mechanical ball was currently siting in Banagher's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! That's right!\" Haro excitedly said as he bounced in Banagher's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm glad he is.\" Banagher said with a smile, giving Haro a few affectionate pats. He was right back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" Audrey then took another bite out of her ice cream bowl. \"You know, if Marida was here, she'd probably eat this place's entire stock of ice cream!\" The blonde said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she'd still be hungry for more!\" The two close friends then started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta say, I did not expect her to have such a sweet tooth.\" Banagher said as their laughter started to die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the two teens long to finish their bowls. And after that, they ate two more bowls each. They leaned back in their seats after finishing their last bowl, pleased smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that was delicious.\" Audrey said as she gave her stomach a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it!\" Banagher said as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where should we go next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a place that has some pretty good burgers, you want to give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I've actually never eaten a hamburger before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Audrey and Banagher stuffed themselves with lots of different food and drinks as they went from place to place. Pizza, cookies, brownies, hamburgers, soda, smoothies, pretzels, and more all went into their stomachs. As they stuffed themselves more and more, their bellies grew bigger and bigger.  By the time there was only one place left for them to visit, their guts has become just as round as Haro and even bigger. Their tummies were straining against the waistbands of their pants, desperately trying to pop the buttons off them. They were straining against Audrey's coat and Banagher's belt just as much. It didn't help that all the drinks the two close friends had drank was causing them belt out some belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Banagher, \u2013UUURRP-! Excuse me.\" Audrey said, cradling her swollen belly. \"I think we might've overdone it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've never been so stuffed. UUURRAP!\" Banagher moaned as he rubbed his bloated belly. \"At least we've only got one stop left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile appeared on Banagher's face. \"It's the hot dog place we ate at when we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey started smiling herself. \"I always did want to hang out with you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how you didn't want to eat while walking but as soon as you took a bite you had the biggest smile on your face?\" Banagher chuckled as he and Audrey reminisced on the first time they ever hanged out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, yeah. I was such a dork back then. I still am, really.\" Audrey chuckled as well. \"Did I ever tell you I came up with my name from a movie poster I saw while we were eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Guess you learn something new everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled over to the hot dog stand as fast as their packed middles would allow, Banagher held Haro by his right side. They ordered three hot dogs each, as well as some soda. They sat down on a nearby bench and began chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, they're just as good as they were the first time.\" Audrey said as she took her first bite, her face lighting up in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they taste just right,\" Banagher nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how full their bellies were, Audrey and Banagher had no problem eating their hot dogs. They just simply tasted that good, so good it was like the pain in their stomachs completely disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was good!\" Banagher sighed, leaning back. \"I can't believe we ate all of that, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was strange,\" Audrey said with a hint of worry in her voice. \"I don't know what came over m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Banagher's gut snapped his belt in half and Audrey's belly popped off her coat's buttons. Blushes immediately appeared on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh,\" Banagher awkwardly said, trying to figure out what he should say. \"That happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It certainly did.\" Audrey said as she looked down at her round stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the button on Banagher's pants popped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the...?!\" Banagher cried out in surprise, seeing the valiant button ping across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gasped in shock as well, but that proved to be a fatal error, for her own pants button was only just strenuously kept on, and this one breath was the final straw. It too was flung by sheer force of her bloated stomach to the other side of the pathway, leaving more of her skin exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too?!\" Audrey couldn't believe it. \"D-did I really eat so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on their pants then popped off at the same time and the resulting belly fat that came pouring through the now open flaps forced their zippers down all the way, exposing a bit of their underwear. Both their faces turned scarlet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few awkward seconds of silence passed as they looked down at their huge bellies and open clothes, not really sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great meal though, right?\" Banagher said, forcing out a chuckle. \"I haven't had great food like that in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, m-me neither. It was, ah, very good.\" Audrey said, still a bit shocked by what had happened. She looked down at her dome of a stomach. \"We certainly helped ourselves to a lot of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can say our guts are proof that we had a good time.\" Banagher said with a dorky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled. \"That's a good way of looking at it. It was actually kinda fun eating so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, you can really pack it away! Maybe you and I should enter an eating contest at some point!\" Banagher said, giving a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave a chuckle before grinning and giving him a (very light) punch on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and ruin even more of my clothes? What a fantastic offer, I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was punctuated with even more laughter from the bloated teens. They both then just leaned back in their seats, letting out pleased sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've gone without the wardrobe malfunctions but today was really fun.\" Audrey said, smiling warmly. \"I think I would even call it awesome. I am using the word awesome correctly, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a friendly chuckle. \"Yeah, I would call today awesome too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated teens spent some time looking up at the sky and trying to pick out cloud formations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man...\" Banagher said as he placed a hand on his middle and began rubbing methodically to help ease the stuffed feeling from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at his belly, along with his circulating hand, then at the brunette's face with a quizzical look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, why are you doing that out in public? Isn't that a bit rude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was snapped out of his internal bliss at Audrey's words. He looked to her for a moment before offering a warm grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maaaaybe. But, when you got a belly as stuffed as this-\" here he gave a slap to his stomach for emphasis- \"it's okay to bend social norms a bit, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked away, blushing. Then, she slowly raised a hand to her own belly and began rubbing as well. She exhaled a bit in contentment as it really did help to soothe the digestion within a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, doesn't that make you feel better?\" Banagher said as he focused back on himself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It really does.\" Audrey said with a pleased smile. \"UUURRP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRRP!\" Banagher belched back with a grin.</span></div></div>",

After standing up, which was easier said then done, they leaned on each other for support, their big bellies touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, our stomachs are touching, A-Audrey.\" Banagher said, blushing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So they are.\" Audrey stuttered, her face just as red as Banagher's, which is to say very red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you uh, w-want them to not t-touch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, it doesn't f-feel uncomfortable. URRAAP! Excuse me.  In fact, i-it actually feels kinda n-nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,  It does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them could really explain it but for some reason, feeling their big bellies rub together actually felt nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love! Love!\" Haro said, causing Banagher's and Audrey's faces to turn even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overfed duo began waddling back to their dorm, their guts jiggling and bouncing with every footfall. Occasionally, Audrey or Banagher would let out a loud burp, much to their embarrassment. Fortunately, it wouldn't take them long to reach the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this keeps up we'll need someone to roll us around by the end of the week.\" Audrey joked, rubbing her stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like me.\" Haro said as he bounced alongside them. Banagher wanted to keep holding the little guy but he really needed a free hand to give his aching stomach a belly rub. Haro didn't mind, he didn't want Banagher to feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I need someone to roll me right now.\" Banagher said, giving his tummy a few rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then finally reached their dorm. As as they entered, they waddled over to the couch as fast as their bloated forms would allow and planted their asses down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, even though we're so bloated, today was amazing.\" Audrey said with a smile, giving her gut a much needed rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, it was.\" Banagher concurred, smiling himself as he gave his own giant gut a massage. \"You ready to \u2013UUURRRP- play some video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, which one should we \u2013UUURRRAAP-!\" Audrey immediately slapped both her hands over her mouth, giving a blush. She couldn't believe that she had just belt out a huge burp like that. Of course, she had burped quite a lot today (which she wasn't a huge fan of either) but she hadn't burped THAT loudly before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-E-Excuse me. I'm really s-sorry, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she was cut off by a huge belch, courtesy of Banagher. She looked at her friend's grinning face, surprised. She wasn't expecting Banagher to belt out a burp like that. It didn't seem like he had done so accidentally and it was clear from the blush on his face that he was embarrassed. SO why did he intentionally embarrass himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, excuse me.\" The Gundam pilot said, a goofy smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey just stared at him, lost for words. There wasn't really much she knew to say at that point, so she decided to wait for Banagher to contribute his own story. After scratching his head a bit, her friend obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you just seemed to be feeling down there, so...I kinda wanted to make you feel a bit better?\" Banagher almost asked the last part. \"...Did I do it wrong? I'm new to all this, so you can have away at me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey realized that Banagher had intentionally burped to help her feel less embarrassed by sharing her problem with her. And it worked perfectly. Audrey couldn't help but smile, Banagher was always good at cheering people up. He was such a sweet (and cute) guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you did it perfectly.\" Audrey proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with just one belch you managed to \u2013UUUURRRP-! Sorry about that!\" Audrey's blush returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, today's all about having fun.\" Banagher said in a friendly tone, chuckling a bit. \"So you should let loose and burp as much as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey thought about what her overfed friend said for a few seconds and then belted out an even a larger burp without excusing herself, her blush intensifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" Banagher complimented, a dorky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher!\" Audrey said, an equally dorky smile on her own face. She had no idea what was getting into them but she loved it!</span></div></div>",

Wanna have a burping contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A burping contest?\" Audrey said in a confused tone. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a game where you see who can belt out the biggest burp. You up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds really weird but also kinda fun.\" Audrey replied as she rubbed her tummy. \"Sure, I'll give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so we each take turns burping until one of us is declared the winner.\" Banagher never expected that he would get into a belching contest with someone as prim and proper as Audrey yet he was. \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've got a big one coming up.\" Audrey proclaimed in an enthusiastic tone. She rubbed her tummy for a few seconds before she belched. \"Here I go! UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated duo giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now It's my turn.\" Banagher said. Like Audrey did, he rubbed his round middle for a few seconds before he burped. \"UUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Audrey and Banagher had a burping contest. They rubbed their stomachs, coaxing out several large belches. The burps they let out were loud and were occasionally followed up by giggle fits from the both of them, as they were having an absolute blast. Some of the burps Audrey and Banagher let out were so loud it even shocked them. Neither teen thought their bodies were capable of producing such huge expulsions of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRP!\" Audrey belched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP!\" Banagher belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new, and frankly quite odd experience for them, but rewarding at the same time. Sure, if one were to actually ask Banagher or Audrey what was satisfying about this, they wouldn't be able to put their finger on it and give a genuine answer, but it just felt right. As if there was something intimate about the whole thing, like they could forget all the troubles of world and all its colonies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both felt a rumbling deep in their guts. It started out as just a small thing at first, but then built up quickly. Before either of them knew it, a large expulsion of gas exited their mouths, filling the air with evidence of their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher simultaneously belted out a massive belch. They immediately burst out into laughter. Audrey never would've imagined that this is how her first day as a normal girl would've gone. She and Banagher went out and completely stuffed themselves and now they were lazing about on the couch and belching galore. And it was an absolutely amazing day. It felt so fantastic for Audrey to just let loose and enjoy herself. She could tell that Banagher was enjoying today just as much as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're pretty good at this, huh?\" Audrey said, still laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again!\" Banagher chuckled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Banagher looked down at his body, a mixture of many emotions swirling through his mind. He was standing in his room, on top of a white scale that read that he was now 200 pounds. It was official now: he was fat. Obese. No longer could he be considered the slim young man he used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he fell back onto his bed, the mattress creaking beneath his large weight. He looked down at his belly once more, noticing that lying down only made it look bigger. It was like a giant, soft mound that loomed over him, pretty much blocking off the view of anything past its massive expanse. Banagher stood up and gave it a closer look, a look of disgust on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was quite the enormous thing, so big and round it was pressing against the hem of his pants, the fabric barely able to contain it. So far, it didn\u2019t have any massive front rolls that turned it into a double-belly, instead just making it appear like one spherical, large mass. Of course, there were plenty of side-rolls that accompanied his love handles, and those could be quite deep, especially if the brunette ever decided to bend over to either side for whatever reason. All of this helped to make Banagher\u2019s belly incredibly soft and jiggly, no hints of muscle left within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t the only part of his body that got bigger, much to the Gundam pilot\u2019s dismay. Banagher\u2019s legs were huge, and there was a lot more junk in his trunk as well. Gone were the toned legs that met up with an equally firm ass; now they had been replaced with legs that were so huge they squished and chaffed together anytime the brunette walked, and a giant bubble butt that jiggled and wobbled with every step the poor young man made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of Banagher\u2019s chest, that was also quite different. It used to have muscles honed from hours of hard work, pecs that were nearly as hard as rocks. But not anymore; now his chest was so flabby and big that it could almost use a bra. His moobs were huge, squishing up against each other anytime the brunette lied down, and they jiggled tremendously with every little movement they young man made. They weren\u2019t big enough to lie on his stomach, but if he gained anymore weight, Banagher was a little afraid of what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the brunette\u2019s face. While it always had a bit of softness to it in the past, that only became much more pronounced as the pounds piled on. Banagher\u2019s cheeks had filled out to the point of becoming cherubic, and his chin was now double-tiered. It also wasn\u2019t too unlikely to see this same face red and drenched with sweat after a particularly grueling thing the out-of-shape Gundam pilot had to do, his panting only serving to show the bigger features of his visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Banagher had gained weight was his close friend, Audrey Burne. They two had decided to dorm together at Banagher's school after the Laplace conflict ended. Their had grown even closer to each other as well, to the point of becoming lovers, though they were still too nervous to admit they were boyfriend and girlfriend. The two would often enjoy hot dogs together, like they did when they first met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of Audrey's kindness, she would often give Banagher a lot of food, unintentionally fattening him up. They both knew he was fat, but they didn't really know what to say. As a result, they avoided talking about it as much possible. Granted, they both enjoyed a little belly play; that was at least one good thing about Banagher's new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott and Takuya also didn't say anything, though Micott did \"accidentally\" take a picture of Banagher's stomach exclusively when it was supposed to display both her and the Gundam pilot's bodies in full view. Banagher's weight gain didn't affect his relationship with his friends, which helped him feel a little better about his flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was more blunt, and had no problems telling Banagher he was fat and out-of-shape. However, she didn't say that to be mean. In fact, she was concerned for him, especially since she saw how distressed he was over his new pounds. It was just her lack of social skills that made it come off harsher than intended. So, she offered to help Banagher lose some weight, which the brunette accepted eagerly, both to be nice to Marida and slim down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Banagher.\" Audrey said as she walked into his room. \"Ready for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Audrey, and yeah, I could go for some cereal.\" Banagher said as he picked up Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey could tell that Banagher was just checking his weight and probably wasn't happy with it. Spending some time with him would be a good way to get his mind off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher could feel his belly, ass, and moobs jiggle and bounce as he and Audrey descended down the stairs, catching both of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, where are Takuya and Micott?\" Banagher asked, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their picking up a video game, the one that's about two girls trapped in a city fighting mechanical bears. I forgot the name.\" Audrey answered as they reached the end of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot. I was thinking about something else.\" Banagher said as he placed a hand on his tummy. He was glad that he'd be jiggling a little less, now that they were off the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'll have to show you it. It's part of a series, I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds interesting.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began watching TV as they enjoyed their breakfast on the couch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lazing around in the living room of Banagher\u2019s dorm, Banagher and Audrey really had no idea what to do. It was a nice, peaceful day, but there wasn\u2019t much they could think of to occupy their time. Aside from playing some video games, those were always fun. But otherwise, nada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, of course, until Audrey\u2019s stomach gave a loud growl. Sitting at the dining room table, she sported a massive blush as she put her hands to her stomach, hoping Banagher hadn\u2019t heard that. Unfortuanetly, from the way his full face turned to look at her, he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, though, the brunette wasn\u2019t nearly the type of person who\u2019d make fun of her for being hungry. Instead, he got up and walked on over to his friend, a goofy smile on his face the whole while. Audrey couldn\u2019t help but notice how much his belly jiggled with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, feeling a little peckish?\u201d the Gundam pilot asked as he made it to the table. \u201cBecause if you are, we could go out to get something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked up, flattered that Banagher would make that type of suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Banagher? I could just make a sandwich or something here, we have the ingredients\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not! I know just the place to bring you, and besides, I want a bit more food myself,\u201d the eager young man said, placing a hand on his rotund middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed, then gave a little smile. Banagher was always good at persuading her to do things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey stared at the menu of an interesting restaurant that caught her eye, called \u201cPo\u2019s Hideout\u201d, lost in thought. This was her first time going out to eat in a while, and the options on display were quite staggering. So many dishes were right in front of her eyes, each one begging for attention. Corn dogs, calzones, pizza, fried chicken, apple fritters, and even more! The poor young woman had no idea where to start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, though, she wasn\u2019t alone. No, Banagher Links was next to her, eyeing her indecisive expression, having already made his decision as to what to order a while ago. Realizing that his blonde friend may need some help, the brunette put on a small smile and tapped Audrey\u2019s shoulder. This startled the princess, causing her to look up in the young man\u2019s brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Audrey? Having a hard time choosing what to order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d the blonde said, giving a little smirk to her friend. \u201cYes, this menu just has so much to choose! I have no idea if any of it\u2019ll be good or not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as someone who\u2019s had all this stuff before, I can tell you that all this stuff tastes really great!\u201d Banagher said, placing a hand on his round middle. \u201cAnd this place has some very experienced chefs, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey still seemed a little uncertain, even with her friend\u2019s reassurances. Banagher realized that seeing through example would probably work better than words; the blonde princess was that type of person, after all. She needed to see something in order to believe it, and it was looking as if he\u2019d have to be the one to show her the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, how about this? I\u2019ll order a whole bunch of that stuff, and you can try it after I\u2019ve tasted it and shown you it\u2019s good. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to think this over, Audrey eventually nodded in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that does sound nice. You have to understand, I grew up in a very different type of environment than what most have been exposed to. I\u2019m not used to the food that\u2019s served to most others, as a result. I hope I don\u2019t come off as being cumbersome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, you? Are you joking? I\u2019d never consider you a burden!\u201d Banagher said firmly, turning to face the entrance of the restaurant. \u201cCome on, we have a few meals to order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later presented a sight that attracted the stares of most patrons of Po\u2019s Hideout, nearly making their jaws drop. For over at a table near the middle of the establishment, there was a practical feast laid out in front of only two people, a brunette man and a blonde woman. However, it seemed as if the young man was the only one of the two who was actually doing any eating whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher Links was certainly showing Audrey he liked good food, alright. He was practically shoveling it all into his mouth, caught up in his own gluttony. He was partaking in his own greedy desires with such gluttonous abandon, it even shocked Audrey a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such showing of his\u2026 passion for the delicacies was when he took two slices of bread, stuck a large calzone in between both, and chomped down it with sinful relish. He then took two slices of pizza in each of his hands, alternating taking bites out of each of them, practically inhaling all the greasy sauce and cheese goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason as to why he was being such a glutton was because even though he ordered most of the meals for him and Audrey to share, the moment he took a bite out of the first dish, his eyes lit up in ecstasy and he ate the entire plate of fired calamari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting out a burp, Banagher realized his mistake and apologized profusely to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, damn, I finished everything! Sorry, Audrey, I really didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d he said, bowing his head in sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, on the other hand, felt something within her light up. Something about watching Banagher stuff his face with all sorts of food, watching his stomach get slightly bigger as a result, made the blonde princess want to see him eat more. Thus, she responded in a way that she felt would get him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Banagher, please don\u2019t apologize! Obviously, you\u2019ve shown me that the fried calamari is really good!\u201d she said as she picked up a piece and chomped down on it, pleasure visible on her face. \u201cBut, I\u2019m not entirely sure about everything else. Do you mind if you try some more dishes for me, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher\u2019s eyes widened. He placed a hand on his stomach, realizing that while he wasn\u2019t full yet, it probably wouldn\u2019t be too long before he got to that point. But then he saw the look in Audrey\u2019s eyes, a somewhat pleading look, and he made his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Audrey, will do. I\u2019ll eat more of this food, and then I\u2019ll show you that it\u2019s all delicious!\u201d he declared as he began to get to work on the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, he ended up losing himself in his gluttony, since Audrey made no attempts at getting him to stop. He just kept on eating and eating, causing his shirt to ride up and his belly actually started to force his zipper down on his pants. Absentmindedly, Banagher unbuttoned them, allowing his stomach to billow out as he continued to stuff his face. However, that still left his belt, which was already tight before his stuffing. As a result, Banagher had an idea. The brunette began to inhale hard, forcing his stomach to expand out. After a few seconds, a large SNAP! Was heard as the belt was broken by the large amount of adipose spilling forth. Grunting, Banagher returned to his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Audrey watched on, she realized that he\u2019d have to stop at some point, when his stomach wouldn\u2019t be able to take much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do in that scenario?</span></div></div>",

Clearing her throat, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite good enough yet, Banagher. Surely you can fit a bit more in that big belly of yours, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down at this stuffed, midsection, giving it a poke. It gurgled in response, reminding the brunette of just how much food he packed it with. He ate enough food to feed a couple families of five already; he had no idea if he could fit anymore in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he looked back up at Audrey, he saw that she truly had an eagerness to see him eat more. It made him actually think: did she have an active desire to see him stuff himself? Granted, he already knew that she found his belly nice to play with on occasion, but would she also enjoy something like that? Of course, there was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u2026 sure, Audrey. I think I can fit a bit more in. But are you really sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded firmly, eyes still eager to see Banagher stuff even more food into his greedy mouth. Banagher, for his part, inwardly apologized to his stomach before getting to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what work it was. Even though his stomach was protesting him to stop by this point, Banagher still pressed on. Slices of cheesecake, fistfuls of chips, and sticks of corndogs all went into his mouth one by one, all joining together in the sloshing pit that was the brunette\u2019s stomach. It was getting less and less spacious by the minute, though, signaling that Banagher was reaching his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after eating through eight more dishes worth of food, Banagher decided to call it quits. His stomach, once soft and jiggly, was now completely spherical and hard. Poking it, Banagher gave out a moan of both pain\u2026 and yet also, a slight bit of pleasure. Despite how physically draining stuffing himself to such an extent could be, it surprisingly felt a little rewarding. Granted, it was quite the feat to be able to fit enough food in your stomach to be able to feed a family of ten twice-over, but now it was time to end things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUURRRP! Audrey, do you think it\u2019d be \u2013URP- okay if I stop eating now? I think I\u2019m done for the rest of the day\u2026 and probably the next\u2026\u201d Banagher said, resting a hand on his bloated middle. \u201cYou understand, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey snapped out of her bliss upon hearing these words, realizing Banagher was indeed uncomfortable. Shaking her head, she immediately began apologizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, Banagher! I-I didn\u2019t mean to push you too hard!\u201d she said, bowing her head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave a little laugh in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Blame my gluttonous appetite instead, heh heh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked up, sighed, and gave a bit of a laugh of her own. Banagher was always cute when trying to cheer people up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later saw the two of them arrive back at the living room where they began, except this time with Banagher obviously being several sizes bigger. It was quite a sight, seeing the relatively petite Audrey helping to support the incredibly obese Banagher on her shoulder. It was a little comical, actually: Banagher lumbering and swaying about due to being stuffed silly, while Audrey attempted to keep a more dignified air as she helped to support her friend as if he were drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, neither of the two realized how funny the situation was, for different reasons: Banagher, because he was way too bloated to care, and Audrey, because she was nearly suffering sensory overload with Banagher\u2019s giant mass pressing up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher\u2019s engorged stomach was so spherical it was pressing right into the blonde\u2019s side, and even with its firmness from the meal previously, there was still a layer of soft fat that was incredibly evident. Combined with seeing Banagher\u2019s legs and stomach jiggle and jostle with every footfall made, how labored his breathing was, his round face betraying how out of shape he had gotten, it nearly made Audrey\u2019s knees buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Un)fortunately, however, they were able to make it to the couch, where Audrey gently laid Banagher down, allowing his bloated stomach to stick up into the air like a mighty mountain. Pausing a moment to look at it, Audrey was nearly lost in the tantalizing way it moved up and down with every one of Banagher\u2019s labored breaths, before snapping her attention back to normal when a giant belch filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it came from Banagher, and was accompanied with a cute moan. Audrey, being the considerate girl she was, immediately started questioning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBanagher, are you okay? You\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d Audrey said, placing a hand on Banagher\u2019s taut tummy and beginning to rub the sphere of adipose with great care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Banagher began with, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m really not that-UUUUUURRRRRP-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he was cut off by one of the biggest belches he\u2019d ever belted out in his entire life. For a moment, there was complete silence following it, with Banagher\u2019s face going beet red. Then, however, he and Audrey looked at each other, and they burst out laughing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBanagher, what do we say?\u201d Audrey asked in a playful tone of voice, somewhat recovering from the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-excuse \u2013UUURRRP-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got the first part down, but what about the second part of that statement?\u201d Audrey said, a bemused expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUURRRP! Excuse \u2013URP- me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice. One should always remember to have proper manners, Banagher,\u201d Audrey said, giving a light pat to Banagher\u2019s stomach before continuing with her rubbing activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while, before Audrey decided to bring up some small-talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019ve you been doing with getting that high score in Ghoul Guns? I hear it\u2019s a pretty tough game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis perked Banagher up enough to allow him to lift his head and smile. If there was one thing he was surprised by when it came to Audrey, it was her interest in his video games. Considering her upbringing, it was a rather surprising revelation. He could still remember the time when he first showed her his collection; the look of sheer wonder on her face made his heart warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is, but guess what? I actually beat it! Beat it fair and square, no cheat codes used at all!\u201d he said triumphantly. \u201cThat old score of 100,000? It\u2019s just been boosted up to 200,000!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nearly squealed in admiration before quickly composing herself. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s amazing, Banagher! I knew you were good, but not that good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher scratched the back of his head, sporting a big grin on his face. \u201cAh, what can I say? Enough practice will boost your skill level at anything, really. Thanks for the compliment, though. Do you wanna play a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. Right now, though, I think we should help to soothe your stomach. Sorry if it felt like I was pressuring you earlier. I really don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Banagher assured her. \u201cI really don\u2019t mind. It was really good food, though; do you think you\u2019d be willing to try more the next time we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shook her head affirmatively, giving a bit of a chuckle. Satisfied, Banagher laid his head back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette let out several more belches, with Audrey occasionally adding in a, \u201cWell, excuse you!\u201d every time, in increasingly playful ways. After a while, Banagher drifted off to sleep, leaving Audrey still contentedly rubbing his stomach even as his breathing got softer and no more burps escaped his lips. Audrey sighed in contentment, looking down at her friend\u2019s round face in happiness. But then she flashed back to the restaurant, and contemplated what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, though, what came over me? I have no idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Banagher slept off his big meal, he dreamed that he and Audrey were sitting on their couch, happily watching TV. Just like in the real world, Audrey was her regular skinny self while Banagher was fat. Suddenly, Banagher's stomach let out a loud rumble in hunger, catching both teens' attention. The brunette self-consciously placed a hand on his dome of a middle, a slight blush tinting his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get a snack.\" He said as he heaved himself up. The obese brunette walked over to the fridge and opened it, he licked his lips as he looked at all the delicious food inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Audrey gained a shocked expression on her face as she saw Banagher carrying a truly absurd amount of food as he walked back to the couch. It was like something out of one of those cartoons Banagher introduced her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's uh, quite a large snack.\" The blonde stated as her overweight friend sat back down in his spot on the couch and placed his meal next to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I might've overdone it a bit.\" Banagher chuckled. He quite the assortment of food with him. Pretzels, potato chips, cereal, and ice cream just to name a few. \"You can have it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher.\" Audrey said as she grabbed a bag of potato chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Banagher ended up eating far more then Audrey. Whilst the blonde merely ate one bag of potato chips, Banagher devoured everything else he brought and his gut was as bloated as one would expect. His belly was normally big and round, even when it wasn't filled with food, but now it was even bigger. Banagher's dome of a middle even snapped his belt in half, popped off his pants' button, and even forced his zipper down before he was even finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, boy am I \u2013UUURRRRP- stuffed!\" The bloated Gundam pilot said, giving his big belly a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed.\" Audrey said, chuckling a bit. She reached a hand out to Banagher's gut and began rubbing the large orb, eliciting a moan of pleasure from her bloated friend's lips. \"How's your stomach feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, it feels great \u2013UUUURRRAP- now that you're rubbing it!\" Banagher said with joy. It always felt amazing when his blonde friend rubbed his tummy whenever he was bloated from a big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see.\" Audrey said with a warm smile, giving her friend's belly a few pats, accidentally forcing a huge burp out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry about that!\" Audrey stuttered out, her cheeks blushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, that felt great!\" Banagher happily said, smiling in a reassuring manner, though he was still blushing a bit. After all, belting out a huge burp in front of your friend was far from polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, burping actually helps me feel better.\" Banagher clarified. \"Speaking of, do you think you could press down on the top of my belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey took a few seconds to process what Banagher just said, and when she did she placed her hand on the top of Banagher's big gut and pressed down slightly. And just as expected, a \"URRRAAAP!\" came flying out of his mouth. Banagher and Audrey immediately started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of Audrey rubbing Banagher's belly, coaxing out quite a lot of loud burps from him, the overfed Gundam pilot was just about to fall into a food coma like he did in the real world, ironically. Suddenly, Banagher's phone started ringing. Surprised, Banagher pulled it out of his pocket and read who it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Audrey asked, still massaging Banagher's belly of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! It's Riddhe.\" Banagher began answering. \"He-\" Was all Banagher could say before he was cut off by Riddhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher! Neo-Zeon is on it's way to Industrial 7! The Nahel Argama is at the docks, get here ASAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way!\" The call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you.\" Audrey stated, the blonde had a dead-serous look on her face yet she was still giving Banagher a loving belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stay here, it's much safer.\" Banagher pleaded before he attempted to stand up, only for his overstuffed stomach to prevent him from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my responsibility as the princess of Zeon to aid you however I can in ending this threat.\" Audrey said. She stood up and extended her hand to her friend. \"And I'm safest with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks, I really appreciate it.\"  Banagher grabbed his friend's hand and after a bit of huffing and puffing from both of them, he was lifted up. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, their determination didn't mean that it was going to be easy for Banagher to walk there while he's got a belly this bloated. Much like how the real version of her did earlier, Audrey supported Banagher as he waddled over to the docks, his huge abdomen pressing against the blonde's flat stomach. Upon actually getting there, Banagher was faced with another challenge: getting into his pilot suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grunted as he tried with all his might to force his suit to zip over his belly but it simply refused to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Come on!\" He grunted in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sucked in his stomach and actually started to make some progress but he ran out of breath and had to let his gut come flopping back out. The brunette was panting and red in the face from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some help?\" Audrey said in a concerned tone. The blonde was already in her normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah *huff* thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher needed one hand on the zipper and another on the suit itself. And he couldn't suck his tummy in long enough to zip up his suit. This made pulling the zipper up all the way impossible for Banagher to do on his own (until he digested his snack) but Audrey had a solution. She gently pushed in Banagher's gut for him, eliciting another belch from him as she expected, which gave Banagher just enough room to move the zipper above his belly, with Audrey perfectly timing when she removed her hands from her friend's round stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're smart. Thanks!\" Banagher complimented with a goofy smile after he zipped his suit up all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing.\" Audrey smiled as she blushed at Banagher's complement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey then saw Banagher off as they stood in front of the Unicorn Gundam's open cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you'll succeed.\" The princess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I've got you supporting me.\" Banagher then pressed a button on his helmet that made it's visor come down.  He then turned and attempted to enter the cockpit when he faced his next challenge: actually getting his fat butt in the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Banagher was so fat that he actually got stuck in between the hole to the cockpit. Of course, the hole to the real life Unicorn Gundam's cockpit was much larger. Since this was Banagher's dream and dreams are made of one's subconscious, it wasn't too surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grunted as he tried to squezze through to no avail. \"Hey, Audrey, can you give me a hand?\" The Gundam pilot said, blushing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Audrey said in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey pushed her close friend's bloated frame as hard as she could and after a seconds of doing so, Banagher finally squeezed through. However, this sent both of them tumbling through and falling over. Audrey placed a hand on the cockpit's chair for support, however, she unknowingly pressed the button that closed the cockpit's hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time for me to get out, just launch with me.\"Audrey sated, fearless as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher nodded and then got up. He didn't want Audrey to be so close to the fighting but he had already taken too long to launch so there really wasn't any time to let out his skinny friend out. Either way, Banagher knew no harm would come to her, he would make sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as he was about to plant his fatass in the cockpit's chair Banagher woke up and his dream ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher opened his eyes to see that he was till laying down on the couch in his school dorm's living room, with Audrey still sitting next to him. The only differences were that Audrey had placed a blanket on him and that Takuya and Micott were siting on one of the other couches. He let out a small grunt as he shifted lightly, alerting to Audrey that he was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're awake.\" The blonde said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Takuya added, placing his mobile suit magazine aside. \"Man, you sure know how to sleep, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not any better yourself, Takuya.\" Micott teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a loud yawn, still a bit sleepy as one typically was when they woke up. \"How long was I asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour. You slept like a log.\" Micott informed, a bemused expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Banagher, isn't there a video game you want to show me?\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Banagher's drowsiness was instantly gone. He always had energy for video games.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after having breakfast the next day, Banagher got a phone call from Marida asking if today was a good time to start exercising together. Keeping mind how he had definitely gained a few pounds from his binge yesterday (even if he didn't looks visibly fatter), Banagher told her that today was the perfect time to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher walked down to the nearby park, his tummy bouncing with every step as a reminder of how badly he needed to do this, where Marida said they would be doing their exercise. Seeing the nice clear sky, beautiful scenery made of grass and trees, the brunette could easily see why Marida wanted to work out here, even though he was never really an outdoors kind of guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from the park entrance, he saw his red-haired friend waiting for him on a park bench, she had two bottles of water by her side. \"Hey, Marida.\" Banagher said as he walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked at how much her friend's belly was jiggling with every step. She thought on how Banagher was right, this really was the perfect time to start exercising together. \"How's your diet going?\" She said as Banagher sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words left Marida's lips, memories of how much eating he had been doing lately, especially yesterday, flashed through his mind like a montage. \"It's been going fine, I only had breakfast so far. Cereal and orange juice, just like you said. No snacks at all.\" The brunette avoided eye contact with the redhead as he nervously scratched the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Banagher wasn't surprised that his lying failed to trick Marida, but he was surprised by how she verified that he was lying. She lifted his hoodie and shirt up above his belly and started feeling up the ball of fat with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you doing?\" Banagher's full cheeks were a shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida ran her a hand over his stomach, with her other hand she poked it, jiggled it, pat it, and grabbed a handful of his belly flab, while Banagher just watched in confusion and embarrassment. It took less then ten seconds but it sure as hell felt like more. \"You've had four hot dogs, a hamburger, and a large soda.\" The redhead calmly said as she removed her hands from her friend's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher could only give her a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start with stuff like jumping jacks and sit ups, then we'll do some jogging around the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Banagher pulled his hoodie and shirt back down over his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we do that, have some water.\" Marida handed Banagher a bottle of water. \"The first rule of exercise is to always stay hydrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda reminds of me of when I was in the desert with the captain.\" The two then drank some of their water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the same basic principle, drink at regular intervals even if you're not feeling thirsty. Now then,\" Marida stood up. \"Are you ready to exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher stood up as well. \"Yeah, I'm ready to lose this gut.\" He lifted up the mass of flab and then let it drop, sending it jiggling and bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear.\" Banagher felt the jiggling made that less cool then he thought it would be, but he was glad it impressed Marida. \"First, we'll do some warm ups. Just stretch however you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida did professional warm up techniques with perfect form, Banagher's form was rather awkward, something he knew very well. All his stretching was done clumsily, and when he leaned over to the side to stretch, his love handles and side rolls got deeper. After half a minute of this, the warm up was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that our bodies are ready, we'll start with a simple exercise, touching our toes.\" Marida said before she did so effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down, his stomach blocked the sight of his feet but that didn't deter him. \"I've got this.\" He thought. He leaned over and reached down, meeting much greater difficulty then he expected. He felt his belly press his crotch and legs as he kept reaching down, giving him some discomfort that made this even harder. Grunting, he was visibly annoyed and uncomfortable. He couldn't tell as he was only looking down, but Marida watching him the whole time with patience, still touching her feet. She realized this might prove harder then she thought but she knew Banagher would reach soon, he wasn't THAT fat. And indeed he did. \"Got it!\" He said when he finally reached his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Marida was going to have him hold that position for a few seconds but she decided to give the poor guy a break. \"Good work. Let's drink some water before we try something else.\" She got back into a normal standing position and walked back to the bench where they placed their bottles of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher stood back up, panting a little. \"*Pant* *Pant* Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was push ups, which was in some ways even harder. Once again, Marida did the exercise perfectly, but the poor young man to her side was struggling. Not only was his form awkward and clumsy like usual, his tummy made touching the ground difficult. His middle pressing and squishing against the ground threw off his balance when he tried to make his flabby chest hit the ground, and he had to actively press his stomach into ground to complete a push up. By the end of this, Marida had done 34 push ups. Banagher had only done 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the sit ups, easily the hardest for Banagher yet. Banagher held Marida's feet in place, anchoring being the official term, as she did twenty sit ups. Banagher knew his friend was fit, even without the aid of her Cyber-Newtype enhancements, but he was still amazed by how good she was at this. And then it was Banagher's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got this, Banagher!\" Marida cheered on as her fat friend struggled to do one single pull up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot of the Unicorn Gundam was grunting and huffing, fighting his belly to pull one pull up off as it squished against his legs. His exercise partner could see some sweat and redness on his round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up, you can do this!\" Marida kept cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-O-One!\" He shouted as he finally did it after fifteen seconds of effort. He immediately flopped right back down, panting and sweating. His stomach rose up and down with every pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job. That's the key to exercise, you just have to keep at it and believe in yourself.\" Marida said. \"Ready for the next one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida mercifully ended the sit ups at five. Their last exercise before jogging was jumping jacks. They weren't hard for Banagher to do, but they were still exhausting. His belly, moobs, and butt jiggled and bounced with every single jumping jack, and his tummy slapped against his legs. His jumping jacks got more and more sluggish as he got more and more exhausted. By the time they were done with jumping jacks, Marida had finished 50 while Banagher had only finished 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they started jogging, the exercising pilots took a quick break to sit down and drink some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how I am doing so far?\" Banagher felt he already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For someone of your weight and lack of physical activity, pretty good.\" Marida answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though your form is clumsy, you're getting exhausted far too quickly, and having trouble with even the most basic exercise, you're still keeping at it and that's what's important. Most people like you would've given up after the first sit up, but you did four more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Marida. I was sure I was doing terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you keep at it, you're doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having some more water, they started jogging, the obese brunette's legs, ass, and belly jiggling and jostling the whole time. Banagher's chubby legs gave him a bit of a wobble but he could still keep up with the speed Marida was going at. After thirty seconds of jogging, Banagher started panting. Ten seconds later, he was sweating. Five seconds after that, some redness was appearing on his chubby cheeks and he started moving slower, something Marida noticed, so slowed down to match speed with her obese friend. Eight seconds later, he was panting heavily and face was completely red with painful exhaustion and drenched in sweat. He soon had to ask Marida if they could take a break, which she immediately granted. The poor young man collapsed onto the sidewalk right outside the park, huffing and puffing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How *huff* *huff* did I do?\" Banagher asked. Once again, he felt he knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, for someone as fat and out of shape as you, pretty good.\" Marida answered, surprising Banagher that she still felt he was doing good. \"Though I think we should try something other then jogging for now.\" The redhead pondered on what they should do next. It had to be something that would keep them both moving a lot but not non-stop. Being able to sit down and take a break whenever they wanted would be ideal. But what matched that description?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually looking at the scenery around her, Marida noticed a basketball court on the other side of the street, no one was currently using it. \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever played basketball?\" Banagher asked as he watched Marida dribble the ball in place. They were both standing in the middle of the court, Banagher was on his side while Marida was on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I understand the basic rules. Have you played it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few times during gym class. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida tossed the basketball into the air, she got it before Banagher was able to. She quickly ran over to Banagher's side of the court, Banagher chased after her as fast as his bloated form would allow but the redhead quickly dunked the ball, leaving Banagher shocked at how good Marida was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you never played this before.\" The brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't. My physical fitness just gives me an advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher look at his stomach, frustration evident on his face. \"And my body gives me a disadvantage.\" He emphasized the \"dis\" in disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the score. The goal is just burning calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's just not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that frustration and use it as fuel to keep trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida threw the ball again, the result being the same as last time. Banagher got a little closer to Marida then last time before she threw the ball, which fell in the hoop. The next time Banagher actually manged to get the ball dribbled towards Marida's side, jiggling like he did during his jogging, but Marida stole the ball as soon as he was about to shoot. She quickly dribbled back to Banagher's side of the court, the side's owner chasing her and panting,and preformed another successful throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marida threw the ball at the start of the next round, Marida threw it again, she caught it and started running towards her chubby friend's hoop, only for him to steal the ball from her. Jiggling like mad and panting, Banagher quickly wobbled to Marida's side and made the shot, which fell through the hoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good shot.\" The redhead said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'm actually *pant* a little surprised I did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida once again caught the ball for the next round. Banagher decided to try something different this time. Rather then try to steal the ball there, he ran with all the speed he could possibly summon and blocked Marida in front of his hoop. However, Marida did a poor dribble that made the ball bounce out of her reach and then right into the middle of Banagher's gut, making it jiggle violently. It kept jiggling and jostling for four seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was hit with a wave of worry and guilt the second Banagher was hit by the ball. \"I'm so sorry! Are you okay, Banagher? Is there a bruise?\" She ran to Banagher, knelled down so her eye level was at her friend's orb of a middle, and lifted his shirt and jacket up to inspect the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. That actually didn't hurt. I think all this fat actually protected me.\" Banagher poked his big tummy a few times, finding that his finger actually sank into the fat before it met resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling and inspecting the mass of flab, Marida found that Banagher was correct, there was not a single mark. \"Hmm.\" She gave it a poke, finding the fat immediately went back into place as when she removed her finger. \"It seems your big belly has some uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, now that we know I'm okay, can you stop now?\" Banagher's beet red face wasn't looking at Marida. \"There's some girls looking at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo played for a few more rounds before they decided they had enough exercise for today. Marida's score was 17 to Banagher's 4. Banagher was left a mess by the end, he laying down on the bench, panting heavily, his chubby face once again red and covered in sweat, his stomach jutting straight up into the air and moving up and down with every pant. Marida was sitting at the other end of the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good today. I'm proud of you.\" Marida said after drinking some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff *huff* Thanks.\" Banagher then took a big sip from his bottled water, getting as much water as he possibly could. It was so refreshing to feel the water fill his thirsty, thirsty mouth. Like drinking water from an oasis after traversing a desert for hours without water. \"That was really fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't had that much fun in a long time. Let's make this a regular thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud growl of hunger then sounded from Banagher's middle. He looked at it, looked back at Marida, and gave a blush and goofy grin. \"Guess I'm hungry, heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing a small grin, Marida gave Banagher's tummy a friendly pat. \"Let's get lunch. I'm feeling hungry myself.\" Marida's own stomach growled in hunger. She gave it a few pats, blushing a little. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mineva Lao Zabi had discovered that the Vist Foundation intends to handover a powerful relic called Laplace's Box to Neo-Zeon. Despite her heritage she believes that Laplace's Box would be misused for the sake of the Zeonic movement if Neo-zeon were to obtain it. To prevent this, she travels to the space colony Industrial 7 as a stowaway aboard the Neo-Zeon freighter, The Garencieres. Unfortunately while entering the colony she accidentally ran into a construction area and fell out of the center of the colony. However she was rescued by a young boy named Banagher Links. Despite this, she was still far away from where the deal would deal would be held and she needed to get there fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren\u2019t you eating? You gotta be starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's words quickly snapped Mineva out of her thoughts. The two had just made a quick stop for some hotdogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we\u2019re going to eat and walk\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told she was feeling rather hungry but the princess within her felt uncomfortable eating while walking. Still she quickly took a bite out of her hotdog and was surprised by how good it tasted. She couldn't help but blush. She had never eaten a hotdog before but now she wanted to eat as many as she could. She quickly ate the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious.\" Mineva thought as wiped her mouth with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut much to her surprise she quickly heard her stomach growl for more. Mineva put a hand on her stomach and blushed. She had never felt hungry after a meal. Despite her embarrassment and concern for her weight, she decided that she should eat a little more to keep her stomach from growling before Banagher noticed. After all just one more couldn't hurt and she would get to eat another hotdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Banagher. Do you mind if I get another?\"</span></div></div>",

Mineva had eaten far more then she meant to, she was only going to have one more hotdog to quell her growling stomach but it seemed like no matter how many she ate it wasn't enough to satisfy her hunger. At least until she had eaten a dozen or so. Now she felt like she would explode if she ate any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can\u2019t believe I ate so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMineva looked down at her bloated gut. Her large orb-shaped belly strained the buttons on her coat, almost to the point of popping. She moaned as she rubbed it before accidentally unleashing a loud unladylike belch. Mineva immediately slapped her hands over mouth, blushing. She really hoped Banagher hadn\u2019t heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me.\" Mineva uttered after a few seconds of silence. The two continued walking, Mineva still groaning all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to take a break?\" Banagher asked, \"You look a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\u2019s no time, we need to keep moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever due to the extra weight her bloated tummy had added she soon lost her balance and fell. Banagher quickly grabbed hold of her, preventing her from hitting the floor. Though he had not intended to do so by grabbing her belly. After helping Mineva regain her balance Banagher awkwardly removed his hand from her belly, both of them blushing heavily.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't risk lives over a tummyache. Even if it was a rather painful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you what could happen if we don't make it in time.\" Mineva said, gaining a serious look on her face. \"I won't risk another war breaking out just because I have a stomachache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" Banagher started. \"But I'm not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Banagher and Mineva's thoughts were interrupted by a loud -ping!- sound. They then heard the sound of something light hitting the ground and saw that it was the button on Mineva's pants. Mineva's bloated belly had finally managed to pop off the button on her pants, causing her tummy to pour further outwards, undoing her pant's zipper as well as straining her coat's buttons even more. It also would've given Banagher a small look at her underwear had her coat not covered it. A blush quickly appeared on Mineva's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I think you should lay down. Just for a little while.\" Banagher said. \"I don't want you to be in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you, Banagher.\" Mineva said. This was the first time someone her age had ever expressed concern for her as a person, rather then as a symbol of Zeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on Mineva's coat soon popped off, exposing her stuffed belly and revealing that her blouse had ridden up to the point that her belly button was clearly visible. While this made her tummy feel much more comfortable it also caused Mineva to feel embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMineva moaned as rubbed her newly-freed stuffed belly before accidentally unleashed a loud unladylike belch. She immediately slapped both her hands over her mouth, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me.\" Mineva uttered after a few seconds of silence.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBanagher gave a small friendly chuckle at this. This helped relax Mineva, as well as cause her to give a small smile. She was still embarrassed of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher,\" Mineva said, sounding a little more happy, both due to Banagher and their being less pressure on her tummy. \"Could you pick up those buttons?

She had to admit that it felt nice to sit down and relax after walking for so long. It also gave her a chance to give her stomach a soothing rub, something it really needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you know my name?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Mineva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me Banagher even though I haven't told you my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pet called out your name when we crashed.\" Mineva said, referring to Haro who was sitting in Banagher's lap. Haro had been mostly silent since Mineva started overeating, most likely because he couldn't think of anything he could say without hurting Mineva's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so I'm Banagher Links.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor both their sakes, Mineva couldn't tell Banagher her real name. While thinking of a fake name, Mineva remembered seeing a movie theater while she was eating. It was showing a classic film staring Audrey Hepburn, an actress she was interested in due to her being in some movies Mineva liked as well as their situations being somewhat similar, though she had never heard about Audrey Hepburn ever binge eating to the point that her belly was bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Audrey. Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a four letter difference but she was sure Banagher wouldn't notice, he seems like he would rather play video games then watch classic movies, though she barely even knew what a video game was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?' Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Haro.\" Banagher started, holding Haro up to Audrey. \"It's a replica of the robot mascot built by an ace pilot back during the war. It was the coolest thing ever when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey noticed that Banagher was as enthusiastic as a little kid wanting to show his new toy, she got the impression that he had wanted to talk about Haro to someone for a while. She also noticed that the shape of her belly resembled Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn\u2019t know what most kids liked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Banagher asked, putting Haro back on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I grew up, we were always on the move.\" Audrey explained. \"I was brought up like a nomad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds a lot like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's response surprised Audrey. He seemed like an ordinary boy to her, but now it looks like they may be more alike then she first thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite there being less pressure on Audrey's belly due to her coat and pants being unbuttoned, she still felt unconformable from the pressure  that was in her belly due to all the food and gas within it. Realizing that now was probably the best time to tend to her stomach she would get for a while, she began to rub her stomach, occasionally moaning or groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher could tell that while Audrey was feeling better, she was still bloated and the massage she was giving her tummy, as well as the occasional burp, was not helping her enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to rub your stomach?\" Banagher asked, he figured that having someone else rub her belly would feel better then doing it herself, though he had never done or even seen someone do this before, he thought it couldn't make her feel any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-What?\" Audrey asked, stifling a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I thought someone else rubbing your belly would feel better.\" Banagher clarified. \"I could do it for you, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey thought about it for a moment. She could use a massage, and Banagher is a nice person, and he is rather cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\" Audrey said, placing herself on Banagher's lap after Banagher moved Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher put his hands on Audrey's belly. They were both blushing heavily and feeling nervous, as this was the first time that either of them had gotten intimate with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can-You can start now.\" Audrey said after a few awkward seconds of silence, sounding nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I know.\" Banagher said, sounding equally as nervous. 'I've just... never really done this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then began to rub Audrey's belly, causing her to let out a small \"ah.\" as she felt Banagher's hands move around her belly, as all her discomforts began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Banagher.\" Audrey said, after a minute or two of enjoying Banagher's massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah?\" Banagher asked. he was feeling less nervous after doing this for a few minutes, though he was still afraid that Audrey was about to tell him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you go a little lower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did as she asked and while Banagher's massage already felt good, it now felt absolutely amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh yeah. That's the stuff.\" Audrey said as she leaned further back into Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt embarrassed about saying something like that but Banagher was just so good at rubbing her belly that she couldn't help it. He was like an angel. That might not have been a bad comparison, even if it was incredibly cheesy, he did save her life after all and it didn't feel like that would be the last time either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's soothing massage accidentally forced the gas in Audrey's belly out, causing her to burp loudly, she quickly placed a hand over her mouth, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me.\" Audrey said, she's been burping so much today, despite her normally excellent manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Banagher assured. \"Just do whatever you need to feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few seconds to think about what Banagher said, Audrey let out an even bigger burp without excusing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what was more embarrassing, her loud belches, her bloated gut, her huge appetite, or the almost sexual comment she made earlier, but it was definitely all worth it to meet Banagher and get to this moment. And she had to admit, it was nice to let go and be an ordinary girl. She didn't have any regrets about anything she did this day.</span></div></div>",

She had orders to retrieve Mineva and return her to the Garencieres, by force if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the solder side pf Marida viewed this as nothing more then another mission, her human side, the side that saw Mineva as a little sister, was concerned about the boy that Mineva was with. She knew nothing about him and as most older sisters would've, she was afraid he was dangerous. The soldier side of was also concerned, the fact that she knew nothing about him made him a wild card and she had both heard of and seen many missions fail because of an unpredictable element. Mineva was the princess of Zeon, It's light, She couldn't afford to fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida continued to observe from a distance, she knew she needed to keep a balance action and observation, placing emphasis on over the other could easily result in the failure of a mission, especially in a civilian district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to Marida as if the boy was holding Mineva, but she didn't seem to be resisting or even uncomfortable, if anything she seemed completely relaxed. Marida knew that she didn't understand people, she knew it was completely possible that Mineva was willing sitting in his lap but she needed to know what Mineva had done since arriving in the colony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat confused her the most however, was Mineva's bloated belly. She knew that Mineva wasn't pregnant and she knew that she would never pig out to such a ridicules extant. Perhaps it was a clever ploy to convince anyone who had seen her that she was pregnant, throwing her pursuers off, though she wasn't certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mineva's belly and thinking how much she must've eaten to cause it to swell so much, made Marida think about her own belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida was no longer the slim and fit soldier she used to be, having become incredibly obese. As a result of letting her training and diet slip her mind for a while now, she ended up gaining so much weight that she weighed 348 lbs., making her incredibly obese. This certainly took the expected toll upon her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was her absolutely huge stomach. It was a massive sphere of adipose, big enough that it went past the hem of her pants. In fact, it was so huge, it actually had a notable hang due to the effects of gravity pulling the massive weight down, causing it to obscure the young woman\u2019s waist and crotch. There were several prominent rolls and love handles on the sides of the titanic beast, and they melded seamlessly with the ample amount of back fat the redhead had accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Marida\u2019s chest. Her cleavage was modest beforehand, but now it was absolutely huge. Each boob was massive, filled with so much fat that they were trying to burst out of her bra. Granted, they were still just as perky as ever due to Marida\u2019s youth, but they each boob was as big as a honeydew nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, one couldn\u2019t leave out Marida\u2019s now prodigious posterior when describing her. While it used to be toned and fairly small beforehand, now it was massive and blubbery. All the muscle that used to be there was completely gone, instead replaced by copious amounts of flab that caused each cheek to jiggle profoundly when the soldier even so much as walked. The amount of jiggling and jostling it did whenever she ran only served to remind the young redhead of how huge her ass had become, to the point that it caused many rips and tears in her old pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were Marida\u2019s arms and legs, just as flabby as the other areas of her body, and their effects just as heavy as they were literally. First, her legs were so thick with fat that they chafed against each other constantly, not even having the smallest of gaps when one looked at the upper area. It seemed they were almost permanently fused together, their great jiggly masses bouncing along with every step the young woman took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead\u2019s arms weren\u2019t exactly much better: while they weren\u2019t too bad near her hands, like her legs, the further up they went, the thicker they were. They had lost all traces of muscle, and were attached to hands that were very thick, with sausage-like digits to seal the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Marida\u2019s face. It was much fuller than it was when she was slim, definitely. She now had cherubic, fat cheeks that went along well with her double chin. Combined with the copious amounts of neck fat she had, along with how her face was usually red from exhaustion, it gave her a very cute appearance. However, this never detracted from just how piercing her gaze could be whenever she needed to use it. But when she was relaxed, allowing her more human side to show through, she certainly looked like quite the nice person to cuddle with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, poor Marida\u2019s wardrobe hadn\u2019t been updated at all to accommodate all of this. Her uniform\u2019s shirt was so ill-fitting that it rode up over her dome of a belly, enough to rise well past her navel. Her stomach and waist were both so huge that they ended up breaking many of the standard-issue belts given to the redhead, so she had to get a tailor-made one. Her pants, while not having as many tears and rips as some previous pairs, still had a few. In short, she was practically bursting out of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! A lot better.\" Audrey replied with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had been rubbing Audrey's belly for quite a while by now, he was happy to know that it was helping her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready to get up. Let's go.\" Audrey said, after a few more minutes of her tummy being rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was just about to get up, when Banagher hit a really sweet spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.\" Audrey moaned. \"Maybe in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a dozen minutes later that she was finally ready to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Alright, I'm ready to get up for real this time.\" Audrey said, getting up with a smile still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks for the \u2013UURRP- massage Banagher.\" Audrey said, blushing with a nervous smile on her face. She is such a dork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Just let me know if you need me to rub her your belly again. Or, uh, if you need my help with anything. Aside from getting to the mansion that is.\" Banagher replied, blushing with a similar smile as Audrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a small giggle at this, it was fitting that her best friend is as dorky as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair continued walking to their destination. Marida knew they were going to take an elevator to the colony builder, and decided to cut them off.</span></div></div>",

It felt just as good as it did before, though they would've like to sit down. Even though they were getting used to this, blushes still appeared on their faces. They are still teenagers after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wouldn't be able to enjoy this moment for long however, Marida was waiting for them at the elevator's stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends didn't notice her immediately, they were stuck in their own little world. Marida didn't mind though, in fact she didn't intend to interrupt them, they would have to acknowledge her soon. And it was nice to see Mineva happy. Though Mineva Lao Zabi, The Princess of Zeon, wasn't here, there was only Audrey Burne, Banagher's close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey unleashed a loud unladylike belch, patting her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.\" Banagher complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher.\" Audrey didn't know what was coming over her, but she was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after thanking Banagher for complimenting her belching skills, something Audrey never thought she would do, she noticed Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Marida?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey instantly moved away from Banagher, blushing even more. She instinctively tried to button her clothes together, having forgotten in the heat of the moment all her clothes' buttons had popped off. Panicking, she tried to pull her blouse back down over her belly and zipper her pants' back up. Neither attempts at looking presentable were met with success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing such an uncharacteristic lack of manners from Mineva, not to mention just how loud her burp was, surprised Marida, leading to a small look of shock on her face, which was mostly just her bottom lip lowering slightly. She quickly recovered however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked at Banagher. From the way he carried himself, to the fact that he was holding what looked like a cartoon character, to his face, to his eyes, to what little she saw of his friendship with the princess, she knew he wasn't someone who would hurt Mineva. She quickly turned her eyes back to Mineva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go back.\"</span></div></div>",

He knew they couldn't just try to run away, while Marida appeared to be too fat to catch up with them, even if Audrey was still bloated, the two men with Marida would still catch up. Despite this, Banagher could still see a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" Banagher said quietly to Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can\u2019t handle Laplace's Box right now,\" Audrey argued. \"whatever it is, it will simply be used by Full Frontal to start a meaningless war, which will bring nothing but more hatred, you understand that, don\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" Marida replied, Audrey's words had no effect on her. \"I understand that I have orders to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie.\" Audrey said, raising her voice a little. \"You weren\u2019t given your powers for this, you know very well that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey abruptly stopped speaking, as she saw the two men behind Marida move towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry.\" Marida apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gently rolled Haro between the two groups, before pressing a button that sent the elevator back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danger! Danger!\" Haro exclaimed as he rolled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your hand.\" Banagher said, as Audrey did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro began to emit a beeping noise as he flapped his \"ears\". This caused the two men back up slightly, Marida's group was worried it was a bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they came to the conclusion that Banagher needed them to, he throw Haro high up in the air, causing the two men to panic, now positive that it was bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!' Banagher exclaimed as he used the rails to jump onto the platform that was now above them, guiding Audrey to do the same as they were still holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men attempted to chase after them by doing the same, but do they were only able to grab onto the ledge, Banagher and Audrey were already standing up by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher delivered a swift kick to the larger one, knocking him down. Unfortunately, this allowed the other one enough time to pull himself up, Banagher was completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey realized that Banagher was in danger, and belly bumped his assailant off the platform, causing her belly to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed at this, embarrassed. Banagher actually liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job.\" Banagher complimented as he caught Haro before they began running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" Audrey said, running with him. She was picking up a lot of useful skills today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was having trouble running however, she was simply too bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida used the larger man that had fallen down to jump up onto the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!' Audrey said, as she saw Marida land on the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked back, realizing what Audrey was warning him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began running after them. She started to pant and sweat, her face red from exhaustion, her body jiggling and wobbling violently, reminding her of just how out of shape she's gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having a bit of trouble running, Audrey was still faster than Marida's extremely obese form. Despite this Marida was beginning to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platform they were on was starting to disconnect from their destination. Banagher and Audrey jumped over to it, with Marida doing so as well not long after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let go of Audrey and tried to push Marida off, it was hard to make someone so fat even budge, but Banagher did so by force of will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher fell off the platform with her, but Audrey grabbed his hand and manged to pull him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was lying on the ground trying to get her breath back as she heard her stomach growl. Giving an exasperated sigh, she placed a hand on it in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher were sitting down, panting and trying to catch their breaths, they were almost as exhausted as Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Banagher said, still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're -pant- welcome.\" Audrey, completely exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's stomach gurgled sickly, which caught both teens' attention. All that running wasn't good for Audrey's poor belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need -pant- to throw up now.\" Audrey said, feeling all the food and drinks in her stomach starting to come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have -pant- a napkin?\" Banagher asked, they might have to share it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey realized that she didn't, she threw out the napkins that came with the hotdogs when she finished eating. If she threw up, she would have to show up to the mansion with vomit on her mouth or her clothes, and she wasn't going to ask for permission to vomit on Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold it down.\" Audrey answered.</span></div></div>",

And this wasn't even getting into how obnoxious he found partying with his classmates to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" Banagher paused for a moment to think. \"Got it's up and downs.

The two men that were accompanying her had already returned to the Garencieres, Marida had told Zinnerman that she would return when she had finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was enjoying quite a feast, her table was filled with hamburgers, fries, hot dogs, soda, pizza, and ice cream. For most people, this would be impossible to finish, but Marida wasn't like most people. She knew she was going to eat it all. Partially to comfort herself over losing Mineva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Marida was still going to eat everything, she didn't want to take too long to return, even if Zinnerman told her to take as much time as she wanted, she didn't want her gluttony keep her away from the Garencieres for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida decided that she would have to finish eating in an hour. So that meant she would have to eat five extra large hamburgers, three bags of french fries, seven hot dogs, a large pizza, and ten bowls of ice cream in an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began to tear into her food, wolfing down her meal as fast as she could. She started with a bowl of ice cream first, her favorite, occasionally taking a sip from her large soda. She finished it quickly enough, small remains of ice cream was now around her lips. Marida continued to dig in, now just shoving whatever she felt like eating into her greedy maw, not even finishing what she was eating before taking a bite from something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida later let out a loud belch, signaling that she had finished half of her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Marida said as a polite gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was her coat covered with sauce and icing, it was also getting unbearably tight. Marida unzipped her coat, then undid her belt, along with her pants' zipper and button, easing the pressure on her big tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida continued eating, more sauce and bits of ice cream continued to land on the redhead's large body, sometime even in her cleavage. Marida didn't care about how messy she was getting, she needed to eat and that was all that mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Marida had finally finished her feast. Marida let out an incredibly loud belch as she leaned back in her chair, hands on her big gut, feeling how hard and full it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.' Marida said, not understanding how pointless it was to bother excusing herself at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her belly was already big, Marida's gut was now absolutely huge, to the point of turning her shirt into a tube top. Marida had to admit that she was impressed, both with how much she manged to eat and by how large her belly was. Unfortunately, Marida had a massive stomachache from eating so quickly, but she wasn't going to let it keep her down, she just needed to rub her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a few minutes tending to her aching belly and belching, Marida heard a beeping noise come from her watch, it had been an hour since she started eating. Marida began to heave herself up from her chair, a task easier said then done. It was hard to resit the urge sit back down and wait for her tummy to digest her meal, but Marida knew that she would break the chair if she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida manged to finally get up after a dozen seconds of what felt like exercise to her. Marida took a moment to catch breath. She looked down at the orb of fat disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely going to have to start exercising again.\" Marida thought. \"I need to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began the arduous walk back to the Garencieres, rubbing her swollen tummy and belting out massive burps the whole time. She hoped that she would still fit in her normal suit, she needed to spend some time in zero gravity.</span></div></div>",

She's looked after me for a long time.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though she does feel like one. I never got to know my family.\" Audrey explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" Banagher said. \"I never know who my father was and my mother died a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had never opened up to anyone about his family. While he talked to Micott and Takuya about it, it was only once. He was bringing it up now because Audrey hurting as much as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both my parents died when I was very young.\" Audrey said. She wasn't sure if she wanted to get so personal with Banagher but it felt good to talk about it. \"Should we talk about something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's nice to talk about stuff like this. You're the only one I've ever opened up to about this.\" Banagher answered, happy that he finally found someone that would understand how he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Audrey and Banagher talked about their families, Micott and Takuya were having a field trip to the Snail along with their class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Banagher never showed, huh?\" Takuya said to Micott. They were both worried about Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Petit MS that crashed on our school campus, I hope that wasn\u2019t him.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't crash, that was a forced landing. We don\u2019t know why he did it, so we shouldn\u2019t be spreading rumors about him.  If he gets kicked out of school, he\u2019s gonna be living on the streets. It\u2019s not like he has a home to go back to.\" Takuya replied. \"If he doesn't show up today, then we'll go look for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't stop me if you tried Takuya.\" Micott said before looking through her binoculars. She was still worried but she might as well try to enjoy the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon noticed two figures walking together. She zoomed-in, revealing them to be Banagher and a girl she didn't recognize. They were even holding hands as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher?!\" Micott exclaimed. \"Who's that girl he\u2019s with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with her gut?\" Micott mentally added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Takuya said, grabbing the binoculars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was very confused. Is Banagher into fat chicks? Is that why he ignored her this morning?  She was going to have a talk with him when he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see he's okay.\" Takuya said, relieved. \"Something wrong Micott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. I'm just wondering who that girl is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out soon soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott wondered if Banagher really was into fatties. If that was the case, then maybe she would put on a few pounds herself. She could definitely make being fat work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wanted to know about that girl. He couldn't have known her for more then a few hours but they already seemed like close friends. While she wasn't sure if she trusted her, it was nice to see Banagher talk to someone new.</span></div></div>",

Haro!\" Haro exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey chuckled. \"I can see why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been upgrading him since middle school.\" Banagher said. \"That's why I'm into electronics. Sometimes I think about playing the piano like my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play the violin. I could show you when this is all over.\" Audrey suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I can play as well as I can eat.\" Audrey said as she gave her belly a little shake. She was still a little embarrassed but Banagher was helping her feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can play even better.\" Banagher assured. \"Any friends you'd like to introduce me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never had any.\" Audrey said. \"I was sheltered so I never got to know anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher felt sorry for her. While he was always a little shy he still had Micott and Takuya to talk with. Audrey must feel so lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have me.\" Banagher said, smiling. \"I'm you're friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher,\" Audrey replied. A warm smile on her face. \"Thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher could reply, tremors interrupted them as the builder unit moved back, the colony starting to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The walls of the colony grow as more and more foundation blocks are added.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" Audrey said. \"The world itself is growing\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly a breathtaking sight for them. This wasn't the first time Banagher had seen it but watching the colony grow with Audrey had caused him to see it in a different light. It was a sight that they would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally reached the mansion. Their journey was coming to an end. Or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s it.\" Audrey said, both of them staring at the sight before them. \"I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s really a mansion out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began walking towards it when Audrey realized that she needed to ask Banagher a very important question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, wait!\" Audrey said as they stopped walking. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my belly any smaller? Do you think I can cover it now? Maybe I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being kinda weird, Audrey.\" Banagher was caught off-guard by Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a loud sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Audrey admitted. \"I just want to look presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be yourself.\" Banagher said. \"That's how we became friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey accepted Banagher's advice. She nodded before they continued walking to the front door. \"Be yourself\". Audrey felt like she was in a whole different world. One where she had a friend. One where she was herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reached the front door. Audrey realized that when they went through it, they would be at her world and she would be Mineva Lao Zabi again. Her heart began pounding, she felt like she was about to lose everything. She felt like she was about to lose Banagher. When this day began, she would've abandoned Banagher when she didn't need him anymore. Now she couldn't imagine doing such a thing. She needed him and she wanted him to need her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher knocked. There was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe no one's home.\" Audrey said. The deal wasn't going to be held for a few more hours so it's possible that the man she was looking for wasn't here. At least that meant she would be with Banagher longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear a piano?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Audrey said. All she could hear was a few birds chirping. \"I don't hear anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher ignored her and entered the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us! Is anyone here?\" Audrey said as she followed him into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked up the stairs. Audrey blushed as her belly jiggled with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher entered the room the stairs led too. He couldn't explain it but he felt drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, you can\u2019t just\u2026\" Audrey stopped as saw the beautiful sight that stood before them. The room had six tapestries in it. They should be related works as the base colors and structures of all these works were the same. They had a woman standing at the middle of a garden with flowers and animals woven in them. The imaginary world the woman was in would remind one of a small outer space. There were two beasts on both sides, and the completely different parties created 6 scenes. Amongst the two beasts, one of them was a lion, and the other one was one with the body of a horse and a long thin horn on its head\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A unicorn\u2026\" Audrey muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who was taking fruits from the tray the maidservant was holding; the woman playing the harp at the table; the woman making a crown of flowers. The woman who let the unicorn rest on her knees and looked at the mirror; the woman holding a flag with a moon on it; and last of all, a woman standing in front of a small tent, putting her jewellery into a box a maidservant's holding. The unicorn and the lion were on both sides of the tent, and the woman who looked like she was putting her jewellery away was entering a tent. The tent had the words 'A Mon de D\u00e9sir' written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my only desire\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read all of that?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember this.\" Banagher said. \"I\u2019ve seen this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've seen it too.\" Audrey said. \"What's it's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady and the Unicorn.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two continued to enjoy the painting, it was beautiful. Audrey gently grabbed Banagher's hand. She couldn't put it into words but it just felt right. She felt Banagher hold her hand, she could tell that he was feeling tense. He needed someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, do you like The Lady and the Unicorn? I do!\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" Banagher said. \"'To my only desire.' The beast of possibility... The symbol of hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice quote. Did you come up with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it just sorta came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave a little smile. It was weird, how Audrey made Banagher feel, a warmness permeating his heart that he didn\u2019t get from most other people. The closest was Micott, but even that was different than what Audrey made him feel. It was almost as if she was helping to fuel his happiness and confidence, which he was tremendously grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that that\u2019d be very important later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to enjoy the painting. Eventually, a loud yawn filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Audrey said, blushing. \"I'm feeling kinda sleepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you've eaten yourself into a food coma.\" Banagher said, a friendly smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's when you eat so much you fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I did eat a lot.\" Audrey said as looked down at her filled up tummy, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling pretty sleepy myself.\" Banagher said before yawning. \"Do you want to lay down for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well, yes. But I don't know where we could sleep. This isn't our house after all.\" Audrey said, concerned with being polite, as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone will mind if we sleep in the guest room.\" Banagher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, we'll pass out on the floor if we don't get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey replied, taking Banagher's joke completely seriously. \"Alright, you've convinced me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher soon found themselves a room. Much like the rest of the mansion, it was filled with incredibly expensive furniture. Despite this, everything looked like it hadn't been used in a long time, yet the room was still clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a pretty nice room.\" Banagher said as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My room is kinda like it.\" Audrey instantly realized she said too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is your family rich or something?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was having difficulty coming up with what to say. She had to tell Banagher something but she didn't know what. She couldn't tell him that her family wasn't rich, she just admitted to have a fancy and expensive bedroom. And she obviously couldn't tell him that she was the princess of Zeon. Audrey really wished she could just tell Banagher the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well, I'm rich. I mean! My family is rich. But you know, it's not a whole lot of money. I mean, it is but that's not my opinion.\" Audrey twiddled her fingers and tried to avoid looking at Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Audrey. You don't need to tell me anything.\" Banagher said, a little smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at Banagher and breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher laid down on the bed, letting out a sigh in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so nice to relax after everything.\" Banagher said. He noticed that Audrey was staring at him and seemed nervous. \"Is something wrong, Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" Audrey was blushing. \"I-I've never shared a bed with someone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher immediately started blushing. He hadn't realized just how intimate he was getting with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I-I haven't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both silent for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, w-what should I take off?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just your shoes.\" Banagher said. \"A-And your coat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed as she took off her coat and shoes. While she wasn't revealing anything other then her bloated gut to Banagher, she still felt nervous. Banagher blushed just as much as Audrey as he removed his jacket and shoes. He was just as nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher then laid down in bed together, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh. Do we talk and stuff?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you-If you want.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey came up with a conversation starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your favorite video game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Dangan Ronpa. Have you heard of it?\" Banagher asked, excited to geek out with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have. Tell me about it.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about a group of special high school students that are trapped in a school called Hope's Peak Academy by a teddy bear called Monokuma. And the only way anyone can get out is if they kill someone and don't get caught.\" Banagher said as if it was the most normal thing ever. \"After every murder, a class trial is held between the survivors who investigate the case then vote on who they think the murderer is. If they get it right, then the murderer is executed. But if they get it wrong, then the murderer \"graduates\" and is allowed to leave the school, while everyone else is executed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty interesting, Banagher.\" Audrey said. It sounded complicated to her but it still sounded like a good story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I told you a little too much at once. Heh heh.\" Banagher said with a goofy smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'd actually like to know more about Dangan Ronpa. Can you tell me about the characters?\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Their all really great. My favorite is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to geek out together. After a while, Audrey started giggling profusely, truly enjoying the time she was spending with Banagher. However, she felt a bit of a disturbance within her gut, a gurgling that forced her to put a hand on her stomach in shame. This attracted the attention of Banagher, much to the young woman's' embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong, Audrey?\" he asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, I just -UUURRRP!\" she belched out, growing red in the face. \"Excuse m-me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Do you want a belly rub?\" Banagher asked, a nervous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes please!\" Audrey said, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey moaned in satisfaction as Banagher began rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. UUURRRP! Excuse me!\" Audrey said as she and Banagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're excused.\" Banagher said as he continued to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher continued to geek out for several hours. It was actually starting to get quite tiring, forcing the two teens to start drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey woke up a few hours later, stretching and yawning. She wasn't sure how long she'd been conked out, but looking out the window, she could see the Sun was setting She looked over at Banagher, who hadn't yet woken up. He looked so cute sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Audrey realized that her meal had an effect on her, and not in a good way. Her stomach, which used to be completely flat, now had a fair amount of pudge to it, filling a little bit of her lap. There weren't any rolls or anything to speak of, but it was certainly straining the hem of her pants quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were a tad fuller as well, feeling somewhat snug against her bra, and they rested on the creamy flesh that made up her stomach. Audrey always had a respectable chest, but it had just gotten a little bigger with all the calories she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were thicker, not enough to touch yet, but getting there, and they were connected to meaty thighs. They seemed to jiggle quite a bit more when she moved them, to which she was quite embarrassed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was fuller too, no doubt due to influence from her legs, and it was filling up her mattress more than the young princess would care to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face hadn\u2019t actually seen much change (granted, she couldn\u2019t tell anyways), although her cheeks were just a little bit fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face was beet red as she looked over how much weight she had gained. She had no idea how she was going to lose this fat. A loud yawn interrupted her thoughts. Banagher was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Audrey.\" Banagher said as he stretched.</span></div></div>",

He wanted to say something to help her feel better but he knew it was better to not say anything for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh.\" Banagher sheepishly scratched the back of his head. \"That guy you're looking for should be here now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Audrey replied. \"His name is Cardeas Vist. He's in charge of the Vist Foundation. Do you want to meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Banagher said, a sweet smile on his face. \"I'm probably out of my league. But I want to be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher.\" Audrey was smiling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt her belly jiggle as she and Banagher walked back to the room with the painting, catching both of their attention. Audrey's face was beet red. Banagher decided to start some small talk to help Audrey get her mind off of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh. Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes I did. I even had a dream about us.\" Audrey's eyes instantly widened when she realized what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I actually dreamed about us too.\" Banagher was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is t-t-that so? Well, umm, what was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was us y-you know, going to school together and hanging out after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that so?\" Audrey asked, caught off-guard. \"Because, honestly, that was the same type of dream I had. But that seems incredibly coincidental...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are having a good time together.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey said. \"It was a nice dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was.\" Banagher said. They were both smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered the room with the painting. It appeared that no one had entered the room since they left it. Banagher and Audrey looked at The Lady and the Unicorn. It felt so familiar to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen this before.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interested in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice interrupted their thoughts, startling them. The two teens turned around and saw a man standing at the door. He looked at Audrey, who was frozen, and again looked back at Banagher. The man slowly entered the room. Banagher felt the pressure in the room get even more intense. He subconsciously took two steps back, when Audrey grabbed his hand. They both looked at each other, ready to talk with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady and the Unicorn\". It\u2019s a tapestry believed to have been created in France before the middle era. And it\u2019s no replica. My predecessors went through a great deal of trouble to acquire it prior to the One Year War. I\u2019m head of the family, Cardeas Vist. This is my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must apologize for coming into your home without permission.\" Audrey said. \" My name is\u2026 Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m aware of who you are.\" Cardeas stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we\u2019ll skip the formality.\" Audrey said. \"As long as you understand my position, that\u2019s all that really matters. I\u2019ve come here to ask you to rethink this course of action. I\u2019m referring to Laplace's Box and your plan to hand it over to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas turned his attention to Banagher. \"I think you had better leave.\" Banagher felt nervous but he would never abandon Audrey. Cardeas immediately returned speaking to Audrey. \"It\u2019s too dangerous. We shouldn\u2019t be talking under these circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zinnerman is a rational man. He wouldn\u2019t cause trouble unnecessarily.\" Audrey replied. She noticed that Cardeas seem annoyed at her attempt to get him to reconsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you consider your protection unnecessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was beginning to get annoyed at Cardeas' attempt at dodging her questions. She hadn't gained weight just to be dismissed. Banagher noticed that her hands were trembling slightly. Unable to understand what they were saying, all Banagher could do was stare at them as they talked. Just as he thought, he was out of his league. But he was determined to stay with Audrey until this was over. And after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" She began. \"Why are you doing this? I've heard that Laplace's Box has guaranteed the prosperity of the Vist Foundation for decades. Why give it to us now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Cardeas avoided her questions. He faced Banagher. \"Excuse me. You\u2019ve been asked to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are people after her.\" Banagher wasn't going to leave Audrey, no matter who asked him to. \"I won\u2019t leave her alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have the slightest idea who they are or what they want with her for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Banagher immediately answered. \"I don't, but I know that I should to be with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel that he should still be here, 'Audrey'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Audrey was furious at Cardeas for dismissing her after coming all this way, her anger was immediately replaced by fear and anxiety. She had no idea what to say. Audrey didn't want to put Banagher at risk but she also needed to be with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I-I-I, he doesn't have to be h-here if h-he doesn't want to. Y-You can go home if you want, B-B-Banagher. I'll c-catch up with you.\" Audrey stammered. \"T-Thanks for everything B-Banagher. It-It was really c-cool. And I'm going to s-shut up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Banagher would've given a friendly laugh and Audrey would've too, but the brunette knew that Audrey needed to hear what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, I can still help. You came here to prevent a war, didn\u2019t you? And doesn\u2019t he have the power to do something about that? Hearing you talk about the war is so different from hearing my professors talk about it. More grave. You've made me see how bad it would be. So please, let me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... My heart was pounding when I saw you fall from the sky this morning. Everything that felt off in my life just slid into place. For the first time in my life I knew what I was suppose to do. I don\u2019t care who you are! Just say that you need me and I'll... Just tell me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey took a deep breath. She had her answer. Banagher's words made her realize that no matter where they are going, they were going together.</span></div></div>",

He knew that Audrey understood the situation and he trusted her to make the right choice but he still wanted to sate his thoughts. \"We went through a lot to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned her gaze to Cardeas, her face looking very serious. \"I urge you to rethink the consequences of what you're about to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concern about this\" Cardeas responded. \"You\u2019re not wrong. I\u2019m aware that Full Frontal is being called the second coming of Char and not to be taken lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you--?!\" Audrey was then cut off by Cardeas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it\u2019s not that simple.\" Cardeas stated. \"Even if given the key, it will still take someone qualified to open Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laplace's Box?\" Banagher thought. It felt familiar to him but he didn't know anything about it. In fact, he didn't know anything about what Audrey said could cause a war. While he knew that she was correct, he still would like to know what is going on. Banagher decided to ask Audrey exactly what the situation is after she was done talking with Cardeas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key to the Box?\" Audrey asked, almost as confused as Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have taken steps to create something that will ensure that this is no easy horse to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I doubt things will go as you say, it seems our business here is done for now.\" Audrey faced Banagher again. \"Banagher, let's leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" Banagher said as they began walking out of the room. Neither of them had any idea where they were even going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can arrange transport for you both to Banagher's class.\" Cardeas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would appreciate that. Thank you.\" Audrey said as she and Banagher continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey were both silent as they walked out of the mansion. Banagher had trouble deciding to what to say. He had never seen Audrey this mad before. Even during their confrontation with Marida, the blonde wasn't like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sat down on a bench near the mansion's gates. She gave a sigh before looking at Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to you had to see me like that, Banagher.\" The blonde apologized. \"I didn't mean to get so upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize.\" Banagher said as he sat next to her. \"I'm a little angry myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm not sure if I made the right choice.\" Audrey said. \"Do you think I did?\" This was the first time Audrey had ever asked someone if she did the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did.\" Banagher assured. \"There wasn't anything we could do there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Audrey said. \"Thanks, Banagher. I needed to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this whole time that you would make the right choices\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't help by smile at this. A blush quickly appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Banagher nervously scratched the back of his head, trying to word his question in a way that wouldn't seem awkward. \"What's Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a powerful relic.\" Audrey answered. \"I don't know what exactly it is. Only that it has the power to destroy the Earth Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a a small pause as Banagher contemplated what Audrey told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does-Does anyone know what it is?\" Banagher knew he was getting involved in something dangerous but having it confirmed made his heart beat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a select few in the Vist Foundation and the Earth Federation.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that key that guy mentioned?\" Banagher had a feeling that it was more then just some simple key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Audrey said. \"This is the first time I've ever heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher and Audrey could continue their conversation, they heard a car pull up to the mansion's gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like it's time to leave.\" Banagher remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens got up and walked towards the limo parked near the gates. Banagher stopped and looked back the Vist foundation mansion. Audrey noticed this and walked back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" She asked. Banagher had been acting a little odd since they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. I'm fine. Let's go.\" The brunette stated as he walked towards the limo with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached their destination nighttime had arrived. Banagher's class was currently staying at a hotel. The limo left almost as soon as the brunette and blonde stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could've at least waited until we checked in with your class.\" Audrey thought out loud. \"Yes I'm aware of the irony of asking for politeness after belching so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda charming.\" Banagher said. \"Uh, that could've been worded better. Heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should burp a little more then!\" Audrey joked. They both burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how you feel about being in the same class?\" Banagher asked as he and Audrey walked into the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm feeling a little nervous.\" Audrey admitted. \"More then a little nervous, actually. I know the driver said that your teacher has been told that I'm a new transfer student but do you think this will work? I don't even have a uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been through harder stuff.\" Banagher said. Pushing Marida's incredibly obese body certainly was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey said. \"But what about your classmates? I don't think I'll fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Banagher said. \"We're friends and the first thing you did when we met was tackle me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I apologized for that.\" Audrey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't?! Please forgive me, Banagher! I-I owe you an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a small laugh, which confused the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did! I'm just messing with you. Sorry.\" Banagher had a small grin on his face, though his apology was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed before laughing herself. \"Alright, you got me.\" Even she couldn't help but enjoy Banagher's little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to chat as they headed to the top of the hotel. Which they had been told was were most of his class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, Banagher noticed that the only one missing was his teacher, Mr. Bancroft. He wasn't surprised. After all, the class was already under the hotel staff's supervision and he did need to take breaks from looking after his students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see Micott and Takuya?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Their right over there.\" Banagher said as he directed Audrey's attention to the table where they were sitting. \"Ready to meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you don't tell them about how much I've been eating and burping.\" Audrey joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret's safe with me!\"</span></div></div>",

She recognized her as the girl she saw Banagher with when she and Takuya accidentally spied on them, though her stomach was much smaller now. While she was glad to see that Banagher was okay, she was worried about his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name's Audrey. We just met today.\" Banagher answered as he and Audrey took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just transferred to your class.\" Audrey said.

Why did you trust her so easily? She's probably one of those people that think the Federation is evil or whatever.\" Micott said, puffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot, idiot.\" Haro muttered in Banagher's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Micott. Just be glad that Icarus is safe.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icarus?\" Banagher and Audrey uttered, blinking in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya turned his laptop's screen towards the two, revealing that it had the front page of the \"Daily 7\", a news site that Anaheim Electronics run. Banagher and Audrey saw the photo of the Torohachi in the lawn and the headline \"The Icarus that challenged the Artificial sun sadly fell onto the park\", and immediately turned off the webpage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher groaned in both annoyance and embarrassment. Audrey wasn't familiar with normal lives but even she could tell that anyone in Banagher's situation would cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Icarus is a Greek deity, r-right?\" Audrey attempted to comfort Banagher. \"Granted, he's most famous for falling due to his hubris but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you two do after crashing?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey told me she had to meet with Cardeas Vist to prevent the war.\" Banagher explained, both to inform his friends on what happened and to get away from the Icarus subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the chairman of our school, right?\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He lives inside the Snail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would someone as big as him live in a place like this?\" Micott asked, finding the idea hard to believe. \"The chairman\u2019s just a title to him. He never even appeared in the graduation ceremonies before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I actually heard about him having a house over there.\" Takuya interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Audrey said. \"We got to talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it go?\" Micott asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey exchanged a brief glance before sinking in their chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, uh, didn't really do much there.\" Banagher stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did learn a little more about the situation.\" Audrey noted. \"But, uh, that's pretty much it.\" The blonde didn't want to bring up the belly rub Banagher gave her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"At least the bed was comfy. And we saw a nice painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott groaned. \"Let's talk about this tomorrow. I'm going to get a snack, you guys want anything?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours earlier, before Banagher and Audrey had their nap, Marida finally reached the Garencieres after a while of waddling. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the ship, carrying around such a large, stuffed belly was exhausting and the tummyache she had wasn't helping. After such a long and tiring day, Marida just wanted to relax in the Kshatriya, rub her aching belly as it digests her massive meal, and belch out some of the gas in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reporting to Zinnerman, Marida went to her room on the Garencieres to put on her normal suit. Before she put it on, the redhead held it in front of her, reflecting on how she had gotten so fat that her normal suit had to resized. She sighed, this was embarrassing. She was relived to see that it still fit her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida then left the ship to enter the Kshatriya. Whilst Zinnerman (along with a few others as back up) went to negotiate with Cardeas, the fat redhead was to wait in there, ready to sortie in case a fight occurred. Being in zero gravity felt so relieving to Marida, she felt much better now that her big belly didn't weigh her down. When she was in zero gravity was the only time when Marida would feel like her old self, before she had gained so much weight. While she still had a big gut, large boobs, a fat ass, and a chubby face among other things, she could move like she used to, she didn't have to worry about her weight slowing her down. And it felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily maneuvered her way into the Kshatriya's cockpit. While Marida wasn't fat enough that she got stuck, she wondered if she would ever gain enough weight that she would. Her pilot's chair had already been resized to accommodate her massive girth. Piloting a mobile suit was something Marida's weight never got in the way of, which she took solace in. On the battlefield of mobile suits, a pilot isn't skinny or obese, a pilot is lucky or unlucky. While she didn't want to fight, the battlefield was a place where she could be herself. There she wasn't Marida, the gluttonous fatass, she was Marida, the soldier of Zeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida rubbed her bloated belly as she belted out powerful belches. She looked over her body, it was embarrassing how fat she had gotten. She remembered the first time her belly had broken one of her belts. At this point, she had lost track of many belts her fat gut had broken. As soon as this mission was over she was going to start working out. Marida unleashed a massive burp. It was weird burping inside of her helmet. The obese redhead thought about how her attempt to retrieve Mineva had gone. She hated how her weight had affected her performance but she wondered if she truly would've won had she still been slim. The boy who was with Mineva had proven to be a surprisingly capable opponent. He was able to fend off two grown men and Marida herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead released another loud burp, easing the pressure in her big tummy. As she continued to burp, Marida wondered what the relationship between Mineva and the boy was. They seemed to be friends and trusted each other immensely. Somehow, despite being her opponent today, Marida trusted the boy to protect Mineva. She hoped that they were both okay, while they should both be at the mansion, where both Zinnerman and Cardeas would see to their safety, what if they weren't? If they were somewhere else, then Marida would immediately head out to look for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt herself begin to drift off into sleep. She wasn't surprised, eating so much food would make anyone sleepy. She continued to tend to her aching belly as it became harder and harder to keep her eyes open. Marida closed her eyes, she could use a nap after today. Marida unleashed a massive belch. There was only one thing on her mind as she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, keep Mineva safe.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the present time, Marida had just woken up. She stretched and gave a big yawn. The fat pilot looked down at her large stomach and ran a hand over it. Her gigantic meal had been digested, adding even more pounds to her already massive body. She would have to weigh herself after the mission. At least her stomach didn't hurt anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Marida just had wait for her orders. While she was a very patient woman, she would often enjoy a snack while she waited. It was actually part of the reason she had gotten so fat. She was going to be sitting around for a while anyways, so why not eat a burger or two? Marida actually felt a little peckish. While she wasn't so hungry that she wanted to devour a massive feast like earlier, she could use a little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that a small box was floating around her cockpit. Odd, she hadn't asked for anything. Upon closer exception, she noticed that there appeared to be a letter attached to the front of it and a large bottle of water on the side of it with, a few cans of soda next to it. She plucked it out of the air and read the letter's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push yourself too hard.<br>\r\n    Zinnerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd please stop calling me master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was far from the first time Zinnerman had told Marida to not call him master. A smile graced Marida's face, she was truly lucky to know Zinnerman. She opened the box to discover that it contained some hamburgers, just what she needed. The redhead happily began chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit into her meal, however, Marida felt an odd sensation. She stopped eating, something felt wrong to her, like something bad was about to happen.  She wasn't sure what was the cause of it but it made her feel uneasy. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat. She remained alert and returned to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Audrey and Banagher were happily chatting with Takuya and Micott. Audrey was reading a mobile suit magazine that Takuya usually read. It felt kinda weird to her to realize that despite her attempts to prevent war, she knew very little about the machines used in war. Before today, the only things the blonde princess knew about mobile suits is that they were incredibly large, humanoid machines used to wage war and that there's a special type of mobile suit called a Gundam that was a symbol of hope for the Federation. She didn't even know what a \"Jegan\" was before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything you like?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I like the ReZEL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's got a pretty nice design, which isn't too surprising, given that it's based off the Zeta Gundam.\" Takuya stated. \"What's your favorite mobile suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually only recently got interested in this stuff.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever need someone to give you an introduction, you've got me.\" Takuya boasted with a confident grin. \"I bet I could tell you all about nearly every mobile suit there is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you for the offer.\" Audrey was actually caught a little off guard by Takuya's enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she's as much of a geek as you are, Takuya.\" Micott teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of mobile suits, I actually saw a new one this morning.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this caught Takuya's interest, as well as Micott's and Audrey's to a lesser extant. \"No way! Where did you see it?\" Takuya enthusiastically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at the museum, right after we saw the Zaku.\" The brunette clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it look like?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get a good look at it but it was white and it had a horn.\" Somehow when Banagher saw it, the painting at the mansion flashed through his mind. As did images of his mother playing the piano and a man whose face he couldn't see.\"It's like it was a Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, was that the \"unicorn\" you spaced out over?\" Micott said in an annoyed tone. The face she was making wasn't too different from the one she made when Banagher stopped listening to her in the middle of a conversation this morning. The only way this could've seemed even more stupid to her would be if Banagher tried to convince he saw an actual Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry about that.\" Banagher said with a nervous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's a Gundam?\" Audrey asked. Ironically, despite being the princess of Zeon, Audrey was fascinated by Gundams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. It didn't have the V Fin but who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a V Fin?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Audrey, you've got a lot to learn.\" Takuya said in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt a chill overcome her massive body. She felt the cry of her fellow soldier, Savior. It\u2019s the cry someone makes before their life is extinguished. She shifted uncomfortably in her chair, griping the controls harder. Marida grunted as she felt the hanger shake, she heard a distant explosion. She trembled as that horrifying chill passes through her body. \"Don\u2019t get swallowed by this,\" Marida told herself. \"I can't let myself get distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, what the hell was that?\" Gilboa said from the Garencieres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gilboa, have you heard from the Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost the connection. The Minovsky particles are getting denser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we engage inside the colony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemy has surrounded the colony. Our only option is to cut straight through, find the Captain, and get the hell out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that.\" Marida didn't want to fight in a civilian area, but she had to save Zinnerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she headed out, Marida figured she should probably finish eating first. She wolfed down the rest of her burger and then chugged the rest of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida Cruz, Kshatriya, heading out! UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Marida felt a sharp killing intent. \"The enemy's here.\" The Kshatriya then launches it's Funnels, the 2m-long attack drones then exited the port and aimed in multiple directions at an unaware Jegan that was guarding the entrance as he and his companions prepared to enter. The funnels then each simultaneity fired a shot into the Jegan's cockpit, killing the pilot and destroying the mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Funnels returned to her, Marida launched the Kshatriya and then used the Funnels to blow a hole in the gateway leading into the colony. While she was very capable soldier, the redhead couldn't fight that many at once with them all surrounding her and she was well aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hotel, Audrey, Banagher, Micott, and Takuya were still causally chatting, completely unaware of the fighting going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, we're going to a party on Saturday, you wanna join us, Audrey?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...\" Audrey had never been asked to go to a party, or anything social before she met Banagher. \"I appreciate the offer but I've never been to one before, I'm not sure if I would fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Audrey.\" Banagher said. Inwardly, he thought about how ironic it was for him to say that, given how miserable his time at a school party was the last time Micott and Takuya dragged him to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just stick with us and you'll be fine.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're going there anyways, I suppose I should tag along.\" Audrey stated. \"Thanks, everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. So other then mobile suits, what are you into?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey placed a finger to her head and closed her eyes, seemingly lost in thought. Banagher was curious himself to see what she\u2019d say, since he\u2019d only known her for a short time, himself. A few moments later, the blonde opened her eyes and gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose the entertainment around here has fascinated me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher happily said. He couldn't wait to show Audrey some video games. \"Are you feeling up to a look at some of the stuff at my place later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at him, surprised at first, before she let out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sounds like fun, thank you Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Banagher's classmates that were walking not far from them noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tom, what do you think that is?\" One of Banagher's classmates asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back there, what's that?\" Micott said. She spotted what appeared to be a light in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others turned their attention to what Micott was referring to, as did the rest of the class. Audrey recognized the sight, it was the thrusters of a distant mobile suit, Marida's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida had the Kshatriya uses the thrusters on it's binders to dodge the beams coming at her, causing her gut to jiggle and bounce with every movement. three of the Kshatriya's Funnels then fired at a Jegan from multiple directions, one shot pierced it's right leg, another struck an area next to the cockpit, and one priced the cockpit, killing the pilot. Unfortunately, without the pilot to keep the mobile suit flying, it fell down towards the town and soon hit the side of a highway, it exploded as soon as it made contact. The debris rained down on the unsuspecting civilians, injuring and killing some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida angrily gripped the Kshatriya's controls harder, her anger at what had happened clear on her pudgy face. She knew that civilian casualties were inevitable in war but she hated it so much when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting raged on. A ReZEL Commander Type was forced by Marida to crash on to the roof of Banagher's school. The pilot was protected by the safety airbags and saved from a concussion, and in his groggy vision, glared at the enemy suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned Zeon monster!\"  The pilot resumed firing at Marida, determined to still aid his allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Marida grunted, her stomach hurt. Piloting a mobile suit wasn't good for a full stomach. While she wasn't stuffed, there was still a lot of food in her sloshing belly. Still, she remained focus on combat. As she dodged the shots the downed ReZEL fired at her, Marida felt a chill from not just the the enemy pilot's intent to kill but also his hatred, causing goosebumps to appear over her massive body. Marida kept her eyes on her opponents as she released the Kshatriya's Funnels, she noticed that one of them was missing, there should be three of them, she only saw two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senses and radar alerted her that the third enemy was behind her and was nearly in range to strike her with his beam saber. The other ReZEL still in the air fired his Beam Gun at the Kshatriya which dodged the shots. A ReZEL then swung it's beam saber over it, the Kshatriya countered the attack with it's own beam saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off my \u2013UUURRRP- back!\" Marida burped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese pilot then had the Kshatriya slash off the ReZEL's right arm. The ReZEL fired it's Vulcan Guns at the Kshatriya, which then broke the blue mobile suit's visor with one of the Sub-Arms hidden in the binders. The Sub-Arm then tore the beam saber from the severed arm and gave it to the Kshatriya's left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So \u2013UURRAAP- heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya was now wielding two beam sabers. A ReZEL then fired at the Kshatriya with it's Beam Rifle, the green mobile suit dodging each shot and closing in, it's chubby pilot intending on destroying the ReZEL with it's Beam Sabers. The Federation pilot then switched his rifle to emit a beam saber, which he used to clash with the Kshatriya's. Marida made the Kshatriya impale the ReZEL from above, killing the pilot. She left the weapon in the mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had to deal with the mobile suit on the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll shut you down! UURRP!\" Marida sent three Funnels at the downed ReZEL that was still firing at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swept down to the Federation mobile suit and open fire. One shot hits the cockpit in the center abdomen, one shot hits the mechanical arm with the beam rifle, the ReZEL is down. However, the last hit pierces through the thruster pack from the side, hitting the small reactor core hidden inside. A nuclear explosion occurs, lighting the night sky of Industrial 7 like a miniature sun. Marida leaves the area, ashamed that she was so careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and his class saw the fighting and the damage it caused. The fear was obvious in their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are holes in the colony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, isn't that around where the school is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is war.\" Takuya ominously stated. His friends turned their heads towards him. \"This is the beginning of a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A war...\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, I need to go back to the mansion.\" Audrey suddenly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cardeas said that he has the key to Laplace's Box. I need to know what has happened to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's dangerous, Banagher but whatever Laplace's Box is I have to make sure it never falls into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher shook his head in frustration. \"Let's make sure everyone gets somewhere safe first, okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class made their way to the doors that led from the Snail to the colony. However, the doors were shut and there was no response to their pleas to open the doors. Banagher walked over to the access point on their side that was away from the rest to the class and attempted to open the doors with it, Audrey, Takuya, who was holding Haro, and Micott, with him. Banagher pressed the button for access, but the passage point seemed to be locked, and there didn't seem to be any reaction from the number lock. The brunette hit the machine in frustration. A look of worry was on Takuya's face, as well as Micott's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, open the doors!\" Takuya shouted, anger clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher somehow sensed that a nearby mobile suit was about a fire, a chill came over him. He looked behind him and saw a stray shot heading towards the doors. The shot hit where the rest of Banagher's class was. The impact shook the area and sent a powerful gust of wind towards them. Banagher grabbed Micott and held her close to him, shielding her from the harsh wind. When the gust was gone Banagher looked at where his class was, he didn't see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya dashed towards a Jegan and slashed it half with it's Beam Saber. The large mobile suit then moved towards the top of where the doors once stood and began to cut a hole through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida!\" Audrey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Banagher,\" Takuya began as he stood from the spot he took cover in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at Audrey and then Takuya, he was so glad to see that they were alright. However, he and Audrey then saw the doors begin to grow bright red as heat over took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Micott, you're not hurt, are you? What about the othe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya was cut off as Banagher and Audrey forced him and Micott down. A red beam destroyed the door. It was a shot from the Mega Beam Launcher of a ReZEL Commander Type that was in it's Waverider mode. It quickly passed through the hole took out it's Beam Saber. It then fired two grenades form it's Grenade Launcher. The Kshatriya dodged the shots but was forced to retreat as the ReZEL got closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, Banagher, and Takuya watched, they were rendered speechless by how close they were to the fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Micott was horrified by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esther, Marco, Dennis, Tom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was slowly moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott!\" Banagher grabbed Micott to keep her form going anywhere on her own as it was still too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott began sobbing. Audrey was filled with guilt. She knew that the wars Zeon started killed many innocent people, but this was the first time she had ever seen it and the effect it had on their friends and families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I have to go.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Audrey couldn't believe what Banagher had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya, Audrey, take care of Micott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go back to the mansion. There's something very important there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, Banagher!\" Audrey interjected. \"I'm the one who will be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you risk your life for me. Far too many already have.\" Audrey said, sorrow evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, everything will be okay.\" The brunette said, a comforting smile gracing his face. Banagher's words somehow made Audrey feel confident that everything would be okay. She loved his smile so much. For most of her life, Audrey was rarely around people that would treat her like a person instead of a symbol. Banagher's smile was so open about their friendship, whenever she looked at his face, even now, she could tell that he was her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going to happen to me, I'll be back, I promise. Now please, look after Micott for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded. \"I will.\" She didn't want Banagher to leave but she trusted him to return safely. She knew he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Banagher turned his attention to Takuya. \"Takuya, did you recognize that mobile suit that just tore through here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like a Zeta-type transformable suit. I think it's from the Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then its mothership should be at the Snail. You have to get there. It can protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher very gently moved Micott into Takuya, who grabbed hold of her. Banagher then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go!\" Micott shouted. The brunette stood up. Takuya attempted to keep her from leaving. \"You can't leave me here. Please don't leave me! Banagher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I being too cold?\" Banagher thought to himself. \"Still, it's better that I go then Audrey. I don't know why but for some reason I want to go back there. I feel like... there's something there I missed. Something very important.\"</span></div></div>",

The ReZEL then closed in and struck it with it's Beam Saber, which clashed with the Kshatriya's own. Marida then had the Kshatriya grab the Federation mobile suit's face and then crashed it into the artificial sun. The Funnels destroyed it before it get up. With no enemies left in the immediate vicinity, Marida left the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher reached a lift that leads to the Snail and the battery for it was still running. As he was about to touch the control panel, the lift that was moving up let out a slight electronic sound and stopped in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it opened, a tall man with sideburns aimed his gun at Banagher, the teen instinctively closed his eyes braced himself for the shot that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shoot the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette opened his eyes and lowered his defenses, he saw a that there was another man, a bearded one wearing a thick trench coat. He could tell just from looking at them that they didn't belong to the Federation or the Vist Foundation, they were very clearly wearing regular clothes.  Unbeknownst to Banagher, this was Suberoa Zinnerman and his subordinate, Flaste. As they passed by him, Zinnerman then fired his pistol into the control panel, turning it nonoperational. He let go of the pistol, it was evidently out of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been able to get in touch with Marida?\" Zinnerman man asked Flaste as they left Banagher's vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida. He knew that girl, she was Audrey's friend, the one who attempted to bring her back, and the pilot of the green mobile suit that was destroying the Federation mobile suits. He would have to think about what this meant later, he needed to focus on finding another lift to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marida made her way through the Industrial Block, she soon spotted Audrey, who was carrying Haro along with two civilians she didn't recognize, Takuya and Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey somehow felt Marida saw her. She instinctively looked at the Kshatriya, she would recognize that mobile suit anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monoeye on the Kshatriya's head looked at Audrey as well as Micott and Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, why's it looking at us?\" Takuya uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marida could make an attempt to retrieve Audrey, a Loto, stepped out of it's hiding spot and fire it's Missile Launcher at Marida's mobile suit. This unit was piloted by Daguza Mackle, the commander of the Earth Federation Forces' ECOAS special forces team. The Kshatriya shielded itself with it's binders and manged to dodge a few shots. The dust from the explosions blinded Marida's vision, it wasn't a good idea to move as full speed while she couldn't see but she had no choice, the Federation unit would surely fire at her gain if she stayed still. Marida had the Kshatriya move upwards at north eastern angle, her vision locked on the Loto. This resulted in her crashing into the upper part of a wall, Daguza immediately fired again, had the Kshatriya not shielded itself in time, those shots would've caused massive damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had her gaze fixated on the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Micott shouted, snapping Audrey out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we've gotta get outta here!\" Takuya added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza exited the Loto and prepared to fire an anti-mobile suit bazooka at the Kshatriya. He already had the unit in his sights when it removed itself from the wall but he needed to ait for it to get closer before he could fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin in seconds, the Kshatriya launched it's Funnels and was now in range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza fired and the Kshatriya shielded itself, Marida expected it to be a regular missile but it wasn't. It detonated before it could make contact and disabled the Kshatriya's cameras. What was once was a clear image of Marida's surroundings was replaced by a blinding light. The tubby pilot grunted as she closed her eyes as the light was hurting them. Daguza immediately jumped off the Loto, and Marida's Funnels soon wildly fired, a beam pierced through the front of the Loto, evaporating the control zone and cutting through to the back. The Loto exploded and blew apart the armor on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal...\" Takuya uttered in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teens then noticed that the flaming debris of the Loto are heading towards them. They braced for the impact, Takuya held onto Micott tightly, whilst Audrey held Haro even closer, her eyes closed. Fortunately, a ReZEL knocked the debris away from them with it's shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're saved.\" Takuya uttered as he and Micott looked up at the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey heard those words, she opened her eyes and looked at their savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the second time I almost died today.\" Audrey thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Federation mobile suit. It's an RGZ-95. A ReZEL, Micott!\" Takuya continued. \"Hey, we're students at the Industrial College. They blew holes in the colony, so we escaped. Can you help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ReZEL's piloted exited the mobile suit's cockpit and turned off his helmet's visor. His name was Riddhe Marcenas. Audrey noticed that he seemed to have a pendent wrapped his wrist but he was too far away for her to see what it looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher continued his search for a lift that lead to the snail, he came across a room unlike any he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room was a white mobile suit being held in place by a box-shaped container cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it. Pure white armor, translucent visor at roughly where the eyes are, and protruding long horn on the forehead. This was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mobile suit he saw this morning at the museum. The cockpit at the abdomen was opened, as well as the cockpit's door. He floated up to the cockpit and stood at the edge of it, there was man in the cockpit whose back was facing him. Cardeas Vist. He noticed that Banagher was behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gael? You made it.\" Cardeas said as he turned around to discover that Gael wasn't there, Banagher was. \"It's you. Why are you here?\" His voice is different from the voice Banagher heard in the villa, and it seem that he\u2019s a changed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the key. Audrey said that it can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Banagher a second to processes what he was told. \"This is the key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It will lead it's chosen rider to Laplace's Box. This is the Unicorn Gundam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were planning on escaping in it, weren't you?!\" Banagher accused, his voice filled with rage and frustration at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I did, I wouldn't survive.\" The head of the Vist Foundation stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher slammed his fist against the side of the cockpit in frustration. \"What the hell's wrong with you?!\" He shouted, even he was surprised that he was letting out all his anger and frustrations. \"You act like you're so superior, but you can't do anything! Audrey came to you trying to stop this war from breaking out, and you had the power to do that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion occurred near the room and flames began to enter it but the two ignored it. Right now, they had to talk and nothing was going to prevent that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those people... they had plans for tomorrow... for next week... they had a future! They weren't supposed to die like this! I lost my mother, but it was different. This isn't the way people are supposed to die. It's wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People should be treated with dignity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas words resonated with Banagher. He looked as the man before slowly stood up, clutching a wound on his chest. \"We're supposed to respect one another's lives. But once we grow out of childhood, though we know better, we still cause meaningless bloodshed. We've done it to the Earth as well. We devoured the resources then sought out new frontiers to exploit in space. Humanity grew out of control and must endeavor to regain its dignity. We must revive the hope that was born one hundred years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through the potential that lies within, we will demonstrate the true power and compassion of humanity.\" Banagher didn't know why but somehow everything that was being said felt familiar to him. Even the words he just said felt like he had said them long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you still remember.\" Cardeas stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To transcend what is immediate and realize our god-like potential, the greatness within us that is, possible.\" Cardeas stuck his and out as he spoke and Banagher slowly grabbed it. You've come this far, but are you confident that your conviction will not waver? The weight of the burden she has to bear is immense. You'll need the resolve to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders if you go with her. Do you have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pondered his answer for a moment. \"I don't have confidence or resolve. All I know is that I need her to need me. I have to be with her. I have to help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas' clips curled up, and a smiling face was right in front of Banagher. It wasn't a wry smile nor a mocking smile, but a satisfied smile that was mixed with pride and some sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this.\"</span></div></div>",

The monitor's light flashes, and the words access authorized is shown on the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then sat in the chair and put his hands on the control sticks on both left and right side. A flashing light appeared and scanned Banagher and the data it collected on the monitor appeared. A silhouette of Banagher's body was there, the words \"Biometric Scan\" were to the right of it and \"Now Registering\" were to the left of it. The latter words soon changed to \"Complete\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've programmed it to respond to you and you alone.\" Cardeas explained. \"If you can prove yourself to be a suitable pilot, and I know you will, the Unicorn will grant you powers unrivaled And then show you the path to Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dark curse that has sentenced the Vist family to serve as its guardian for a hundred years. But if used properly, it can bring light to this Universal Century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna... your mother didn't want to see you fall victim to this curse, so she took you from me.\" Before now, Cardeas' words would've been nonsense to Banagher but somehow, everything felt like it make sense to him. it did make sense to him. \"She must hate me... as I'm sure you do as well. But now you must go. Fear not, If you trust in the possibility that lies within and try with all your might, the path will show itself to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas warmly placed a bloody hand on Banagher's cheek. Something he hadn't done in so long. Banagher placed his over Cardeas', it felt so familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's selfish. You can't say all that to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me.\" Cardeas said as he began to float away. His hand left Banagher's cheek, leaving a bloody hand print. \"I wanted more...so much...\" Banagher grabbed Cardeas' hand hoping to stay with him but he soon lost hold of him as Cardeas left the cockpit. A smile then appeared on Cardeas' face as he looked at Banagher. \"Banagher... My wish has finally come true, Anna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cockpit closed as the flames consumed Cardeas. Banagher fell back in the chair and placed a hand over his right eye. \"Father? Did I... Was he... My...\" An old memory resurfaced in Banagher's mind, an old memory of him leaving the mansion with is mother when he was little. The view of the surroundings the cockpit gave him vanished. Tears left Banagher's eyes as the truth set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, an image he knew every well appeared on the cockpit's screens, The Lady And The Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'To my only desire.' The beast of possibility... The symbol of hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father showed that picture and was the one who taught him the meaning behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father... Mother... Please forgive me, but I... I must go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grabbed the controls, he was ready. The Unicorn's eyes light up, giving a human feel to it. The restraints in the container left the mobile suit and the Unicorn began to step forward amidst the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven far away in palm of a ReZEL, Audrey could still feel Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida could feel Audrey as she made her way to the colony's exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot noticed that something that emerging from the flames nearby. It was a mobile suit, the Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did the machine come from?\" Marida thought. There was something about it that set her on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida released her Funnels and fired them at it, the Unicorn dodged the beams and charged at her. The Kshatriya took out it's Beam Saber but the Unicorn pushed against mobile suit and crushed the hand that held the Beam Saber, crushing the Beam Saber as well. With the strength of the Unicorn, Banagher knew that he could defeat the enemy in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... Get the hell outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe increased the Unicorn's thrusters to their maximum strength. The force was enough to active the Kshatriya's airbag, there was barely enough room in Marida's chair for both the airbags and her massive belly. It didn't take long for them to near the wall at the end of the tunnel. The Funnels fired a hold through it which the Unicorn forced the Kshatriya through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airbags in the Kshatriya's cockpit deflated back into their inactive form, allowing Marida to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida emitted a huge burp, the pressure from the airbags hitting her forced out the gas in her big belly. With the air pressure on the machine gone, Marida controlled the thrusters like she\u2019s launching and leaves the white mobile suit. Both mobile suits turned around so that they face each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's open!\" Marida released all twenty four of the Kshatriya's funnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pained at the sight, he didn't what to do. Suddenly, the display console immediately flashed the words NT-D, and the fixate equipped on the chair rest moved on its own as it clamps onto Banagher\u2019s head on both left and right side. Everything then began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Funnels simultaneously fired at the white mobile suit but the Unicorn was protected by it's I-Field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parts forming the shoulders of the Unicorn broke open from the gaps in the armor, and the sliding armor revealed a frame that\u2019s giving off red light. The same phenomenon happens with the legs, knees and thigh. The front armor of the waist and the torso open up as well, causing the Unicorn to look bigger. The red luminescent glow is becoming stronger, causing the bright patterns decorating the white mobile suit to become clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wrists slid, and two beam saber handles appeared at the back of it, hanging on the shoulders like a decoration. The one change that\u2019s most obvious however is the head. The part  like a mask opened, and the visor on the complex eye slid off, causing the Unicorn\u2019s face to look completely different. The one horn that\u2019s represent the unit splits in half and shows a V-shape, showing the main camera. The two cameras that are positioned like human eyes glowed, and the unit had a golden V-shaped horn on its forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn readied it's beam saber, Banagher was ready to defeat his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn board the Nahel Argama with Micott and Takuya, Audrey looked at the sight as she held Haro in her hands. She had seen this sight before, the mobile suit she saw was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Unicorn Gundam dashed towards the Kshatriya, destroying two Funnels along the way with a single slash of it's Beam Saber as if they were no threat at all. With the gap between the two suits quickly closing, Marida activated the Kshatriya's thrusters to get away, as the mobile suit wasn't designed for close combat and she wouldn't be able to use her Funnels on such a fast opponent before they managed to to strike her. But in spite of the the Kshatriya's increased speed, the Unicorn reached in a small matter of seconds. It slashed it's Beam Saber at the green mobile suit but the Kshatriya shield itself with it's Binders, resulting in three fourths of it's front left Binder being sliced off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida grunted form the impact, her gut jiggling. She put more distance between herself and her enemy using her mobile suit's thrusters but the white mobile suit quickly followed after her and would soon reach it. She fired her Funnels at it an attempt to slow it down and damage it but like before, the Unicorn kept at the same speed and manged to dodge all of the Funnels shots. It destroyed two more Funnels as it got ever closing, not slowing down in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida turned the Kshatriya towards the Unicorn, realizing that she would to prepare to meet it in melee combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing is built with Psycho-Frame throughout the whole body?\" Marida noted as she watched the Unicorn dodge more shots from her Funnels and destroy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn Gundam destroyed another Funnel as it dashed towards the Kshatriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam...\" Marida said aloud to herself, rage building within her. \"Gun \u2013UURRP- dam... UUURRAP! Gundam is... \u2013UUUURRRP- the enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya ignited it's Beam Saber and charged towards the Unicorn Gundam. Their sabers clashed with each other and the suits rotated in sync with each other as they did so. They soon moved away and then charged at each other again. They pulled away from each other yet again but charged much sooner this time. Banagher striked before the Kshatriya was able to and cut off even more of it's front left Binder, and destroying the thrusters the Binder had and forcing the Kshatriya to retreat a good distance from him, using it's remaining thrusters. The uneven amount of force caused it to flip 360 degrees vertically, resulting in Marida's entire body jiggling around all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a ferocious belch, Marida charged at her enemy before she felt Zinnerman calling for her. She immediately calmed down, stopped her charge and looked towards where her captain was. She saw a Geera Zulu and focused on the image in her cockpit. She saw that he was in the the palm of the mobile suit's hand, along with Flaste, and was making a movement with hand that singled for her to return to the Garencieres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese pilot realized almost too late that she had let her guard down and the Unicorn was about to land a strike on the Kshatriya's chest. She activated it's I-Field just in time to prevent any damage and began her retreat. She fired all twelve of her mobile suit's Mega Particle Cannons at the Unicorn. Banagher maneuvered the Unicorn Gundam in between every shot. With her mission of securing the Garencieres' escape complete, Marida quickly left the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Neo-Zeon's retreat, Industrial 7, Banagher's and his friends' home, was safe. The adrenaline left Banagher and he felt his exhaustion catch up with him. he struggled to keep his eyes open, he still had to make his friends were safe, but his entire body felt so heavy. Not even when he fought Marida in-person had he felt this exhausted. In spite of his best efforts, Banagher Links, now the chosen pilot of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam, fell into a deep sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Unicorn Gundam was retrieved by a ReZEL sent by the Nahel Argama, the ship Banagher's friends were now on. Since Banagher was now asleep, he was naturally unable to respond the ReZEL's pilot's messages. Correctly deducing that the pilot was unconscious, the Argama's mechanical crew began to hack into the mobile suit itself to open the cockpit. However, the Unicorn had a very strong defense system against hacking, making progress very slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere on the ship, Audrey, along with Micott, Takuya, and Haro, were currently in one of the lounge rooms. They had just been escorted there by Mihiro Oiwakken, a communications officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait here for now.\" Mihiro said, standing just outside of the door frame. \" Let me know if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you received any word about who was piloting that Gundam?\" Audrey asked as she walked up to the officer. The blonde couldn't explain why but she couldn't shake the feeling that Banagher was the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, from what I've been told, the hatch hasn't even been opened yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was disappointed to hear that. Of course she didn't want Banagher to risk his life but at least being the pilot of the horned Gundam would mean that he was accounted for. She would never forgive herself if he got hurt doing something for her. She hoped, more then she ever had for anything before, that he was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, are you doing all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA friendly voice inserted itself into the conversation. Audrey and Mihiro looked towards the source of it, a young, blonde Federation officer walking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm the ReZEL pilot that pulled you guys out. My name's Riddhe Marcenas.\" He said as he finished walking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go take a look?\" Riddhe offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the Gundam.\" He clarified. \"You are curious, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensign Riddhe...\" Mihiro uttered. While it wasn't exactly against regulations to show civilians mobile suits in the hanger, it still wasn't something the captain would likely approve of. Not to mention that they should be resting after the hell they had to endure today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, Ensign Mihiro.\" Riddhe assured her. \"I know a secret spot where we can steal a peek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna go!\" Takuya suddenly said with a big grin as he ran right next to Audrey, much to her shock. \"This Nahel Argama was the mothership of the Gundam Team in the first Neo Zeon War, and now it's carrying this new Gundam! It's just too cool. It's like destiny, or... or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very clear from the look of surprise and confusion on her face that Audrey was caught completely off-guard by Takuya's enthusiasm. After having spent almost her entire life aorund cynical and stoic soldiers, it would take a while for her to get used to someone being so upbeat. It took her a few moments to regain the stoic look she usually had on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah.\" Riddhe said. He wasn't expecting to see such enthusiasm from someone had just barely survived a terrorist attack. It was a good trait to have in times like this, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you coming, Micott?\" Takuya said as he and Audrey looked at their brown-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Micott said in a depressed tone, lounging on the couch as she held Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Takuya's face instantly vanished and was replaced with a look of worry. He walked over to comfort his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm coming too.\" Mihiro told Riddhe. \"If that Gundam hadn't shown up when it did, you and I wouldn't be having this discussion now. I for one want to meet the pilot who saved our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro's words only made Audrey even more worried about Banagher, the worry was visible on her face. Feeling a sudden craving for a snack, Audrey walked over to the nearby vending machine and ordered a bag of tortilla chips. She opened up the bag and sighed as she looked at it. She couldn't believe that she was actually eating comfort food. The blonde began eating her snack.</span></div></div>",

And as any observation room should do, it provided them with a perfect view of the Gundam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they're saying.\" Takuya responded. \"It looks so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.\" Riddhe said to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned her face away from the others as they turned their eyes towards her. She hadn't been seen since U.C. 0088 so she hoped that no one could recognize e her as Mineva Lao Zabi but it seemed that hope was in vain. She braced herself as much as she could for the words \"You're Mineva Lao Zabi!\" but she never expected what Riddhe would actually say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You look like Natsume Swanson, you know, the famous actress.\" He said in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked twice in surprise, a surprised look on her face, feeling a huge weight leave her shoulders. Though she wished it would leave her gut too. \"I-I don't know much about the entertainment industry.\" In the span of a few seconds her expression had changed from showing her grim acceptance and guilt into showing sheer confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro closed her eyes and frowned, clearly suffering from a bad case of second hand embarrassment. Micott had her eyes halfway closed, she couldn't believe just how bad he was at this. Audrey just returned to her bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ensign!\" Takuya suddenly said, immediately grabbing everyone's attention. \"The cockpit is opening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at the Gundam's cockpit to see it open, just as Takuya had said. As it finished opening, they saw Banagher sitting in the pilot's seat, unconsciousness and with a bloody hand print on his left cheek. It was a sight none of them would ever forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott covered her mouth with her hands, a terrified look in her eyes. The Burnett was completely scared speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!\" Takuya uttered in shock. \"Why is he...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he be the pilot?\" Riddhe asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had a completely stoic expression but this was merely a facade. Had it reflected how she really felt she would've looked as horrified as Micott and incredibly guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher! What happened to you?! This is all my fault.\" Thoughts such as this flooded her mind. \"Please be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was immediately rushed to the med-bay. Thankfully, he wasn't wounded, he merely passed out from the sheer amount of G-forces that were exerted on to him. Of cruse, he would still need plenty of rest but that was all he would need before he was as good as new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher slept in the med-bay's, he dreamed of the life he had with his parents, before his mother took him away to live a normal life, away from the dark curse of the Vist family. His friends waited in the med-bay for him to wake up and fortunately, ti would only a little over half an hour before he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher. Banagher.\" Haro said as Banagher's eyebrows and eyelids began to move, showing that he was regaining consciousness. And sure enough, his eyes did open, much to his friends' relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Doctor!' Takuya said, sporting a relieved smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Argama's doctor, Hasan, got out of his chair to look over his patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher...\" Micott said in a concerned-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are-are you okay?\" Takuya said, sounding equally concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's eyelids were halfway down, he still felt so tired and his body still felt so heavy, the brown-haired young man was barely able to stay conscious. He looked aorund the unfamiliar room to see who else was there with him. He saw Micott, who was holding Haro, Takuya, and Audrey, all looking back at him. As soon as he saw his blonde friend, his eyes opened more, as if her very presence was enough to vanquish his weariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey.\" He uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott looked at Audrey, surprise that her name was the first thing he said as he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, can you hear me?\" Hasan before he grabbed both of Banagher's wrists. \"If you can hear me, squeeze my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro grabbed the communications phone and dialed for the bridge. \"Mihiro to the bridge. The boy is just regaining consciousness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Hasan asked Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little dizzy and really tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any parts of your body you can't feel? Any aching or pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, your condition is as good as I was expecting it to be.\" The doctor said. \"All you need is some rest and you'll feel fine soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on board the Nahel Argama, a Londo Bell ship. You'll be filled in on the details tomorrow, once you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Banagher was finally released from the med-bay. Along with his friends, Banagher was given his own room, since it would take a few days until the Nahel Argama could reach somewhere to drop them off. After putting his regular clothes back on, he decided to go check out his room. He wasn't expecting anything amazing since this was a warship but he was a tad curious and it couldn't hurt to get a head-start on getting used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his room's door he saw Audrey sitting on his couch with Haro and the table across from the bed was nearly overflowing with food. Needless to say, this was far from what Banagher expected to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Audrey.\" Banagher uttered, walking into the room and closing the door behind him, confusion evident in his voice. \"What's with all the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for you.\" The blonde answered. \"After everything you've done for me, I wanted to do something for you, even if it's just something small like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there's anything small about the amount of food you got.\" Banagher said as she sat down next to Audrey. \"Thanks, I really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome but before we begin eating, I want to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" Banagher had a confused look on his face, he honestly had no idea what his blonde friend wanted to apologize for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For having you go back to the mansion.\" Audrey's guilt was clear as day on her chubby face. \"If you didn't go you wouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm really sorr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Audrey, it's not your fault.\" Banagher cut her off, a comforting smile on his face. \"Now, how much food are you going to eat?\" The brunette had a big, goofy grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a laugh, her friend was just being too cute. He certainly knew how to cheer people up. \"Well, given that my belly has gotten a bit bigger from my hot dog binge,\" Audrey gave her pudgy belly a light slap for emphasis, causing it to jiggle. \"I'm sure I'll be able to eat even more then I did last time!\"</span></div></div>",

Both their pants were unbuttoned and unzipped to make room for their stomachs. Banagher's belt had been undone and Audrey's coat was unbuttoned, Mihiro was kind enough to sow the buttons back on and Audrey was not going to break them again after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said I was going to eat a lot but I didn't think we would \u2013UURRRP- actually eat everything.\" Audrey stated, giving her tummy a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either.\" Banagher said. \"So out of everything we ate, what was your favorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'd have to say the hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you'd say that.\" Banagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave it away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then let out a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both teens felt gurgles in their bellies, accompanied with sharp pains in their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I don't think my stomach is agreeing with me.\" Banagher groaned, giving his belly a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine isn't either.\" Audrey moaned, rubbing her belly. As much as her stomach hurt she was more concerned about Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't bear seeing Banagher in pain like this after all her kind friend did to help her.The chubby blonde wished there was a way she could help ease her bloated friend's stomachache when she remembered the soothing belly rubs Banagher gave her when she had a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um, B-Banagher...\" Audrey started, blushing. \"D-Do you want me to r-rub your b-belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens' faces were practically blushing scarlet when Audrey finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, s-sure! That'd be great!\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey then moved a little closer to Banagher, who shifted slightly in his spot so that his gut was facing his friend. Audrey then slowly and nervously placed her hands on Banagher's belly. A few seconds of awkward silence filled the room, both teens blushing heavily. While Banagher had already rubbed Audrey's belly, her rubbing his was a completely new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, y-you can s-start whenever you're ready.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right! Sorry.\" Audrey stammered. \"This is my first time doing something like this. I hope I'm not bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're not. I'd never consider you annoying, you're my friend.\" Banagher said with a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face went even redder. \"I-I-T-Thank you, that really means a lot to me, Banagher.\" The sheltered girl stuttered out, giving a shy, dorky and friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's your reward for being such a great friend, a nice belly rub! As soon as I can work up the courage that is, heh heh!\" Audrey giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much time as you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudre nodded and turned her attention back to her friend's tummy. After a few more seconds of silence from the both of them and the blonde preparing herself, Audrey gulped and began gently rubbing Banagher's belly. Banagher let out a moan of pleasure as Audrey's hands made soothing and rhythmic motions on his belly, all his discomforts fading away as a soothing warmth filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels amazing, Audrey.\" Banagher said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it does, B-Banagher.\" Audrey, a kind smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, Audrey's massage accidentally forced a huge burp out of Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! Sorry about that!\" Banagher said, his blush returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled. \"Don't worry, just do whatever you need to feel better. That's what you told me to do, right? So you should do the same.\" Audrey giggled a bit more, Banagher was just so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second to process that a girl and prim and proper as Audrey, who unbeknownst to him was even a princess, has absolutely no problem with him letting out a huge burp right in front of her, Banagher started giggling with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey continued rubbing Banagher's belly, a belch occasionally flying out of his mouth. It was a new yet enjoyable experience for the both of them. Audrey's massage felt absolutely amazing to Banagher as he let his bloated gut surge out and felt Audrey move her hands in soothing circles on his stuffed belly, easing the pains and aches inside it. The burps and moans of pleasure he would let out were clear signs of how much he was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was enjoying it just as much. After seeing her brown haired friend go through so much, some of which she blamed herself for, she was so happy that she could finally help him feel better. And not to mention, after living such a sheltered life, she loved that she could finally hang out with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes into Audrey's massage, Audrey's bloated belly let out a low grumble and she groaned. It was clear from that and the look on her face that she was indeed feeling unconformable. Being the caring guy that he was, Banagher immediately picked up on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does your stomach hurt?\" He asked in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh -UUURRAP!- Yeah, kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about I give it a good ol' belly rub?\" Banagher said with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone else if your situation said that I would say they should lie down and rest. But you've always got energy to help others, don't you?\" Audrey said with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Banagher enthusiastically said, a big dorky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher placed his hands on Audrey's stuffed belly and began rubbing it, causing her to let out a moan of pleasure as the pain in her tummy faded away and she was filled with the same soothing warmth that Banagher felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher giggled. There was something funny about a girl as polite as Audrey giving a big burp as her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Audrey and Banagher rubbed each other's bellies at the same time. Both would often let out a mighty belch due to the massage. Audrey and Banagher loved rubbing the other's belly and the rubs they received as well. Neither would dare admit it but there was something they really liked about the bloated bellies they were sporting. Perhaps it was because they were a result of them hanging out and having fun.</span></div></div>",

As they rubbed each other's belly, they happily talked o abut a variety of subjects, such as movies, videos games, and TV. Right now, they were currently watching a marathon an anime that covered the White Base's journey during the One Year War, a personal favorite of Banagher's. Though they were only a few minutes into the first episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this covers the White Base's -UUURP- entire service?\" Audrey asked her friend, still rubbing his belly as he rubbed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y -UURP- Yeah. This is one of my favorite shows, I've been a huge fan of it ever since \u2013UURRP- I was a little kid.\" Banagher answered. He always loved geeking out with his blonde friend. \"I've even got a lot of the models. You wanna \u2013UURRAP- see them when this is all over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, Audrey had an important question on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is Dozle \u2013UURRAAP- Zabi in this?\" Audrey felt really weird referring to her father by his full name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah, he shows up in the next episode.\" Banagher answered. \"He's actually really popular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He is?!\" Audrey said, a little louder then she intended. She really didn't expect that her Father would be so popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like him because he looks like a stereotypical villain when he's really a nice guy and a great dad. I'm sure you'll like a lot too. \" Banagher had no clue how awkward this conversation was for Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will.\" Audrey said, giving a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over fifteen minutes later, the episode ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really good.\" Audrey answered. \"Who are your favorite characters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I like them all so it's kinda hard to pick but my top three are Amuro, Sayla, and Frau. Do you have any favorites yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's mention of Sayla stood to to Audrey, as she knew that was the fake name that the daughter of Zeon Zum Deikun took, with her real name being Artesia Som Deikun. From she was taught by the members of Neo-Zeon that looked after her, Sayla was now living a normal life with few (even inside of Neo-Zeon) knowing of her heritage. Audrey hoped that she would one day be able to live like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Amuro and Frau.Though from what you said about him I have a good feeling that I'll like Dozle too.\" Audrey still felt weird referring to her father by his first name. \"And if you like Sayla then I'll probably like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then moved on to the next episode. A little bit into their viewing, Banagher and Audrey both felt their stomachs gurgle, they were about to let out a burp and it was going to be a big one. They both looked at each other and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey both belted out a massive belch at the same time. They immediately started laughing, their faces blushing bright red. Of course, they were still embarrassed but they were having way too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha ha, I'm getting pretty good at this, huh?\" Audrey asked, covering her mouth in a mock gesture of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher concurred, chuckling. \"Although you have a long way to go if you wanna match up to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, no way! I'm definitely way past you in skill!\" Audrey said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not likely, but okay!\"</span></div></div>",

The well-fed blonde easily saw the drowsiness in her friend's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go to sleep?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I really need a nice, long nap.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty tired too.\" The blonde gave a yawn of her own. \"I'm surprised we managed to stay up so long, especially with all this food in our stomachs. Thanks for showing me Mobile Suit Gundam, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. It was lots of fun watching it with you.\" The brunette said. \"So I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, a-actually, Banagher, is it alright if I could sleep here for the night?\" Audrey asked, she and Banagher started blushing slightly. \"It would probably be hard for me to walk back to my room while I'm this bloated. So I think I should stay here. A-Assuming that's alright with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be nice.\" Banagher said in usual friendly tone. \"After all, it was pretty nice the first time we did this, heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Of course, before either of us go to sleep, we need to brush our teeth.\" The princess stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shocked you can even think about stuff like that after everything that happened.\" While Banagher knew that Audrey was obviously a very formal and polite person, he didn't know she was such a stickler for stuff like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking care of our bodies is always important, Banagher.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point but I don't know if toothpaste is going to get the smell of pizza out of our mouths, given how much we ate.\" The brunette joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Brushing our teeth will take care of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bloated teens then brushed their teeth together in Banagher's bathroom. Once they were done with that, it was time to get dressed for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish \u2013URAP- we had some pajamas to switch into.\" Banagher said as he and Audrey waddled out of his bathroom. \"I could go for something really comfy after all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We actually \u2013UURP- do. They should be in your\u2013UURAP-  dresser.\" Audrey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Pajamas are standard \u2013UURRAP- issue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Miss Mihiro bought them a while ago for the crew.\" Audrey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice of her.\" Banagher noted. \"It must've cost her a lot of money. Let's just hope we can actually fit in any of them.\" Banagher chuckled as he gave his belly a little shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at the sight. \"Let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then waddled over to the dresser and opened the drawers one by one to find a collection of comfy looking pajamas. Most of them had styles that would work for a boy or a girl but a few of them were very clearly designed for girls. They picked their clothes and got changed. Audrey got changed in the bathroom while Banagher got changed in the bedroom itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher wore a simple white t-shirt and blue pajama pants and Audrey wore a pink button up pajamas shirt that went along well her pink pajamas pants. Of course, given who incredibly bloated their stomachs were, they couldn't pull their shirts down all the way. Banagher's shirt rode up past his bellybutton and only manged to cover the top half of his gut. Audrey only buttoned the part of her shirt that covered her breasts, she knew that if she buttoned the parts meant to cover her middle, her belly would just pop the buttons off. The chubby princess' belly was left completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at her tummy and rested a hand on it as she stood outside the bathroom. She knew she had pigged out but seeing her gut completely bare really hammered the point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAP! We're going to have work off a lot of weight tomorrow, \u2013UURAAP- aren't we?\" Audrey said with a sheepish grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably but don't worry, it's not that much \u2013URP- weight.\" Banagher said, sitting on the edge of his bed with Haro by his side. \"Besides, you still look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Audrey said as she waddled over to the bed and sat next to Banagher. \"You still look great too. I-I didn't mean to imply that you're fat! You're not, you've just got a very big b-belly because you a-ate a lot. You're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Audrey.\" Banagher said, giving Audrey a friendly pat on the back, eliciting another burp from her lips. \"I know what you meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed, something that had long ceased to be an uncommon sight nowadays. \"Th-thank you, Banagher,\" she said. \"Your kind words...I don't know what I'd do without them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher quirked an eyebrow at this. \"Hm? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just...ah, how do I put it...? I suppose your words always have a type of warmness to them, one that's never counterfeit. And when I feel it, I know you never lie when you say things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled, rubbing the back of his head with a goofy grin on his face. \"Wow, you can seriously feel that? Now I feel stupid! I mean, I know you're talented, but to even feel auras- is it, like, literal heat? Am I supposed to feel it, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do, Banagher. I can tell,\" Audrey said, nestling her large body into Banagher's own softness. \"Everyone does when they're with a person they care about. I just tried to put my version into words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really thought about it like that. You make me feel the same way.\" Banagher said, starting to blush himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two just sat there for a few seconds blushing at each other, not really knowing what to say. Suddenly, a giant belch escaped Banagher's lips, shocking both teens. They stared at each other for a few seconds before they burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Banagher!\" Audrey complimented, still laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Banagher said with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging good nights between each other and Haro, Banagher and Audrey then laid down in bed, Banagher was on his side while Audrey was laying on her back, the princess' gut sticking straight up into the air. She and Banagher closed their eyes and began drifting off to sleep. Shortly after, Audrey, not actually asleep yet, felt a hand make contact with her belly and make circular motions on the great expanse, a familiar warmth filling her. She opened her eyes to see that it was Banagher giving her a belly rub. She looked at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you'd like a belly rub.\" Banagher said, sporting a dorky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey adopted a playful smirk, Banagher was just so cute. \"Thanks, Banagher.\" She raised a hand into the air and wriggled her fingers playfully. \"And I think you'd like one too!\" She then placed her hand on Banagher's gut and started giving it a soothing rub. The bloated brunette let out a sigh of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I could ever turn down a belly rub from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher rubbed each other's big bellies, once again filling each other with a soothing warmth. They both occasionally belched, easing the pressure in their turbulent tummies. Some of the burps they let out were so loud, it actually surprised them. Since they were both still awake, they talked about whatever they could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Audrey, you've heard about the Axis \u2013UUURRRP- Shock, right?\" Banagher asked before he let out another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, UURRRRP! What about it?\" The blonde remembered clear as day the dread and horror she felt as she heard about Axis getting closer and closer to Earth and how Londo Bell's attempts at stopping it were failing. Seeing the members of Neo-Zeon that she was with being so happy about the news unnerved her greatly. To say that Audrey was relieved when Axis was pushed back by Londo Bell is an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this sounds stupid, but when Amuro, Londo Bell, \u2013UURRAAP- and even some members of Neo-Zeon pushed back Axis, they created this aurora \u2013UURRP- that was like the light from the human heart. Everyone there felt a warmth that made it seem like everything was going to be okay. That's... \u2013UUUURRRP- kinda how I feel right now. I know it's a really stupid comparison but I still wanted to \u2013UUURAAP- say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was far away from the battlefield but still saw the aurora of the Axis Shock as the asteroid moved away from Earth. Just looking at it filled her with a soothing warmth and hope for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not stupid at all. UUURRAP!\" Audrey said with a warm smile. \"A little weird, yes, but its not a bad comparison. I actually... feel like that too. These moments I've spent with you have been some of the happiest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're some of my happiest too.\" Banagher said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bloated friends just smiled at each other for a few seconds, not really knowing what to say. Rather then say anything more, Audrey and Banagher unleashed a massive belch in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're also some of our fullest too.\" Audrey with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got that right.\" Banagher chuckled.</span></div></div>",

She took a glance at the digital clock that was on top of the TV, already knowing before she read it that she had slept way longer then she usually did. The clock read that it was about 2 PM. Audrey almost let out a sigh, at least it wasn't as bad as it could possibly be. The blonde looked over at Banagher, her brown-haired friend was still sleeping soundly. Audrey couldn't help but let out a small smile, he just looked so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess of Zeon got out of bed and walked over to the closet, her tummy jiggling a bit with every step, something Audrey still wasn't quite used to. She pulled her clothes out of the dresser and began walking over to the bathroom to get changed. Banagher was still sleeping but she didn't want to risk him waking up to see her without any shirt or bra on as she was changing clothes, her breasts completely exposed to him. Just the thought of it made a slight blush come to Audrey's chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to the bathroom, Audrey saw the mess she and Banagher had made last night with their binge. There was empty snack bags, soda cans, bottles of water, chocolate bar wrappers, hot dog wrappings, licked clean plates, ice cream cans, and even a few boxes of pizza among others. And of course, they would have to clean all this up. Audrey didn't regret eating all that with Banagher, not one bit at all, but she was not a fan of all the cleaning they were going to have to do, hopefully before anyone else saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey entered the bathroom, shutting the door before she started to get changed. She didn't have any problem putting her clothes on, she hadn't gained that much weight, but how her clothes felt a little bit tighter compared to how they felt yesterday morning was still a reminder that she had put on weight. After getting dressed, she left the bathroom and put her pajamas away in the dresser. At that moment she heard a yawn come from Banagher. She looked over at him and saw him slowly getting up and stretching his arms as he yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Banagher.\" Audrey said as she walked over to the bad and sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Audrey.\" Banagher replied. \"So how long did we sleep in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's two o'clock. We really slept in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. At least our stomachs got plenty of time to digest.\" Banagher said. \"Ready for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll wait outside while you get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Audrey stood outside the door of their room and waited, she started to wonder if anyone might've walked past their room door last night and happened to hear the loud belches they let out or some of the the rather unusual conversations they had. She knew that even if someone had heard them, they wouldn't even know who they were from, unless they were Micott, Takuya, Riddhe, or Mihiro, but anyone hearing it would still be incredibly embarrassing, especially if it was someone who knew them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he buttoned and zipped his pants and put his belt on, Banagher noticed that they felt a more snug then before. He wasn't surprised at all, he knew he was going to pack on some pounds from all the gorging he did last night with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done getting dressed, Banagher walked out of his room to see Audrey waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to have for breakfast?\" The blonde asked before she immediately found herself examining her friend's weight gain with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's body was much softer then before, the most notable area being his belly, which now was a little ball of jiggly fat, it was even a little bigger then Audrey's. His face, chest, ass, and legs were noticeably more chubby as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably just some cereal.\" Banagher saw that his friend was caught in a trance of looking of at his softer body, not even registering his answer. \"Guess you noticed I put on a few pounds.\" The brunette had a slight tinge of red in his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Audrey out of her trance. \"Oh, uh, it's not that, y-you haven't gained a pound. You didn't eat that much\" She stammered. \"I was just, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Audrey, I'm not getting fooled.\" Sighed Banagher, placing a hand on his belly. \"I mean, we really stuffed ourselves last night, there's no way we weren't going to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right\" Audrey gave her belly a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not that big a deal.\" Banagher continued. \"It's not like we always eat that much, we'd be huge if we did.\" The chubby brunette said, giving both of them images of them obese. \"So we don't even have to work it off, it'll go away on it's own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, that's right.\" Audrey started perking up. \"It's not even that much weight, and I'm sure everyone has one of those days where they lose control of their appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Now let's go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say you were going to have for breakfast again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some cereal. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toast would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then started walking to the cafeteria. They both couldn't help but notice that their bellies were jiggling. They kept thinking about how they would look if they were fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even if last night made us obese, I wouldn't have regretted it.\" Audrey said with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Banagher replied, sporting a smile. \"If it means getting to have that much fun with you, then bring on the pies!\" Banagher then lifted his shirt to reveal his belly and gave it a good shake for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at the sight and did the same herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After getting their breakfast from the cafeteria, with Banagher jokingly remarking he's surprised they've even got room for breakfast after last night, the blonde led the brunette to the lounge room Mihiro took her, Takuya, and Micott to when they first boarded the room, in hopes of finding the latter two there. Fortunately, they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Banagher before letting out a yawn as he and Audrey walked in, Haro rolling alongside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" Micott said before she noticed Banagher's starter belly and how jiggled with his every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you two really slept in.\" Takuya remarked as he turned his attention away from his mobile suit magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleepyheads! Sleepyheads!\" Haro said, as Audrey and Banagher sat down together on one of the couches. Their orb-shaped friend then hopped onto the couch and sat right next to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're any better.\" Micott teased Takuya. \"Of course, it's not like anyone would blame any of us for sleeping in after yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... actually not why we slept in.\" Banagher said. He and Audrey began eating their respective breakfasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? So why did you sleep in?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were up all night eating.\" Banagher explained with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And watching TV.\" Audrey added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so that's why you've got a gut now?\" Micott asked Banagher, eyeing said gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Banagher gave his belly a few pats for emphasis, causing it to jiggle. \"You should've seen our stomachs last night, they were huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... certainly were.\" Andrey said, a slight tinge of red in her soft cheeks. \"We also had fun watching Mobile Suit Gundam last night. Banagher introduced me to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised, Banagher loves that show as much as I do.\" Takuya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott felt more and more jealous as she heard about how Audrey and Banagher spent so much time together last night. Why Audrey instead of her when she and Banagher had been such close friends for years? What did Audrey have that she didn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought I'd find you here.\" Mihiro said after she opened the lounge room door. \"Banagher, if you're feeling well enough we'd like you to explain to us what lead to you getting in that Gundam.\" The Federation officer said as she walked over to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Do I have to see the captain or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually you'll be meeting with commander Daguza Mackle, he's waiting for you in the hanger. I can show you the way.\" Mihiro explained. \"But first you need to finish your breakfast.\" She added in the tone of a big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, right.\" Banagher said before he returned to his breakfast. He was caught a bit off guard by how a member of the Federation forces was acting like a big sister to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone needs a good breakfast to recover, Banagher.\" She said with a small smile. The ensign then noticed how chunky Banagher's belly was, along with the rest of him. \"Was Banagher always chubby?\" She pondered. Granted, she had only known for him less then a day but she could've sworn all that pudge wasn't there yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Banagher finished his breakfast and left with Mihiro for the hanger, Micott was still thinking about how Banagher had spent all that time last night with Audrey. She couldn't stand how Banagher seemingly picked Audrey over her, despite Audrey not knowing Banagher nearly as long as she did. She wanted to spend that moment with Banagher, she wnated so badly to pig out with Banagher. Suddenly it hit her. If Audrey and Banagher could get tons of food last night, then that means she could do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the hanger, Banagher had just finished explaining how he ended up in the Unicorn to Daguza, though he decided not to tell him that he was Cardeas' son, as he felt there was no chance of Daguza believing that. Banagher was sitting in the Unicorn's cockpit as Daguza stood in the opened cockpit door, facing Banagher. Banagher had turned on the Unicorn to demonstrate that he was the only one who could use it, as Daguza requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you stand by the story?\" Daguza almost rhetorically asked, skepticism was clearly evident in his voice despite his calm demeanor. \"You expect us to believe that Cardeas Vist just gave it to a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Banagher answered with a stiff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did he say anything when he gave you this gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, he told me to take the mobile suit and use it to protect everyone.\" Banagher answered. \"That's all he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are multiple details about your story that don't make sense.\" Daguza bluntly told him, partly in hopes it would get Banagher to tell him the full story. \"That said, it is an indisputable fact that this mobile suit is set to only allow you to pilot it. So it seems that Cardeas did give it you. You're free to go for now, though this is far from the end of our investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher silently walked out. Normally he would've said \"Thank you\" or something like that but he just wnated to get away from this whole scene. He felt like he had just barely dodged a bullet and had no guarantee that another one wasn't going to be aimed at him in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be easier to believe if I told him Cardeas was my father?\" Banagher mumbled in frustration as soon as he thought he was out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wasn't. As soon as Daguza heard that, everything started to make sense to him. Still, the commander of ECOAS felt it would be better to avoid a direct confrontation with Banagher for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Banagher was led back to the lounge room by Mihiro, who then returned to her regular duties, for the second time in two days he saw a girl with an absurd amount of food waiting for him. This time it was Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Banagher, I was just about to dig in.\" Micott said in a causal tone despite this being anything but a normal meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting lunch to be so big.\" Banagher said as he walked over to Micott, eyeing the impressive feast she had gotten. The brunette had mostly gotten different types of snacks like chips and pretzels, thoguh she also got stuff like an extra large pizza and a tub of ice cream. There was also some fast food like hamburgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't either.\" Audrey commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not like you two have any room to talk.\" Micott teased with a grin as she gave Banagher's belly a poke, the Gundam pilot's soft tummy allowing her finger a bit of lee-way before it met resistance. She did this partly to emphasize her point but for reasons she didn't understand, she really wanted to feel Banagher's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, heh heh!\" Banagher said with a sheepish grin, giving his tummy a few pats. Audrey didn't say anything but blushed in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You walked right into that one, Banagher.\" An amused Takuya commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't you help me finish all this?\" Micott suggested as part of her plan. \"There's no way I'll be able to eat it all by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just had breakfast so I'm-\" Banagher was then unexpectedly cut off as Micott forced a slice of pizza in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just eat already.\" Micott said before she took a bite out of a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Micott and Banagher started binging. Despite the experience being rather fun for him, Banagher didn't get why Micott was acting like this, being completely oblivious to Micott's crush on him and that she was jealous of Audrey. Audrey herself was equally oblivious and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya let out a chuckle at the event, being the only one besides Micott who knew exactly what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, Mr. Takuya?\" Audrey asked the freckled young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott and Banagher, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Miss Micott usually act like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always been pretty feisty but this is the first time she's ever done this.\" Takuya then grabbed two bags of chips, Banagher and Micott were too engrossed in their gluttony to notice. \"Here, a little snack to go with the show.\" He said as he handed Audrey one of the bags and then opened his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Audrey said before she opened her bag. \"This is certainly a sight.\" It was also far from what Audrey thought a normal life would be like.</span></div></div>",

UURRP!\" Banagher groaned, giving his bloated tummy a few pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott and Banagher rubbed their stuffed bellies as they rested on the couch and burped up a storm, having finally finished their feast after nearly an hour of binging. Micott's belly had swollen into a big round ball like Haro. Banagher's gut had as well but it was even bigger then Haro because of the weight he had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this -URAP- what it was like after binging with Audrey?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, UURRRRP!\" Banagher answered. \"Except this time I'm the chubby one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I didn't think you two would eat all of that.\" Takuya commented as Banagher and Micott continued to burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew Banagher would.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty impressed with how much you ate, Banagher.\" Micott said. \"I've never seen someone eat that much in one sitting before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We knew you ate a lot last night but we didn't think it was this much.\" Takuya added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks.\" Banagher said. \"You can really -UURRRP- pack it away too, Micott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T - URRRP- Thanks, Banagher.\" Micott said, thinking about how her plan had worked perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two entered an eating contest, you'd win, hands down.\" Takuya complimented with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big winners! Big winners!\" Haro said, sitting right next to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey knew Takuya was joking and not actually suggesting they enter an eating contest, though he really did believe they could win one, his words actually made her think about joining one with Banagher. As well as Micott and Takuya if there was an eating contest with teams of four. The princess used to think that eating contests were absolutely disgusting (as well as all the belching, bloated bellies, and weight gain that came with them) and couldn't even begin to see why someone would participate in one. But now her experiences with Banagher had caused the idea to seem a lot more appealing to the blonde. There was just something so wonderful and fun about letting go and pigging out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this means I'll be as chubby as you and Audrey when this all digests.\" Micott said as she looked down at her orb of a middle and gave it a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's only a little bit of fat, it won't take long to lose it.\" Banagher assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that eating contest idea.\" Audrey suddenly said, ruffling a bit of her hair. \"Do you think maybe... we could have one between the four of us? Tomorrow, of course. Miss Micott and Banagher are obviously too full right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just joking about that.\" Takuya said. \"Though I have no doubt that if Banagher and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me \"miss\" -UUURRRAP- \"Micott\"?\" Micott asked Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. Is that a problem?\" Audrey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll call me Mr.Takuya?\" Takuya teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird to call people your age Mr or Miss -URRRRRP-, Audrey.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how come you never call Banagher -UUUURRP- that?\" Micott said, wondering just how close Banagher and Audrey actually are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's because...\" Audrey stuttered, blushing and trying to understand why herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, when Banagher was less bloated, he and Audrey began the process of cleaning his room of the remains of their binge last night. They knew they had eaten a truly huge amount of food but seeing all the empty bags of chips and pizza boxes among others really drove home to them just how much they really pigged out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In hindsight, we probably should've thrown out the bags as soon as we ate the food in them.\" Audrey noted as she picked up another empty chip bag and placed on top of an equally empty pizza box to make it easier for her to carry it to the garbage disposal room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Banagher responded, grabbing another empty soda can. \"But it would've been pretty hard for us to walk around with those huge bloated guts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's rather colorful choice of words to describe their stomachs last night caused to Audrey to imagine them walking aorund with even bigger stomachs that were jiggling wildly, stomachs the size of a yoga ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens then made a trip to the garbage disposal room and drooped off as much of their trash there as they could carry at once. This was their third trip there, and it wasn't going to be the last one or even the second to last one today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to Banagher's room Audrey started picking out trash to throw out while Banagher took a break and laid down on the couch, his tummy still bloated enough that it pushed his jacket up enough to expose most of it but Banagher didn't really mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a break.\" Banagher explained, a little surprised by Audrey's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think we should finish cleaning up as soon as possible.\" Audrey said as she started grabbing more empty bags and cans. \"Honestly, you're being really lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with taking a little break.\" Banagher lazily scratched his belly. \"You should take a break too. I mean, we both already did a lot of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why put off things that need to be done anyways? It's just being lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRP!\" Banagher belched, which is universally considered a poor way to start one's argument. \"Sorry about that. Anyways, I think always worrying about eventualities is only gonna stress you out and keep you from enjoying life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey then reflected on how the people she had spent nearly her entire life were mostly servants and soldiers of Neo-Zeon, people who would work day in and day out for her. People who lived to serve her. She knew that this was not normal behavior for people but she only realized now that her upbringing had given her unfair expectations of how much normal people like Banagher should work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Maybe even a light snack wouldn't hurt. Right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, a plentiful plethora of food stood before the competitors. Pizza, hamburgers, cookies, cakes, corn dogs, kebabs, curry, brownies, fried fish, and hot dogs among others filled the table they were all seated at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eating contest was being done with three rounds and three teams of two. Audrey and Banagher were naturally teamed up, Micott and Takuya were the next team, and Riddhe and Mihiro were the last team. The two Federation officers were lucky enough to get a long break, which Riddhe felt was best spent joining this friendly eating contest he overheard Audrey and the others talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you talked me into this.\" Mihiro said. Just looking at all the food they were about to devour made her feel fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's a good way to take our minds off of everything and relax.\" Riddhe argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I pop a button or break my belt, you're paying for it.\" Mihiro had a feeling that it was more a case of when then if. Already she couldn't get the image of herself with a huge gut and burping up a storm out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro was siting next to Banagher, ready to act as a clock of sorts for the competition. He would announce when each round was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the huge spread of food, Audrey felt a little bit of dread form all the weight she was going to gain from this. But that was what surprised her, she only felt a little bit of dread. In fact, she actually felt really excited. Just a few days ago, she would've refused this contest without hesitation, she would've found the idea completely disgusting. Yet here she was, ready to give it her all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Audrey?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Audrey and Banagher then happily bumped their big bellies together, causing both spheres of fat to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott saw that, her cheeks turning red. She wouldn't admit it but she really loved seeing Banagher's gut jiggle. She just wished it was her belly he was bumping his with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott looked down at her belly. It had grown from her binge yesterday into a round ball of soft fat that filled up a little bit of her lap. It was now fat enough to jiggle. Her breast were notably larger, though they were a little smaller then Audrey's. But her butt was bigger then Audrey's and thighs were thicker then Audrey's own. Her ass filled up her chair and her legs would always touch when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fired up.\" Takuya commented. \"Guess you see this as your chance to upstage Audrey.\" He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's noting like that.\" Micott said, which would've only further convinced Takuya she was jealous if he wasn't already 100% convinced of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Takuya sarcastically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026Ready\u2026Set...\" Takuya said to get everyone's attention. All the competitors got ready to start digging in. A few got their knife and fork ready while the others were prepared to grab something as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Takuya yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher started digging into the fast food, greedily shoveling as much as they could into their mouth. Banagher started with a slice of pizza, chomping down in it as fast he could and getting some of it on his chubby cheeks. In contrast to Audrey, who while eating quickly, still managed to retain her perfect manners and elegance. Any food stuffs that got on her face were soon wiped away with a napkin. She started eating with hot dogs, as Banagher and Haro expected. After finishing his first pizza slice, Banagher started alternating between different foods, taking a bite out of a slice of pizza and then another out of a burger. After finishing her first hot dog, Audrey picked up one in each hand and alternated between taking bites out of each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott started with the ice cream, eating scoops as fast as she possibly could. The brunette was extra pumped for this, viewing it as her chance to outshine Audrey. Her previous plan on dragging Banagher into a mutual binging session with her was pretty much a success, but she would need to keep grabbing Banagher's attention (as well as hopefully his gut one day) if she was going to completely outshine Audrey. Takuya started with a slice of cake. He was eating at a decently fast pace but powered by pure jealously and love, Micott was eating way faster then him. It was actually impressive. Takuya started to wonder exactly how fat and bloated Micott was willing to get to win this one-sided war with Audrey. At any rate it meant he picked a good partner for an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe was eating at a pretty decent speed. Not as fast as Audrey or Micott but still fast. compared to Mihiro though, he was astounding. The brunette ensign was eating at what was easily the slowest pace out of the six of them. This was partly because she was the least enthusiastic about the contest out of the six, and partly because she just wasn't as good at competitive eating as the others. Some encouragement from Riddhe got her to speed up her pace a little, enough that Riddhe didn't have to pull the team by himself. Part of why Riddhe was enjoying the contest was that being invited to an eating contest was subconsciously viewed by him as further confirmation that he wasn't being being treated differently because he belonged to influential family. He was a normal person, and becoming that was was why he had joined the military in the first place. He didn't know it, but he in the same room as someone who had similar issues that would eventually result in getting fat: Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Times up! Times up!\" Haro excitably said when the timer ran out. \"Round one over! Round one over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll six competitors stooped eating and reclined back into their spot. It was only the first round and already they were all feeling rather full and a bit bloated, their bellies had swollen up a little. Belches escaped their lips as they rubbed their tummy. None of them were considering quitting but they still needed a bit to let their gut rest and expel some gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Audrey. You can really pack it away!\" Banagher complimented the blonde before letting out a small burp. \"Maybe we should enter a real eating -UURRP- contest some day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you -UUURAP- don't mind us having to be rolled home afterwards.\" Audrey joked and gave her gut a pat, the two lovebirds giggled. \"And thank you for the compliment. You're quite skilled at being a glutton yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me. UUURRP! Who won this round?\" Takuya asked. Everyone was so caught up in binging they had pretty much forgotten they were having a contest.</span></div></div>",

And unsurprisingly me and Mihiro were dead last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally this left Micott frustrated, she had been outdone by Audrey again. Coming in second place wasn't even a nice consolation because there was no way Riddhe and Mihiro were going to not acme in last place as long as the latter was eating at the slow speed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you guys holding up so far?\" Takuya asked. \"Me, I've got more then enough room for the next two rounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be able to eat for the next two rounds.\" Audrey said, placing a hand on her belly to check whether or not it felt firm and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still got more then enough room to eat everyone under the table!\" Micott boasted as she gave her stomach a slap for emphasis that made it jiggle. The brunette had forgotten for a moment that this was a team effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't get what everyone sees in this.\" Mihiro thought out loud, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was a bit disappointed that her boasting elicited a response from Mihiro instead of Audrey, the latter not even seeming to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group soon got the next set of food and started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, Audrey and Banagher were eating purely for the fun of the contest and the taste of the food. And also like before, they were doing really good in the contest. This worried Micott, with everyone still eating at the same speed as the last round the results were bound to be the same. Even though Audrey was pudgy when she first met her, and she did see her with huge gut before then that she now suspected was a really stuffed belly, she never would've expected someone as petite and polite as Audrey would be so good at pigging out. Hell, she wouldn't have even thought the blonde would be the type to even join this if it wasn't for that late night binge Banagher told her he had with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott decided to kick it up a notch. She started eating as fast as she possibly could, wolfing down everything she could. She wasn't going to bother tying to pace herself anymore, she was betting it all on her sheer speed and willpower. The taste of the food was just a nice bonus at this point, all she was focused on was winning. Sometimes she wouldn't even finish what she was eating before she took a bite out of something else. Sometimes it was two of the same food, like when she took one slice of pizza in each hand and took a bite out of each until they were both resting in her sloshing stomach, and sometimes it was two completely different foods, like when she took a bite out of a burger and then a kebab before she sent both to her stomach. She was only pausing to either breath, drink, or belch. she didn't give a damn about manners at this point. She couldn't care less about all the crumbs and food stuffs getting on her face, clothes, belly, and even her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the round when pants had trouble containing their gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott's stomach was unsurprisingly the first one to pop the button of her shorts, allowing her distended belly to pour further out, forcing her zipper to come undone. But she oculdn't care less, not even the fact that a bit of her underwear was showing. Besides, everyone would soon be in the same state. A predication that would soon turn out to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the experienced piggies of the group, the veterans if you will, Audrey and Banagher realized when their pants (and belt, in Banagher's case) where feeling tight and wardrobe malfunctions were on the horizon. SO they undid their pants buttons and zippers, Banagher also undoing his belt. This gave their bellies the freedom they needed, easing the pressure on them. The lovebirds blushed a bit and gave each other a nervous smile and chuckle when they saw that a bit of their underwear was visible, but they were used to getting oddly personal with each other at this point so it wasn't as bad as it would've been when they first met. In any case, they quickly returned to gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe and Mihiro didn't have the foresight Audrey and Banagher had, their stomachs snapped their belts and popped their buttons, allowing their bellies to surge forth and force their zippers to be undone. They both blushed at the sight as they looked down at their stomachs in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro poked Riddhe's belly to get his attention. Which worked but as soon as Riddhe look at Mihiro, he accidentally burped in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks, Riddhe.\" Mihiro said sarcastically in an annoyed tone with an equally annoyed expression to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that!\" He nervously said, terrified that anything he said would just make Mihiro even more mad. That or another belch would slip out while he was still facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to remind you that you're -UURP- paying for the replacement belts and pants. UUURRP!\" Mihiro said before she intentionally burped in Riddhe's face as revenge. \"UUUURRP! There, now we're even in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as their bellies grew as they continued to eat, so did their belches. Audrey and Banagher were pretty used to burping loudly at this point, but the others weren't. Of course Micott ddn't care about how big her belches were, so that really only left Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro as the  ones surprised and embarrassed over their burps. as much as they wished they could swallow their burps down, they did appreciate how it made their tummies feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Haro announced the second round was over, leaving everyone swollen and moaning. The gluttons were leaned back in their chairs, moaning and burping as they tenderly rubbed their swollen bellies.Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro's bellies were as big and round as Haro, completely filling up their laps. Takuya's forced his shirt to rise above his navel, while Mihiro and Riddhe's forced them to unzip their uniforms, their own bellies forcing the shirts they worse under their uniforms to rise above their bellybuttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher's bellies were even bigger then Haro and just as round. Their shirts could only cover the top of their stomach. Audrey had already undone the buttons on her coat at this point. No way was she going to pop them off right in front of Mihiro after she was kind enough to sow them back on for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURP! Whew, man at this rate I'm going to huge by the end of the week.\" Banagher said, imagining how he would look obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be a complete -UUURRRRRP- ball by then.\" Audrey teased with a giggle, poking Banagher's belly. The brunette's words made her also wonder how he would look as a complete butterball. She felt he would look really cute as one. \"Guess I'll have to be in charge of rolling you around. UUURAP! Assuming I'm in any better shape then, which I probably won't be.\" She grabbed a handful of her belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Micott will have to roll us around. You up for it, Mi -UUURP- cott? ... Micott?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRAAP! Ughhhh...\" Micott groaned. Her speed eating had left her with a gigantic stomachache. \"W -URAAAAP- What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are -UURAAAP- you okay, Micott?\" Takuya asked. \"You look like you're about to throw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sickly gurgle sounded from the depths of her stomach, causing her to groan in pain. She burped again. \"I'm-I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some pills?\" Mihiro asked. \"There's plenty of types I can get in the med -UUURRP- bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, URAP. I'm fine.\" Micott really wanted to say yes but there was no way she was going to take one, especially if Audrey hadn't. To her it would be cheating in the contest to win Banagher's heart. And his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain you're okay, Miss-Er, I mean Micott.\" Audrey asked after she burped. \"You look like you need a belly rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if Banagher -UURRRRRP-! I mean, I said I'm fine!\" Micott said, frustrated that to hear that coming from Audrey of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a rub if you want.\" Banagher offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was REALLY hard for Micott to turn that down but she was determined to be the bigger glutton then Audrey not to cheat. But if he started giving Audrey one during the contest, then she was going to ask Banagher if he could rub two tummies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. Anyways, who won this round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRP! You and Takuya, of course.\" Riddhe said as he rubbed his own belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The third and final round proved to be the most challenging for everyone, as that was when the feeling of being stuffed really started hitting the competitors. Even Audrey and Banagher's eating paces were slowing down. In Micott's case, she was reduced to the slowest eater because of how much her stomach hurt from her speed eating. She still had the same drive as before, but no one in her state could eat any faster then at a snail's pace. Takuya initially tried to eat faster to make up for Micott but soon ran out of energy and had to return to eating at a slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faster eaters slowing down gave Riddhe and Mihiro the advantage. While they had slowed down too, their somewhat poor performance meant they hadn't eaten quite as much as everyone else, so their speed was noticeably faster then the other slightly more bloated teams. Though the two certainty didn't feel like they were any less bloated then the others. Mihiro was dreading the effects all this food was going to have on her figure by next morning. In stark contrast to Riddhe, who didn't even think they would have any visible weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Audrey and Banagher, they were still eating but were a bit more focused on giving themselves belly rubs as they did so. Despite being so stuffed, Audrey was still enjoying the chance to pig out and enjoy herself, and Banagher was enjoying seeing her do so. He was impressed by how she was still able to have perfect table manners during an eating contest. Well, aside from all the belching of course, but bothering to wipe her mouth with a napkin was Godly levels of table manners for an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time's up! Times up! Round over! Round over!\" Haro announced, bouncing up and down in his spot next to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach competitor immediately dropped what they were eating, except for Audrey who just finished her bite of hamburger, and leaned back in their chair, moaning with their hands on their big bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRAAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all released a massive belch at the same time. The combined power of all six belches was enough to shake the room itself, the many dishes on the table clattering, and jiggle each of their huge bellies. They sighed in relief when their eruption was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so -UUUURRRP- full...\" Audrey moaned as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped. \"I couldn't eat another bite. I'll explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're going to anyways. URRP!\" Takuya joked, giving his tummy a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghh... URAAAP! So who won?\" Micott asked, tenderly massaging her swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm way too full -UUUURP- to count.\" Riddhe groaned, rubbing his own belly and belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure -URRRRP- we all are.\" Mihiro moaned, rubbing the top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Haro was there to count for them. He hopped onto the table and counted how many empty dishes, as well as empty wrappers, pizza boxes and bowls, were in front of each person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddhe and Mihiro won.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first reply was a loud burp from Banagher as he pressed down on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we're doing a tie -URP- breaker round?\" Takuya gave the second response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRRP! Do we have to? URAP!\" Mihiro groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't -URP- I don't think we even have enough food for another round.\" Banagher said. He was correct, no one saw on the table anywhere near enough food for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could have -UUURP- a burping contest.\" Takuya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURP! What's -UURP- that?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a game where you see who can belt out the biggest b -URRRRRP-!\" Banagher explained. Burping the word burp wasn't intended but he still felt it was a nice touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, URRRRP! That sounds rather weird but also kinda fun.\" Audrey said, still rubbing her huge gut. \"But after those really loud belches we all let out, I'm not sure if any of us have a lot of gas left... I can't believe I just said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled. He then reached over and began rubbing his blonde friend's belly, who then did the same to him. Both chubsters were sporting goofy smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was only able to watch Audrey and Banagher act like such love birds for a few seconds before looking away in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone wants a belly rub.\" Takuya teased. \"I'm not B -UURAP- Banagher but I can give you one if you like. And give me one too of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I can really use one.\" Micott said as she and Takuya started rubbing each other's stomachs. \"But seriously, Bana- UUURRP- gher's just my best friend, like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott moaned in pleasure as Takuya's hand came over her sore middle, she was not expecting it to feel this good. She wasn't expecting feeling Takuya's belly to feel so good either. It really helped her take her mind off her feelings of frustration and envy towards Audrey. For the first time since the contest started, she could focus on the fun she had during it. Even her animosity towards Audrey had calmed down a bit. Sure she still had no idea why Banagher was so smitten with her, and sure there was still something really off about Audrey, but the blonde was still her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, UUUURRP! I never would've imagined that pigging out could be so fun.\" Audrey said in an amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -UUURRRP- said it.\" Banagher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher then happily bumped their big bellies together, jiggling them in the process. The impact immediately caused them to belch loudly in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovebirds let out a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, we're going to get so fat -UURRRRP- from this.\" Banagher said as he gave his gut a hearty slap for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think this all started from a hot -UUUURRP- dog.\" Audrey mused as she gave her belly a shake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey yawned and stretched as she woke up. She took a looked aorund what had become her room as she reflected on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been my room for three days. Well, three days and one night to be exact. This ship has been my home for three days. Spending time, \"hanging out\" as they called it, with Banagher, Micott, Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro has been my lifestyle for four days, counting the day I arrived at Industrial 7. And they have been my family for four days.\" Audrey thought to herself. \"I've lived for sixteen years, four days is a small percentage of my life. Yet it feels like this has been my life for years. I want it to never end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the princess knew it can't last forever. The Nahel Argama will eventually reach it's destination of Luna II. For all her political experience, it was difficult for Audrey to predict what will occur there. Banagher's status as the only one who can pilot the Unicorn will most likely protect him. If not then they'll destroy the Unicorn Gundam, then the Federation probably won't care less about Banagher. If that's still not enough to save him, then she'll see if she can convince the Nahel Argama crew or even Neo-Zeon to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she thought about it, she still didn't know how or why Banagher had the Unicorn Gundam. She would have to ask him soon so she could plan their next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna II wouldn't be the end of their troubles. There was still the matter of Laplace's Box and Neo-Zeon. When that was all over, would they even be able to return to their normal lives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl of hunger from her stomach broke Audrey out of her thoughts. She blushed and looked down at it. \"This is significantly harder to get used to then my new life.\" She said to her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of her bed and looked down at her stomach, blushing even harder. It was so big. She gave it a poke, her finger sinking in before it met resistance. When she removed her finger, the fat jiggled back into place without a mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even see my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on her pajama shirt were visibly tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess of Zeon grabbed the sides of her big belly and gave it a good shake, she was shocked by how much it jiggled. Her face got even more red from the sight of her bouncy belly in motion. Even when she released the orb, it still took a second to stop jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have to lose this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid thing then growled again to remind it's owner again it was time for breakfast. Audrey sighed, her stomach was right. The blonde got dressed and did her hair before she left her room to walk to the mess hall, cringing as her tum jiggled with every step like a blob of jelly. When she got there, she looked aorund but couldn't see any of her friends. This confused her, they should be eating breakfast by now. Was the clock in her room wrong? She looked at the nearby clock, it read 11:13. Five minutes since she woke up, which were spent getting dressed, doing her hair, and playing with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:13 and there was no sight of her friends. They couldn't still be asleep at this time, could they? That would be incredibly lazy. She walked to Banagher's room and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher? Are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure no one else was nearby, Audrey opened the door. Sure enough, she saw Banagher, sleeping, snoring, and much fatter. He was on his back, his stomach sticking straight up into the air like a mighty mountain. His gut was rising up and down with every breath. His pajama shirt had ridden his orb of a belly to the point not even his incredibly deep bellybutton was covered. Haro was in sleep mode by the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head playfully, Audrey gave a little smile. She expected no less from her pal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde walked over to Banagher, nearly lost in the tantalizing way his tummy moved with every breath. Haro woke up and was about to greet Audrey, who put a finger to her lips to indicate that she wants him to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands on the blubbery surface of his massive belly and started rubbing and playing with it, amused by how none of this woke the brunette up. She loved how it felt in her hands, it was like a wonderful pillow. She rubbed, pat, jiggled, and shook her close friend's sphere of adipose, having the time of her life. She loved watching all the fat jiggle from the contact. At one point she even stuck a finger in Banagher's navel. Sometimes she'd grab handholds of Banagher's belly flesh. Audrey had no idea what had gotten into her, but this was way too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally had enough fun, she removed her hands from the snoring brunette's belly and took a moment to look at the large expanse. She then gave it a big slap, the fat belly jiggling greatly from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Banagher jolted awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Banagher.\" Audrey sweetly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Audrey.\" Banagher in a somewhat annoyed tone. He then yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Banagher! Good morning, Audrey!\" Haro joyfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Haro.\" Banagher said, still a bit annoyed at Audrey's method for waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Haro.\" Audrey said, she then returned her attention to Banagher. \"I'll wait outside while you get dressed. I didn't have breakfast yet, so lets eat together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, I'll be done in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey then waited outside Banagher's room. To pass the time, she started playing with her belly after she checked that no one was nearby. She did things like rubbing it, feeling it up, shaking it, and slapping it. She also checked to see how deep her bellybutton was now. This made her embarrassed, but she had nothing better to do. Plus it was almost fun. Almost. At least, that's what she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that Banagher should've been done getting dressed by now. She opened his door to see that yes, he had gone back to sleep, still in his pajamas. She walked over and slapped his gut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, I'm up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly got dressed and left his room. Allowing both teens to see how fat the other had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pounds continued to pile on Audrey and Banagher\u2019s bodies, they made their marks known. If one were to look at the couple, it would be difficult to discern which of the two had received a larger share of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey\u2019s stomach had ballooned to such proportions the young woman had never even contemplated. In such a short span, it had gone from mostly trim to a reservoir of fat. A reservoir so full and heavy, it hung low enough to obscure a fair portion of her crotch while standing. Two meaty love handles flared from her sides, positioned just below a small roll that partitioned them from the rest of her abdomen\u2019s expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing Audrey\u2019s weight gain excelled at, it was bringing her chest it to its true voluminous glory. Supple as marshmallows and nearly large as cantaloupes, they\u2019d grown to such an extent that they made jokes of any bra Audrey attempted to contain them in. They pooled over the top of her abdomen when she stood or sat down; they hung like ripened berries when she bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assets on Audrey\u2019s lower end weren\u2019t anything to scoff at either, though. Her ass had grown to a size ill-suited for her skinny jeans, making it and her legs a tight squeeze. It didn\u2019t even jiggle, it was so compressed. Though while the princess\u2019 ass hadn\u2019t yet managed to escape the her clothes, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t make its presence known. There were plenty of times in which Audrey vied for a seat, only to find that most could barely contain it. They got the job done, but armchairs and wide stools had had become her preferred seating of choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was topped off with Audrey\u2019s face, which had received comparatively little change. It acquired a hint of a double chin through all the gaining (the extra fat helping to obscure her growing neck), as well as chubby cheeks that created a small alcove for her mouth. Beyond that, however, she was still just as easy to recognize as Zeon\u2019s former royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had undergone a simpler gain, though just as pronounced. Most of it was centered in his stomach, which was so large that the poor guy gave up on trying to keep his pants closed. It hung even further down than Audrey\u2019s, to the point it pretty much did obscure his crotch. Any shirt Banagher wore, meanwhile, could barely obscure it. His navel ran deep; it could fit a whole finger without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest had become soft and pliable, not as much as Audrey\u2019s, but only due to the inherent differences in biology between man and woman. Banagher\u2019s jiggly posterior also jutted out further than any fit male\u2019s would have any right to, and his thighs were constantly rubbing against each other, light as the sensation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher\u2019s face gain was more pronounced than Audrey\u2019s, with a more pronounced double chin and cheeks. It hadn\u2019t gotten to such an extent that his neck was swaddled with fat or anything, but it was certainly on that track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm starving.\" Banagher gave his middle a few pats for emphasis, the mass of fat wobbling from it.</span></div></div>",

Heh, Micott says I sometimes completely space out and she gets mad when I forget she and Takuya are there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That sounds like something you'd both do.\" Audrey only needed a second to imagine something like that happening with the two of them. \"I find myself looking at the stars often too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wondering where your place in the world is too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Audrey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are you going to take your shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was referring to a shot in a game of pool. The two teens had been spending time after breakfast playing various games in the recreational room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, sorry. I got caught up in our conversation.\" The blonde then made her shot, which didn't earn her a single point. For the third shot in a row. \"Whats the score again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, six to seventeen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed in frustration, not that she was surprised she was doing so poorly. \"This game is harder then chess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You wanna play something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating breakfast with Micott, Takuya, Haro, Mihiro and Riddhe, the circle of friends split into two groups. Apparently Banagher's childhood friends and the two Federation officers were going to finish up the eating contest from yesterday, which they would need Haro for to count the dishes. Riddhe himself was surprised he was able to drag Mihiro with him into this again. Especially given the obvious effect the eating contest had on all their bodies. Not only had Audrey and Banagher gone from chubby to fat, but Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro had gone from thin as rials to pudgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe's gain was mostly focused on his belly, which was now a round potbelly that got jiggly with every step. He did also have more junk in his trunk, which made the cockpit of his ReZEL a bit snug. Some moobs were beginning to develop as well. His face was already soft, and his weight gain only made it softer, making his cheeks more round and chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro's gain had spread evenly, but with a bit more emphasis her chest and butt, the former making her bra a bit snug and the latter nearly reaching bubble butt status, though she did also have a pudgy tummy, wider legs, and a rounder face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's weight gain had spread completely evenly. A round soft belly suited his status as a geek, which Micott teased him about as she gave it a slap to see it jiggle. Man boobs were starting to form and his butt was fatter. His freckles went along well with his fatter cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro told them that after this she was going to help them all get in shape. It was a bit hard to resist to temptation to note that Audrey and Banagher needed it the most but she didn't want to be mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this left the duo of Audrey and Banagher alone for a whole day. The Gundam pilot suggested they check out the recreational room, and the princess suggested they bring four boxes of hot extra pizza with them, two for each of them. The chef of the Nahel Argama was already used to what gluttons this duo could be and found it charming to see a young couple enjoying themselves so much, so she got the pizza ready on the double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe people throw something this sharp just to pass the time.\" Audrey said as she looked at the throwing dart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you'd think that.\" Banagher then threw his dart, which landed in the inner ring of the board. \"Especially now that we've got this huge balloons attached to us.\" He gave his tummy a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What balloons?\" Audrey then threw her own dart, which hit the outer ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, the ones we're putting all that food in.\" Banagher threw another dart, which landed in the outer ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get what-Oh! Now I get it. He he!\" Audrey threw another dart, which barely even managed to hit the board. \"Miss Mihiro would probably be mad at us if she saw how much pizza we're going to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she does, just point out she got roped into another eating contest.\" Banagher half jokingly said as they continued ot play, Audrey consistently getting low scores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine she's already a bit mad at herself over that. Which team do you think is going to win?\" Audrey was imagining all of them as being so fat they were cartoon-ish balls of fat that needed to be rolled around. She found it an oddly cute idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say Takuya and Micott, they were amazing yesterday, especially Micott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tempted to say Mr Riddhe and Miss Mihiro-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call them Riddhe and Mihiro, it's pretty safe to say they're our friends at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. As I was saying I would normally expect Riddhe and Mihiro to win, seeing how they're adults, but after their rather poor performance and how well Micott and Takuya did, I have to agree with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think Riddhe did pretty good, it was Mihiro that held him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey threw the last dart of the game, which surprisingly nearly got to the bullseye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Banagher.\" Audrey felt some glee, not just from the shot itself, but also the praise she got from Banagher. \"Now, how about some chess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, though you'll probably win every match. I can barely keep up with you on checkers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the bridge of the ship, Captain Otto Mitas had just finished a frustrating argument with Daguza that did nothing to sway either of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that ECOAS can do as they please during an operation, but I wish they'd get off our backs while we're giving them a free ride.\" Otto complained.  \"To say nothing of that prima donna from Anaheim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complaining to us about it won't affect the situation.\" Second in command Liam Borrinea reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtto just grumbled. He knew that but it was always nice to have someone complain with you, to know you're not the only one with those feelings. An alarm then set off. \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The derelict ship we encountered has decelerated.\" One of the bridge crew stated. \"Now traveling at relative speed zero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haunted by ghosts of the One Year War.\" Otto mused. \"Have the mobile suits eliminate it. They can move something that size, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they've already returned.\" Liam reminded her captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-they what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those were your orders, Captain. Would you like to give the order to send them back out?\" Liam rhetorically asked. A question like that normally wouldn't be rhetorical, but she knew her captain well enough that in order to hide his embarrassment he would exclaim along the lines of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just blast it with the main guns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the recreational room, Audrey and Banagher were enjoying a game of chess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The knight can't do that.\" Audrey once again informed Banagher on the rules of chess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was too easy.\" Banagher said. \"Why is the knight a horse anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to represent a knight riding the horse, if the piece were to depict that in full, it would clash badly with the style of the other pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it should be a suit of armor, that would be much cooler.\" Banagher then made his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't deliberately move your king into check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sighed. \"I have no idea how so many people can remember all the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Video games seem much more complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. They're much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make heads or tails of the terms used on the back of the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just because you haven't played any yet.\" Banagher used a pawn to make the only move he thought could be even remotely good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be able to once those games are finished downloading.\" Audrey made her move. \"I knew the previous crew of this ship was unorthodox but I never would've imagined they'd use military funds to buy video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, I can't imagine going a whole year without video games.\" Banagher commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach of both teens then growled loudly in hunger. Their chubby cheeks went a bit red at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it's time for some pizza.\" Banagher said with sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, all the games we've been playing have worked up quite the healthy appetite.\" Audrey said wearing a similar grin, resting a hand on the top of her dome of a middle self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fat love birds started eating pizza to their hearts' content, Marida was exercising in her room on the Garencieres. The completely obese redhead was wearing a purple workout bra, purple workout shorts, and purple workout shoes. With the song she had playing already stuck in her head, she was ready for the first exercise: Touching her toes. It was a simple yet effective way to start working out again after neglecting her diet and exercise regime for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there was the problem that she couldn't even see her feet, her huge belly and chest completely blocking her view. She sucked in her stomach but she still couldn't see her feet. She inhaled deeply and then exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to touch her toes, her belly squishing against her tits and legs as she did so. The Neo-Zeon pilot's face turned red with exhaustion as she sweat and huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* Come... on! *Huff* *Huff*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost reached them but soon had to give up, and planted her large booty on the floor to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, *Huff*, that won't work.\" She wiped the sweat from her brow with her meaty arm.</span></div></div>",

Not only did her gut make it rather hard to do a proper push up, squishing against the floor like a pillow with every push up, but the redhead got out of breath rather quickly, only able to do twenty push ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jumping *Huff* jacks will work, my stomach can't possibly get in the way of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't but jumping jacks were even more exhausting as she had to use her entire body for the exercise instead of just half at most. Her entire body jiggled with every jump, and the jumping itself was murder on her out-of-shape legs. After only fourteen jumping jacks, she had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only exercise she could do now, having left her exercise equipment at home, were sit ups. She knew they would be the hardest but she was determined to lose weight no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *Huff* can do... at *Huff* least.... one!\" Marida face was red as tomato as she sweat profusely. The expression on the poor redhead's made it clear as day how painful this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried with all her might, trying to heave her upper body up, pressing against her mighty gut that was covered in sweat. After thirty seconds of this pain, Marida simply had to give up. She flopped back onto her back, her upper body jostling from the impact. Huffing and puffing, the Kshatriya pilot was as filled with frustration as she was ice cream on a hot day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* *Huff*, I *Huff* need to lose weight *Huff*\" She looked at her humongous belly, which was taking up the majority of her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marida.\" Gilboa's friendly voice rang over the intercom. \"We found the Federation ship that's got the key to the box. Head to the bridge and the captain will brief you on the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida had to take a few seconds to catch her breath before she could answer. \"Under -*Huff*- Understood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned her attention to her titanic tummy, it was like a mighty mountain that stood in her way, or a huge monument to her gluttony. It pretty much was both to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I let myself go so badly.\" She thought to herself. \"I'm a complete hog, unlike princess Mineva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRAAP! Ahh, this is the life.\" Audrey belched loudly as she slapped her big belly in satisfaction, happily stuffing herself with pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you said it! UUUUURRRRP!\" Banagher agreed, belching loudly as he gave his massive gut a few pats. He was also happily pigging out on pizza as they conversed. \"You know, there's something awesome about a girl who can belch like a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed and smiled at Banagher's compliment. \"Thank you, Banagher. And I must say, there's something equally awesome about a boy who can also belch like a monster! I'm using the word awesome correctly, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and don't worry, you are.\" Banagher said with a goofy grin, blushing in joy. \"Never had a girl compliment my burping skills before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're criminally underrated. UURRRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recreational room was oddly empty the whole day, so Audrey and Banagher were free to gorge and belch as much as they wanted without fear of embarrassment. The princess didn't even have her coat or pants buttoned and zippered, as she was in private with Banagher, who had to walk around with his pants and belt undone. The two obese teens were already halfway through their first pizza. They leaned back in the comfortable lounge cushions as they gazed at the stars together, shooting the breeze with each other and wishing this moment would never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Banagher got halfway through his sixth slice when he hit a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURAP! Ugh...\" Banagher groaned, rubbing his swollen belly with one hand as he contemplatively looked at the slice of pizza in his other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Bana -URP- gher?\" Audrey asked in a concerned tone. She couldn't recall ever seeing her overfed friend like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm just not feeling up to it today. I'm full already.\" Banagher placed his half finished slice back in the pizza box next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've eaten far more then this in one sitting before.\" A certain disappointed blonde said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. UUURP! I don't know -URAP- what's wrong with me.\" Banagher groaned, disappointing Audrey felt far worse then the discomfort he was feeling but there simply wasn't anything he could do. \"I feel like I have a huge rock in my gut. I'm really sorry, Audrey. Next time we'll eat three extra large pizzas and a huge bowl of ice -URP- cream. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Audrey said, she tired to hide her disappointment but Banagher was the one person she wasn't capable of lying to. Well, except when it came to her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I completely failed you.\" Banagher said, the guilt he felt evident in his voice. \"I'm a fat guy spending time with a girl as wonderful as you, do you have any idea how lucky I am? All I had to do to keep you happy was talk with you and pig out and I couldn't even do the second part right. I'm really sorry, Audrey. I'll make it up to you somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey placed a soft hand on her friend's equally soft hand. \"It wasn't luck, you've earned this time with me.\" Audrey looked Banagher right in the eyes, her face was one of pure confidence. No blushing, no stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose emerald green eyes, just looking at them filled with Banagher with a soothing warmth. \"It's okay, you didn't fail me. Just talking with you is enough.\" Audrey assured him. She then let out a loud unladylike burp. \"Excuse me.\" Unlike every other time Audrey passed gas when she didn't mean to, there was no embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey... thanks.\" A smile smile formed on Banagher's chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. And I think there's a way for you to finish eating all your pizza.\" Audrey eyed the two pizza boxes stacked on top of each next to Banagher, she noticed that the brunette had left the top one open.\"Perfect.\" She thought to herself. \"You just need a helping hand.\" She told Banagher with a mischievous grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\" That was all Banagher could get out before Audrey tackled him to the ground, their big bellies hitting together and jiggling like jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was on top of her best friend now. Still smiling, she grabbed a slice of pizza. \"Open wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, what are you-\" Banagher's words were stifled as she shoved the pizza in his mouth, which he started eating.  The blonde made sure she was doing it in a way that ensured Banagher didn't choke. When Banagher finished his slice, Audrey grabbed another one and shoved it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for what felt like ages. As soon as Banagher finished his slice, Audrey forced another one in his awaiting maw as soon she was sure he had properly chewed and swallowed. She could feel her friend's belly getting big and bigger, pressing against her own stuffed gut more and more with every slice. She always kept a hand lovingly on the Unicorn Gundam pilot's sizable stomach, giving it a soothing rub that eased all the aches inside it. After every couple of bites, the princess of Zeon held a can of soda or a bottle of water up to Banagher's lips so he could drink it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this felt amazing to Banagher. The sensation of Audrey's love for him, his belly pressing into her's, how he could just lay there and be fed, and the massage she gave him, everything was perfect. Not only did Audrey find feeding Banagher like this incredibly fun, she loved how his confused expression gradually turned into one of pure pleasure and love. It erased all worries she had that she might've went a little too far. The brunette's chubby cheeks often had bits of foodstuff, like cheese and ketchup, on them. It was a cute sight but a messy one, so she always wiped his cheeks with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\" Audrey eventually said in a sweet tone with an equally sweet smile. She gave Banagher's gut a few friendly pats, making him burp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey got off her friend, who then slowly sat up. His tummy was absolutely stuffed to the brim, the biggest Audrey had ever seen it. It forced his hoodie and shirt to ride up even further past his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had to let out three great belches before he could answer. \"UUUURRRP! UUURRRAAP! UUUURRP! I feel...\" Banagher looked down at his stomach, he nearly did a double take at it, and then looked at Audrey's. \"I feel...\" He suddenly gained a mischievous grin of his own. \"I feel like two can play at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffed to the brim pilot then tackled Audrey just like she had to him, their bellies once again jiggling like they were blobs of jelly. Unlike when Audrey did this to him, they were both smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Audrey?\" He said as he held a slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Banagher then shoved the pizza into Audrey's mouth, the blonde moaning in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde loved how being fed like this felt, not just because of the amount of pleasure it gave her, but also because she knew this was the feeling she was able to give her fat best friend. Banagher's feeding of her was more or less the same as how Audrey fed him, but she had to remind him to wipe her cheeks, and there was a bit more belly play. Banagher viewed this as partly his way of thanking Audrey for how she comforted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a strong person with clear resolve. And I have no idea what the hell I'm going to do about the Unicorn or Laplace's box.\" Banagher thought to himself. \"But I know that I belong by Audrey's side, and that's all I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with that, you're done.\" Banagher said as he put the last slice of pizza in Audrey's mouth. He then rolled off her. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey finished eating and sat up. Her stomach was the biggest it had ever been, it forced her blouse to ride up well above her bellybutton. \"I feel great. UUUUURRRRRP!\" She said with a goofy smile.</span></div></div>",

His blonde friend giggled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would've an interesting little way to -UUURRRP- make the crash landing easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher released his breath, his tummy deflating back to it's normal massive size. \"Heh, you sure about the \"little\" part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. Speaking of your big belly, I think it would make for an excellent pillow.\" She joked and gave said big belly a pat before resuming massaging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's cheeks went red. A cute girl, Audrey no less, using him as a bed? \"H-Hey, if you want, you could give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's cheeks turned a similar shade of red, she immediately realized that might've sounded a bit too close to flirting.\"Oh, uh, maybe another time. You -UURP- You're really full, so my head would obviously cause you discomfort. Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" Banagher thought to himself that his fat best friend's tummy would make for a pretty nice pillow too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of awkward silence passed, only the sounds of two fat bellies gurgling and being rubbed filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say -UUUUURRP-! Sorry about that, I wanted to say thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For giving me a place where I feel like I belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi felt both her heart warm at that, and guilt at the same time. On one hand, she was so happy she could help Banagher. On the other hand, that place was incredibly dangerous. A part of her wanted to shoo Banagher away for his own good. The rest of her wanted to give Banagher a big hug and thank him for everything. Though despite all the physical contact they had, hugging was still something a tad too romantic for the socially inexperienced blonde. Belly rubs were just helping a friend out, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... happy to help.\" Audrey said. \"There's something I want to say too. Thank you for -UUUURRAAP-! Oh, great, now I've got that habit too.\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for -UUURRRP-!\" Audrey was now visibly frustrated. \"Thank you for -URAAAAP-!\" Audrey looked even more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna wait until your stomach settles down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N -URP- No. I need to say this now.\" Audrey thumped her chest to get a belch out, her big boobs jiggling from the action, which Banagher thought was really hot. \"Thank you being such a wonderful friend. Whew, I finally -UUURRRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a bellyful laugh, his stomach and chubby cheeks jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\" Audrey said, Banagher kept laughing. \"Your sense of humor is incredibly immature.\" It only took a few seconds for the Zabi's pout to turn into a barely restrained grin. Then a smile. Then a chuckle. And finally she was laughing as hard as Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated couple spent more time, chatting, belching and giving each other tummy rubs they looked at the stars. They talked about a variety of things, like dreams, how they reacted when realized they got so fat, bets on how much fatter they and their friends would by the end of the week, TV shows they liked, what video games Banagher wnated to show her, or how despite spending so much time looking at the stars neither of them actually knew any constellations. The blonde also told the brunette about some amusing stories of Marida's weight gain, such as how she once snapped a belt right in front of Full Frontal, though Audrey just referred to him vaguely as \"her superior\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of this, Banagher remembered those games should be done downloading now. Still bloated as hell, it was really tough for either of these fatso to get up, even with them helping each other, but they eventually did it. It felt like exercise to them. The Zabi buttoned her coat and pants, as well as did her zipper, to look presentable. Despite being several sizes larger then when she woke up, somehow she was able to do it. It was very uncomfortable though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them started walking to Banagher's room, their legs and stomachs jiggling and jostling with every footfall. There were the normal symptoms that came after their now-customary large meals: some belches here, some groans there. At one point, Audrey became seriously worried that a button on her dress might pop off, forcing Banagher to (somewhat disingenuously) assure her everything would be fine. It\u2019d be one thing if something like that were to happen in private; the two had gotten used to their clothes malfunctioning from their ballooning weights. But Audrey was a princess at heart, and the thought of showing that sort of indecency in public would be one she\u2019d rather avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from the brunette's room, they passed Daguza and Conroy in the hallway. Initially the soldiers paid them no mind, but Daguza realized the blonde looked very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, the blonde.\" The ECOAS officers stopped walking, the duo they addressed followed suit. \"Whats your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey swallowed down a burp. \"ECOAS\". She thought. \"I should've factored them in. It only makes sense an anti-terrorist unit would be searching for me.\" \"My name is Audrey Burne.\" She answered. \"Is that all? As you can see, me and my friend just had a big lunch, and we would like to return to his quarters to digest.\" The girl formally going by the name of Mineva Lao Zabi could feel Daguza scanning her face like a hawk examining his prey to determine if it was time to strike. She felt like she was getting an x-ray done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it me or is there some hostility between these two?\" The brunette pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, I won't stop you.\" Daguza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She and her equally engorged friend resumed walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were out of earshot, ECOAS officers being experts at indicating when that was, Conroy asked his superior a question. \"Something up, commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conroy, I think we found her. That was Mineva Lao Zabi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConroy's relaxed disposition was gone right there and then. \"I'll boot up the database.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey groaned as she sat down on the edge of Banagher's bed alongside it's owner, she and Banagher had mercifully made it without collapsing. She undid her coat and pants, letting her tummy surge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know him?\" The pilot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ECOAS officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you seemed kinda pissed off at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just imagining it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyways we've got a few games to pick from. We can start with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room shook, causing them to fall off the bed, with Audrey landing right on top of Banagher, the impact making them burp simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I'm too full for this.\" Banagher groaned. Audrey belched in agreement.</span></div></div>",

It hadn't hit the Nahel Argama but rather the debris of the destroyed colony around it, which the explosion had sent some of colliding with the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All units, scramble!\" Liam ordered on the bridge, the first one to recover from the sock of such a sudden attack. \"Turn about, full speed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damage report and scan the area!\" Otto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no one out there!\" One of the bridge radarman reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look harder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of missiles was fired from the Neo-Zeon vessel, Rewloola. They all missed the ship and hit the debris around it, triggering the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've fallen into a trap.\" Liam said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Otto was about to contemplate their next move, Alberto's annoyed voice was transmitted via the intercom. \"This is your fault, Captain! You and your indecision!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we had-\" A bridge crewman quickly cut the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got intense heat signatures approaching at high speed.\" The radarman reported. \"I count four total. They're approaching from directly above us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they missiles?\" The captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir. Not judging by the flight paths. I'd say they're mobile suits. But the way they're navigating the debris field... It's impossible... The lead machine is approaching at... three times the speed of the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead machine that was navigating the debris field as if it were just a minor distraction was a red mobile suit known as the Sinanju, the Red Comet's successor machine to the Sazabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be interesting.\" Uttered it's pilot, Full Frontal, the Second Coming of Char Aznable. \"Let's test the performance of your brand-new Gundam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while in his room, Banagher's eyes widen as he felt some sort of uneasiness. Of course the whole situation made him more then uneasy (and nauseous from how the ship was shaking and that Audrey was still on top of him) but what he felt here was different. More like it was coming from just one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these the same guys that attacked the colony?\" He asked, not even trying to get up as he knew it was impossible with Audrey still on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Audrey, she slapped her hands over her mouth as she felt her lunch about to come up. Banagher winced as he saw that, afraid she was about to hurl on him. Thankfully for both of them, the nausea passed. \"Oh I'm going to kill Marida.\" She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't any better in the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I can't take this anymore! UUUURRRP!\" Micott yelled in frustration with her hands grabbing her head, her stomach stuffed to the gills. Her shorts unbuttoned and unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott, we've gotta look -UUURRP- for normal suits!\" Takuya instructed, equally as full. His belt undone along with his pants. \"This ship could get a hole blasted into it any second!\" Haro bounced back onto the cushion next to Takuya, having been knocked off it by the shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott, Takuya, put these on.\" Mihiro passed them normal suits. Like them, she was stuffed, her uniform pants and belt undone. She was glad their guts were about to be covered by the normal suits, even if the bulge would still be visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe was already on his way to the hanger. He wasn't going to let a bloated stomach stop him from fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turrets on the Nahel Argama fired in vain at the Sinanju, the red machine easily managed to dodge every shot and return fire, destroying eight turrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anti-air def-What're you doing?!\" Otto yelled. He and the rest of the bridge crew had just gotten into their normal suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't acquire a lock.\" One of the gunners informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the system, just shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Argama fired anti-air missiles at the Sinanju and moved back. The missiles all missed but it at least forced the Sinanju far enough away from the ship that Full Frontal couldn't fire back for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher -UUURRAP-! Not again.\" Audrey attempted to start. She rolled off her friend before trying again. \"Banagher, listen to me. That machine's systems are registered to your biometric data. Which means it can't be operated by anyone but you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's face was one of pure confusion. \"That's what I'm told, but... but how do you -UURP- know all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped. \"I want you to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rear main gun of the ship was destroyed. The explosion caused another tremor in the ship, which proved annoying to Conroy's work on the Nahel Argama's terminal, whcih they had uploaded their data to via hard drives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh.\" He groaned. \"Damn amateurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. As long as they believe we have the Box, they will try to neutralize our ship without destroying our engines.\" Daguza assured his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it hard to believe a single mobile suit can neutralize the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fighting broke out in Industrial 7, the ECOAS team had downloaded data on the staff and students of the Anaheim Electronics Industrial College. Knowing the close ties the Vist Foundation had to the school, even ignoring that Cardeas Vist was the chairman of it, they had suspicions of Vist Foundation members among the denizens of the school. Having been told that all the civilians aboard this ship belonged to that school including Audrey, looking at her student ID was an easy way to confirm their suspicions of her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Conroy said as he found the fake file Cardeas had forged on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey Burne<br>\r\nSex: Female     Age: 16<br>\r\nBirthplace: Side 1, 003 Eden<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudent Code: ALB05674293800<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepartment: Technology<br>\r\nFaculty: Resource Development<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, definitely a fake. The photo doesn't even have her wearing the uniform. Probably just used the best shot a security camera gave him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the situation, Cardeas and the rest of the Vist Foundation most likely didn't have time to properly forge the ID. They probably planned on doing later.\" Daguza surmised. \"At any rate, I'm certain who's attacking this ship is aware that Mineva is on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can escape if we go now.\" Audrey stated, she then slowly stood up. \"We could head back to Industrial -UUUURRP- 7 with Micott and Takuya. You'll all sneak onto a cargo vessel and find some place to hide in one of the Sides. While you do that, I'll figure out some way to dispose of that machine. I'll contact -UUURAAP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aud -URP- rey...\" Banagher uttered. He then started the process of standing up. \"What's been with you today?\" He thought to himself. Just a few minutes she was laughing with him about dumb stuff like Marida burping over the intercom. Now she was reminding him of how distant she was when they first met. Before she ate that faithful hot dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we don't do it... That thing is just too dangerous. I can't let anyone get their hands on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just wait a sec!\" Now standing up, Banagher grabbed the Audrey's shoulders and got closer, their stomachs pressing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I -UUURRAAP- will explain it to you -URAP- later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you won't tell me anything, then how can you expect me to agree -UUUUURAAP- with you? Stop trying to convince me by talking like this. It isn't fair.\" Those words Banagher spoke were enough to make Audrey's visibly surprised, it made her realize she hadn't considered Banagher's feelings at all when she came up with this plan, just his safety. \"Audrey, what do you wanna do? Don't tell me what it is that you should do, your responsi -UUURRRP- bility.  Tell me what it is that you want to do.  If you do, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at her feet in guilt and uncertainty. Well, she tried to, her massive stomach completely blocked the sight of them. She racked her mind for the answer to what was the most difficult question she had ever been faced with. \"... I want -UUUURRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Zabi heir could start again, the door suddenly slid open, revealing the intimidating sight of Daguza and Conroy in their ECOAS gear. Audrey moved away from Banagher in hopes he wouldn't get caught up in this. Conroy stood in front of Banagher to keep him away from Audrey without roughing him up. Daguza roughly grabbed Audrey by her soft shoulder and pulled her towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you-\" Banagher said in protest as he tired to intervene but was kept back by Conroy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why I'm here.\" Daguza stated to Andrey, who just solemnly looked down in defeat. She silently went with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher tried to follow her but was physically held back by Conroy.</span></div></div>",

Trajectory is set!\" Mihiro announced, the Nahel Argama preparing to launch it's entire mobile suit team. \"Catapult hatches one through four, open! Mobile suit corps, get into launch position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hanger opening to launch his ReZEL, Riddhe had a prepared yet slightly nervous expression. He thought back to how he had asked Mihiro to see a movie together, she said she wanted him to pick out the movie but told him the type of movie she really hated. Riddhe felt like an idiot when he realized he had already forgotten what type of film that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Is the tubby rich kid getting cold feet?\" Homare teased in a friendly manner, it was his usual way of helping others calm their nerves before combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm pretty sure I heard your voice crack, Lieutenant Homare.\" Riddhe cracked back. He knew it wasn't true but it just wouldn't right to not fire back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just wait till we get back. Then we'll see who pissed their suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norm Basilicock, Romeo 001, launch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galoma Gorga, Juliet 002, launch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddhe Marcenas, Romeo 008 taking off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team took off, Riddhe was the second to last to take off, Homare quickly falling suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homare, Romeo 004 heading out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomare's ReZEL was only out of the hanger for a second before the Sinanju effortlessly hit it with a shot that went right through the top of it's chest. The impact from the shot sent Homare's ReZEL off the catapult deck before it exploded. The shot had hit the reactor, causing an explosion large enough to destroy most of the catapult deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe looked back in horror, sweat on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severe damage port side catapult deck\" One of the bridge crew reported, the bridge shaking from the explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Homare!\" Mihiro shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up with the damage report!\" Otto ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here and head to the Moon!\" Alberto ordered as he walked in, wearing his own normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Alberto, it's dangerous for you to be here.\" Liam told the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Sinanju! It's the Red Comet! You can't defeat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtto grumbled. He really wanted to say something that would shut this fatso up, but there really was no way he could honestly claim he was certain they would win this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two years ago, our experimental mobile suit MSN-06S was stolen by Neo Zeon while it was being transferred from the lunar city Granada to a testing ground at Von Braun.\" Alberto stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju headed into the debris field, followed by the three remaining pilots of the Nahel Argama team. The plan was that Norm and Riddhe would force it towards a pint in the debris field where Galoma was waiting for it. Riddhe tried to land a shot with the mega beam launcher but soon realized that was impossible once he saw how fast it moved. Each shot Romeo 001 and 008 fired missed, but they got the Sinanju to head in the direction they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Federation Forces that were sent to get it back were completely wiped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\" Galoma fired rapidly with both of his Stark Jegan's beam rifles. Once again, each shot missed, despite how fast the firing was, and the Sinanju flew right past the Jegan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they say the one responsible is Full Frontal, the man they call the Second Coming of Char Aznable, the Red Comet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull Frontal hadn't fallen for the plan, he just didn't bother to go a different direction because the one they planned on him taking was the most convenient and he knew he didn't have to worry about getting shot down. The Sinanju quickly reached the Nahel Argama. It dodged every shot from the turrets and fired back, destroying another turret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of this story before.\" Liam said. \"The \"Ghost of Char\", who destroyed two Clop-class ships with a single mobile suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship shook again from another hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Char went missing during the Second Neo Zeon War, never to be heard from again!\" The captain pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, your men don't stand a chance out there.\" Alberto handed the radarman an Anaheim Electronic information card, which he put into the ship's database.\"Their mobile suits are useless. The Unicorn was made based on data collected from the Sinanju. We've got to get out of here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we run now, we'll be attacked from behind.\" Otto claimed. \"Transfer the data to each section of the ship! Our enemy is not a ghost. Send in the mobile suit corps too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot! You have no clue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last time you'll speak to me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the argument could continue, the bridge door opened. Everyone's eyes were drawn to the sight standing in the doorway. Audrey Burne, an obese teenager, with two imposing ECOAS soldiers flanking her, Daguza and Conroy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju dodged fire from the Argama's turrets. The ReZELs and Stark Jegan had caught up to it. The data on the Sinanju had just finished transferring to their machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\" Riddhe had the ReZEL fire it's mega beam launcher at at the seemingly easy target the Sinanju was. It evaded the shot, which instead hit an asteroid. The Sinanju used the destruction of it to move out of the sight of it's pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back, ensign Riddhe.\" Galoma ordered. \"Stay in formation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe burped in frustration and had his machine scan every area it could for it's target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galoma, below you!\" Norm warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaloma spotted the Sinanju and aimed the Jegan's rifles but a shot pierced the cockpit just a mere second before he could pull the trigger. He died thinking he was about to hit the Sinanju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be the real Char.\" Norm had to divert his eyes away from the light of the Stark Jegan's explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from the field, Full Frontal's royal guards were watching the battle unfold in their captain's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Angelo, we have multiple hostiles. Shouldn't we cover the Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. We need only stand by and watch, Ensign Sergei. We'd only get in the Captain's way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo 001 and 008 fired their mega beam launchers at the red machine. The red machine successfully evaded the shots and fired back at Riddhe's machine, destroying half it's left leg. The blonde's belly jiggled from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate, -UUURRRP- everyone will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all attacking mobile suits.\" Daguza spoke over the communications channel. \" You are ordered to cease fire immediately. We are holding Mineva Zabi captive aboard this ship.\" An image of Audrey appeared on the screen, Riddhe's eyes widening. \"I repeat: We are holding the Zabi heir, Mineva Lao Zabi, captive aboard this ship. If you do not halt your attacks immediately, we cannot guarantee her safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Takuya said, standing next to Micott, who gasped. Both were in their normal suits. They had heard the message over the communications panel in the mess hall. \"She's the princess of Zeon?\" Micott's face turned to one of anger over Audrey's seeming betrayal of their friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are prepared to begin negotiations. I'm sure you'll make the right decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher stared down at his bubbling gut dejectedly. Not over Audrey's heritage and identity, he couldn't care less about that, but because of the awful situation. He let out a burp and then started wobbling as fast as he could to the bridge, his big gut, flabby tits, and large ass bobbing and bouncing all the while. It didn't take long for his face to became red and sweaty with exhaustion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I have received the image.\" Full Frontal spoke over communications to the Nahel Argama bridge. \"I am Captain Full Frontal of Neo Zeon. Tell me. What are your demands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Char's voice...\" A communications officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Commander Daguza Mackle of the Earth Federation Space Force Special Operations Group, ECOAS. We are requesting that you cease your attacks and withdraw immediately. If you do, we can guarantee the safety of Mineva Zabi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just have her back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was annoyed. \"I don't know if you really are Char, but you're just as impatient and uncooperative as him.\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take one thing at a time. If you allow us to pass, then we can discuss that, once our ship has arrived in a safe location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're holding her as your hostage. However, we have no evidence that this person is the real Princess Mineva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems rather cautious for the man that people are calling the Second Coming of the Red Comet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you, we're nothing but terrorists, and since we are not part of your military, we cannot expect to be protected by international law, so you can understand our caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the highest regard for human rights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's quite a statement coming from people who send special forces into civilian colonies, and are now using hostages as shields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play innocent, both were in response to terrorist acts Neo-Zeon had committed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I chime in and say I agree with commander Daguza for once?\" Audrey said. She had a feeling Banagher would be proud of her if he was here to see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's voice was picked up Daguza's mic. It gave Full Frontal pause as he realized this was indeed Mineva. \"... If that's an imposter then I must say she does an excellent job at mimicking Mineva Zabi's voice and... attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go without the snarky comments, Full Frontal. I know that you realize it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, it's our turn to make some demands.\" Full Frontal stated. \" I request you hand over the materials you collected from Industrial 7 and all data pertaining to Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey swallowed down a burp, she was being extra careful not to belch now that she knew it would be picked up by Daguza's mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in exchange?\" The ECOAS commander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll guarantee your safe passage. Unless, of course, you object to the terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no objection. However, we are unable to comply. Because we never obtained Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you did retrieve a Gundam type mobile suit, did you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the property of the Federation, and has nothing to do with Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our side will determine this. If you won't accept our demands, we'll be forced to destroy your vessel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that with the prisoner on board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything pertaining to Laplace's Box takes priority. Of course I do want to retrieve both.\" The Second Coming of Char explained. \"I'll give you three minutes. I trust you'll come to a sensible decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza removed the communications headset he was borrowing. \"He's bluffing. He wouldn't forsake the guiding star of Zeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure...\" Audrey stated, all eyes now on her. She burped into her fist before continuing. \"Pardon me. If Full Frontal is in fact Char Aznable, he would be the son of Zeon Deikun, which means he holds the Zabi family responsible for his father's death. Why should he care about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting you should say that. You've removed any doubt in my mind that you are the princess.\" Daguza aimed his handgun at the side of Audrey's head, the barrel so close it was touching her blonde hair. Not a single change in expression, she looked at the gun, then at the headset and saw it was still turned on. She theorized it was most likely a ploy by Daguza to ensure Full Frontal knew he was serious about possibly killing the princess. \"And I bet that a good number of those Sleeves soldiers out there still believe in the Zabi family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you believe that, then by all means, continue this useless negotiation.\" Audrey said. \"However, the soldiers of Zeon don't play as nicely as you do. If you were a Zeon, all you'd be thinking about is how to destroy anything related to Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right!\" Alberto interjected. \"W-We should destroy the Unicorn's electronic system while we have the chance! That thing is the key not the actual box, so if we destroy it, and the safety of the Box will still be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConroy muffled and pulled back the fat man. Daguza glanced at the monitor. Nothing from Full Frontal yet. \"If we're lucky, he didn't hear that.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put the resolve of a Federation soldier to the test, Commander Daguza Mackle.\" Audrey turned to face the commander, the gun now pressed against her temple. \"If you have the strength, then destroy the key and take my life. Losing both the key and myself will undoubtedly deal a severe blow to Neo Zeon. Otherwise, continue to wait for them to storm in and take it from you. There's no time for indecision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtto and Mihiro were about to get up to stop Daguza, when a loud belch filled the air, startling everyone. Surprisingly, the source of it wasn't Audrey, though she did feel a big one bubbling up in her gut. Everyone turned their eyes to the source of it was that was standing in the doorway: Banagher Links, leaning on the doorway for much needed support as he tried to catch his breath, drenched in sweat and face red from exhaustion. He was huffing and puffing. \"Audrey!\" He said but his cheeks turned green and he covered his mouth to keep himself from vomiting. The nausea soon passed. Daguza stopped pointing the gun at Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette wobbled over to his best friend, on his round face was a look of worry and anger born from that worry. \"Stop talking like that. You\u2019re just forcing others and yourself down the path of despair like this. Just leave this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since Daguza and Conroy came for her, Audrey's stoic facade broke. She showed visible shock. \"Banagher... UUUURRRRP!\" Their bare tummies were now touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn\u2019t be involved in these things. Stay with us.\" Banagher grabbed Audrey\u2019s hand and intended to leave the scene. Audrey managed to steady her body that was about to be dragged away as she used all her out-of-shape strength to shake off the young man\u2019s soft, inviting hand. Banagher blinked in confusion and worry. \"Audrey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey repaired her cold exterior. \"I am Mineva Zabi, not Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying? You\u2019re Audrey. Whether you\u2019re lying or not, you\u2019re Audrey Burne to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her, this was the first time she got rebutted like this. Audrey gasped as she lowered her head slightly. Daguza told off the teenager who intended to grab her hand again. \"Enough. Children shouldn't concern themselves with adult matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher turned to face Daguza, the worry in his face was gone, only anger was left. \"If I'm such a child, then what about her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl is the princess of Neo-Zeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? That mean she's not human?! No way! If I\u2019m a kid, so is Audrey. Is using children as hostages the maturity I'm supposed to be looking up to?! Does being a grown-up just give you free reign to do whatever you please to people you think are below you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger released from Banagher's heart and soul shut Daguza up just as effectively as if Banagher had physically attacked him so severely he was knocked unconscious. Otto and Audrey stared at Banagher in amazement at the obese teenager. Otto finally sat back in his chair, knowing the situation was now in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to apologize to him for underestimating him so much.\" Audrey thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up.\" Full Frontal snapped everyone out of their thoughts. \"What is your decision?\"</span></div></div>",

No one had any answer, no one but Banagher. he looked aorund at the others in frustration, even Audrey and Daguza, who not even a full minute were completely convinced they knew exactly what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to act so sure -UUURRP- of yourself, at least try to do something.\" Banagher sassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... certainly got our father's way of lecturing others.\" Alberto thought to himself. He was pretty sure Banagher hadn't even noticed him and he still felt guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher yanked Mihiro's helmet off and then her headset. \"Hey!\" she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting Audrey.\" Banagher said into the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\" Full Frontal repeated in confusion. \"Is that code for something relating to Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mineva's real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mutual headache between us.\" Daguza answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All she wants is for everyone to stop fighting, and here you are, considering killing her!\" Banagher barked, his belly jiggled. \"Don't you care about her?! UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mineva Zabi's heritage does make her a valuable asset for Neo-Zeon, that is indeed true.\" Banagher was nearly jiggling with rage when he heard that. \"However, she has demonstrated and confessed that she holds no interest in Zeon holding supremacy over the Earth Federation. And Zeon has no need or want of those who refuse to embody it's ideals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line was then cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes!\" Otto shouted as the bridge returned their focus to their posts, Mihiro snatched her headset back from Banagher. \"Ready air defenses! Mobile suit corps, be prepared to intercept them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a box...\" Banagher grumbled. \"Why can't you just hand the damn thing over to them?! We don't even know what the Box is. Why do so many people have to die for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that no one else has to die for it.\" Daguza countered, Banagher glared at him. \"While we don't know the secrets hidden in Laplace's Box, some say it could overthrow the Federation. What if we were to turn over the Box only to cause even more people to lose their lives? Could you take responsibility for that? How would you explain to all those families that their love one had to die because you didn't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down at his stomach, which was still struggling to digest his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still a chance Full Frontal is bluffing, no matter what she's done I can't imagine a member of Neo-Zeon being so willing to throw away the last surviving Zabi.\" Daguza passed Conroy the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cease fire immediately. Otherwise we will be forced to execute Mineva Zabi.\" Conroy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship shook again from losing another turret, the vibrations making Audrey and Banagher's chubby bodies jiggle like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your last warning: cease fire on us immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher ran his hand against a chubby cheek, the same one his father placed his hand on before his death. \"If we just take down that red mobile suit, then you won't need Audrey as a hostage anymore, right? I'll do it!\" He wobbled off in a huff.Daguza, Audrey, and Alberto looked at him, the Zabi had a look of pure guilt on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, wait!\" Banagher heard those words, but they came from a different obese blonde then the one he hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alberto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to run off all half-cocked, there's something you'll need to use the Unicorn to it's full potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain in the hanger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlberto tossed Banagher a pilot suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This -URP- doesn't look like a Federation pilot's suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not, it's a Vist Foundation one specifically for the Unicorn's rider. It's specially designed to help the pilot withstand the ungodly amount of g forces the Unicorn gives when moving at full speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I won't pass -URAP- out again like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's cheeks were a bit red. \"Though it looks too small for me.\" He gave his tummy a few pats to drive the point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a man of size myself, I am all too aware of that feeling. So there's no need to feel embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe's ReZEL fired wildly at the Sinanju. \"Stand down! Stand -UUURRRP- down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddhe!\" Norm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault! How could you?! Did you really think taking a hostage would work against a bunch of terrorists?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju stopped and aimed directly at the cockpit of Riddhe's ReZEL. Riddhe tried to evade but because he lost half of his machine's left leg, all he could achieve was his machine spinning nearly in place, his gut shaking from it. Before the red mobile suit could fire a fatal shot, a beam came at it, forcing it to take tit's sights off Riddhe to focus on evading. Another beam came and the machine dodged that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shots came from Norm's beam rifle. He switched it into beam saber and then charged at Full Frontal, who had the Sinanju pull out and activate one of it's beam sabers, the blades of their machines locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensign Riddhe, control yourself.\" Norm advised his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju's beam saber was stronger then that of a mere mass production model's. It overpowered Norm's beam rifle and split it in half before slashing at the ReZEL itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorm's ReZEL exploded from the slash, the Sinanju flying away from it's kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Commander Norm...\" Riddhe's sorrow was immediately accompanied by rage. \"Bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju headed towards it's last target. Riddhe made his ReZEL ignite it's beam saber. Before he could charge, he felt this sensation. And so did the Sinanju pilot, who left Riddhe alone and moved to a different point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was...\" Riddhe zoomed in on the Nahel Argama to see one of it's hangers' opening to reveal the Unicorn ready to head out. The white mobile suit was wielding a beam rifle and a shield on its arms \"The Gundam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gundam is on catapult one!\" Mihiro alerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! Don't let it launch!\" The captain ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam pilot, identify yourself! You are not cleared for launch.  Return to the hanger bay immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAAP! Sorry about that, I just had a soda.\" Banagher blushed. It wasn't like he could not have one after that grueling run he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, mind your manners.\" Mihiro sighed. \"You're such a boy sometimes.\" She raised her helmet's visor to belch into her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey heard the sound of heavy footsteps and turned aorund to see Alberto waddling into the room. She wasn't the only one who spotted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this!\" Daguza pressed Alberto to the wall with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a compromise that could work for everyone.\" He claimed. \"The Unicorn's performance is unmatched. Even a pilot with no training can fend off the Red Comet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza tightened his hold of Alberto. \"You're practically giving the Box to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's only the key, and that boy is only one who can use it, you know that. And you know he'll never accept Neo-Zeon's way of doing things. There's no risk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza released his grip but kept glaring at Alberto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlberto walked over to one of the communications posts. \"You can hear me, right, Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything looks good.\" He answered. \"Except me in this suit.\" He thought to himself. It was a huge pain to get it zipped up over his fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey got closer to one of the monitors showing the situation in the hanger. Once again, Banagher had shattered her facade of coldness.  \"Banagher, don't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go over everything one more time. That pilot suit you're wearing has a medical sub-system designed to reduce strain on the body from G resistance. Don't worry about turning it on, Once the NT-D is activated, it'll kick in automatically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NT- -UUUURAP- -D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the mode in which the Unicorn's performance limiters are disengaged. You handled it the last time. You'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Launch preparations complete!\" Banagher confirmed. He inhaled deeply and then exhaled. He thought of all the times he had seen Amuro launch from the White Base in episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam. Now it was his turn. \"Detaching from ship!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The locks on the heels were released, and the Unicorn Gundam took off at a speed that allowed it to dodge a shot from the Sinanju, much to the surprise of Full Frontal. The Unicorn ascended far above the ship that only recently housed it. The machine's targeting system pointed him to where the Sinanju was hiding: Right behind an asteroid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn fired a shot at the asteroid, it pierced right through the middle. The only reason it didn't destroy the Sinanju and end Full Frontal's life was because he was closer to the side of the rock. The debris sent him off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\" Banagher uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn kept firing on the Sinanju, each one nearly close enough to damage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually struggling to dodge?!\" Full Frontal thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the shots that missed destroyed one of Full Frontal's Royal Guards by merely grazing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It barely grazed him, but...\" Angelo uttered. Of course a beam didn't have to acutely hit it's target to damage it, but for a stray shot to completely rip apart the Geara Zulu like it was wet paper? The sight of that filled Angelo with something he had never felt before: Fear for his captain's life. \"Captain!\" His purple Geara Zulu fired on the Unicorn twice, both shots missing. \"I can't believe I fired on the captain's perfect battlefield. I desecrated it!\" He began trembling with anger at both Banagher and himself, mostly himself. \"You made me shoot! I'll make you pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher realized he had spent too much ammo too quickly. He was breathing heavily. \"Stay calm, stay clam, Banagher. You've been trained for this.\" Images of his old life in the Vist Foundation mansion, the life he had forgotten, flooded his mind. The piano. The experiments. The Lady and the Unicorn. His breathing calmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn reloaded the beam magnum and fired a few more shots. However, both he and the targeting system soon lost sight of the red mobile suit. He came under the furious fire of the Royal Guard team. He increased his speed to dodge the shots, his entire chubby body shaking from the force. His targeting system spotted the Sinanju and Banagher resumed firing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju evaded every shot \"It doesn't matter how powerful you are if you can't hit me.\" It's pilot said. Igniting its beam saber, the red mobile suit charged at the white one. Banagher panicked at how fast the suit was approaching, but the Unicorn ascended at the last moment even without any input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moved for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relief was cut short when he saw a beam from Angelo's Geara Zulu about to hit him. He raised his shield, but to his surprise, that triggered it's I-Field. Something Banagher didn't even know it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? it has an I-Field?\" Full Frontal uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn reloaded the magnum and started firing at the Sinanju from a stationary point, hoping that would improve accuracy. he kept firing, each shot coming a little close to hitting their mark then the last. Until he saw an explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm came from his radar and he spotted the Sinanju right next to him. It had released it's two propellant tanks so their explosion would serve as a decoy to trick Banagher into thinking he had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju gave a fearsome kick that sent the Unicorn into a nearby asteroid. The impact from the kick had forced a huge burp out of Banagher. Banagher was barely conscious as the Sinanju prepared to stab the Unicorn with it's beam saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Banagher thought of \"Audrey...\" The Unicorn's NT-D system activated and the Unicorn went into Destroy Mode, bearing the face of Gundam. It flew away from the asteroid, which was all it's red opponent hit. It then chased after the Unicorn, to those watching this field from afar, it looked like two incredibly fast streaks of light, one red and the other blue, were striking each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it.\" Banagher had confidence. He had resolve. \"So this is Gundam. Here we go, Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mobile suits slashed at each, the Sinanju's beam saber was locked with the Unicorn's beam tonfa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I had forgotten the incredible frustration Gundam so often fills me with.\" Full Frontal stated. \"So you're the successor of Amuro Ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just Banagher Links!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machines pulled away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can flank him! Climb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did as Riddhe instructed. The ReZEL fired the mega beam launcher from below it's target, who dodged as expected. However, this put the mobile suit right in the Unicorn's line of fire. The horned mobile suit fired  a shot at the Sinanju, which managed to destroy the thruster on it's right leg. Anyone less skilled then Full Frontal would've been killed by that shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sinanju began pulling back. The Unicorn chased after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Don't get in too close!\" Riddhe warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn continued pursuing it's target. But then Banagher felt this sudden sense of dread wash over him. Distorted giggling, almost mechanical, echoed in his mind. He obeyed his instincts and moved back but a pale blue mobile suit jumped out from behind an asteroid in front of him. It charged at him maniacally, two beam sabers ignited. It's eyes were red, seemingly with rage, and various parts of it were glowing a heated orange, similarly to the Unicorn. This machine was known as the Todesritter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Todesritter's beam saber locked with the Unicorn's beam tonfa, but that ended as quickly as it began. The Unicorn pulled back when Banagher saw the pale blue mobile suit about to strike him with the other saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher could do anything, he was grabbed by the Kshatriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Quad-Wing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn fired it's vulcan guns but the much larger green mobile suit delivered a swift punch to the Unicorn's chest. The impact from it put Banagher on the verge of passing out and forced a giant belch from his stomach, his entire body jiggling from the the the fearsome punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRP! I'm sorry, Audrey...\" He was heard via the communications channels by all the combatants on the field and those onboard the Nahel Argama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida recognized him \"Why is that boy inside the Gundam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's eyes opened and greeted him with the last thing he would've expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple ordinary house. He looked around and realized he was on a couch in what seemed to be the living room and that someone had removed his boots. He looked at the door and saw his boots placed near it like he had put them there after coming home from school. He spotted a nearby kitchen that was close to the door, a dining table on the other side of the room. He could tell this meant he wasn't in a big house. Probably just one floor, not counting the attic. He placed a hand on his stomach, it was still rock hard, so only a few hours at most had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I lose?\" He thought to himself. \"What am I saying? Of course I did, I remember it. But being in an ordinary house makes even less sense then. There's not even any restraints or guards, so what is this? Was I rescued? Did Audrey did somehow find a place to hide me as part of that insane plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone home?\" He asked. No response. He looked around the room, he didn't get up of course, not with a stomach this full on top of the headache that punch gave him. He didn't see any photos lying around that could've shown the face of whoever lived here. Or faces of the people who lived here, possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave up and just laid down there, resting. Drumming his fingers on his belly, it was clear he would just have to wait for the owner to return. Besides thinking was painful with this headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of just laying down, watching TV, thank God the remote was within reach, he heard the doorknob turn. And who entered was the last person he would've expected: Marida Cruz. She was out of breath, in the same state Banagher was when he ran to the bridge, complete with being stuffed to the brim. Only she was wearing her exercise clothes. Banagher just looked at her in confusion... and something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* *Huff* I see you're awake.\" Marida wiped the sweat off her brow, she finally had caught her breath. \"My name is Marida Cruz and you'll be living with me from now on. UUURRRAAP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher couldn't explain why, but he found the sight in front of him really hot and was glad his gut now completely covered his crotch. He just wished this was in a much different context.</span></div></div>",

UUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Palau, a civilian mining asteroid in Side 6. It's the base of operations for Neo-Zeon.\" Marida explained. \"You were brought here after your battle with Full Frontal. In order to help you understand us and come around to our way of thinking, you'll be living here. I'll be serving as your guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like my jail -UUUUURRRP- or.\" Banagher angrily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate if you could show some manners when belching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just let out a huge one yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's puffed up cheeks went a tad red. \"Yes, but I apologized for that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, where's my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be sharing one with me, my house only has one bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Banagher's cheeks went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll answer any questions you have once I get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida then wobbled to her room, Banagher was lost in the mesmerizing way her gut, tits, butt and legs jiggled and jostled with every step. Right before she entered her room, she burped into her fist (Banagher could still hear it at the couch) and said \"Excuse me.\". Banagher double-checked that his belly completely covered his crotch and was relived that it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya's never gonna let me live this down.\" Banagher thought. \"What should I do? Maybe I should make a break for it while she's changing. No, that wouldn't work, not while I'm this stuffed. Even if I could get to the Unicorn and fight my way out, I don't even know where the Argama is. Or where Palau is in the first place. Audrey and the others must be plotting a rescue right now, right? They've gotta be, so I should just stay here and wait for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida soon left her room and returned to the living room. She was now wearing her causal clothes, only without the boots. Because of how distended her middle was from stuffing herself, she had to leave her sash undone, her pants unbuttoned and unzipped, and her shirt was left zipped up to only her large boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you -UURRRAP-! Pardon me. I hope you don't mind me leaving my stomach exposed. I'm rather full, as you've no doubt noticed, so I can't zip my shirt all the way.\" Marida matter of factly said, resting a hand on the top of her well-fed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sat up. \"Of course I don't mind, it's not like mine is covered any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida sat down next to Banagher, the couch groaning from her added weight as she did, and they watched TV together. At first neither of them said anything, which felt unbearably awkward for Banagher. Since he was going to be stuck living with Marida for a while, the brunette figured he should try to have a positive relationship with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate two whole extra large pizzas to get this stuffed.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, so how much did you eat to get a belly -URP- that stuffed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five tubs of ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impressive.\" Banagher complimented. \"No way I could eat that much. What gave you the idea to eat so much? Were you -UUURAP- celebrating or going for a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURP! Excuse me. No, I got hungry while I was waiting in ambush for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I see.\" Banagher thought they were going to go back to awkward silence, but then he realized something. \"Wait, you had five tubs of ice cream in your cockpit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am trying to lose weight, but I couldn't risk my hunger breaking my concentration. And your fight -UUUURP-! Excuse me. And your fight was rather long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long enough for my gut to get any softer.\" A loud gurgle escaped from Banagher's belly. \"Oof, it's still busy digesting all that -UUURAAAP- pizza.\" He said as he rubbed his swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we're both struggling with our gluttony. UUUURRAP! Ugh, excuse me.\" Marida was rubbing her own fat belly.\"I'm going to be doing some exercise tomorrow. You're welcome to join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks. Though I'm probably going to be pretty bad at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm any better.\" Marida looked down at her gut in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're pretty fast for, uh...\" Banagher thought on how to phrase this in an unoffensive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida burped and apologized for it before interjecting. \"Don't censor yourself, it's not like I'm unaware of my obesity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You're pretty fast for someone as fat as you are. No -URAP- way me and Audrey would've been able to get away from you if we were as fat as we are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're overestimating me, but thank you.\" Marida replied. She thought back to when they first met at Industrial 7. \"I have to say, I'm surprised by how fat and out-of-shape you've gotten in such short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher immediately thought back to all the times he and Audrey had been pigging out together these past few days. \"You wouldn't say that if you saw how much I've been eating lately.\" The fat young man slapped his belly, making it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched some TV together, tending to their distended middles the whole time. They were both burping a quite a bit, Marida apologized after each one while Banagher didn't bother. There was still some awkward silence here and there, but they were more talkative with each other. Though there were some moments where Marida missed obvious cues for her to engage in a specific topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's big belly grumbled loudly and he felt a sharp pain in his chest. \"Uh oh. UUUURRRRP! UUURRAAAAP! Oof.\" Two great uncontrollable belches came flying out of Banagher's mouth. He looked over at Marida to see exactly what he knew he would: Her chubby face glaring at him. Even with all that fat, her glare was still very intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you belch like that around the princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I, uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" The disapproval was evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is hard to believe , but Audrey's been burping as much as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida raised an eyebrow in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mineva's been burping as much as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell lies about the princess.\" Marida's words made Banagher feel like he was on the verge on a brutal ass kicking. Or having her sit on him with her massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm not lying, you saw her burp when we first met. Remember when I was rubbing her belly on the elevator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only saw her belch once.\" Marida said. \"Though I don't understand why she was so pleased to hear you compliment her for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's really changed since you last saw her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, I'd like if you could have some manners around princess Minev -UURRAAAAP-!\" A massive burp suddenly came roaring from Marida's mouth's. Her chubby cheeks blushing, Marida wore an expression of shock and embarrassment. Even Banagher was surprised. After a second of stunned silence, Marida tried to apologize. \"Excuse -UUUURRRRP-! UURRRRRAP!\" Two more giant belches forced their way out of her lips, her blushing and embarrassment intensified. She sighed. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice burping!\" Banagher complimented with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nothing to be proud of... but thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was going to throw up the whole -UURRRP- time, I'm still surprised I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't feeling any better. I'm glad I didn't have to fight as long as you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Marida were in their bedroom, they changed into their sleepwear after brushing their teeth, though Banagher said his mouth still tasted like pizza. Banagher was wearing blue button up pajamas, while Marida was wearing a red nightgown. Because of how bloated they were, Banagher had to leave his pajama shirt completely unbuttoned up to his moobs, even after showing his gut to so many he still wasn't ready to show those puppies off (except maybe to Audrey if she wanted to see them), and Marida's nightgown was clearly riding up. Though not so much she was left indecent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida placed another pillow on the left side of her bed after she moved her pillow from the middle to the right. \"Is that enough space?\" She asked as she sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so but, uh, can I sleep on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... it's that, you know, I-I-I'm not used to sleeping with g-girls. Audrey is the only one I've done it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Marida dashed from her side of the bed and tackled Banagher down to the ground. Marida had him pined to the ground with her strong gut, it was pressing painfully into Banagher's full tum, her boobs pressing into his tits. The collision made them jiggle and then burp at the same time, and since their faces were so close, it was in each other's faces. Banagher was visibly grossed out but Marida's soul piercing glare didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do fat girls keep doing this to me?\" Banagher groaned. At this point, he was expecting to have Mihiro and Micott pin him with their bellies at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you had sex with Mineva?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Banagher was sweating with fear, he looked the most terrified he ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you pressure her into sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I meant that we literally slept together! We've just been sleeping in the same bed a few times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida got off Banagher. \"I see.\" Marida stoically said. \"I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions. Things like that make me rather... quick to anger. I hope you can forgive me, I've been a poor guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It's fine. I worded that poorly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no excuse for my actions. I'll take you out for ice cream tomorrow, you can have as much as you want, it's on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a little kid, Marida. And I thought we were exercising tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go for chocolate, it's my favorite flavor. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate is my favorite too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first time Banagher woke up before Audrey did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to wake up.\" Marida said as she gently shook Banagher awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" Banagher said, still 75% asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to get up.\" Marida affirmed. \"It's 12 PM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher, now only 50% asleep, noticed that Marida was already in her Neo-Zeon uniform. \"I'm not an early bird like you, can I sleep in a little more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already let you sleep two hours longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this was one terrorist he can't negotiate with, Banagher reluctantly got out of bed, brushed his teeth, and got dressed. When that was done, he walked into the living room, seeing a plate with a big, tasty stack of waffles waiting for him on the kitchen table. Marida was eating her own stack of waffles, even though she had finished breakfast hours ago. Right next to her plate was a large notepad and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the paper for?\" Banagher asked as he sat down at the dinner table and started chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to file a report on how you became the pilot of the Unicorn and everything you know about it and Laplace's Box.\" Marida explained before she took another bite out of one of her waffles. \"Once the captain has read it, you'll be speaking with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher swallowed. \"I-I am? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from any questions he might have about your story, he'll want to see what your perspective on everything is. And help you understand ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't ever approve of the way Neo-Zeon does things. Besides, it's not like I look presentable like this.\" He then patted his exposed belly, which jiggled from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked down at her dome of a middle \"I'm not anymore presentable.\" Marida then looked back at Banagher. \"But that doesn't change what I have to do. Everyone is pushed into situations they don't think they're prepared for, but that doesn't mean they can't handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of silence followed as Banagher complemented the soldier's words. \"So, where should i start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Audrey woke up in her room. Normally she would've woken up in the brig, but after Full Frontal proved to everyone that despite her heritage Audrey was no member of Neo-Zeon, there really wasn't any reason to treat er like one. It helped that Mihiro, Takuya, and Riddhe all vouched for her. But that didn't help her feel any better, it didn't help her feel like all of this wasn't her fault. she felt that all the pain death that had happened these past few days were all her fault, and that the best friend she ever had was now captured by terrorists because of her. Her body felt like it was filled with bile, she felt this lump in her throat like she was about to cry, but not tears ever came out. She felt that she deserved to feel like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of just aimlessly laying in bed, she heard her tummy growl. She got of bed and put some pink slippers on. Still in her pajamas, she left her room and walked to the mess hall, endless thoughts of self-hatred filling her mind. It was like someone was following her everywhere and constantly telling her that she was a horrible person no one loves. If that was what was literally happening, she wouldn't protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got all the snacks she could carry and started walking back to her room. She spotted Micott and Takuya eating together at a table. Micott was fat while Takuya was still just pudgy. They were eating a lot of food, Audrey could immediately tell they were eating just to get their minds off things. She felt that was her fault, that if she hadn't suggested that eating contest, she would be the only fat one here. They didn't seem to notice the blonde, and the blonde left in hopes she wouldn't make things any worse for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her room, Audrey tossed her slippers off, laid down on her couch, and started stuffing herself with all the snacks she had brought with her. As soon as she finished a bag, she would just toss it aside. She didn't care that her room would get messy, she she felt she didn't deserve a clean room. Her belly grew more and more bloated with every bag, but it didn't feel good like the other times she pigged out. She could only think to herself that was a disgusting pig, and a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey belched loudly once she finished all the food, her gut very bloated, she thought herself disgusting for it.. She just laid there for a while, she wanted to just go back to sleep, but she found herself somehow unable to sleep. It felt like she was in limbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, Audrey looked at it, Riddhe standing in the door frame. Audrey returned to just aimlessly looking at the ground but Riddhe didn't stop looking at her. A few seconds of painful silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here to yell at you but... I can't.\" Riddhe said. Audrey didn't reply. \"I don't know what it's like to bear such a cursed family name, but I do know what it's like to feel weighed down by your family. The Marcenas family is incredibly influential in the Federation's political system, my father, Ronan Marcenas, is the chairman of the Settlement Issues Council, something I'm sure you know. I hated being treated differently by others, even when it was treating me better then everyone else. I wanted to be my own person, that's why I joined Londo Bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words reached her heart, but the Zabi still didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe continued. \"Our families don't decide who we are, you're proof of that. Your family cursed all of us with Zeon, you're trying to break that curse. No one person can change the world on their own, so don't hate yourself because the killing continued. Give yourself some time to heal. Banagher called out your name, he called you Audrey. Even after learning the truth, he still views you as Audrey Burne, his best friend. You are better then you think you are. You two need each other. You'll meet again, and you'll be both be happy when that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Riddhe left. Audrey rolled onto her back, now looking up at the ceiling. There was silence, except for the words in her mind. She thought back to Banagher and all the expediences they shared. The word sof self-hatred slowly left her mind, now all she could hear was Banagher's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so I'm Banagher Links.\"<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\"<br>\r\n\"This is Haro. It's a replica of the robot mascot built by an ace pilot back during the war. It was the coolest thing ever when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds a lot like me.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to rub your stomach?\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just do whatever you need to feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see his face. She could hear his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Just let me know if you need me to rub her your belly again. Or, uh, if you need my help with anything. Aside from getting to the mansion that is.\"<br>\r\n\"Good one.\"<br>\r\n\"Give me your hand.\"<br>\r\n\"Good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joy on his face, the joy in his voice. Could the one responsible for that really be worthless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We make a good team.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n\"It's nice to talk about stuff like this. You're the only one I've ever opened up to about this.\"<br>\r\n\"You have me. I'm you're friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she can bring so much light to someone as wonderful as him, to give him a place he belonged, then how can she be worthless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady and the Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n\"'To my only desire.' The beast of possibility... The symbol of hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, I can still help. You came here to prevent a war, didn\u2019t you? And doesn\u2019t he have the power to do something about that? Hearing you talk about the war is so different from hearing my professors talk about it. More grave. You've made me see how bad it would be. So please, let me\u2026 I just... My heart was pounding when I saw you fall from the sky this morning. Everything that felt off in my life just slid into place. For the first time in my life I knew what I was suppose to do. I don\u2019t care who you are! Just say that you need me and I'll... Just tell me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have worth. She said the words they both wanted her to say that day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey stood up. She removed her pajamas as fast as possible. She put on her pink bra and panties. She put her blouse on, her big belly made it impossible for the blouse to cover her incredibly deep navel. She put on her pants, which was a tight squeeze and the hardest part of her wardrobe to get on. She was visibly frustrated as she struggled to get it cover her large ass, but after some grunting and frustration, she eventually did. She didn't bother trying to button and zip them, she knew that was impossible with a gut like this. She put on her grey socks and brown loafers. Lastly, she put her coat on, leavening it unbuttoned for the same reason her pants were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing her hair, Audrey walked out of her room. Her belly, boobs, and butt jiggled with every step but she didn't care. She didn't hate her weight anymore.</span></div></div>",

Alberto was explaining the operation to rescue Banagher, though all the arguing was making that rather hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me the Nahel Argama is supposed to fight and break into that fortress alone?! Impossible!\" One of the engineers yelled at Alberto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Audrey said to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This operation is under ECOAS jurisdiction.\" Alberto countered. \"And reinforcements have already arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something to say.\" Audrey tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I add it is unprecedented for two elite ECOAS teams to join forces like this.\" Alberto continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little annoyed, Audrey tried again. \"You need to hear what I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the possibility of our success?\" A Federation officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was now more then a little annoyed. \"Can you please just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're supposed to recapture the RX-0, sizing control of one local area s not going to cut it.\" The officer continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad now, Audrey tried once again. \"Just listen to me for two-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you even considered all the resources we'll have to dedicate towards prevent enemy pursuit?!\" Another crew member said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kept bickering, Audrey sighed in frustration. Seeing there was only one way to fix this, she breathed in deeply, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRRRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic belch shut everyone up instantly, all eyes were now on the source of the gaseous eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Audrey snarked. She walked towards the briefing monitor and faced the crowds. Normal a fat girl with a huge gut bulging out of her clothes would've been an amusing sight. But there was something that about Audrey's iron will that made her gut flat out intimidating. \"Now that I have your attention, I'll be going to Palau ahead of the Nahel Argama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can't just come barging in here and acting like you're in charge!\" A mechanic yelled at the princess. \"In case you've forgotten, this isn't a damn Zeon ship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to alter your plans, I'm working on my own. I just believe that I can aid you by doing so. Mr. Alberto, you need someone to to get into Palau to inform Banagher of the rescue, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the best person for that job. Very few are aware that I've completely abandoned Neo-Zeon, they believe I'm simply voicing my complaints while ultimately doing nothing. Full Frontal has no reason to expose me, he's aware that claiming I'm against Neo-Zeon with no proof would merely divide his forces. I can freely walk around Palau without arousing suspicion. Besides,\" Here, Audrey grabbed the sides of her fat belly, the fat oozing between her fingers, and lifted it up to display the mighty orb. \"all this blubber might act as a convincing disguise.\" She then let go of her gut, it dropped down and started jiggling. \"I've lived in Palau for years, I know the layout. I'm perfect for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do we know you won't just use this as an opportunity to escape and warn them of our attack?\" An ECOAS soldier asked. Unlike the others, there was no hostility in his voice. He was merely asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know of exactly how you'll attack Palau? The warning wouldn't do any good if they don't know how you'll attack. They won't move Banagher or the Unicorn either, they want to keep him where there's no chance of him escaping. Moving him would just be an unnecessary risk of him escaping or being rescued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with her.\" One of the crew members said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Audrey said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me!\" Another crew member said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of whether or not I receive your support on this, I will find someway to reach Palau.\" Audrey declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who will be taking you there.\" A man with a beard and black hair said as he entered the briefing room, he was wearing a Londo Bell uniform. Audrey couldn't say why, but for some reason she had this feeling that she knew this person. \"It's been a long time, princess Mineva.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The large doors of Full Frontal's office opened, Banagher walked into the room, Zinnerman and Marida flanking his sides to ensure he would not attempt to escape. There was a clear understanding between all three of them that Banagher knew attempting to escape without outside assistance would only end in failure. Still, precious \"cargo\" like Banagher had to always be protected. Banagher and Marida's big bellies bobbed and bounced with every step, but the brunette notice that Zinnerman's did not. He assumed that must be because he had a good amount of visible muscle to go with the fat, unlike Banagher and Marida whose weight was pure lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked around at the fine decor of the room. It felt condescending, like it wasn't designed to show of the beauty of the room, but rather the supposed beauty of the people who owned it. To show that everything about them was superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked the desk at the end of the room, Full Frontal was sitting at it, with his most trusted knight, Angelo standing off to the side of it. \"Is he human?\" was Banagher's first thought. It wasn't just the mask that gave off this uncanny feeling, nothing about the Second Coming of Char felt human to him. He seemed artificial. Robotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tell me there was a room just like this in the last stronghold of the former Principality of Zeon, A Baoa Qu.\" Full Frontal spoke. His words caught Banagher off guard. \"The governor-general of Palau is adamant sympathizer of the former Principality. As such, I have to accept gifts like this graciously, even if the decor isn't my style. I suppose accepting gifts I don't enjoy is a trait of a good leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that supposed to be a joke?\" Banagher thought. Logically a joke should've put him at ease, which he knew was Full Frontal's intent, but the way it was said in a such a matter of fact tone only further contributed to the uncanny effect Full Frontal was giving. It was like even he didn't find it funny, or even care if it was. He said it like it was something he was ordered to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Captain Zinnerman and lieutenant Marida. You may leave, I'll take it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain.\" Marida started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Princess Mineva being held hostage by the Federation was unexpected. We will have many opportunities to rescue through both force and diplomacy. Just be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones the masked man addressed saluted before they left the room. Banagher took one last look at Marida's exposed bellybutton, and then looked at his own.They were in the same boat but there was something about the way she carried herself that made the fact that was practically bursting out of her uniform seem like a non-issue, even though Banagher knew she hated being like this. In contrast, Banagher felt he just looked like a fat slob, despite not showing off any more fat then Marida was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher stared at Full Frontal. \"Char Aznable.\" he uttered. He thought about how Char this person was claiming to be used to wear a mask during the One Year War era, though it was a different type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, have a seat.\" Full Frontal invited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher glanced at the nearby leather couches that faced each other, he walked over to them. Even though he really just wanted to sit down, the idea of sitting down in his enemy's couch felt wrong. Well, Marida was officially his enemy, but she didn't feel like it. The Red Comet did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?' The blond asked. \"I've heard it was no small feat to get you out of that Gundam safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that you-Were you the guy I fought with in that red mobile suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelo's eyes narrowed, furious at Banagher causally referring to Full Frontal as some mere guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a problem sitting for tea with a mortal enemy, Banagher Links?\" That was what Full Frontal said, but it felt far more like he was saying \"You will sit down\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there were better hills to die on, Banagher sat down, he was caught off guard as he felt it flattened it a bit beneath his bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fatass is tainting the captain's couch! What does the princess see in this blob?!\" Angelo could barely keep himself from yelling those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette reluctantly took a sip from the cup of tea. \"I really hope this doesn't made me burp.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have good reflexes, even if you're a bit reckless.\" The masked one said he removed his gloves and walked over. \"However, that's a temperament not befitting of a pilot.\" He stood in front of Banagher and extended a hand. Banagher hastily stopped drinking tea and stood up. Banagher was about to accept the handshake when he he found himself unable to, it felt he was being asked to give a handshake to an empty suit of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might sound rude but may I ask why do you wear that mask? Are you hiding a scar or something? I'd like to see your face. That is if you have nothing to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare-!\" Angelo started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fine, lieutenant Angelo\" Full Frontal said. \"Banagher is right, it's a matter of etiquette.\" With that, he removed the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's eyes widened, the face of the man known as Full Frontal was undoubtedly Char Aznable's. His blue eyes had the same world-weariness to them.</span></div></div>",

My apologies.\" His words carried a feeling of barely restrained condescension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe extended his hand again and Banagher reluctantly shook it. It felt cold and lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about how you meet princess Mineva but as for how you came into possession of that mobile suit from the Vist Foundation, the Unicorn Gundam, there is much I have yet to understand.\" The man calling himself Char Aznable said as he walked to the front of his deck and turned to face Banagher. \"The truth is the decision to turn over that machine to us had already been arranged. So what would make Cardeas Vist suddenly choose you to be the bearer of Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida already put down everything I know in the report, right?\" Banagher answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did.\" Full Frontal placed the mask down on his desk. \"However even with the knowledge of you being Cardeas Vist's son, that the Vist Foundation would throw away the prosperity they had partly gained due to an arrangement with the Federation government, place their hopes in Neo-Zeon by arranging for them to receive Laplace's Box, and then cancel the arrangement in favor of someone so apolitical until now, it doesn't make any sense. It feel like there's some details I'm missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe seeing all the death Neo-Zeon brought made him realize you're not interested in change, just destruction. Did that ever cross your mind? Or are you so close minded you can't even fathom the idea of someone growing to to despise you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the leader of Neo-Zeon could offer a rebuttal, Banagher found himself grabbed from his hood by Angelo, pure hatred evident in the white haired soldier's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, lieutenant.\" Full Frontal said for the seventh time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better learn respect, fatso.\" Angelo ordered Banagher before releasing his grip and returning to the side of his leader's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While your theory would explain your father's actions, I am hesitant to believe he would change his mind like that. Simply put, people rarely ever change without it being forced on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop trying to push your grown up pessimism on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I add that we're treating you respectfully because of your relationship with princess Mineva. Please keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you hated her. You said Neo-Zeon doesn't need people like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be more accurate to say I hate her misguided beliefs. True, Neo-Zeon holds no need for people with her mindset, but I'm hoping she will see reason in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She already does see reason. Audrey wants all this to stop. She was very clear that Neo-Zeon must not get the Box. She said it would mean war if you did. And after what happened to Industrial 7, anyone would feel the same. She's the princess of Zeon, if Audrey is against it, why are you trying to get the box? Why won't you listen to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what do you believe Laplace's Box is? What is it that so many people believe has the power to bring the Federation to an end after every attempt before to do so has failed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher paused. \"Well I don't know but I think it's knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do I, though if I may ask, what has brought you to that conclusion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Laplace's Box is supposed to, knowledge has managed the world in an instant plenty of times before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher took a moment to think of examples. He knew better then to bring it up, but seeing how fat Audrey got shortly after she discovered fast food was an example. \"Well, like Zeon's first colony drop, or hitting the Earth with an asteroid to start global cooling. Or centuries ago when they made nuclear weapons or discovered Minovsky particles or developed mobile suits. Even though it looks stable, the world changes little by little right underneath our feet. If an idea comes around at the right time, it could have the power to change everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely right. And you seem to know your history well.\" Full Frontal walked slightly past Banagher, not looking at him as he spoke. \"Are you aware that space immigration was a policy of mass exile? Even though the autonomy of the Side settlers recognized, the central government retained the right to appoint it's leaders, and since the spacenoids weren't allowed to vote, they may as well have had no suffrage whatsoever.\" Full Frontal turned to face Banagher. \"Not all of Neo-Zeon adheres to a single doctrine but we do have in-common is the belief that this unjust system must evolve in order to break from the oppressive rule of the Federation and realize the Independence of spacenoids, we fight-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no one should resort to terrorism!\" Banagher yelled, cutting off the leader of Neo-Zeon. The blond's face didn't show it but he was truly shocked at the obese young man's defiance. \"No matter how righteous you think you are, you can't just go around killing people! It's not right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big hypocrite!\" Roared Angelo. Before Banagher could tell what was going on, Angelo grabbed him by the hood again and was pushed against the wall, his entire body jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of all the death he had seen flashed through Banagher's mind. \"I'm not wrong.\" He thought to himself. \"Humans should live like humans and die like humans. I can't allow anyone to other people's lives short, people they don't know, just because they think they were in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's never right to take another life, then you're as guilty as the rest of us for using the Gundam! You shot down one of our best men, what do you have to say for that?!\" Angelo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he talking about?\" Banagher pondered in his mind. \"I only aimed at Full Frontal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might've been a stray shot back then but you did shoot him down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's eyes widened as those words made reality sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Banagher even knows what you're talking about\" Full Frontal said. \"He was probably acting purely on instinct. Ensign Sergei was just unlucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, did I kill someone?\" Banagher muttered to himself, looking down dejectedly at his gut. \"It's this stupid thing's fault.\" He thought. \"If I wasn't so damn fat, I would've done much better. I would've beaten Full Frontal, I wouldn't have been captured, I would be with Audrey right now, and Sergei would still be alive. It's all my fault for being such a pig. I dragged Audrey into this too, I ruined her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call for Marida.\" Full Frontal's words brought Banagher's focus back to the here and now. \"There is still so much you have yet to learn about who we really are.\" Banagher slowly stood up. \"I want you to understand us, and it is my hope that given enough time we will one day work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of the large doors opening, Banagher turned to see Marida's massive body waddle in. She was visibly shocked once she noticed that the captain wasn't wearing his mask. She quickly recovered and then looked at Banagher. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout protest, Banagher went with her, but turned around right outside the door. \"One more thing. Who are you?! Are you Char Aznable or aren't you?!\" Marida turned to face Full Frontal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Full Frontal placed his mask back no. \"As I am now, I consider myself nothing more then a vessel. A vessel for the hopes of those abandoned in space and for the ideals of Zeon that will light all our paths to freedom. So if that's what the people desire, then Char Aznable is who I will be. And that is the reason why I wear this mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Marida asked Banagher once they were outside of the mansion. \"You seem shaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened in there?\" Marida's tone now contained worry. \"Did he hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of painful silence filled the air before Banagher answered. \"Marida... can we do that exercise now?\"</span></div></div>",

She had been taught her entire life to fear and despise Gundam, yet she felt neither fear nor anger when she laid eyes upon the Zeta Gundam. Just interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Zeta Gundam 3B Type, but I call it Buster. It's a copy of the original customized for my fighting style.\" The bearded man explained. \"Now tell me, do I look familiar to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey faced the man and looked deeply into his face. He definitely felt familiar but no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't remember who he was. \"You feel familiar but I can't remember who you are. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, I'm happy enough that any part of you remembers me.\" He then looked deeply into Audrey's face, which surprised her. Like before with Daguza, she could feel herself being scanned. Unlike with Daguza, it didn't feel like a predator seeing if it was time to strike it's prey, rather, it felt like a father who had been reunited with his daughter after many long years. But this man wasn't Dozle Zabi, so who was he? \"You've grown into a fine young women. Dozle and Zenna would be proud. You have your mother's face, and I can see your father's indomitable will in your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Did you know my parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Shin Matsunaga, the White Wolf. I was childhood friends with your father and we fought together in the One Year War. And for a time, I looked after you when your mother died. Do you remember me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words made everything come together in Audrey's mind, she remembered him clearly now. She was very young when he left her life, but she still clearly remembered the wonderful time that she spent with him. \"I-I do. But Haman told me you died. Killed by a Federation patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin contained the anger he felt when he heard that. \"I'm not surprised. It's far from the worst thing she ever did, but I was hoping she could at least be honest with you about that. Obviously I'm not dead. I left Zeon behind. When I saw that she was going to make you the monarch of Zeon at such a young age, and use you as a puppet queen, I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see...\" Audrey said dejectedly. She knew that Haman manipulated her for her own gain, but she still knew that Haman loved her as a daughter. Of course Haman putting her in that position was an awful thing to do, but the Zabi still had many fond memories of her. She wanted Shin to understand that Haman did truly care for her, but she knew that was impossible. He had too much justified anger at her, both for how she abused Audrey, and for the many sins against others she committed. Audrey could never hold Shin's hatred of Haman against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in person I was leaving. Haman said I was to never approach you or even your room ever again after I voiced my complaints. Well, that might be putting what I said too lightly. I did consider rescuing you, but I soon realized that was something I couldn't do alone. I did leave you a letter, but Haman evidently burned it. I'm sorry for failing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't. As you said, there was nothing you could've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your forgiveness is a blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight smirk tugged at the princess' lips. \"You sound like Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the comparison. From what I've heard you picked a fine knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed. \"I guess that's one way to put it. Anyways, that explains why you're still alive but why are you a member of Londo Bell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, the Titans began oppressing the spacenoids shortly after my supposed death. I refused to stand idly by as Neo-Zeon did, I joined the AEUG. And when that became Londo Bell, well, you could say becoming brothers in arms with Federation officers dedicated to ending all forms of oppression, made me see the Federation in a more favorable light. It still needs change, but I now understand we don't have to burn it to the ground to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one thing I still don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's smirk returned. \"If you're the White Wolf, then why is your Gundam gold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\" The White Wolf said, Audrey could tell from the tone of his voice he hated the gold color scheme. \"It's a special anti-beam coating. Unfortunately, there's no white or grey version of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has your nickname changed to the Gold Wolf yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully no. More importantly, I think we're forgetting to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin gave Audrey a big bear hug, despite not being the White Bear. Her stuffed belly pressing against Shin's middle forced a loud burp out of Audrey. Despite the nausea, she hugged Shin back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Shin. It's been far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know this is rude but we can we cut the hug short? I'm feeling kinda full.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We'll jog to the park and then do a few laps around it.\" Marida said to her brown-haired friend. \"After a break and some water, we'll jog to the ice cream parlor for a small snack, then jog back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind me asking, what made you want to do this? I know we haven't known each other for long, but you don't seem the athletic type. And that's not a jab at your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\" Banagher considered telling her the truth, but he didn't want to risk hearing her tell him that his self-loathing was justified. That was the last thing he needed to hear right now. \"realized I've let myself go, so I want to lose all this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're lying but I won't press the issue. A good jog might clear your head. Now follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida broke into a light jog, Banagher followed suit. Their entire bodies were jiggling around all over the place, which somehow made Marida's figure even more alluring to Banagher. At first things went well, they were moving at a decent pace and burning calories, but after thirty seconds of nothing but jogging without a break, both chubsters started panting. Ten more seconds later, they started sweating. Five seconds later, their round faces started getting a bit red, and their speed started to suffer. Eight seconds later, their faces were completely red and drenched with sweat. The poor pilots were panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should *huff* take a *huff* a break.\" Marida suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We *huff* *huff* need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher collapsed onto the sidewalk, compete wrecks. Panting and wheezing, their legs and lungs felt coated in pain and exhaustion. They felt like they had been traversing a desert. Reaching the park felt like a Herculean task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body *huff* is on *huff* fire.\" Banagher groaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* Sweat is just fat *huff* *huff* crying... That's what *huff* *huff* I tell myself at least.\" Marida wiped the sweat off her brow with her soft arm. \"I think *huff* we pushed ourselves *huff* too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need *huff* water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked down the side walk to see a bus station. It had a wooden bench that could fit both them, and it even had a vending machine. Marida internally thanked God she brought her wallet with her today. \"There's a vending machine *huff* *huff* at that bus station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some panting and gasping, the overweight duo slowly got up and lumbered over to the nearby station, groaning and panting the whole time. Grunting, his large behind on the very inviting wooden bench, Marida made the sacrifice of being the one to get the drinks. She got four bottles of water, two for each of them. She grunted as she sat down next Banagher and handed him his drinks. They quickly screwed off the top of their first drink and started chugging it. It felt heavenly to get the refreshing substance in their mouths, like a farm that had been blessed with rain after a famine. They drank nearly all the water in their bottles before they were satisfied enough to remove the bottles from their lips, burping loudly as soon as they did. Marida didn't excuse herself, she was still too exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pant* *pant* That's better.\" Banagher said. He then groaned. \"This is going to be tougher then I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've just gotta keep at it.\" Marida said. \"And stay *huff* hydrated.\" Marida drank the rest the water in her bottle. \"We're already almost at the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a five minute break, Banagher and Marida resumed jogging to the park. It was far from a pleasant experience, but taking sips from their water bottles helped keep the exhaustion down, though not completely. They soon reached their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are.\" Marida said as they reached their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of jogging, they sat down when they found a wooden bench near a vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher threw his head back over the bench. \"Jogging hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey relaxed for a while, just enjoying the beautiful scenery the park offered. It went well with the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher got back into a regular position. \"Marida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it feel like when you... killed for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I mind answering it. I'm just trying to remember the answer. It's been a long time since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused Banagher. \"How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eighteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher couldn't think of way to answer that. A part of him was glad that he couldn't. It made him feel normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't remember feeling anything when it happened.\" Marida finally answered. \"Maybe the world was just so simple for me back then I couldn't even register that someone had died because of my actions. Maybe even back then I understood that once you step into a mobile suit, you're a combat unit. Or maybe I had already comes to terms with taking a life before I first did. Unlike you, I had already known beforehand that I would be spilling blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't want to get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at it like there's some right answer you must reach. Everyone is different, and that means everyone's reaction to death is different. You only have to do what you feel is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I can't agree with that. I know what you're saying makes sense, but if there's one thing I know, it's that death should always be a sad thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they heard was the sound of the wind blowing, and the leafs being carried by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Banagher looked at his friend, only to find her cupping his round cheeks in her hands as she looked into his tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough drama for today. Let's get you back to your normal, goofy self. Some ice cream should do the trick. Do you want any sprinkles on yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After spending most of the day catching up with Shin, Audrey walked back to her room to spend the rest of the day relaxing in her room and watching TV after such an emotionally exhausting day. She considered playing those video games Banagher was talking about, but it wouldn't be the same without him. Plus, she doubted she could even get them to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida will most likely be assigned to guard Banagher as they attempt to indoctrinate him. Marida usually has shifts early in the morning and comes back at 2:00 PM. That'll be my best time to make contact with Banagher.\" Audrey thought as she walked back to her room. She burped into her fist. \"Excuse me.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde came to a sudden halt when she saw a certain someone standing in the hallway and glaring daggers at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott had a big belly that forced her shirt to rise above her deep navel. She had given on buttoning and zipping her short shorts. The brunette's tummy was very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every step she made. Plentiful love handles and side rolls accompanied the sides of the ball of fat. Her boobs weren't as big as Audrey's, but they had still seen some growth. They had more of a bounce to them, and strained Micott's bra. Her biggest asset was her ass. It swollen with so much fat that it was now truly worthy of being called a bubble butt. Each soft cheek was the size of a basketball. Most seats could barley contain the brunette's ass. Not only was Micott's ass bigger then Audrey's, it was the biggest ass on the ship. Her blubbery posterior went along well with her thick and meaty legs, which always squished and rubbed together whenever she walked. They would also jostle with very step. Her face wasn't too different, it just now had chubby cheeks and a small double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Micott.\" Audrey said, despite feeling the thick tension. She swallowed down a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott turned her head away from the blonde. \"Don't act like we're friends. We were never friends. I thought we were but you were just deceiving me and everyone else.\" Micott belched, she was stuffed and bloated from all the comfort food she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for lying to you about my identity, but that was the only lie I told. You are my friend, and so are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of my friends are dead because of you!\" She yelled on the verge of tears. \"You saw it yourself, they were all killed in an instant. There wasn't anything left of them, nothing at all! Banagher, Takuya, and you were all I had left. Then you turn out to be why so many of my friends are dead, and then Banagher gets kidnapped by your people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. But that fight was going to happen no matter what I did. I don't know exactly what happened, but the deal to hand over the Unicorn Gundam didn't go through. That's why the fighting started. That's why your friends died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott didn't say anything or even look at Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell any of you my identity because I thought that would just get you all dragged into this. And you all got involved anyways. That's why I'm going to help rescue Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you going to -UUURP- do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone needs to go to Palau to tell Banagher about the rescue. I'm that someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott stopped looking at the wall and walked forward, her butt was jiggling the most, but her belly, legs, and boobs weren't missing out on the jiggle action either. She stopped a few feet in front of Audrey and looked into her green eyes. \"If this works and Banagher returns to us safe and sound, I'll forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely forgive you. We'll go back to being -URRAAAP- friends, you'll be as close to me as Banagher and Takuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Thank you, Micott. I truly appreciate this.\" Audrey had a small smile on her round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott sighed, frustrated at how hard to hate Audrey was. \"Well, that's what friends do: They forgive each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked twice in confusion. \"Oh, we're already friends again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not, you dweeb! I meant that when you-Oh, whatever. I've got work to do with the others. See ya at breakfast tomorrow.\" Micott walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure Micott was out of earshot, Audrey put a fist to her mouth and let out an unladylike belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Marida's wobbled out of the ice cream parlor, hands on their big bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! Too much ice cream.\" Banagher moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to explode. UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Marida groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were bloated from all the ice cream they had. Marida had to undo her belt, her pants' button and zipper, and unzip her uniform up to her sizable breasts to relive some of the pressure on her gigantic tummy. Banagher and Marida were rubbing their bloated middles as the balls of fat jiggled and bobbed with every step the overfed duo made. The two full pilots belched and moaned all the while out of both pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time anyone ever out-ate -UUUURP- me. I'm impre -URP- ssed.\" Banagher complemented with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt joy and pride swelling within her from seeing that the fat young man admired her in that aspect as well. \"Thank you. I must say, you were able eat quite a lot yourself, Banagh -UURRRRRP- er. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, all the pigging out I've been doing with Aud -UUUURRRP- rey these past few days has really made me better at stuffing myself.\" He gave his belly a proud slap, making the mass of fat jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been eating like this with the princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Non-stop! You should see much Audrey can pack it away! URRRRRP!\" Banagher said. \"Does everyone from Neo-Zeon have a big appetite?\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just me, UURAAP! Excuse me. And apparently the princess.\" The full redhead played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, someone else from Neo-Zeon had just finished filling himself with a large meal in his room. That someone was Angelo. He was sporting a big, swollen belly that was round and filled up his lap. The white haired man had his uniform's pants and belt undone, his jacket had also been unzipped up to his chest to make room for his stomach. He was expecting that his stuffed stomach would be so big it would just force his clothes to come undone. He was really disappointed when that didn't happen, not even inhaling a lot of air to puff out his stomach did the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a belch of pride, he looked over the large, round, stuffed belly he had obtained from binging on a high quality dinner. \"UURRRP! Ah, I'm already making excellent progress!\" He slapped his belly, which felt a lot more painful then he was expecting. He grunted in pain before resuming his gloating. \"At this rate, I'll be 300 pounds before the week is over. UUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Royal Guard had a new mission in mind: To get even fatter then Banagher so the princess of Zeon would pick him as her knight. He was furiously jealous at Banagher for \"stealing\" his \"well-earned\" spot as Audrey's protector. Sure, being Full Frontal's knight was his main purpose in life, but he also wanted to endear himself to the last surviving Zabi, viewing it as a great honor. Too blinded with jealous to see Banagher's positive qualities, Angelo came to the conclusion that Audrey was into fat guys (he wasn't wrong about that part) and all he would have to do is get fatter then Banagher and then Audrey would love him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devotee of Full Frontal fantasized about Audrey feeding him once he was over 300 pounds, tenderly massaging his stuffed gut as he belched in pleasure, which Audrey visibly enjoyed. Full Frontal wasn't in this specific fantasy, as the captain was too special to Angelo to have to share a fantasy with anyone other then him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until -UURRAP- the princess sees me!\" Angelo said as he looked down at his full middle with a grin. The only part he didn't like about this so far was the stomachache he had. He really wished someone (other then Banagher) was here to rub give him a belly rub. \"Ugh, this stomachache is just proof -URRRRRP- I'm making good progress.\" The Royal Guard said as he massaged his aching tummy. He refused to refer to his stomach as a tummy, as it sounded too wimpy to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher sat down together on the couch once they got home and took off their boots, groaning in pleasure from finally sitting down after the long walk home. They were feeling cold from all the ice cream they ate, so Marida picked up a cozy blanket and covered the two of them with it, snuggling together for warmth. Their full stomachs were touching, they could even feel the other's tummy gurgling and bubbling as they struggled to digest their huge meals. Somehow, their bellies touching felt really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, what a day. UUURRRRP!\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for some T -URRRAAP- V. Excuse me. Anything specific you want to watch?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, just flip through the channels.\" Banagher yawned as Marida started to do so. \"Oh! Stop right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, go back a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida went back two channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's face lit up. Marida was having a different reaction, she was visibly confused as the TV screen showed a black haired young man around Banagher's age, piloting some sort of giant robot while yelling things like \"Rocket Punch\" and \"Breast Fire\" as his machine performed attacks that seemed to defy reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, -UUUURP- what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shin Mazinger Z! It's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida chuckled, showing Banagher one of her rare smiles. \"Well, you're back to -URP- normal. UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You've got this, Banagher!\" Marida cheered on her fat friend as he grunted, his face red with exhaustion as he attempted to do a sit up in the living room. She was holding his feet in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gh!\" Banagher's belly was squinting against his legs, the orb being his biggest obstacle to doing sit ups, along with his lack of stamina. Still, despite the sweet and exhaustion, the brunette kept on trying, both for Marida and Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-O-One!\" Banagher triumphantly shouted with all his remaining might as he completed his first push up after fifteen seconds of effort, and then immediately flopped down on his back, his belly jiggling like a blob of jelly when he hit the ground, sticking straight up into the air. \"-Pant- -pant- I -pant- I'm not sure if I can keep doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took you less time then I did.\" Marida had done five push ups before it was Banagher's turn, each one took around thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did four more sit ups, each one leaving him more exhausted and sweaty. His round face red and drenched with sweat, the pilot was desperately hoping Marida was right that exercise gets a little easier every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks. Are we -pant- going to do more when you get back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll need to rest when my mission is done. This will be a daily thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was very relived to hear that. Already dressed in her uniform, Marida got up and wobbled to the door. \"I'll be back around 7 PM, you're allowed to leave the house if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get how you can treat this like it's some job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a job, just not a pleasant one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'll see you when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida left, leaving Banagher, who was still laying flat on his back, behind to ponder what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what do I do? I doubt Marida has any video games lying around. Don't think she has a computer either. I could just watch TV.\" He turned his eyes from the ceiling towards his stomach, which loomed over him. \"God, I'm fat. The last thing I should do is sit on my fat ass all day, I'll end up pigging out again and Marida will yell at me for eating all her food.\" Banagher placed his left hand over his left eye. \"I gotta get all these thoughts out of my head, I'm losing it. This is so exhausting, maybe I should take a nap, you know, get some rest. No, I'll yell at myself when I wake up. Maybe a walk is what I need. Yeah, that's it. I can burn some calories, see what the neighborhood is like, and it'll clear my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher stood up with some grunting and difficulty, Audrey woke up in her room on the Nahel Argama. She looked the clock on the nightstand, it read that it was 12:49 PM. She supposed she couldn't blame herself for sleeping in a little when she had so much trouble getting to sleep last night. Without any people or sound, there was nothing distracting her from listening to her inner voices as they channeled her self-loathing. She was eventually able to get to sleep by filling her head with memories of Banagher and her other friends, but it was still hard. Even now it was a struggle to truly believe that it was okay to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of her bed and got dressed, a little glad that she could still keep her pants closed, unlike Banagher, but she was well-aware that would change if she kept up her reckless eating. After all, the buttons on her coat were just barely hanging on, and her blouse always rode up just barely above her belly button. Even the pants she was glad she could keep close weren't doing too well, the button on it was visibly tight, and her zipper looked like it really wanted her to undo it. Again, not as bad as Banagher, but a future with Audrey walking around with her pants open and coat undone was still likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing her hair, Audrey noticed that was the second day in a row she had a really bad case of bed hair, the blonde left her room and walked to the cafeteria. Watching her tummy as it bounced with every step, she thought back to how Banagher once assured her they'd both lose the weight quickly without even having to exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the cafeteria and waiting in line until it was her turn, Audrey ordered ten pancakes and some water. Taking her breakfast with her, she sat by herself at a table in the corner of the cafeteria. She would have like to eat breakfast with Shin, Riddhe, or Mihiro but none of them seemed to be in the cafeteria, having most likely had their breakfast earlier then Audrey did. Micott and Takuya would be nice too, and knowing their tendency to sleep in probably hadn't had their breakfast yet, but she figured they didn't want to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was about to start eating, the sight of her hearty meal made Audrey realize how big it was. Ten whole pancakes, she used to just eat two back when she was skinny. She didn't mean for her order to be big, it was just what naturally came to her when she thought of a normal breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is just how I am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started eating her breakfast in silence. After finishing three pancakes, she heard a familiar voice calling her out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind if we sit with you?\" Takuya didn't bother to wait for Audrey's reply to sit down at her table. Neither did Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise was visible on Audrey's face. \"You-You two want to sit with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Takuya said, a smile on his freckled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said I wouldn't forgive you until after Banagher is saved but...\" Micott trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Micott, she's not mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're friends again, okay? Let's just eat already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both so much. I'm really glad to have friends as good as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott took a bite out of her own big breakfast. \"It's like I said, friends forgive each other.\" She said as she chewed, garbling her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like that's true.\" Audrey was tempted to tell Micott to not speak while her mouth is full but she realized this wasn't the time for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want us to call you Mineva?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question gave her the answer to it. It made her realize that ever since Banagher reaffirmed that she was still Audrey to him, she hadn't thought of herself as Mineva even once. Even in the depths of her self-loathing when she was convinced she didn't deserve Banagher's friendship, she still thought of herself as Audrey. \"Banagher made me realize that... my true name is Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had a nice breakfast, all three of them did. One spent chatting about whatever amidst their eating. At one point, Takuya made a comment about even though he knew a lot about the Nahel Argama, he had no idea it was so easy to get fat on it, a comment he punctuated by jiggling his belly. This made Audrey take full notice of how fat he had gotten, she was so distracted by everyone she hadn't notice how her freckled pal had also crossed the border between pudgy to fat after Banagher had been captured. Most likely the result of comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's belly was a round orb of jiggly fat that would fill up his lap when he sat down. It made getting his pants zipped and buttoned a real chore. He found that his tummy was surprisingly fun to jiggle and mess around with when he was bored, he didn't even get embarrassed playing with it in front of the others. He had a pair of soft moobs that rested on his tummy like it was a shelf for models. Crumbs from his meals would sometimes land on them. The aspiring pilot had a big butt that would fill up any chair he sat in and spill off the sides of, which was annoying when he was working on building models. His butt would leave an imprint when he sat on a couch, something he was doing more often these days, and he was already kinda lazy even when he was skinny. Takuya's face now had a double chin and round, chubby cheeks that went along very well with his freckles. His face's new softness made his moments of enthusiasm over mobile suits even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRP! You wanna watch TV with us?\" Takuya offered Audrey after they all finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" She enthusiastically answered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Boing! Boing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's belly bobbed and bounced rhythmically as he nonchalantly walked down a neighborhood sidewalk, taking in the sights. Without even going into one of the buildings or asking anyone, he could tell this was a much more poor neighborhood then any of the ones he had grown up in. He supposed it made sense, downtrodden people are pretty much the only ones who would believe in Neo-Zeon. They're the ones with the most reason to hate the Earth Federation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoing! Boing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tummy wasn't the only thing bouncing, his butt and legs were too but what caught his attention the most was the bouncing his flabby man boobs were doing. They jiggled and bobbed in near perfect sync with is gut, almost as jiggly as the giant orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do girls put up with this?\" He thought as he poked his moobs, wearing an expression of both disgust and annoyance. He removed his finger from the soft sacks of flab, the fat bounced back into place as soon as he removed his finger, without a mark left. \"Guess I'll ask Audrey when I get back. I just hope I won't have to wear a bra.\" As much as he wished he hadn't, he imagine himself shirtless and wearing Audrey's pink bra, his chest filling it up without difficulty and the back string cutting into his fat. \"Egh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his walk, Banagher once again tried to pull his hoodie back down over his belly, but he couldn't get it to even cover his cavernous bellybutton no matter how hard he tried. The sight of a fat guy with a big, fat gut hanging out completely exposed and bouncing with every step naturally attracted some stares from people passing by. Banagher would blush, ESPECIALLY when it was a cute girl, and try with all his might to get his tummy covered but it never worked. He couldn't get his hoodie to cover nor could he even close his pants and cover it with them, as not only would having his pants up that high make him look like a huge dork, though Banagher was well aware he was in fact a huge dork, but he was too fat to even button or zip his pants, or even wear his belt. He couldn't even close his pants to cover some of his prodigious tummy, even when he sucked it in long enough to go red in the face. At least his gut hid his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few days ago I was walking around the ship like this with zero problem, I didn't even mind that Audrey saw me like that. What the hell was wrong with me?\" Banagher shook his head. \"I'm getting those thoughts again. I gotta clear my head. I need to think back on the good times with Audrey. Wait, did I ever tell Audrey who my father is and why I got the Unicorn? Crap, I didn't. I'll have to tell her as soon as I get back, she'll really chew me out for not telling her sooner. But what do I even say? I don't even know how I feel about father,. I just hope I can go back to hanging out and eating hot dogs and pizza together with everyone like before. Audrey'll want me to call her Mineva now, won't she? Well, she'll always be Audrey to me, because that's the real her, I know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more jiggling and another attempt to cover his tummy after seeing yet another cute girl staring at him, the fat brunette realized there was one last thing he hadn't tried. \"Wait, I could try closing my jacket.\" He tried to do so but was met with failure. Sucking his gut in as hard as he could, and tired to get both sides of his jacket to connect but they weren't able to get close enough to touch. Banagher let go of his jacket and released his breath, his gut come flopping out so fast it knocked the sides of his jacket away. \"Should've seen that coming. It's always like that. Every time I try, my fat gut just blows up in my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher kept walking, he had just passed by the ice cream parlor he and Marida went to yesterday. He thought back fondly to that. He knew Marida liked ice cream, but he was still surprised by how much of a sweet tooth someone like her had, he had never seen anyone pack away so much ice cream before in one sitting. He had had his fill, and then some, long before Marida had hers. He just sat there in his booth, burping and alternating between rubbing his belly and drumming his fingers on it as he watched Marida down bowl after bowl of ice cream. She was a bit embarrassed when Banagher complimented her on how much she was eating, the huge belch she let out right after he did so didn't help, but it seemed like Banagher looking up to her in that regard made her feel really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what she's doing right now.\" He turned his head away from the ice cream parlor as he kept walking, and spotted an electronics store. \"If we had phones, would she let me text her during her missions? Hey, if I'm going to be stuck here for a while, then I should get Audrey a phone. She's going to need one when she comes with us to school after this is all over. And we'll be able to keep in touch if we get separated again. I left my phone on the Argama, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the store, he was tempted to run but he didn't want to do anymore jiggling then he was already, Banagher was about to walk in when he remembered his current... status. He could see through the store windows that there was no other customers there, but there was a cashier there, a girl no less. She seemed around Marida's age, and looked pretty bored, which meant a fat guy like Banagher in ill-fitting clothes jiggling in would have her full attention. He looked down at his clothes once again, confirming that the visitation was as bad as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out to the door but heisted. He steeled himself by reminding himself that he was doing it for Audrey and opened the door, a bell ringing as he did so, making him feel like he had just been spotted in Metal Gear Solid and all of Camp Omega was now out for his blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you find anything?\" The cashier said, eyes drawn to the tubby pilot, his tummy in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, n-no thanks, just browsing.\" He said, keeping his conversation with her as short as possible and walking off to the side in hopes a nearby stand would hide him from her, his tummy jiggling as usual. \"C'mon, belly, stop jiggling!\" He internally pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calmed down once hidden by the stand. Checking the prices of the iPhones, he saw that they were all around one hundred dollars in price. \"That shouldn't be too hard to make. Audrey probably wouldn't mind whatever color I get her but I should still get her one in her favorite color. I don't know what that is, but I guess I'll bet on either pink or white.\" He took a few seconds to make a decision. \"Since my phone is white, I should go with pink. Now I just need to see what the best model they have is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent five minuets browsing before he came across one that seemed to be it, costing one hundred and fifty dollars. The store didn't have many of it but thankfully there was one in pink. Mentally marking it as the one he would get once he had enough money, Banagher left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again!\" The cashier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Banagher said, embarrassed knowing that she now saw his impressive butt jiggling. \"Now how am I going to get the money to pay for it?\"</span></div></div>",

No wonder I got so fat, I'm always eating and eating. Wait, isn't it a little after 12? That's lunch time, of course I'm hungry!\" Rubbing his belly in anticipation of his meal, Banagher started his walk back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher lounged on his living room's couch, watching TV. It was 7:24 PM, Marida would be home any moment now according to what she told him. Watching TV at nighttime as he waited for someone to come home, this was far from an unusual moment for the young man. He just hoped things wouldn't end prematurely with Marida, like they did with his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazing on the couch with his gut hanging out as he watched TV, Banagher thought on how he was the most typical imagining of a couch potato, all he was missing was a can of soda and a bag of chips. \"No way would I have been able to fight off Marida back at Industrial 7 like this. It was hard enough when I wasn't the size of a sumo wrestler.\" He lifted his tummy and then let it drop, causing it to wobble and jiggle. \"I've gotta lose all this fat soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that was when Marida walked in and announced her presence with a powerful and unladylike burp, as strong as some of Banagher's very best, hands on her immensely bloated stomach, the gigantic sphere had broken her belt, forced her top to come unzipped, and popped the button on her pants and force it's zipper all the way down. It was just a good thing her huge tummy covered up her now exposed underwear. \"Excuse -URP- me.\" Marida said, her chubby cheeks red from a mixture of embarrassment and the struggle of walking home with such a stuffed and massive belly. \"Hello, Banagher. URAP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mo-Marida.\" Banagher said, finding it impossible to not spend a few seconds looking at his guardian's stomach. \"Victory feast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't actually see any combat today, my mission was just to fill in for someone's shift for patrol. I got hungry and that's how I ended up like...\" Marida looked down at her gut in shame. \"like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you, that sounds really boring.\" Banagher was well-aware that if he had been in Marida's shoes he would be currently beating himself up for eating so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't change how much this binge has set my progress back.\" Marida paused to burp into her fist. \"UUUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" An unpleasant-sounding rumble sounded form Marida's packed-full tummy, even Banagher could hear it. The stomach's owner groaned in discomfort as she clutched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I'm fine. Speaking of our progress in losing weight, what did you have for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing a good job at eating healthy.\" Marida said as she wobbled to her room to get changed. She had trouble stripping off her uniform due to how ill-fitting it is causing no small amount of difficulty and frustration, the fact that Marida was already exhausted didn't help. Once she was finally able to get her top squeeze past her massive gut and big breasts, and her pants squeezed past her huge butt and chunky legs, the redhead flopped down on her bed with a sigh, dressed only in her black bra and panties She took a few moments to catch her breath, looking at her titanic tummy that loomed over her like a challenging opponent that had beaten her in a fight and knocked her on her back, completely defeated. Though Marida mused it was more like she had lost a sumo match. Marida belched loudly and deeply and then apologized for it. \"Where did I go wrong?\" She thought as she placed a hand on her gut, cringing at how soft it was despite how stuffed to the gills it was. \"This used to be toned and fat, now it's this huge orb of fat. Why did I slip on my diet so badly? I can't even remember when exactly I did. I'm truly blessed everyone has been so kind to me about this. She grabbed a handful of her belly fat and belched loudly again, though this one wasn't deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending time laying there and then getting dressed in her casual clothes, having to leave the sash and zipper on top undone, as well the button and zipper in her pants, Marida waddled back to Banagher and sat down next to him, tenderly massaging her tum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anyway i could make some money around here?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to get a job? What -URRAP- Excuse me. What brought this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get Audrey a phone, it costs a hundred and fifty dollars. Could you chip in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, I only have enough money to pay the bills and afford food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave her a disbelieving look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I only have enough money to pay the bills and afford an overabundance of food.\" Marida amended. \"i only have fifty dollars in spending money, which I need to be careful with as I'm still unused to budgeting for living with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any jobs I could take? Besides joining Neo-Zeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that was off the list. I know someone who runs a restaurant and could use a helping hand. If you don't mind working for a member of Neo-Zeon that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me, as long as I'm not doing any propaganda stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's not like that. I'll take you there for dinner tomorrow.\" Marida's overfed middle grumbled loudly again, making her groan in pain as she clutched it. \"Ooooh... UUUURRRAP! Excuse -URAP- me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're okay?\" Banagher was visibly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm...\" Her tummy grumbled audibly again. \"URRRRRRP! Ooooh, excuse me. I said I'm -UUURRRP- fine. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a really bad stomachache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could rub your belly if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it my -URAAAP- self. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels way better when someone else does it. Trust me, my gut and Audrey's can attest to that.\" He gave his belly a proud slap to drive the point home, eliciting a burp from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida imagined Banagher and Audrey giving each other soothing belly rubs as they burped all the while, though she envisioned Audrey as only having a stuffed belly while Banagher was both stuffed and fat. She found it to be an oddly cute sight. \"I appreciate your concern but I can handle a mere stomachache myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. Just let me know if you change your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two kept watching TV, every gurgle from Marida's stomach, every moan and burp from her lips, made Banagher feel more and more guilty for not rubbing her middle. It only took seven minutes for her to relent, but it felt like seven hours to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Banagh -URRRRRRRP-!\" Marida blushed at how she accidentally burped Banagher's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, good one.' Banagher grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Marida muttered. \"Banagher, do you mind rubbing this stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" Banagher immediately got right to work, placing his hand on the top of Marida's tummy and moving it in soothing circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, it does feel much better when someone else does it.\" The redhead moaned in pleasure as she leaned back. \"UUUUUUURP! Excuse me. I'm sorry, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, just do whatever makes you feel better.\" He gave her tummy a few friendly pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida took a few second to think it over, then she breathed in deeply and \"UUUURRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your burping is awesome.\" Banagher gave a pat to Marida's big belly before he resumed rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Marida felt rather weird getting complimented for her belching talent, but she liked how Banagher looked up to her for it. She then burped long and loud for Banagher. \"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're giving me and Audrey a run for our money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but don't sell yourself short. Your belching skills are-Wait, the princess has been belching as loudly as us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer overweight and brown-haired friend chuckled. \"You're in for quite a shock when you see Audrey again.\"</span></div></div>",

URRRRRRRP! UUUURRRAAAP! I'm feeling much better now, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher kept rubbing Marida's belly for a while, how soft and malleable the gigantic mass was led Banagher to do some belly play with it, like patting, jiggling, shaking, or poking it, at one point he grabbed the sides of it and lifted it up, then dropped it, making it shake and wobble as it landed back into Marida's lap, she moaned and unleashed another burp as it did so, Banagher's eyes were fixated on the sight. The brunette rubbing his guardian's tummy was a pleasant sensation to both of them, but it wasn't the same type of feeling rubbing Audrey's tummy gave Banagher. Both bellies filled Banagher with a relaxing warmth, as well the owner of the belly he was rubbing, but it wasn't exactly the same. If asked, Banagher wouldn't really be able to put it in words, it wasn't that he preferred one belly to the other, it was simply that both made him feel good but in different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe episode of the mecha show Banagher and Marida (mostly Banagher) were watching ended, reminding Marida to check the time on the nearby clock. \"It's almost eight, you must be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Marida slowly heaved herself off the couch with a great amount of difficulty, then took a moment to catch her breath. She placed a hand on her dome of a middle and burped. \"I'll cook you dinner. Is pasta fine?\" She said as she waddled to the nearby kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the least I can do to repay you for the massage.\" She stared taking the ingredients out of her cupboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher practically deflated in his seat. Marida making him dinner would normally be fine, but Banagher had already eaten a bunch of leftover pizza for dinner he found in the fridge while she was gone, a whole bowl of pasta would leave him as bloated as Marida. \"I can't not eat it, she'd be so disappointed.\" He thought. He then looked down at his stomach, the mass of flab as big and jiggly as ever. He gave it a deep poke, it was mostly soft but there was some firmness from the pizza. As soon as he removed his finger, the fat bounced back into place without a mark. \"I've gotta just force it down. Man, this is gonna suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Marida finished the pasta, unknowingly dooming Banagher to a tummyache. \"Eat up.\" She said as she placed the large bowl on the coffee table in front of the couch. \"It should be cool in five minutes.\" She then sat back down on the couch with Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minuets until my stomach hurts like hell.\" Banagher thought before he thanked the redhead. After five minutes, the pasta was cool and it was time to dig in. \"I've just gotta force it down.\" He thought as he started eating. It did taste good but that didn't mean his stomach was going to hurt any less. His belly grew more bloated with every mouthful, it hurt a little more with every swallow, each bite a little harder to take then the last one. He kept chatting with Marida, partly as a way to distract himself from the fullness of his stomach. The pilot burped many times as he ate in desperate hopes of easing the pressure in his big stomach. Throughout it all, he still kept trying to keep up the illusion that he wasn't in any pain. There was a few moment when he had to drop it for a few seconds, Marida at one point asking him if he was okay, but he was always able to bring the illusion right back up, even as his smiles became more visibly strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D -URP- Done.\" Banagher feebly placed the bowl back on the coffee table and immediately leaned back into the couch, his gut greatly bloated and full of pasta and pizza, the orb even bigger then usual. Banagher belched long and loud, then let out a cute moan. \"UUUUUUUURP! Oooh...\" He weakly placed a hand on his middle and started rubbing it. \"Man, now my belly hurts.\" He thought as he rubbed it and let out another moan, feeling how much bigger and harder it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had to burp again before he could reply. \"It was really- UUUURAP- good, thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad -URAAAAP- you enjoyed.\" Marida placed a hand just above her friend's belly. \"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" He stopped rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began rubbing the Gundam pilot's tummy, the brunette moaned as soon as her hand made contact, this time in relief. He let out a short but deep belch and started rubbing Marida's belly, they both belched loudly at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that feel good, Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels REALLY good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach overweight pilot's hand made rhythmic motions over the other's giant stomach, burping every now and then to ease the pressure within them. Like before, Banagher sometimes did some belly with Marida, who likewise started to do the same with him. Having never touched his stomach before, Marida was surprised by how jiggly and soft Banagher's big belly truly was, something he noticed and found charming of her. Both had some blushes to their cheeks, this being Banagher's first time doing this with Marida, someone older then him,and the first time Marida had done this with anyone. Marida at one point grabbed a handful of Banagher's belly flab and gave it a good shake, Banagher moaning in pleasure as his gut jiggled like it was made of jelly. \"Aaaaah yeah... UUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on, Audrey was enjoying a night of watching TV for hour son end with Takuya, Micott, and Haro in Takuya's room on the Nahel Argama. Audrey and Haro were watching on the couch while Micott and Takuya were laying down on the floor in front of the couch. Originally they were going to play video games at one point, but once Audrey told them of how she was waiting for Banagher to introduce them to her, they choose to respect her wish and watched TV the whole time instead. That unexpected conversation made the mood rather somber for a bit, but it soon perked back up, as proven by the rather distended stomachs Audrey's friends were sporting. The two had just kept on snacking and snacking, they didn't even realize how bloated they were until Audrey playfully pointed it out, giggling at their surprise and saying they could gain a hundred pounds and they wouldn't notice until she pointed it out. Haro chimed in by calling the two of them piggies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Audrey was unfamiliar with pretty much every show they watched, some of which were known by pretty much everybody, it didn't make the night any less enjoyable for anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRRP! You don't even know what Pokemon is?\" Micott asked Audrey, she and Takuya looking at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, is that strange?\" The princess innocently asked, feeling like she had said something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've -URAAAAAP- never seen someone before who doesn't know what Pokemon is.\" Takuya said before he grabbed another handful of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never got out much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you have a TV?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I never watched anything outside of what my caretakers said to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they ever tell you you're on TV?\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was visibly surprised. \"I-I'm on TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there was an anime about the Gryps War called Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. It had you in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey pouted. \"I want to voice myself...\" She said with a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya burped. \"Hey, you can do it when they make an anime about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think they will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure they will! All the war with Gundam in them got an anime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all that money you have you could -UUUUURAP- commission it.\" Micott half-jokingly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have a lot of money.\" Audrey missed the joke half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you were also in Z -UUUUUUURP- Z.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was a body double.\" Takuya corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I wonder whatever happened to her. Do you know, Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I tried but I couldn't find any information. I didn't even meet her before she took my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's a mysterious mystery, isn't it?\" Haro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's safe to say she's probably not as fat as me though.\" Audrey chuckled, patting her belly. \"UUUUURP! Excuse me.\" Audrey self-consciously looked at the can of soda she just drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or as gassy.\" Micott teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you look kinda different then I thought. Your hair is a lot less red, did you dye it?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my hair naturally turned blonde.\" Audrey was rubbing a strand of her hair as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a -UUUUUURP- a manga called Moon Gun -UUURAAP- dam you show up in. You had a really big butt in it, I think I've got the picture on my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't need to see that!\" Audrey's full face was as red as a tomato.</span></div></div>",

Micott got the idea to wake her friend up this way from Audrey telling them how she woke up Banagher two days ago. Micott was happy to note that waking someone up this way was as fun as it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! UUUUUUURP!\" Takuya jolted awake. \"I wasn't sleeping.\" He said as he rubbed his swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You so were.\" Micott then stretched and yawned. \"Not that I blame you, I'm tired too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffed bellies will do that to you.\" Audrey teased. She then looked at the clock in Takuya's room. \"It's already 1 AM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time staying up -UUURAAP- this late?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second time. The first time was with Banagher the day we got on this ship. I'm still not used to staying up so late watching TV and eating so much junk food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\" Micott said as she rubbed her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's just part of a normal life.\" Audrey grabbed Haro and stood up. \"Thank you both again for inviting me, I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so formal, you don't need to thank your friends every time you hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to keep that in mind. We'll be spending more time together tomorrow, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the group exchanged their good nights, Audrey walked to the bedroom door. She stopped and looked back to see that her bloated friends were still in the same positions, just now resting their heads on pillows they lazily grabbed from the couch. \"Aren't you going to go to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah... Too tired...\" Micott drowsily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey smirked at that and left. She returned to her room with Haro, brushed her teeth, switched into her pajamas, and fell asleep not long after she laid down in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Munch- -Munch- -UUUURRRRP- -Gobble- -Gobble- -Slurp- -Glug- -Glug- -Glug- -Gulp- -UUURAAAAP- -Chew- Chew- -URRRRRRRRP-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey slowly opened her eyes as she woke up, feeling almost magnetically drawn to her comfy pillow. She looked at her clock, which read it was 3:14 PM. \"I'm a mess.\" She thought as she shifted onto her side, her right arm hanging lumpy over the side of the bed. Her impressive stomach went past the edge of her bed. Her eyes were half closed, she was not even trying to see. \"I can't even get up at a good time, how pathetic. I can't do even the simplest things right. Why did I ever think I could prevent a war? I'm just an egotistical brat. Nothing more.\" She sighed. \"I'm having those thoughts again. I need to focus on the good times, that aren't here anymore because of me. No! I can't keep thinking this, I need to focus on the good times, the moments I spent with Banagher, how happy I made him, how happy we made each other.\" The pain the princess felt could clearly be seen on her face, one only needing to look for a single second to see it. Her breathing intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Audrey, it's not your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never consider you annoying, you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels amazing, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about I give it a good ol' belly rub?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's breathing calmed. Her eye lids rose and her vision focused, allowing her to make out the form of Haro as he stared at her. Despite the ball's inability to change expression, he was still able to look worried, to plead with his blank eyes for Audrey to be okay, to convey sorrow for Audrey with his blank eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, Audrey. It''l be okay, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave a tired smile. \"Thank you, I needed someone to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher doesn't blame you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a nice person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is! He is! You'll be eating with him again and getting big, stuffed bellies before you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew stuffed bellies would be something I'd find myself looking forward to?\" Audrey said with renewed vigor as she got out of bed and started getting dressed to face the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, Audrey let out a loud and unladylike burp as she walked out of her room, holding Haro. She apologized for the gaseous eruption and walked to the cafeteria. Upon entering, she looked to see that Micott and Takuya were at their usual table, already having started eating breakfast. \"To think you two got up before I did.\" She said as she walked over and sat down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott burped. \"We're not that much better, we only got up ten minuets ago.\" Micott explained as chewed a spoonful of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya noticed something odd abut Audrey. \"Where's your breakfast? Don't tell me you're starving yourself to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing like that, I need to talk to Shin about when we'll be going to Palau together. I'll have my breakfast after, I just wanted to to say good morning to you two. Well, good afternoon, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't skip any meals, we''ll force feed you if you do.\" Takuya half jokingly said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And take pictures for Banagher.\" Micott added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\" Audrey said. She'd rather not be force fed, but if she had to be, she'd definitely want Banagher to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we might have to cut back on all the eating.\" Takuya then took a bite out of a waffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" Audrey felt a little ashamed that actually got her a tad worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guy raided the fridge last night when everyone was asleep. No one knows who did it, just that he sure knows how to pack it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe someone isn't satisfied with the amount of food they're given. As someone's who been quite...\" Audrey looked down at her fat gut. \"well-fed during her service here,\" said as she gave the orb a few pats for emphasis. \"it's beyond greedy that someone is eating mountains of food during the day, and is not only unsatisfied with that, but steals even more from everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thief must weigh, like, five thousand pounds with an appetite like that.\" Micott stated, trying to imagine what the raid on the fridge looked like. \"Good thing we just got resupplied today, or he'll eat our ship dry in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They better not ration us when Banagher gets back. We need to welcome him back by making him the most stuffed he's ever been.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to give him the best belly rubs he's ever had.\" Audrey said as all four of them imagined how incredibly swollen and bloated Banagher will look, with Audrey and Micott giving him soothing belly rubs as he burped up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave some of that gut for me.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to eat a ton yourselves.\" Takuya said. \"It is a party after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking some more about how they should handle Banagher's welcome home party, the detail they were the most torn about was whether it should be held in the recreational room or Banagher's room, Audrey left for the hanger, still carrying Haro with her. Shortly after entering, she stopped as she noticed two new mobile suits sporting dark color schemes. Audrey walked toward the railing to get as good a look as she could, her belly squishing against the railing. \"Two new Zeta Gundams? No, they look different. One is even slimmer then the original, and the other is bulkier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Audrey!\" A friendly voice coming from Riddhe said. Audrey stopped leaning at the railing and turned to look at Riddhe, seeing that he was was fatter then when she last saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe's belly was where most of his weight had gone. It was a big orb that was so round massive Riddhe had to leave his pants, belt, and uniform top open for it, as he couldn't keep them closed. It was both a blessing and cruse that his gut was so fat that hung down far enough to obscure his crotch, as it meant no one could see his underwear. His belly was very jiggly, especially when he was piloting his mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest and butt were much bigger then they had any fight to be. His chest was two sacks of plush flab that rested on his belly, and his butt was two large orbs that made his seat in the cockpit a bit snug. His legs had also gotten chubbier, now rubbing together slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had gotten pudgy, with cherubic cheeks and a double chin, though his face's chub wasn't as pronounced as Banagher's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you noticed the Delta Plus.\" Riddhe was surprised when his words were met by a judgmental glare from his tubby, blonde friend. \"Uh... Did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed in you, I thought you were better this.\" Audrey coldly said as she approached Riddhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're the thief who stole all that food from the fridge.\" The Zabi said as she stopped right in front of Riddhe, staring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Riddhe never thought a cute chubby girl could look so scary. \"What makes you think I'm the thief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not, then where exactly did all this come from?\" With those icy words, Audrey grabbed the sides of Riddhe's exposed belly as tightly as she could, getting the fat in between her soft fingers, and shook it with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" Riddhe's cheeks turned scarlet. It did feel kinda nice to have someone like Audrey play with his belly, but not only was this in public, the pilot was downright afraid of her. \"I know this looks bad, but I'm not the thief. I've just been stress eating a lot, that's all. UUUURAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that belch as a confession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had a snack!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This some sorta weird lovers' quarrel?\" Those words instantly made Audrey and Riddhe freeze in place, though not the latter's belly, as it was still jiggling a bit. The words came from an older man as he walked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" They muttered as they hastily moved away from each other, blushes on their full faces. \"... And who exactly are you?\" Audrey asked partly as a way to divert attention away from the embarrassing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Travis Kirkland.\" Travis was an obese man in his fifties. Despite this, his face had a rather youthful look to it, were it not for the grey hair, one would most likely mistake him for someone twenty years lounger at least. He had a large beer belly that hung down greatly, a large butt that would make his pilot chair in the cockpit rather snug, chunky and out of shape arms and legs, huge man boobs, and a full face with round cheeks and a huge double chin. Audrey made an educated guess that he was around Marida's weight. Judging from the green pilot suit he was wearing, as well as the leather jacket he wore on top of it, fit him perfectly, he had been fat for a long time now. \"I'm a freelancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't aware we were bringing in freelancers.\" Riddhe noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a special case. Londo Bell didn't come to me, I came to them.\" He explained. \"Though I'm not here for your knight in shinning armor, princess.\" Unlike everyone else in Audrey's life, Travis didn't say princess in a formal manner, he said it as though it were a nickname. The princess appreciated that, thinking on how Haman would've yelled at Travis for it had she heard that. If there was an afterlife, Audrey wouldn't be surprised if Haman's spirit would demand Travis apologize once he finally enters it. \"I'm here for these two.\" Travis pulled two photos out of his jacket's pockets and handed them over to a confused Audrey, Riddhe was looking at them as well.. The first photo showed a young man with brown hair who was wearing a One Year War era Zeon pilot suit, he appeared to be standing in a hanger, a blue High Mobility Ground Type Zaku II as in the background, painted mostly blue and bore the emblem of a white wolf on the middle of it's chest. Presumably the mobile suit belonged to the man in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second photo showed the blue mobile suit that had engaged Banagher when he was kidnapped. \"The photo's outdated by over a decade, but that man is Vincent Gleissner, my son. I'm looking for him, and I think he's with that mobile suit in the other photo. They're both with Neo-Zeon, do they look familiar to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I did very little leading before I left Zeon and I can't be expected to remember every single pilot and mobile suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey.\" Riddhe lightly scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling that was going to be the answer.\" Travis took the photos back and put them back in his jacket's pockets. \"That mobile suit's name is the Pale Rider, and I think finding it will lead me to Vincent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he the pilot?\" Riddhe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but my latest lead tells me that a blue Geara Doga can always be seen with the Pale Rider, I think that's him. If you see either of them, leave them and let me know .\" Travis then looked away from them and pointed at the grey and black mobile suit next to the Delta Plus, directing Audrey and Riddhe's eyes towards it. \"That's my machine, the ZII. It's probably the only mobile suit on this ship that can handle the Pale-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know this ship fought the Pale Rider?\" Audrey shot an accusatory glare towards Travis, Riddhe was surprised when she pointed out that hole in Travis' story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm?\" Even though this was a serious accusation Audrey was making, Travis didn't seem phased at all. \"I'm not a spy from Neo-Zeon, if that's what you're getting at. A friend of mine just did a little digging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like hacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be that easy to hack into Federation records.\" Riddhe stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, she's been hacking them for years.\" With those words, Travis causally strolled off as if the tense tone the conversation took never happened, his gut and butt bobbing and bouncing. Audrey and Riddhe silently watched, not sure what to say or do as Travis left the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Am I still your prime suspect?\" Riddhe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'C'mon! Fit, damn it!\" Standing in the living room of his and Marida's house, Banagher grunted as he struggled to get his belt to reach across his stomach. Marida watched him with her chunky arms corseted under her impressive bosom. Banagher's efforts were met with failure no matter how hard he sucked in his stomach, he had to give up, releasing a breath of air as his gut came flopping out so fast it knocked his belt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a good effort. \" Marida comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't change that I'm a blob who isn't getting the job.\" Banagher sighed, shamefully looking down at his stomach and rested a hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to get job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you turn me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have your answer.\" With that, Marida walked out out of the house, Banagher following suit. It was a short walk to the restaurant, Banagher took a moment to examine it's outside appearance as he and Marida walked in. It wan as oddly high-class looking place, completely out of place in Palau. Even the name itself, Bistro Gleissner, was adorned on the top of the doors in gold letters. Banagher figured the owner of this place must've been saving up for years to afford it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, they saw that there were currently two other people in the restaurant, a brunette and a blonde, sitting side by side at a table filled with empty dishes. Both were as overweight as Marida. Banagher and Marida could've swore that they saw the brunette remove his hand from the soft surface of the blonde's belly as soon as they metered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we interrupting something you and Chloe are doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just got eating.\" The brunette said as he got up and wobbled over to Marida, his tummy jiggling. \"So how is being a big sister going so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big sister?\" Marida and Banagher simultaneously repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm his guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're his guardian that's a few years older then him, isn't that what a big sister is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense to me.\" Banagher said. \"Even if it does feel weird to call you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name's Banagher, right? I'm Vincent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Marida told you about me?\" Banagher took a brief moment to take in Vincent's obese form. \"Never trust a skinny chef, huh?\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVincent had a very big belly that was straining the button on his top and pants almost to the point of straining, and hung down far enough to obscure his crotch. His chest was a pair of flabby moobs that rested on his tummy and jiggled with it, Chloe found his man boobs to be an amusing sight and liked playing with them and cupping them in her hands. His ass was huge and would the chars of his bistro weren't able to contain it. His legs were chunky enough that they rubbed together when he sat down, and his arms were a bit thick, but not with muscles, with fat. As such, the brunette was too out-of-shape to use hand to hand combat, instead he would have to use his weight as a weapon. His face was round, with full cheeks and a double chin. Chloe loved to pinch his chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe loved playing with not only Vincent's massive stomach, but her own as well. Her belly was divided into two rolls and was very soft. The sphere was was flanked with deep side rolls and plentiful love handles. Her boobs were plump, nearly the size of honeydews. They jutted out from her chest nearly as much as her gut did from her middle. Her ass was made up of two huge orbs that had caused some of the blonde's old pants to rip, once in front of Vincent when she reached down to garb his spatula for him. Her legs legs so meaty and wide they were constantly rubbing together with absolutely no separation. Her chunky legs wobbled with every step. Her arms had absolutely no tone to them at all, being so flabby they were worthy of being called bingo wings. Chloe had an adorably round face with pretty much no angles to it, complete with a big double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Marida, Chloe had the bigger chest and ass, but Marida's belly was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has, and that you're here for a job.\" Vincent said. \"She didn't mention what specific job you want though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never talked about that.\" Marida clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are your skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher took a moment to think. The only possible jobs he could think of for a bistro were that of a cook, cleaner, or waiter. Banagher knew cooking was out of the question, having never cooked a meal in his entire life. The closest to cooking he had ever done was microwaving a few meals. Cleaning wasn't an option either, Banagher thought back on how his room back at the school dorm was a bit of a mess. that left only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't really have any that would be useful at a bistro, but I can be a waiter.\" Banagher said in a voice that made it clear he was a bit embarrassed to begin his job interview by syaing he has no skills that would be of use at a bistro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a waiter here. Though you won't get a uniform, I can't afford to get them. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down at his stomach and dejectedly rubbed it. \"Guess I'll have to put up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\" Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now about the payment and working hours. I can pay you ten dollars an hour, I know it's not a lot but it's the best I can afford.\" Vincent said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you work seven hours a day, you'll make the money you need in three days.\" Banagher's big sister pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good, I'll take it.\" Banagher said.</span></div></div>",

I'll start cooking right now, what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of them stuffed themselves full of Vincent's cooking, even Chloe despite having just finished a meal before Banagher and Marida arrived. Three of the bellies were exposed, Banagher's like always, Chloe's, and Marida's. Marida and Chloe had to undo their pants, in the redhead's case she also had to undo her sash and unzip her top, in order to give their tummies the space they desperately needed. As tight as his shirt was, Vincent didn't undo his buttons, which were tight even before he overate, as he wanted to leave a good impression on his new employee. The four leaned back in their chairs, hands on their bloated stomachs, sighs and belches of satisfaction regularly escaping their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Whew, man, I ate like you, Marida!\" Banagher cheerfully said, a satisfied look on his face as he rubbed his belly, an arm thrown over the back of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida chuckled, a slight blush to her cheeks, both embarrassed and flattered to hear that. \"You certainly did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chloe!\" Banagher and Marida looked towards Vincent to see what Chloe was doing, which was undoing all the buttons on his shirt, leaving his gut and moobs completely exposed to the world. She also undid his pants button and zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URAAAAAP! Your belly needs room to breath.\" With a smile, Chloe started rubbing Vincent's belly, easing the pressure within the giant orb. Vincent blushed but he didn't protest further. He started rubbing Chloe's belly, the two of them simultaneously let out a loud belch of pleasure. Seeing two overweight lovebirds with stuffed bellies belch loudly as they gave each loving belly rubs reminded Banagher of the moments he spent doing the same with Audrey. The moments he had been deprived of, and would continue to be deprived of for a while. Looking away from Vincent and Chloe for a moment, Marida noticed Banagher was frowning as he stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" He knew very well it was nothing, but talking about it felt like it would just make the pain even worse. Plus talking about it in front two people he barley knew would be embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida didn't know what Banagher was sad about, but she knew it had something to do with the mutual belly rubs between Vincent and Chloe. In hopes of getting his mind off them, the redhead reached over and started rubbing Banagher's swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Banagher forced a smile and rubbed Marida's belly. Aside from the belches and moans, he was awkwardly silent. To rectify this, Marida asked Banagher a question that had been on her mind for a while but she kept forgetting to ask him. As soon as she got done burping into her fist, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRP! Excuse me. Why do you bother putting your belt on each day if it can't fit?\" It was such a small detail, but the way Banagher would go out of his way every day to wear something completely useless was bugging the crap out of her. Not only was it completely illogical, but it made Banagher look even fatter, which she knew was the last thing his fragile self-esteem needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! This thing.\" Banagher reached down and grabbed one half of his belt that was uselessly hanging down. \"I -UUUUUURP- keep it on in case I can ever get it to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I'll get lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how belts work. UUURAAAP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURAP! There's a chance I'll figure out some -URRRP- way to make it fit. There's no harm in not giving up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Marida to understand exactly what Banagher's logic was, but when she did she gave a small smile, and playfully shook her head. She pat her little brother on the head and said, \"You're a goofball.\" Marida patted his belly a few times, and Banagher belched in response with a grin on his round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an excellent belch.\" Marida said as she gave his packed full belly a few more pats in a congratulatory manner, eliciting another burp out of Banagher's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of the four lazing around as they belched, chatted, gave soothing belly rubs, and were really glad that no customers came in, Banagher discussed with Vincent what his working hours would be. With Marida's advice, they decided on seven hours a day, from 12 PM to 7PM, starting tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waking -URAP- you up at 10 AM. Excuse me.\" Marida said, still rubbing Banagher's tummy as he rubbed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you -URP- wake me -URRRRP- up at 11 instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you need time to fully wake up, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and walk. You should be waking up at 10 AM anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10 AM is way -UUUUURP- too early.\" Chloe interjected. \"I'm glad I don't have to -UUUURP- wake up at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you an employee too?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're Vin -UUURAAP- cent's first employee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked around the bistro. \"I thought it was weird we were the only ones in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is really interested in working for ten dollars an hour. Even Neo-Ze- URRRRRAP- on pays better.\" Vincent said. \"Can you move you to the side?\" He asked Chloe, who moved her hand to the side of his tummy. \"UUUUURRRP! Ahh, thanks.\" The overweight brunette then resumed talking to the other overweight brunette. \"It's probably a good thing, I can't afford to hire many more then you. I can handle cooking and cleaning anyw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe slapped Vincent's tummy, making him wince as his flab jiggle violently, the impact forcing a loud burp out of him. \"No you can't! I keep telling -URRRRRRP- you you're working too hard!\" Chloe scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this usually happen?\" Banagher whispered to Marida as Chloe continued scolding her lover, who futilely tired to convince her he wasn't pushing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's complicated.\" She whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand if I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave her a quizzical look, it wasn't like Marida to keep secrets. He wasn't one to pry, he would respect their wishes if they wanted this to remain private, Banagher wouldn't have even asked them specifically about whatever their situation was. But what made him worried was that that wasn't Marida's reason for not telling him, it was because she felt he wasn't ready to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida cleared her throat loudly to get the couple's attention. \"Thanks again for the meal, but I think it's about time we leave. Here's the payment.\" Marida pulled out her wallet and placed the payment on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, if you want I could apply an employee discount for Banagher's half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida started to slowly heave herself out of her chair. \"That's not -huff- necessary.\" She managed to stand up after some difficulty and took a moment to catch her breath. She noticed it wans't quite as hard to stand up this time as it usually was, she hoped it was a sign her exercise with Banagher was paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher tried to get up as well but found that his stomach made him too heavy and had to plop back down. He panted as he belly moved in and out with every breath. He burped and tried again, meeting failure once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" Marida already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's cheeks were red, and not because of exhaustion. 'Yeah, thanks.\" He reached his hand out and Marida grabbed it. It took quite a bit of grunting but Marida was able to get Banagher on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that food was gooood. UUUURRRRP!\" The brunette said with a grin, patting his belly in satisfaction right before he bumped bellies with a confused Marida, waves of blubber jiggling from the collision as the two of them burped in unison from it, only Marida bothered to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" The redhead asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's grin got big. \"It's a belly bump. A little thing me and Audrey do after we stuff ourselves silly.\" He gave his stomach a hearty slap for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like fun.\" Chloe remarked with interest and then immediately bumped her stuffed belly into Vincent's. Just like their two overfed friends, it made them unleash a massive belch in perfect sync as their tummies jiggle and wobbled like mad.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cool night breeze hit the bellies of Banagher and Marida, the two shivering as they wobbled home. \"Oof, that's one thing that sucks -UUUUURP- about being fat: having your -URRRRAAP- stomach hang out on a cool night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida burped and apologized for it. \"Agreed.\" The two were rubbing their swollen stomachs to both ease the aches inside, and also to warm up a little. \"How are you settling in so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" Banagher paused to belch. \"I'm liking it here. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida already had a good feeling of what he was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I-I miss everyone and I'm worried about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida avoided eye contact out of shame. \"I see.\" She wished she had more to say but she couldn't find the words. Banagher couldn't find his either, leaving the wind as the only thing they heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette cleared his throat. \"I'm not mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida could now bring herself to look him in the eyes, but finding more then two words to express her gratitude was more difficult. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. So, um...\" Banagher struggled to find a subject to lighten the mood. \"Is walking with my stomach exposed on a chilly night another thing about being fat I'll have to get used to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the overfed pair wobbled home, and gave each other belly rubs when they arrived, Audrey had just gotten dressed in her pajamas. During her talk with Shin, he informed her that they would infiltrating Palau tomorrow via a shuttle a spy ECOAS had in Neo-Zeon would supply them with and pilot for them. The plan they had agreed on was that after arriving, Audrey would go to Marida's house (the spy having informed them that was where Banagher was at), which she was familiar with enough that she wouldn't need directions to, and assuming Banagher wasn't there alone, she would leave a letter addressed to Banagher, the envelope saying it was from one Audrey Burne. If Banagher had not told Marida about the blonde's new name, then she would see nothing wrong with the letter and pass it to Banagher without a second thought. If she was aware of the princess' new name, then that's also okay, as Marida respected and cared for Audrey too much to intrude upon her privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter would inform Banagher of a place to meet the princess at tomorrow. Once he arrived at said meeting place, Audrey would pass along a map showing him what route to take in the planned rescue operation that would occur in two days from then. Then came the last and hardest part of the plan: Audrey would leave Banagher and then return to the Nahel Argama to await his safe return in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she would need all the energy she could get, the strawberry blonde was going to bed early. She was considering leaving her pajama top unbuttoned as the button were very tight on her humongous belly, but she decided she should herself for going a whole day without choosing to stuff herself full of food. And seeing those buttons not be defeated by her stomach as her day came to a close felt VERY rewarding. With a pleased look on her chubby face, she proudly pat her round belly, not even minding how it jiggled so much from every pat, and laid down in bed. She exchanged good nights with Haro and went to sleep. Well, it took a while because her body was used to staying up much longer then 11 PM, but she did eventually fall asleep, thoughts of what her reunion with Banagher would be like filling her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-UUUUUURRP- -Munch- -Munch- -Munch- -Gulp- -Gulp- -Gulp- -UUUURRAP- -Scarf- -Scarf- -Scarf- -Scarf-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher yawned and stretched as he got into a sitting up position. He then lazily gave his belly a scratch as he noticed Marida was holding a tray with a plate of pancakes on it next to some orange juice. \"Breakfast in bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy.\" Marida placed the tray on her little brother's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Banagher happily gobbled up his breakfast as it laid atop his tummy, Marida was very pleased to see him enjoying this. Once he finished his plate, the brunette leaned back in the bed with a content look on his round face and let out a satisfied burp as he happily rubbed his belly in circles. He then got of bed and went to the bathroom to take a shower and brush his teeth, showering while having a big belly was still a feeling he wasn't quite used to yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Gundam pilot walked into the living room, he saw that what he just ate was only part 1 of his breakfast, part 2 was waiting for him on the coffee table. There was two plates, one had two stacks of pancakes waiting for him with plenty of syrup, and the other had eight strips of bacon. It was topped off with another carton of orange juice. Banagher almost felt his stomach growl in hunger at the sight of it. \"Is that for me?\" Normally he would've assumed it was Marida's but she was currently eating her own breakfast at the kitchen table, and apparently writing a report of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I already said this, but thanks!\" He sat down in the couch and Just as he did with part 1, Banagher eagerly ate up part 2 of his breakfast. Once finished, he leaned back with pleased look on his face as licked some foodstuffs off his lips, pat his now-swollen belly, and let out a content burp. \"That hit the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Marida took a bite out of a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Banagher left for work, Marida guiding him to the bistro as he hadn't had the directions memorized yet. At the same time, Audrey woke up. As much as she wanted to stay in bed a little longer, she forced hersel fout of bed as soon as she was awake, today was far too important to even slightly risk sleeping in. She yawned as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro woke up at the same time. \"Good morning, Audrey!\" The mechanical ball cheerfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Haro.\" Audrey said and then burped into her fist. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you to see Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but you can't. It's too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Haro made Audrey realize exactly what the term \"puppy dog eyes\" refers to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to resist Haro's charm, but her willpower only lasted for three seconds.  \"Okay, you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Yay!\" The green ball excitedly bounced up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and getting dressed, Audrey left her room and walked to the cafeteria. She sat down at the usual table and ate her breakfast with Micott and Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So today's the big day.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. I'm only informing Banagher of the plan to rescue him.\" The princess clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's still a pretty important day. Look at you, you're so excited you're shaking.\" Micott grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\" Audrey looked down to see that yes, she was shaking a little, the little jiggles it caused only served to place emphasis on that. \"I'm not shaking that much...\" The blonde blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just because you're not there yet.\" Takuya teased. \"Speaking of, you sure you can't bring Banagher home first and come back for the Unicorn later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could, but it would be next to impossible to drag the Unicorn around in the middle of a battlefield. I'm sorry, I understand if you think that seems cruel of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want all this to end.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio soon finished their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRAP! Are you leaving for Pallet or whatever now?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Palau, and not yet. I want to explain exactly what the plan is to Riddhe and Micott. Can you tell them to meet me in my room? I have to check in with Shin first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, how long are you going to be doing that?\" Takuya asked as he rubbed his pleasantly full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten minutes at most, thank you for doing this. Actually, if you don't mind, can you wait with them in my room? I want to say goodbye before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I want to say goodbye too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey got up and left, bringing Haro with her. As soon as they were sure she was too far away to hear them, Takuya and Micott got up and left the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe we have to move all that food in just ten minutes.\" The brunette complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddhe and Mihiro will be helping us, we can make it in time if we hurry.\"</span></div></div>",

I'd rather not explode out of my clothes in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take this the wrong way, but isn't that your current state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but at least the explosion won't be in public... This time, at least.\" The princess' expression contained some memory-induced embarrassment. \"We probably won't be needing those anyways, there's nothing outwardly suspicious about what we'll be doing. Even if someone does suspect us, I'll just tell them my name. I may have put on over fifty pounds but my face is still recognizable. Full Frontal has most likely not told anyone about my leaving Neo-Zeon to ensure I don't get any supporters. So I still have all my authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Shin put the uniform back in the box and pulled out a case no bigger then the ones used to carry glasses. He then opened that case to reveal two devices small enough one could fit both of them in their grasp. \"This is a two-way radio earpiece, it'll be our most useful tool. Update me on your progress periodically, I won't be that far from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face didn't show it, but a part of Audrey was excited to see that she would be wearing those. She remembered that Marida would wear them when she took on mission that involved going into civilian areas. In fact, she was probably wearing one when she chased after her in Industrial 7. To wear those, to Audrey it was like sorta kinda almost being as cool and tough as Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin closed the case and put it back in the box, which he then closed. \"That's everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Sorry if this seems rude, but I need to go back to my room now, my friends are waiting there for me to say goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, do you mind if I come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey entered her room with Shin in tow, she saw Riddhe, Micott, Mihiro, and Takuya all waiting for her in it. That was expected but what she didn't expect was that her coffee table would absolutely overflowing with food like pizza, cake, cookies, hamburgers, and hot dogs, to name a few. There was also some smaller piles near the coffee table itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Haro exclaimed as he flapped his ears in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" The blonde was too confused to even try to guess what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little surprise party for you.\" Takuya had a smile on his soft face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We noticed you've been feeling pretty down lately.\" Riddhe answered, a smile adorning his own face. Audrey thought on how that was a massive understatement, something all of them likely knew, but she didn't interrupt him. \"So we decided to throw you a party to show you that we care about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the full meaning of those words sunk in, a huge smile formed on the Zabi's face. \"Really?\" was all she could say, her voice nearly squeaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you, Audrey! Love! Love!\" Haro said as he flapped his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And all that food on the table is yours.\" Micott pointed towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-All of it?\" Audrey's stomach immediately growled in hunger, asking for it's owner to please eat it all. The princess was almost watering at the mouth. \"But what are you all going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, you just eat all you want.\" Shin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up! Eat up! Get a big, big stuffed belly!\" Haro chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I will.\" Audrey gave Haro a loving pat. \"So this is why you wanted to come with me, Shin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've seen how excited he was when we told him about the party.\" Mihiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all so much. I... I really don't know what to say.\" Audrey's eyes had a light to them no one had seen in them since Banagher was kidnapped. \"But are you sure you won't mind not eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one said we're not eating anything, everything not on the table is for us.\" Takuya said as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a party unless everyone is pigging out.\" Micott said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get how you all didn't get fat sooner.\" Mihiro said, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're not going to pig out.\" Riddhe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am!\" Mihiro gave her pudgy tummy a proud slap, making the soft expanse jiggle. \"Just because I'm the only one here actually trying to lose weight doesn't mean I know when when to have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro's tummy was a soft ball of flab that would form a nice muffin top. It would fill up her lap whenever she sat down, and gave her something to mess with when her role as the communications officer got boring. If there was one thing Mihiro liked about her weight gain, it was how it made her boobs bigger. They were much more jiggly now, and strained her bra to it's limits. Her ass was massive, second only to Micott's in size, and completely filled up any normal-sized char sh e sat down in it, including the communications officer's chair, which was a problem. Her huge butt was complimented by chubby legs that had zero separation between them. Her face was more cherubic with it's softer cheeks and small double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Riddhe weren't the only ones there suffering from wardrobe difficulties because of gaining weight. Takuya and Micott's respective shirts had risen up their stomachs so much their deep navels were exposed. Unlike Banagher and Riddhe, they could keep their pants closed but buttoning them had become an annoying chore at this point due to how hard it was to do so. Takuya also had to deal with the other annoyance of clipping his belt too, though that was still more then Banagher could say. Micott's ass was so huge her short shorts had ridden up a bit and left some of her ass cheeks exposed. Mihiro's uniform was visibly tight on her, especially her pants and belt, her pants in particular looking like they would rip if she bent down to grab something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group begun happily pigging out, except for Haro, who of course couldn't eat, and Shin, who ate a regular amount of snacks as he the only one among them who wasn't fat. Audrey was smiling the whole time as she quickly shoveled more and more food into her greedy mouth, Haro sitting right by her side the whole time. Food wasn't the only thing filling up her stomach, she was also chugging obscene amounts of soda, the carbonation increasing the quantity and quality of her belches. Soon her tremendous belly popped off the buttons on her coat and pants, allowing her gut to bulge out even further and force her zipper all the way down, showing the world her pink underwear. What was Audrey's reaction? She just slapped her big belly with pride and burped with equal amounts of pride, seeing that as an accomplishment, though she did ask Mihiro if she could please sew them back on after the party, which she agreed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, the party was finally finished and all he food was eaten. All party members except for Shin sporting greatly bloated stomachs they rubbed as they moaned and belched in satisfaction. Audrey's was the biggest there, which was impressive considering Riddhe's was normally bigger then hers when they weren't bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big, goofy smile on her face, Audrey happily rubbed her big belly in circles and unleashed a magnificent belch. \"UUUUURRRAP! That was so -UUUUUUURP- good. Thank you all -URAAAAAP- again for doing -UURRRRRRP- this.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Licking her lips, Audrey rubbed her big belly in circles around the middle of it and unleashed a loud, unladylike belch as she wobbled out of her room, still sporting a big, dorky smile. Her tummy jiggled with every step, as did her boobs and behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, we forgot to sew your buttons back on!\" Mihiro called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rectifying that mistake, it was time for Audrey and Shin to leave. They boarded the shuttle, the pilot asked them what took them so long and Shin simply told him there was a meeting they had to attend, knowing that Audrey wouldn't want anyone other then a good friend to know about her pigging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't help but sigh in comfort as she sat down in her seat, walking while being this fat and bloated was very tiring, holding Haro. Shin sat down next to her, both as a bodyguard and a family member. As the shuttle started taking off almost immediately, all the preparations having be done while Audrey and Shin were partying, Audrey had to keep looking through the window at the slowly shrinking sight of the Nahel Argama. \"It's only been little more then a week, yet it feels like the Nahel Argama has been my home for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi soon grew drowsy from the feeling of having a bloated belly. No matter how sleepy she felt, she tried desperately to force herself to stay awake, not willing to supposedly \"embarrass\" herself by taking a nap in front of Shin. She even tried to make her yawns quiet. Of course, there was nothing she could do about the tired look in her green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a nap if you want.\" Shin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped, she was too tired to even remember that she was trying to keep the belching to a minimum so the pilot wouldn't hear. \"Huh? I'm-I'm not tired.\" She said as she struggled to keep her head held up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,  I'm not judging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thank you, Shin.\" Audrey rested her head and very soon fell asleep. She might've not been so easily convinced had she known that not would she be snoring, but also talking in her sleep. Though even if she did, she still would've required very little convincing. \"Oh Banagher... give me that... big... jiggly... belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's eyes slowly opened. She looked around, first at her stomach which had digested the vast majority of her feast, which she was very glad for as she did not want to walk around for hours while being that stuffed, and then at the seat to her left that Shin was sitting, only he had evidently left it while she was asleep. Letting out a yawn, she assumed Shin was discussing thing with the pilot or using the bathroom. The Zabi looked around, thinking on how shuttles always looked so depressing when you were the only one there, but her eyes nearly bulged out when she looked at the window and saw that the shuttle was at a port in Palau. Audrey jumped out of her seat as fast her chunky body would allow and bolted out, her body jiggling violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the ship, the blonde saw that Shin wat right outside it, seemingly waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? You look worried.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was clearly out of breath, her belly moving in and out with every pant.. \"I -Pant- I just realized I slept in. -Pant-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that such an emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't -pant- I didn't want to be late. Did I delay the operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but we still have hours to do this. No need to be so worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed in relief. \"How long was I asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours. I wasn't waiting long for you if that's what you're asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I didn't. Now let's commence the operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we do that, you might want to button your clothes, I think they'll fit now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed, she thought she had forgotten something. \"Oh, r-right!\" She hastily zipped her pants back up and buttoned them before she buttoned her coat. This didn't change that she was still too large for her coat to hide that her blouse had rode up on her belly to right above her very deep navel, but in Audrey's words \"It's better then nothing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nas Audrey and Shin \"commenced the operation\" as the princess put it, Banagher was busy doing something much less exciting: Sitting in a chair and fighting the urge to fall asleep. The poor guy was bored out of his mind, not one single customer had come. He let out a yawn, wondering if it would be preferable for random people to be staring at his free gut again. At least then SOMETHING was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are most days this slow?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're not usually this slow, but yeah.\" Vincent said. Normally he would be in the kitchen now, but since things were so slow today, he figured there was no harm done waiting it out at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at the clock again, this time it read that it was 5:04. That meant that he had spent five straight hours of doing nothing. Thankfully it was time for that to end, as the bistro's bell rang, signaling to Vincent and Banagher that a customer had entered. They looked towards the door to see a young women entering, around Banagher's age. Banagher found her cute, which normally would be a good thing, but when he was obese and unable to hide his massive stomach, this was a worst-case scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Welcome! W-What would you like?\" Banagher stuttered, hoping the girl would just say she was asking for directions and then leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll need to take a look at your menu first.\" She chuckled as she sat down at a table, Banagher eternally grateful she didn't sit down at his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, r-right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait for the order in the kitchen.\" Vincent got up and waddled back to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher began strategizing what the least embarrassing way to take the girl's order would be. \"Okay, how should I do this? When she gives the order, I'll just stay here and write it down, I won't get u[. But hwat about when I need to give the order to Vincent? Should I just shout? No, I'm not going to half-ass my job. I'll just have to grin and bear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to make my order.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it be?\" Banagher got his pen and notepad ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to come over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-No need! I'll just write it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. I'll have caveira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher wrote that down. \"Coming right up.\" He nervously got up and did a fast walk to the kitchen, blushing for he knew that the girl saw his ass jiggle. \"Here's the order.\" He said as he handed Vincent the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said and soon started cooking the order. What didn't happen soon though was Banagher leaving. \"You don't have to stay here, I won't be done with this for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I just... don't want her to see my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to see it when you deliver it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But it's better if she only sees it once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't been fat for long, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sighed and placed a hand on his soft tummy. \"No, I'm still getting used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher hid in the kitchen, Audrey was approaching Marida's house, holding Haro with her the whole time. \"It's only been a week since I left Palau, yet it feels like years.\" Looking around, she saw that everything looked the same, she felt it was foolish of her, but Palau still felt somewhat unfamiliar. \"Palau feels like it's changed, but it hasn't. So why can't I shake this feeling? Like I don't belong here anymore. I do belong here, as much as I hate it, I'm still a Zabi. The only thing about me that's changed is that I've got this huge gut now.\" Audrey lifted up her rotund middle and then let it drop, watching how much it jiggled. \"... I miss Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through Palau was pretty much the same experience for Audrey as it was Banagher, though it was even more embarrassing for Audrey as the people who saw her knew who she was. Every time a blush manifested on her face, all Audrey could do was hope that the stranger who saw her didn't recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon came across what she recognized as Marida's house. As soon as she did she placed herself against the wall of an alleyway, which did nothing to hide her huge middle but Audrey thought she was being both stealthy and cool as hell. She called Shin. \"I've located the mission objective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a mailbox, Audrey, you don't need to take it so seriously.\" Shin was at a nearby street behind Audrey, alternating between keeping his eyes peeled for any sign of Marida, and keeping an eye on Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi blushed. \"I-I-I'm just using the proper terminology, for your intel! At any rate, I'm making the delivery.\" Audrey moved out from her hiding spot after checking to make sure no one was nearby. Crouching, Audrey looked both ways before slowly crossing the street. Upon crossing it, she then started crawling along the ground, which her tummy made awkwardly done as it squished against the ground and wobbled. Upon reaching the mailbox, Audrey removed the envelope from her pocket, placed it in the mailbox, and then raised the flag to be polite. With her objective complete, Audrey then left the street the same way she came to it, unaware that all her stealth was pointless as Marida was out buying groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shin, I've completed the objective.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Here's your meal.\" Banagher quickly placed the plate of caveira on the girl's table and then awkwardly walked back to his table as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The girl said, watching the brunette's butt bob as he walked. \"Hey, are you new here? I didn't see you the last time I was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, she's talking to me.\" Banagher thought. \"Yeah, this is my first day here.\" He answered. \"Actually, I just moved here a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? This place isn't exactly high class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, well, it's complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So did you get a job here because you like the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher blushed. \"I-I didn't get fat off the food here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I wasn't saying you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, uh, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled and told Banagher it was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young women finished her meal in half an hour, it was clear from the speed she ate that she really enjoyed it. \"Waiter, I'm finished. I'm ready to pay now.\" She said as she got her wallet out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there. Just, uh...\" Banagher looked down at his stomach as he tried to find the courage to show it to her. He couldn't tell why, but getting to know the customer a little made him even more shy about his weight. \"Just give me a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on the brunette's embarrassment, the customer offered the obvious solution. \"How about I come give it to you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great, thanks.\" Banagher then got as close to his table as he possibly could so he could hide his gut under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl walked over and placed the payment on the table. \"And here's your tip.\" She said as she placed ten extra dollars down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, this will really help me out.\" He said, hoping his man boobs weren't noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. I'll see you around.\" The customer walked to the front door, but right before she left, she stopped and looked back at Banagher. \"By the way, your tummy is really cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The pilot's blush returned in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the customer left the bistro, leaving Banagher alone with those words. \"She's just messing with me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the bistro's only customer for the day, which meant that Banagher only had to sit there and wait for a little over an hour for Vincent to come out of the kitchen, close up shot, and pay Banagher. At Marida's request, he was paying him cash at the end of every work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"here you, seventy dollars.\" He said as he handed Banagher the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Ah, great. I just realized I don't have my wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you leave it at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you count the Nahel Argama as my home, which I kinda do these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida could hold onto the money for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should still see about getting a wallet soon.\" He placed the money in his pocket for now. \"Hey, that girl is a regular here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, she comes here every now and then. She's my biggest customer, which isn't saying a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she ever talk about your weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef gave a quizzical look. \"No, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, signaling again that someone had entered the bistro. \"How was work, Banagher?\" The person who entered was Marida, jiggling with every step like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was fine.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Marida. I'm closed now but if you don't mind paying, I could cook dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but we're actually going to be eating at Gilboa's home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another member of the Garencieres' crew. He wants to meet you so he invited us both to dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bistro with him, Marida guided Banagher to Gilboa's house. It was a bit of a long walk, and the chill of the night was starting to set in, neither were a good thing for two out-of-shape pilots that had their belly fat exposed to the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A letter came for you while you were at work.\" Marida confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher shivered a little. \"How? I've only been for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was confused too. It says it's from someone called Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's light brown eyes widened, the shock of hearing that news stole all his focus and directed it towards it and nothing else. It was impossible for him to think of anything else, he had even forgotten he was cold. \"Audrey's here's on Palau?\" His mind could only create questions like that and muse on the possible answers. \"Was she captured? Did she come to rescue me? Is it a trap? If Zeon got her, then I need to sneak out and rescue her somehow. But how would I even get away without Marida noticing? Maybe I could run away while on the way to work. No, that won't work. Marida will show up to pick me up and Vincent will tell her he hasn't seen me. maybe I could really stuff Marida to the brim, like so full she falls into a food coma. That might work, but does she even have that much food? And how would I get her to eat it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that's the name the princess goes by now.\" Marida unknowingly brought Banagher back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What did it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't read it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to make sure I don't escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I still respect both your rights to privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher showed a heartwarming grin that Marida unfortunately didn't see. \"Thanks. You're a great big sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher couldn't see it but Marida was blushing. \"Please don't call me that in front of Gilboa and his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sis.\" Banagher felt a little proud about that one. \"You know, you should've waited until we got home to  tell me about the letter, because now I can kinda want to rush though dinner so I can read it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida spent three seconds trying to think of a counterargument. \"That's actually a good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Banagher.\" With a smile, Gilboa greeted the brunette once he and Marida had entered his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust from the way Gilboa said that one sentence, the overweight brunette immediately knew he was a completely different person from Full Frontal. Kind and jovial, Gilboa had in less then ten seconds done a better job calming Banagher's fears about Neo-Zeon then Full Frontal had in over ten minutes.  \"Yeah, I'm probably fatter then you expected.\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't get mad at her, but Marida told me all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him I finally found an exercising partner.\" The obese redhead explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to call him your exercise buddy, the poor kid's gonna have trouble thinking of you as his big sis when you're so damn formal about everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Gilboa's doing it, then does that mean I can call you my big sis while we're here?\" Banagher knew what the answer was, but he was having too much fun messing with Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget what I said, it looks like you're already his big sister. Anyways, dinner's all ready. Take off your shoes and sit down at the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher did so, finding that the other members of the household were already seated at the table. \"Oh, you must be Banagher.\" A women said, Banagher saw that was clearly Gilboa's wife, and judging from the oven mitts she just took off, the cook as well. \"I must say, I'm glad to be serving another person with such a healthy appetite.\" That made Banagher wonder if Gilboa's wife might've been part of the reason Marida had gained so much weight. Then again, most of the binges he saw Marida do were done without her. So who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to lose weight, but I can't hold back when I'm invited to dinner.\" Banagher said, rubbing his stomach in anticipation. He was unaware that Marida had told Gilboa's wife to make sure she really stuffs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good attitude.\" Gilboa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilboa had three children, all of whom were also sitting at the table. If Banagher to guess the age of the oldest, Tikva, he was no older then 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilboa's wife placed the dinner on the table, it consisted of saut\u00e9ed rabbit, soup, bread, and potato salad that was piled up like a hill, Banagher and Marida's servings were much larger then the others. This meal was already amazing for Banagher and he hadn't even eaten anything yet. The food wasn't what made this so important to him, it was that it was a family eating dinner. He had eaten dinner with his mother many times, but that was only with his mother. It was never the image he had seen in media and books. But now, he was eating with that image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the family said their thanks to God, Banagher awkwardly joining in on it despite having never done it before, it was time to eat. Banagher pigged out with gusto, it was easily one of his biggest binges ever, able to give Marida a run for her money. It was quite the sight to see him happily shoveling down plate after plate of food, asking for another serving as soon as he finished each one, to see him get another serving so many times as his belly grew bigger and bigger as he kept eating and eating. When he was finally done eating, he was sporting a giant, stuffed belly as he leaned back in his chair and rubbed it, a huge, please smile on his chubby face. Marida was in a similar state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRP! Man, that was -UUUURRRP- good!\" Banagher gave his big belly a proud slap for emphasis, the impact making the mass of soft fat jiggle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida tenderly massaged her swollen belly, noting how Banagher's belly was the biggest she had ever seen it, the orb of adipose was almost as large as hers when it wasn't full of food. She burped into her fist and apologized for it before making a comment. \"Not TOO good, I hope. Keep eating at that rate, and we'll have to up our game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's tummy gurgled loudly. \"UUURP! UUUUURRAP! URRAAP! Don't act like I'm the only one here with a stuffed belly, Marida.\" He teased with a grin as he lightly elbowed Marida in her stomach, making the soldier burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher belted out another loud belch. \"Ahh, aren't meals like this the best?  This was gre -UUUURRAP- at!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...very nice, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see someone enjoy my cooking like Marida does.\" Gilboa's wife said as she eyed Banagher's impressive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's someone who enjoys good food, alright.\" Marida commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gut is proof of that!\" Banagher gave it a big slap for emphasis, the giant belly jiggling in a gelatinous fashion. \"UUUUURRP! Whew! To think just a week ago I was skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were? Huh, you didn't mention that part, Marida.\" Gilboa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know if he was okay with others knowing that.\" Marida clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you from the Federation?\" The voice of Tikva cut into the conversation, surprising all it's members. He had been mostly quiet this dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? URRP! Yeah. I was forced to come here. To Palau -UUUURP- I mean, I'm happy to be a guest in your home.\" Now that Tikva was his main focus, Banagher taking a good look at his face made him realize that the eldest child had been staring at him a lot throughout dinner, he was just too focused on food to notice. There was something chilling about it, it was like being stalked by a lion cub. The cub may be harmless, but the killing intent it displayed wasn't any different that that of a full grown one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're a prisoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tikva, I told you to treat him normally.\" Tikva's father scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just asking a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm -URAAAAP- something like a prisoner.\" Were he in the mood to be fully honest about his situation, Banagher would say he felt as chained as any other prisoner would feel. He was usually able to suppress that feeling when he was being treated well, but not always. The sense of freedom he was given was false, an illusion created by Full Frontal to indoctrinate him into Neo-Zeon, something he knew. And he imagined Marida knew that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're lucky to be our prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm -URRRRRP- lucky that Zeon felt uncharacteristically kind enough to not execute me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikva was momentarily stunned by that, unable to think of a comeback The purpose behind Banagher's verbal strike was twofold, both to serve as a deterrence against a potential argument, and to make it clear to Marida that his stance hadn't changed at all. Unfortunately, deterrence is only so effective against someone who feels they have something to stand for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?! Well, I hope you're enjoying all that food mom made for you, because if you were a Federation prisoner, they wouldn't give you anything. You'd be tortured!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tikva, enough!\" His mother scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Feder -UUURRRP- ation doesn't -URAAAP- do things like that.\" Banagher knew he shouldn't be mad at a child for saying stupid things, but logic is often unable to stand against emotions. He was tempted to bring up the torture Zeon had done during the One Year War, but he really wasn't in the mood to make this argument anymore heated then it already was. All he wanted to do was just relax, rub his belly, belch some gas out, have actually pleasant conversations, and maybe take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they do! My dad says so. He was a prisoner on Earth, and the captain rescued him from the camp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he tried to force the memory away, Banagher still saw the image of his classmates, his friends, being killed in the crossfire of the Industrial 7 battle, the battle that Zeon caused. \"I...\" He tried not to, but he glanced at his big sister, something she noticed. \"I know people whose friends and family were killed by Zeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Marida, who burped loudly, the others at the dinner table showed shocked expressions. The fact that their cause had gotten people killed was a bitter truth they tried to suppress, something that couldn't be done when that truth was raised in front of their faces. Of course, that was only how Tikva and his parents felt. his younger siblings sill couldn't even comprehend the idea of Zeon doing something bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well the same goes for us! This is war. Zeon is fighting for the Spacenoids, you're a Spacenoid, so why are you siding with the Federation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control yourself, Tikva, or you'll make your dad angry.\" Gilboa might not have been yelling, but it was clear he was already angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No war -UUUURP- is ever -URRRRAAP- right.\" Banagher couldn't feel any of the food's taste anymore, or enjoy the feeling of a full stomach. All he could feel was sadness. \"Even if what you're saying is right, that doesn't mean that Ze -URAAAAP- on dropping a colony and killing millions of people is something that should just be written off.\" Gilboa grimaced at the mention. \"The people Zeon killed, they didn't have a chance to think if the cause they were dying for was right or -URRRP- not. The soldiers who killed them woke up that day knowing what would happen, but their victims didn't. It just wasn't fair, not fair at all. I...\" It was impossible for Banagher to talk about killing without reminding himself of the one he had done. \"URRRRRP! There was nothing else I could've done. I didn't mean to kill him, but... if Sergei didn't die, then I would've.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikva tried to force himself to not cry, to stay angry at Banagher, but his facade was paper-thin. As evident as the anger Banagher felt towards himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a killer. Even so, I'm not a murderer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, no one was able to find the words to say. Instead of words, what broke the silence was the sound of piles of dishes clattering, the result of Marida slamming her meaty hands on the table as she stood up. \"Come with me. UUUUURAAAP!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher found himself being led somewhere he didn't recognize. At first he thought Marida was angrily taking him home but the scenery soon turned unfamiliar as he wobbled behind her, their full tummies bobbing and bouncing with every step. That didn't really help with the digestion. Initially the walk was silent with neither chubby pilot saying a thing. The only sounds they heard were the occasional gust of wind, their stomachs bubbling and gurgling, and the belches they released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must hate me.\" Banagher solemnly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" For the first time in his life, Banagher heard Marida express shock. She immediately stopped moving and turned to face Banagher. \"What gave you that idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what I said. Aren't you taking me somewhere to punish-\" Marida placed a hand on Banagher's soft shoulder, preventing him from finishing that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Then you must be disappointed in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What you said there wasn't -URAP- wrong. No war is ever truly -UUUURRP- justified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're not mad at me, then where are you taking me? This isn't the way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something you need to see.\" Marida turned around and resumed leading Banagher to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town soon disappeared behind them, and a rocky quarry Banagher had never seen appeared in front of them. Marida led him down a tunnel, the lights in it were still functional, but the fact that Marida had to turn them on was proof that they were the only ones there tonight. In fact, Banagher got the impression that they were this place's only recent visitors. He couldn't put it into words, but abandoned places always gave off a certain feel to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the tunnel was the last thing Banagher expected to see: a church, one built into the tunnel itself. \"This was built back when Palau was still in the asteroid belt.\" Marida led to Banagher to the front of a the altar of a cross. It wasn't constructed professionally, being merely a cross placed on a pile of rocks, but the hope it held for the ones who placed it still shone brightly even now. \"When you look back at the earliest space pioneers, they -UUURRP-! Excuse me. They were mostly beggars and political prisoners. They sought to settle in space because there was nowhere else for them to live. They saw when the Universal Century began, the prime minister stated that we were bringing an end to the era of God. For the people who lived in the asteroid belt, the sun was as indistinguishable from any distant star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing talk of starts and hope made Banagher think of Audrey's own words on the subject. \"There are two hundred billion stars in the galaxy, and this is only a small part of that seen from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They needed a light to guide them.\" Marida's eyes were fixated on the cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A -UUUUURP- light?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing can live without light. URRRAAP! Excuse me. But the people abandoned in space eventually found a new light to replace God. And the new light that they found was Zeon. It gave them hope where there was despair, so they could overcome the impossible and keep living in this cruel world. It held out the shinning -UUUUURRP-! Excuse me. The shinning promise that we could all become better. You might find it foolish to put your faith in something so intangible, there are those who would say that ideas like this are not essential to life. I think those people must be either very lucky or very deluded.\" The pilot for Zeon waddled over to a nearby bench and sat down on it, sighing in relief as the bench groaned in pain. \"Apologies for all the belching. I'm aware it made my point hard to take seriously.\" She rubbed her packed-full stomach as it gurgled up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't, words like those can't be weakened by anything.\" The brunette answered as he sat down next to her, he too sighed in relief as the bench once again groaned. He placed a hand on Marida's middle and started rubbing, Marida herself returned the favor, both of them belching as their soft hands soothing circles on the other's massive belly. \"Humanity -URRRRRRP- alone possesses a G -UUUURRRP- od.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone once said that to me. Without burping, of course. He told me about the power to transcend the now, the inner god called possi -UUUUUUURP- bility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAAP! Pardon me. He must've been a romantic.\" Banagher was taken aback by Marida\u2019s smiling face, and felt rather happy too. An embarrassed and proud complicated feeling rose up his chest. \"A person cannot believe that without having strong faith in humanity and the world. Sounds like a nice person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at the cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensign Sergei,\" Marida's words made him look back at her. \"Don't worry about the lives you take in battle. When you go into battle, you become one with your machine, a combat unit called a pilot. There's no room for re -URP- grets. That said, you are already entangled in the situation and it's best you remember that. As for taking action to help protect princess Mineva, or Audrey, as you call her, I thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher showed her a warm smile, his chubby cheeks making it warm Marida's heart even more. \"You're welcome. I don't agree with everything you said, but thank you for saying all that. I really needed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I could help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rubbed each other's stomach in silence as they smiled at each other, though that silence was broken by a creaking sound, and before either of the tubby pilots could figure out what the source was, the poor, ages old bench broke under their heavy weights, sending them to the ground, their entire bodies jiggling violently, which stirred up the gas in their middles. They both belched out loudly at the same time, the expulsion of gas echoed loudly through the church and the rest of the tunnel. Were someone at the entrance of the tunnel as this happened, they would've heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really gotta lay off the pizza.\" Banagher said, he and Marida were both blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither knew what to say from there, but after a few seconds they snickered, which soon turned into bellyful laughter, their fat tummies and chubby cheeks jiggling. it was the first time Banagher had ever seen his big sister laugh any harder then a chuckle, and he was so glad to see it. And Marida was so glad to be laughing this hard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sight of Audrey and Shin walking into the lobby of a hotel could be found humorous by some. The stark contrast of how right next to a fit soldier with toned muscles, a soldier who was capable of winning many battles, both with and without a mobile suit, was an obese teenager who was so incredibly out-of-shape that her gut was constantly left exposed to the elements, with the buttons on her coat and pants rendered tight by her plentiful blubber. Where as Shin walked with a perfect form, Audrey had a bit of a waddle to hers due to how chunky her legs were, her legs and tummy jiggling and jostling with every footfall. She even seemed a bit tired from walking all the way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked up to the counter and, after taking a moment to catch her breath, Audrey ordered a room. \"How much does a room for one night cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be one hundred-Oh my God!\" The clerk exclaimed as soon as he was able to look past Audrey's new chubby features. \"Are-Are you Mineva Lao Zabi?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was pretty clearly caught off guard by the clerk's enthusiasm. \"Um, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you startled the poor thing.\" Shin chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shin...\" Audrey whined like someone telling their parents they were embarrassing her in front of all her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, princess. Please forgive me\" The clerk bowed his head in shame, one of Audrey's most hated sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk raised his head. \"Thank you. I'll have to talk with my boss about it, but I'm sure he'll agree to give you one of our best rooms for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather pay for an average room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure.\" It was hard for Audrey to not let some minor annoyance slip into her tone. She knew that he had only the best intentions and that she shouldn't get mad at him but being given special treatment because of her heritage always hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd like you to treat her like any other guest.\" Shin told the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I can do that but I'll try. You said one room for one night, right? That'll be one hundred dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to finish this conversation, Audrey pulled out her wallet and dug through it. \"Do you do change for five hundred dollar bills?\" She obliviously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumed digging through her wallet, mostly finding only five hundred dollar bills, looking at her wallet reminded her that she still hasn't gotten around to getting a fake ID as Audrey Burne. She did at one point find a fifty dollar bill, but only one. \"There has to be a one hundred dollar bill somewhere in here.\" After a few more seconds of searching, she found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey grunted as she finally managed to fit her pajama pants past her impressive booty. \"Phew.\" She sighed, thinking on how it was a good thing they brought her pajamas from the Argama with them. The last thing she needed was to be put in the situation of having to make do with pajamas her ass had ripped, for all she knew the pajamas the hotel had were even more of a tight squeeze. She took a moment to look at herself in the mirror, she felt she looked ridiculous, a big gut hanging out that stretched the buttons to their limit, a huge butt that was clearly too big for her pants, large boobs that ensured the top button wasn't the only button free of trouble that day, and chunky thighs that rubbed together. She grabbed the sides of stomach and looked down at it as she shook, watching all the blubber jiggle like mad. \"I need Banagher's hands on this gut. He always makes me feel good about having a big tummy.\" It took a few seconds for said big tummy she REALLY wanted Banagher to play with to stop jiggling and bouncing after she removed her hands from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her bathroom and ungracefully flopped down on her bed, it was tempting to fall asleep then and there but she needed to keep up a healthy sleep schedule for the meeting with Banagher tomorrow. She looked down at her tummy again, which obscured mot of her vision. \"At least I didn't pig out again. I wonder what Banagher and Marida are doing right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost got it...\" Banagher said he struggled to stand up, but his filled up stomach was simply too heavy, and he had to plop back down. \"Oof. This is -UUUURRP- tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always hardest to -UUURRRP-! Excuse me. It's always hardest to stand up after breaking a chair.\" Marida remarked as she rested a hand on her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher blinked. \"H -URP- Huh? You broke chairs before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida flashed back to all the times her formally of average size ass had broken chairs, the one she focused on the most being the first time it happened. It was when she was around Banagher's current weight, she and Audrey had just finished having a nice dinner together, the redhead was incredibly swollen from how much she had eaten, so much so she had to undo her top, sash, and pants to give her tummy enough breathing room. As she was chatting (which was peppered with belches of indigestion from the pilot) with the princess, a creaking sound from Marida's chair sounded, and before either of them could react, it broke, sending the poor women towards the ground with a grunt, her belly, breasts, and butt jiggling from the impact. It was humiliating, and while she already knew her steadily climbing weight was a \"big problem\" (Marida cringed at how she accidentally made a fat joke), that was the moment that made her realize her weight issues were even worse then she thought, and she thought they were pretty bad when she noticed her stomach kept her from seeing her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already blushing pretty hard, but when Audrey asked her if she was okay and the only response Marida could give her was a loud gurgle from her stomach followed up by a humongous belch, the poor redhead's chubby face was practically scarlet. Not her finest moment, and certainty a moment she'd rather her chubby little brother never find out about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes.\" Marida blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it happened here, instead of at Gilboa's house. Way less embarrassing.\" Banagher remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it is a bit blasphemous to break a bench in a house of God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is also true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir next plan to stand up was for Banagher to push himself up with Marida's shoulders, then pull Marida up by grabbing her hand. It was harder then it sounded. While Banagher was able to stand up that way, albeit with some grunting and difficulty, partly because their stuffed bellies pushed them away from each other when they faced each other, helping Marida, the over 300 pounds soldier, was the hardest part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready when you are.\" Marida extended her pudgy hand, which Banagher grasped after taking a brief moment to catch his breath. Both parties huffed and puffed as the out-of-shape teenager tried to pull up his incredibly obese big sister. Even with Marida doing her best to heave herself up, it was still hard for Banagher. And once he eventually succeeded in doing so, Marida was accidentally sent tumbling into Banagher, their tummies crashing, resulting in plenty of jiggling and one loud belch each. The brunette was almost knocked down by the Neo-Zeon soldier's massive girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Banagher? Do you need a belly rub?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm fine. Though a belly rub would be pretty nice.\" He placed his hands on his gut as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister chuckled. \"Wait until we get home for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk home wasn't really a walk, it was far more of a waddle, with the duo swaying about as if they were drunk on top of stuffed silly. Sometimes it almost looked like they were doing an imitation of a peg-legged pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so -UUUURRRP- jiggly.\" Banagher remarked as he watched his middle bounce up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not used to it? URRAAAP! Excuse me.\" Marida also watched all the jiggling Banagher's gut was doing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it feels kinda weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll feel natural after some time. Let me -URP- know if you have questions about being overweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it get in the way of piloting a mobile suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Aside from your chair being tighter, it's the same as piloting when you're slim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two moaned and belched as they wobbled home, giving their stomachs tender belly rubs the whole time, all of which was helping to ease the pressure in their packed full stomachs. When they arrived home they quickly collapsed onto the couch, groaning in relief once they planted their behinds on the soft cushions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAP! After all that, I need some TV.\" Banagher said after letting our a tired yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida burped into her fist. \"Before you that, don't you want to read the princess' letter?\" She said as she picked up the envelope up from the nearby stand and passed it o the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" He took it and quickly opened it and belched before he started reading the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Banagher,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so sorry for getting you caught up in all this. There is a rescue coming, meet me at the ice cream parlor tomorrow, I'll give you information on the operation there, and a proper apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll be waiting for you there at 12 PM, I'll wait for you there the entire day. I brought Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove this is from the real me, I'll recall something only we would now. After you woke up on the Nahel Argama, we binged in your room, gave each other belly rubs, and watched six episodes of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. I am looking forward to when we can enjoy moments like that together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher smiled at the letter. It was only a piece of paper, but it carried with it the spirit of his friend. It was almost like seeing her again, and he would be seeing her again tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look happy.\" Marida remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a really nice letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent chatting and watching shows Marida still wasn't used to yet as they gave each other belly rubs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida took a moment to watch Banagher and how he snored loudly, his belly sticking straight up into the air as a monument to his appetite, the mountain of fat moving in and out with every snore. Marida had never before thought that laziness could be so endearing until she met him. \"Breakfast,\" She said as she placed a tray containing his breakfast on to his stomach. Banagher's only reply was another snore that made Marida shake her head and pinched his chubby cheeks which finally woke him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" Banagher said with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for breakfast,\" Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully conscious - though still sleepy - Banagher held the plate up as he sat up, then placed it down on the top of his belly which had quickly become his favorite table. \"In bed again? Thanks!\" He said as he quickly ate part 1 of his large breakfast, punctuating it with a pleased belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resisting the urge to go back to sleep, Banagher got out of bed, dressed himself in his poorly-fitting clothes, and went to the living room to find a very hearty helping of pancakes waiting for him at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for part two?\" The obese redhead said to the fat brunette as she had her own hearty helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was sporting a goofy grin, \"Man, Marida! You're really gonna fatten me up!\" He said, happily drumming his belly as he waddled over, the blubbery orb jiggling to the beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fat enough already.\" Marida teased before taking a big bite out of a pancake. \"In all seriousness, we haven't done any exercise in a while. I was thinking we could jog to the bistro and then jog home after work. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gulped down a bit of pancake that had a good amount of syrup on it. \"That's fine. You're right, we have kinda been slacking off lately.\" It was then that he remembered he had to meet with Audrey today after work. \"Actually, is it alright if I only jog on the way there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't feel up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not time for the second jog yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that I'll probably feel too tired after work to jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already planning another binge?\" The pilot teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me, I'm always making sure I've got this big thing filled up.\" For the sake of emphasis, and because he liked playing with his gut, Banagher lifted his stomach up and then dropped it, resulting in waves of chub wobbling. \"I think I'll take a little walk around town, I still haven't gotten used to the neighborhood yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, you've got a gut to lose. I don't want to get in the way of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were both finished with their breakfast, it was time to start their jog. \"Ready, Banagher?\" Marida asked after doing some brief warm ups. Banagher tried to answer but he was cut off by his own loud belch. He blushed and slapped a hand over his mouth. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" The older sister chuckled. The two out-of-shape pilots started jogging, their soft chests, ample bellies, chunky legs, and rotund butts bobbing and bouncing the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was sunny that afternoon, much to the dismay of the two as they pitifully attempted to keep a brisk pace. It was more of a cycling rotation between out of breath shuffling and a few more minutes of jogging. The warm sun didn't make the feat any better, either. Banagher didn't want to say anything, but he was starting to regret jogging. Little did he know that Marida was kicking herself mentally more than her belly flab did to her upper thighs physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* Keep it up, Banagher! We can do it!\" Marida cheered in between pants. Banagher groaned, but continued onward to keep Marida placated. It was becoming more and more obvious to him that people were staring, and that made him somewhat fidgety. Marida had taken notice too, but tried her best to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that having every passer by stare at them was just the motivation that they needed to keep moving. The mock siblings tried their hardest to ignore the fact that their fat was shaking about as they barreled along the sidewalk, and the fact that they were dangerously close to a wardrobe malfunction from the fat jiggling, but somehow they made it work just long enough to reach their destination.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida leaned against the wall of the bistro and let out a long, dramatically loud sigh, and said, \"Oooh! Banagher, we did great there. -Huff-! But let's not over exert ourselves, we need to rest after such strenuous activity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave a weary smile, and said, \"Yeah, and luckily we're right at a place where at least you can take a breather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida smiled as Banagher stuck his tongue out teasingly. It apparently was not much of a big secret that the two didn't care much for jogging. Marida sighed; her observant little brother had predicted exactly what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stumbled through the door of the Bistro, still exhausted and panting. To someone who had none of the context, like Vincent, it was quite a surprising and concerning sight. \"Are you two okay?\" He said as he wobbled over at a brisk pace. \"What the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, we're fine.\" Marida explained as she pulled up a chair to sit down in, which groaned under her massive weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did the same. \"We -huff- We just did some jogging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVincent felt a little stupid for assuming something serious had happened when the explanation was such a normal thing, though few would blame him for assuming the two were trying to escape more then just their own obesity.\" Oh. Well, I guess exhaustion is a sign of progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And pain.\" Banagher groaned, his belly being completely left out in the open meant that Marida and Vincent could see all the sweat on it. He was glad his curse of cute girls seeing his stomach wasn't striking right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you two some water. It's free, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning jog had left Banagher in a fairly awkward state for the day. His legs were wobbly, and he had a hard time getting going on the daily tasks and grind. It would have gotten him a stern talking to from Vincent - if more than five customers actually had shown up that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the late afternoon Banagher was thoroughly recovered from what could have been mistaken for being hit by a truck from the way he moved in the early hours. The slow shifts allowed him ample time to rest, almost as ample as his own backside. As his shift ended and he metaphorically turned in his apron for the day, he wished he had an apron to physically turn in that way he would have something to cover his gut, Banagher lamented to himself how sad it was that someone like Vincent had to pay him money to essentially sit for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbling out to meet with Audrey, Banagher wished she came to meet with him tomorrow. He knew he should just be happy to see her again, and he was, but it would've been so great if he could surprise her with a present. he only needed to wait another day to have enough money to buy it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked into the ice cream parlor, his gut entering before the rest of him, the brunette scanned the entire place for the sight of his favorite chubby, dorky blonde. Sure enough, he saw her in both at the end of the room. As expected, she was enjoying a big bowl of ice cream, as told, Haro was sitting right next to her. What surprised Banagher was that Audrey was wearing a familiar pair of sunglasses that really didn't suit her, and not just because they emphasized how chubby her cheeks were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiggling on over to her, wearing a big grin, the Gundam pilot was so happy to see her again that he was on the verge of giving her a big ol' belly bump. \"Hey, Audrey, I'm here!\" He said as he sat down at the booth. It was a bit snug for him and even though he knew he had the bigger gut of the two, he couldn't imagine it wasn't at least a little bit of a tight squeeze for the princess too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are.\" Audrey uncharacteristically said, not looking up from her ice cream bowl as she kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Banagher! hi Banagher! It's been so long!\" Haro excitedly said as he bounced up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to see you again too, Haro. We're going to have to spend a lot of time together today.\" Banagher showed him a kind smile. \"So how have things been for you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends, who wants to know?\" Banagher was glad to hear Audrey's voice again but he wasn't expecting such a cryptic answer from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simile was replaced with a confused look. \"Um, it's me, Audrey.\" He pointed at his pie-like face. \"I haven't got that much fatter since we last saw each other, have I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, in war, you never forget a face.\" Despite the topic, Audrey was still only looking at ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a fat face like mine stands out in the military, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a smile creep up on Audrey's face, it looked like she was trying to hold back a giggle, but she forced both that and the smile back down. \"So you're here to talk business, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's what you could call it, but after that I was hoping we could hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey made this bizarre and obviously forced grunt that Banagher thought was supposed to sound inquisitive. \"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don''t know, I was hopping we could come up with something together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking into a battlefield without a plan? You must have a death wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting really weird, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey yanked her sunglasses off. \"Forget this! I can't do it right!\" She exclaimed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" But Banagher was glad to see Audrey back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm your informant, that means I'm supposed to be cool and mysterious, but it didn't work. What did I do wrong? This is way harder then it looks.\" She pouted and resumed eating her cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled, his smile returning. \"Well, there's not really anything cool and mysterious about a chubby girl eating ice cream, even if her shades are cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida is fat and eats ice cream, and she's still cool and mysterious.\" Audrey grumbled.</span></div></div>",

It'll tell you exactly when the operation will commence, follow all the instructions on it to the letter.\" She handed Banagher the map, who put it in his own pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you put it like that, it sounds so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie to you, this operation will take lives. I know it's cruel of me to ask this, but you need to prepared to end lives again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher tensed up at hearing that, something that Audrey and Haro could clearly see even before he said anything. \"... I understand.\" Those were the solemn words he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sentence was all that was needed to replace his blonde friend's serious expression with a frown. \"I'm sorry, Banagher. I shouldn't have brought that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's-It's alright, let's just focus on enjoying today, okay? We've both been through a lot, we need a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a lot of things to thank you for, but this time, it's for being the first person to tell me to take a break from being Mineva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Banagher perk up a little. \"I'm glad I can help. So what do you do first today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy some ice cream with you, of course.\" With a smirk, Audrey got out of the booth, which was a bit of squeeze as Banagher figured it would be, and soon came back with a big bowl of ice cream for her brown-haired friend. \"Eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Banagher heartily dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to take a moment to stare at Banagher, he was just so adorable, round, and jiggly. Seeing that big goofy smile on his face made her heart warm. Seeing him shovel ice cream into his round face, licking any bits of it that got onto his chubby cheeks, was so adorable. If he wasn't busy eating, she would pinch those puffy cheeks. Her chunky friend was just as adorable and sweet as she remembered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yes.\" She hastily squeezed herself back into her side of the booth with Haro and resumed eating. \"Did I at least look cool from a distance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Banagher said, but his smile told Audrey her answer without him needing to elaborate any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Audrey pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey's not cool! Audrey's not cool!\" This friendly teasing from Haro earned him a playful knock on the head from Audrey. Banagher chuckled; he didn't blame Audrey for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily chowing down together, they spent some time catching up with each other. Banagher wasn't too surprised to find out that Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro had gotten as fat as them, he felt a little jealous when his friend told him that Takuya could still keep his pants and belt closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey finished most of her first bowl, she suddenly dropped her spoon, a display of poor table manners complete unlike her, and she grunted in pain. \"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis sight made Banagher drop his own spoon in shock, even Haro looked concerned despite being incapable of changing his face. \"What's wrong, Audrey?\" Banagher asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mouth... it's so cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was being completely serious, but that just made Banagher's smile return. \"Looks like you've got your first brain freeze.\" He said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?!\" She was confused. It felt like she was suffering from a serious medical condition, but Banagher calmed down once she described it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you ate your ice cream too fast. Your mouth is just a little too cold, that's all. Don't worry, it'll go away in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it did. \"Oh... this is embarrassing.\" That embarrassment almost completely vanished when Banagher let out a friendly chuckle at how endearingly unused his blonde friend was to normal stuff. Audrey chuckled too, it was so good for things to be back to normal, even if it was only for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished eating three bowls, the two leaned back in their seats with pleased looks on their faces as they each let out a massive belch, their hands on their stomachs. \"Pardon us.\" Audrey said with a giggle. \"Do you want to keep eating ice cream or should we try some other place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try somewhere else, I've had my fill of ice cream for today.\" Banagher pat his tummy. \"You're more familiar with Palau, so where should we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd rather you pick. Even though I've lived here for a long time, I never ate outside of my home. I don't know anything about normal food stores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I saw a burger place that looks pretty good, you want to give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful. I've never eaten at a fast food place before. I heard the food there is disgusting and leads to an early death,\" She said, tone deaf to how morbid her description was. \"But whenever I see people eating it, they look pretty happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Banagher holding Haro, he and Audrey waddled out of the parlor, only for the blonde to bring things to an unexpected halt. \"Can you please wait a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey seemed a little nervous. \"Um, can I touch your big belly?\" There was a slight blush to her chubby cheeks, a blush Banagher's own cheeks then matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure, but why? Usually we do this after we're done eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's just been so long since I've felt you and your stomach.\" She anxiously placed her hands on her chubby friend's stomach, the longed after sensation giving her goosebumps. His stomach was so soft, like a giant pillow, and just as inviting to rest her head on. She began moving her hands around the puffy orb, making Banagher sigh in pleasure. Coyly smiling in a cute but pervy way, Audrey's soft hands felt up every bit of her friend's gut. \"Ah! It's a lot softer than I expected!\" Audrey said, her eyes bright with a childlike wonder. She grabbed handfuls of his creamy belly fat, poked the soft expanse and marvel at how deep her finger sank in and how the fat would jiggle back into place without a mark, pat the giant orb in a friendly manner, grab the sides of it and jiggle it, slapped it lightly, and poke him in his incredibly deep bellybutton. It all felt as amazing to Banagher as it did Audrey, he had missed this feeling. The brunette was really happy to see Audrey enjoying herself so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm done. Thanks for letting me do that.\" Audrey said as she released the jiggly orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" The brunette then started walking. \"Now lets get some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette stopped walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you rub my belly?\" She asked. \"I know you want to~\" Audrey said playfully as she gave him a joking wink, followed by a laugh at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you're right about that,\" Banagher said, his face flushed. He hesitantly placed his hand on her protruding stomach; his own filled with butterflies from the surrealness of getting to touch someone he hadn't seen in so long. He started moving his hands over her stomach and fondling it, he thought on how her stomach felt different then Marida's, and it wasn't because Marida's was bigger. Sure, they were both big, fat bellies belonging to two kind girls who love to eat, but they didn't give off the same feeling. Marida's was... tougher, as odd as it felt for Banagher to use that adjective to describe a fat gut. It was still very soft and squishy, but still strong, even if Marida herself couldn't see that. Audrey's tummy was different, it was pure marshmallow fluff. But neither belly was better then the other's, they were equally good in different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher engaged in much of the same belly play Audrey did with his stomach. Just like he did, the blonde would occasionally sigh in pleasure. Kneading this princess' chub was like kneading cookie dough to her knight. Seeing Audrey jiggle reminded Banagher of good memories, really good memories. At one point, the princess' belly gurgled, and a huge belch came flying out of her mouth. They both giggled and the blonde excused herself. Banagher stuck his finger into Audrey's deep navel and shook it around in there, they both watched as the Zabi's stomach jiggled and wobbled from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two punctuated this session of belly rubs by bumping their massive tummies together, sporting big, goofy grins on their cherubic faces. Their stomachs took a few seconds to stop jiggling, that amused both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get some burgers in your belly?\" Banagher asked as he pat his friend's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Haro in hand, the fat princess and her chunky knight jiggled on over to every food place they could find, stuffing themselves full of all the delicious food they found. Being as rich as she was, Audrey's wallet meant they could eat all they wanted. Hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, corn dogs, pretzels, kebabs, ice cream, cookies, and cakes among others filled their stomachs up. They'd enter every place with big bellies and come out with even bigger bellies. They were happily chatting about stuff like their friends, food, TV, and video games as they glutted themselves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After wobbling out of yet another fast food place, their bellies bigger then they were when they wobbled in, the blonde noticed that Banagher still had his opened belt on, and now that she thought about it, it had been like that the even before they started pigging out. \"Why do you keep your belt on if it doesn't fit?\" She asked after burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He was a little surprised to see another friend ask that same exact question. \"It's in case I ever figure out a way to make it fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides losing weight?\" Audrey said in a bemused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, I AM trying to lose weight, it's just gonna take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with your belt.\" With a helpful smile, Audrey pushed Banagher's gut in, eliciting an \"Oof!\" from the poor guy, and started the great struggle to zip and button his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, I -URP- don't think this going to work.\" Banagher said in obvious discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's *grh* not that t-tight.\" Audrey lied through her teeth. She knew Banagher was fat, but trying to actually close his pants made her realize she had almost forgotten how fat his belly truly was, realize that she had let her own weight gain overshadow Banagher's. \"There we go.\" She said as she finally got his pants zipped and buttoned, though they both knew it was serving as a dam against the ocean of Banagher's blubber. \"Now for the belt.\" She said with a hint of dread she tried to hide. The belt was just as hard to close, Audrey compared it to trying to force two magnets together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Aud -URRRP- rey, you don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *grh* insist, it's my fault you're fat in the first -UUURRRP- place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally managed to clip it together. \"Done, whew!\" She removed her hand and let her friend's well-fed stomach bulge back into place. \"That's much better isn't-\" Audrey's hard work was immediately undone as her big friend's middle snapped his belt and popped off the button on his pants, the button and belt buckle was sent flying right into Audrey's stomach, making the soft expanse jiggle violently. Waves of creamy flab came flopping out, forcing his zipper all the way back down, which would've left his white underwear exposed if his stomach wasn't so heavy it hanged down enough to cover his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wardrobe malfunction made both their faces take on the coloration of a tomato, but for different reasons. They were silent at first, not even Haro was able to do anything but stare at his friend's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Audrey started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That happened.\" Banagher finished, resting his hands on the top of his belly. Their difficulty to find what words to say was empathized by the chirping of a nearby bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped into his fist. \"Um, you wanna get some more pizza?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that, uh, sounds nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forget, did we have pepperoni pizza yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby princess gained a look of curiosity on her face about this mythical pizza. \"No, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of food they were packing away left many people, including the employees and other customers at where they ate, amazed. Audrey and Banagher were eating machines, eating and eating with no sign of stopping. As their bellies grew bigger with every stop, so did the amount of stares they got when they wobbled into a new stop, belching crazily while sporting gigantic bellies. It made them feel a bit embarrassed but they were having far too much fun to care that much about it. One cashier asked them why they came here, since they were obviously both very full. With a grin, Banagher gave his stomach a few proud pats, belched loudly, and told him that they were having a night on the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went and they got fuller, their belches got louder and more frequent. A fat guy like Banagher burping wasn't an unusual sight, but what certainly was was the princess of Zeon not only belching, not only with seemingly no embarrassment, but with skill matching her friend. The two even had a few small belching contests here and there, Haro kept track of who many each one, which was three each. Audrey at one point accidentally burped right into Banagher's face. Not too long ago Audrey would've been horrified beyond words, now she just laughed it off with Banagher, even though it was embarrassing enough to make them both blush. Whenever one well-fed teen complimented the other's belching talent, it made the other's heart fill with joy. Sometimes Banagher let out a laugh so bellyful or a burp so loud it made his cherubic cheeks fold and bounce, which, the princess thought was the cutest thing, she couldn't resist pinching those chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiggling around the block, Audrey and Banagher were holding bags of chips, pretzels, and popcorn, along with an extra large cup of soda, as snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP! Excuse me!\" Audrey joked with a smile before she happily ate another handful of popcorn. \"All this amazing food -UUURAAAP- was so close to me all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher finished sipping on his soda. \"UUURRAAAAP! It must feel liberating -UUUURRRRP- to get to taste it all of the -UURRRRRP- first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, it's fantastic.\" Audrey shoveled a few more handfuls of pretzels into her greedy mouth. \"How do normal -UUUUUURP- people like you not get fat sooner? URRRRRRRP!\" She ate another handful of chips and downed it with soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I'm -URAAAAAP- the kind of person you should be asking -URRRP- that.\" With a blush and a goofy smile that screamed \"Please still think I'm cool, Audrey!\" the obese young man gave his gigantic belly a jiggle to drive his point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Audrey teased with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher's a fatty! Banagher's a fatty!\" Haro teased, causing Banagher to playfully give a very light kick. He could barely even see Haro past his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask Mihir-\" A loud popping sound interrupted their chat and brought all three pairs of eyes looking at the source, which was the middle button on Audrey's coat being popped off. Audrey gasped in shocked, which her tummy bulge ever so slightly, but it was enough to pop off the lower button too, with the button on her tight pants immediately following. Her massive tummy was now free to bulge forward, and bulge forward it did, the zipper powerless to stop her pale belly fat from forcing it all the way down, exposing her pink underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushes adorning two faces, three if Haro was capable of blushing, the fat friends were so embarrassed they couldn't bring themselves to eat. \"Oh God...\" Audrey said, she couldn't actually see past her stomach, but she logically knew that the zipper going down meant her underwear could be seen by anyone. Her, Banagher, and Haro looked around, luckily there wasn't anyone there right now but there was no way no one would see her before the night was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sighed, resigning himself to what was about to happen. Desperate times called for desperate measures. Praying no cute girls would walk around the corner, the Gundam pilot lifted his heavy stomach up with all his strength, which normally wasn't much since he was so out of shape but Audrey gave him all the strength in the world, exposing to the world his white underwear. Audrey would've blushed even harder at the sight if she could, her blush was no longer solely out of embarrassment. \"So, um, -UURRRRRP-, here you -URP- go. It's my underwear.\" Banagher was hoping he could say something less lame but that was all he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce what Banagher was doing sank in, Andrey showed him a relived smile and laughed. \"Banagher, you're an amazing friend. UUUURRRRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Audrey and Banagher were finally finished eating that night. Wobbling out of a hot dog buffet, the fat lady and unicorn unleashed a massive belch in unison with pleased looks on their faces, hands on their full bellies, feeling how full, hard yet soft, and massive they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed!\" Banagher said as he pat his bloated gut, even with the sphere of adipose being as packed full as it was it still jiggled from the pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Audrey said as she rubbed her full belly, thinking on how it was like a giant, pale Haro. \"That was amazing, Banagher! UUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies were massive, nearly the size of beanbag chairs. They were even nearly as large as Marida's stomach when she wasn't bloated, which was really saying something. Even they were surprised by how big their stomachs had become, Haro was downright amazed by them. He'd be looking at them even if they weren't blocking his view of his friends' faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRP! You've got that right!\" He started rubbing his own fat belly. \"I've gotta say, you can really pack it away! UUURRRRP! Maybe you -UUURRRP- and I should e -URRP- nter an eating contest at some point!\" Banagher said, giving a big smile that his puffy cheeks made even more adorable and heartwarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey answered by grinning and giving him a (very light) punch on the shoulder. \"Yeah, -URRRAAAP- and ruin even more -UUUUURRP- of my clothes? What a fantastic offer, I\u2019ll have to get back to you -URAP- on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was punctuated with even more laughter from the bloated teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can eat more then you two!\" Haro said as he bounced up and down, looking forward to later bounce on their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Haro but we'll need to start keeping our appetites in check or else they'll be rolling us around.\" Audrey jiggled her belly for emphasis, which she found fun and Banagher found cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that we've eaten Palau dry, what do you want to do?\" The brunette said as his stomach gurgled audibly enough for both of them to hear.</span></div></div>",

If that's okay with you, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled over to the park, Banagher holding Haro. The teens were so bloated that they were waddling like they were peg-legged pirates. They couldn't explain why, but there was something they found interesting about the way the other's stomach bobbed and bounced during the walk. When Audrey wasn't watching Banagher's stomach bounce, she was looking at her own jiggly stomach, something thebrunette noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped before he said something. \"Still not used to being so jiggly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H -URP- Huh? Oh, yes. It still feels strange.\" To Audrey, her full stomach jiggling felt like her stomach was a full bag of marshmallows that was being carried down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly used to either yet.\" Banagher gave his gut a pat. To him, his stomach jiggling felt like it was a basketball being dribbled. \"Marida said we'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that won't take long. All the food we ate isn't helping this feel less strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher concurred with her by letting out a deep burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they waddled their bloated forms over a bench in the park, the pair groaned in relief as they planted their huge asses down on it, the pilot relived there wasn't any groaning from the bench like when he and Marida sat down at the church. He tried to take it as a sign he wasn't that fat yet but it was hard. The two almost immediately reached started rubbing each other's stomachs as they resumed chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon into the belly rubbing, Audrey felt a gurgle from her stomach along with a sharp pain in her chest. She had been belching a lot tonight, and quite loudly too, but she hadn't felt so much gas at once. She looked over at Banagher who looked back at her, she could tell he was experiencing the same thing. A week ago, they would've been mortified at the massive burp they were about to unleash, after all, one was a princess who was raised to be as polite and elegant as possible and belching loudly was neither of those things, and the other was a goofy guy trying to find a place he belonged to who just burped loudly in front of a kind, cute girl who understood him and gave him that place he was seeking. But now, after all the time they spent with each other, they grinned at each and at the same time happily belted out a belch so massive it made their big, fat bellies jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey immediately started laughing, their faces blushing bright red. Of course, they were still embarrassed but they were having way too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha ha, I'm getting pretty good at this, huh?\" Audrey asked, covering her mouth in a mock gesture of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher concurred, chuckling. \"Although you have a long way to go if you wanna match up to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, no way! I'm definitely way past you in skill!\" Audrey said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not likely, but okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, their friendship was blossoming in a way neither would've thought possible a few days ago. Just a few days ago both the blonde and brunette had never even dreamed of ever being in this situation, yet they had found themselves belching and eating galore, and having a blast doing it. Both teens wanted this moment to last forever, just to lounge around, have fun, and not have a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that princess Mineva?\" A young man asked his friend he was strolling through the park with as they saw Banagher and Audrey burping and giving each other belly rubs, and looking very happy while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be. Wow, she really got fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her boyfriend's pretty fat too, wonder if he was always fat or of they got fat together. Wonder who he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever he is, he's damn lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slim duo was unaware that the obese duo, plus Haro, could hear them perfectly fine. \"Boyfriend?\" The blonde half of the chubby duo repeated in confusion, her chubby cheeks were sporting a blush. \"You're not my boyfriend, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Banagher's face matched Audrey's blush. \"I-I dunno. I mean, I never called you my girlfriend, but those guys -URAAAP- thought we were acting like a couple.\" He said as he nervously drummed his fingers on his friend's tummy, which she thought felt oddly nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've been -URRRRRP- doing this a lot...\" A very brief silence followed, Banagher really wished he could let out a huge burp to change the subject, but his stomach picked the worst time to not give him a lot of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, so what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I've never had a boyfriend before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love! Love!\" Haro chimed in as he bounced on Banagher's belly and then Audrey's, the first bounce on each belly made them burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a break from giving belly rubs, Banagher, Audrey, and Haro looked up at the stars, the gurgling and bubbling of their stomachs was the only audio. No matter where you were, the stars always seemed the same, always giving the same feeling of serenity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher.\" Audrey said, stifling a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you like to look at the stars as you think about your place in the world. After everything you've been through, have your thoughts on that changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed his arms over his flabby chest and gut, closing his eyes. A few seconds of contemplation later, he sighed and then opened his eyes. \"Everything just feels so confusing. When I lived in Industrial 7, I was scared of how restricted life seemed. It was like what we going to do was decided for us before we were even born. That we were destined to just follow a path someone else laid out for us. Like a factory.\" Those words surprised Audrey, not just because of how cynical they sounded, but because of how similar they sounded to how she feels about her life. \"But now everything is too free, it's all so chaotic and irrational. I can't tell who my allies and enemies are. All I know is that I can trust you, Haro, Takuya, and Micott, but that's it. Out of all the people I'll have to decide which should live and which should die, that's a small number. I'm not suited to pick up a weapon, but I have to anyways.\" Haro snuggled up closer to the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Audrey looked down, she had to force herself to look at him in the eyes. \"But knowing that we're on your side helps, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does but... I just don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it like this,\" She could now more comfortably look him in the eyes. \"Admitting that you don't know is wiser then most people think. It's a wisdom a lot of people in the Federation and Zeon don't possess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Banagher looked back at the stars. It was like staring into a crowd of people, each face you see represents a life as unique and detailed as your own, but from a distance, they all seem blank. \"So how do you feel about your place in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... All I know is that I'm the only one who can end this war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it when you get like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only surviving member of the Zabi family, the only one both willing and able to bring peace between the Federation and Zeon. This is my responsibility and only mine.\" Audrey said and then let a small burp pass her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop it. I already told you this mindset you have is selfish, it's arrogant too. You can't do everything by yourself, let people help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want as little people involved as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but you won't get anywhere on you're own. URRAP! You get like this and rush off into danger without thinking things through. You've nearly died twice from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA contemplative expression washed over Audrey's face. \"... Three times, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the fighting broke out in Industrial 7, the remains of a mobile suit nearly crashed into me and the others, Riddhe saved us. If you count that since my recklessness is the whole reason I was in Industrial 7 in the first place, then I've nearly gotten myself killed three times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to, just please let us help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It's hard.\" The pilot of the Unicorn Gundam was surprised to see Audrey let vulnerability show in her voice, he could only think of one other time she did. \"I don't want you or anyone else to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we don't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked lost for a moment but quickly gave her pal a weary smile, almost looking defeated yet relived at the same time. \"I really needed someone to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned to stargazing for a while, the mood of their conversations returning to normal. The first thing they talked about was movies, Banagher quickly discovering that Audrey's experience in films was rather... limited. Her favorite was some film Banagher has never heard of before, staring an actress she had never heard of called Audrey Hepburn. The princess couldn't resist teasing her friend about how she 100% right that Banagher wouldn't recognize the obvious reference. Banagher pouted and said he's not into that sorta stuff. For her part, Audrey had at best only vaguely heard of some of the films Banagher said he liked, the brunette quickly telling her that he'd have to show them to her, something she was looking forward to.</span></div></div>",

Have you thought anymore about that?\" The pudgy pilot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver a princess, Audrey belched loudly as she gave her swollen gut a pat, nodding affirmatively. \"I have, once this is all over, you'll be returning to school with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great but like I said, my classes are in mechanics. Do you know anything about that?\" He asked, already knowing that was practically a rhetorical question with someone like his strawberry blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But that's what school is for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher scratched the back of his head. \"Well, yeah but the school year has already been going on for months already, it's not going to be beginner stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still can't be that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to need a tutor, luckily you've got me. Let's start with something simple.\" Banagher held Haro up to Audrey's face, startling her a little. \"Let's say we wanted to modify Haro to make his eyes light up, what's the first thing we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" She wasn't sweating but she sure felt like she was. \"Um... buy two light bulbs?\" She trailed off as if she was asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend blinked at her answer and placed Haro back on the bench without saying a word. \"This is going to be harder then I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, my answer wasn't that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher at one point casually drummed his belly, the flabby mass jostling from his little \"performance\". He didn't think much of it but he could tell from Audrey's face that she thought very much of it. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do that again?\" Child-like wonder was clear as day on Audrey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This?\" Banagher drummed his belly again, each hit making the fat jiggle like waves of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that.\" She answered, her eyes locked onto her pal's gut. \"What's that called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Banagher was wracking his brain to try to figure out what was so special about drumming his belly. \"It's called belly drumming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please keep drumming your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\" Banagher drummed his belly as Audrey watched, a small smile on her face that washed away any embarrassment Banagher had about doing this goofy activity. \"I'm glad you're enjoying this -URP- but I don't really know what you like about this so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know either but please keep doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will.\" A few times the drumming stirred up the gas in his tummy, making it expel itself loudly from Banagher's mouth, which made Audrey giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Banagher was done, his blonde friend had an unusual request for him. \"Can you please teach me how to do that?\" She said with an amount of enthusiasm that befuddled Banagher, something the question itself also did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's something you need to be taught.\" Banagher scratched the back of his head. \"You just slap your belly and that's it.\" He was giving Audrey a small smile that said \"Your naivety is endearing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i see.\" Audrey looked down at her round stomach in thought, it let out a low grumble as it struggled to digest her feast. She then gave it a single slap, this accomplished making her dome of a middle wobbling but it didn't get the drumming effect she was looking for. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta do it with both hands.\" He saw Audrey raise her hands to do a simultaneous slap on her stomach and realized he needed to be more specific. \"A-And you gotta alternate hands. And it's not really a slap, it's more a mix between a slap and a pat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, it sounds rather complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Banagher's instructions in mind, Audrey successfully drummed her belly. She giggled at the sight of her jiggly tummy in motion. \"You're right, it isn't once you get the hang of it.\" As Audrey continued to slowly drum her belly with a look of child-like wonder on her soft face, Banagher couldn't stop himself from smiling too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I should be doing with the Unicorn and Laplace's box.\" He thought, the drumming making Audrey belch more then once. \"But I do know this: My mission is to keep Audrey smiling.\" Looking at those wonderful emerald-green eyes, the first thing he ever noticed about her face, they were like a shinning light to him that illuminated his path. He saw another stranger walk past them, that stranger looked at the princess in confusion. The brunette could tell his goofy friend noticed but she played it no mind, she was having too much fun playing with her stomach. Thinking on the huge contrast between Audrey and Mineva, Banagher chuckled, a type of happy chuckle. What he'd give to see the past and the present meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Audrey had her fill of fun, she stopped drumming her stomach and returned to massaging her friend's tum, who returned the favor. \"Thanks for teaching -UUUUURP- me -UUURAP- that. Do you want to do anything -UUUUURP- else before we call it a night or should we just stay here and chat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea, UUUUURRRP! How about we see a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great. What's a good -UUUURAAAP- normal movie for me to start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" That question was one of those questions where the answer should be simple but it still takes you a bit to think of it. \"I guess Star -UUUUURRP- Wars would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need to buy a ticket for Haro too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure popcorn isn't too filling?\" Audrey asked her brown-haired best friend, she was looking into the cup of the delectable snack contemplatively. \"We did eat a lot before this, our stomachs are still just as swollen as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Besides, the movie-going experience isn't complete without popcorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach carrying a big popcorn cup and a soda, Audrey and Banagher took their seats in the theater. Luckily there was an empty seat on Banagher's side, so he placed Haro in it, who they did not have to buy a ticket for, not that doing so would've put even a single scratch into the Zabi's infinite wealth. She could've bought tickets for every seat in the whole theater, everything the snack bar had to offer, and then the theater itself and it still wouldn't have even begun to slightly dent her finances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey started snacking on her popcorn, as did Banagher. The young women of the trio wasn't entirely sure if Banagher was correct them being bale to eat all this popcorn without getting a really bad stomachache, in a worst case scenario, throwing up, but thus far it seemed fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew the T -UUUURP- V would be huge but seeing it in person is another thing. I bet that's how other people feel about our big bellies, hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm?\" Banagher's mouth was full of popcorn. \"Oh! That's not a TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a screen, movie theaters use projectors to show the -UUUURP- film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -UUUURP- see...\" Audrey's voice made it obvious she felt like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up over it, it's what anyone in your position would think. Besides, you're kinda like a medieval princess, it's really charming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face and voice showed that she was cheered up. \"And that makes you my knight -UUUUUURP- in shining -UUUUURRRP- armor. Though I don't think your armor will fit anymore.\" She gave a teasing poke into her knight's flabby side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gut's the only armor I need.\" Banagher played along with a hearty slap to his dome of a middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw the projector light up, Audrey felt a sense of amazement. Like she had said about the size itself, seeing it in person was completely different from hearing about it. Unfortunately, that amazement was about to swept aside for a short but unbearable moment. \"Ahh!\"  Audrey jolted as soon as the iconic opening crawl started, she placed her hands over her ears in a clear panic, Her sudden movement sent her popcorn cup flying but Banagher managed to catch it before much popcorn could fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Audrey?\" A concerned Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Haro asked, somehow looking as concerned as Banagher despite his face never changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Its-It's so loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sighed in relief that it wasn't anything serious. \"Yeah, it is pretty loud to someone who's never been o the theater before, I forgot. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's over. You can watch the movie now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese princess slowly brought her hands away from her ears, seeming surprised that the unbearable sound was over. \"Okay... Okay. Whew... Whew... That was... UUURP! That was Hell.\"</span></div></div>",

They were holding their huge bellies as they rubbed them, Banagher having to do it with his only free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fan -URRRRRRAP- tastic. I can see how it led to one of the biggest film franchises of all time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd say something like that, you were really into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it it really that obvious when I'm enjoying something?\" Her voice contained not a hint that she was aware of how rhetorical her question practically was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Banagher had an amused grin as he flashed back to all the big smiles and looks of wonder he had seen his best friend make. Whether it was good food, good TV, good movies, good friends, or good bellies and fat, Audrey was always incapable of hiding her joy. \"Yes, you always get this huge smile when you're really enjoying something.\" The two were now out of the movie theater and just aimlessly walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\" A small blush was on Audrey's round face. \"I-I had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really charming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Audrey cleared her throat as a way to announce that she would like to change topics. \"Back to the topic of the movie, it was really interesting how many parts of it's story and world paralleled real life. You said that film was made before the Newtype theory, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's decades old.\" Now that Audrey mentioned it, Banagher could see the similarities their world and Star Wars held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had heard a story that three Newtypes, I believe they were called the \"Miracle Children\", saw a vision of the colony drop on Sydney before it happened and were able to convince their town to evacuate. I wonder if, uh, who made Star Wars again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if George Lucas was a Newtype himself, saw a vision of the future, and based his films off that.\" She said completely seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh, a rare sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent some more time chatting about whatever they felt like before the overweight Zabi raised the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In hindsight I should've expected the job to be as boring as it is.\" Banagher said. \"I think it's only -UUUUURP- gotten five customers in two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold that thought.\" Audrey burped before she continued. \"Are we just aimlessly walking around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. We are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Maybe now would be a good time to... call it a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey stopped in her tracks, Banagher followed suit. \"I mean that I think this is where we should part ways for now. Until the rescue, of course.\" Her stomach gurgled very loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right... Yeah it is getting pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the perfect -UUUUURP- time to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got some pretty b -UUUUURRAP- ig meals to sleep off after all.\" Banagher showed her a very clearly forced smile, which Audrey felt was the best forced smile she ever saw, not that that's saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We certainly did.\" Showing an equally forced smile, Audrey patted her tummy as she looked down at it. Letting out another impressive burp, she ran a hand through her strawberry-blonde as she showed Banagher the most comforting smile she could give. \"UUUUURRRP! Whew, I don't know about you but I think our rampage through all the town's eateries is one for the record books!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher slapped his tummy, sending a jiggly wave throughout it. \"You've got that right! URRRAAAAP! These are two of the biggest stuffed bellies I've ever seen. Guess we'll need someone to roll us around tomorrow, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess giggled. \"Looks like it. Good thing you've got Marida to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed, though it was awkwardly followed up by a painful silence. Both bloated teens looked at each other, waiting for the other to walk away first. Haro alternated who he was looking at it. All they heard was the intense gurgling and bubbling of their overfed stomachs. They couldn't even put up fake smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't do it.\" With that, she charged into Banagher and gave him the biggest hug she could give, their bellies slamming into each other, making a caught off guard Banagher go \"Oof!\", nearly dropping Haro. \"I know it's only two days, but-but after everything I've -UUUUUUURP- gone through since you left and how hard I've been -UUUUUURP- trying to see you again -UUUUUURRP-! I-I just can't, I can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Audrey.\" Banagher wrapped his arms around her, feeling how soft and huggable she was. \"We'll stay together, we'll leave Palau together in the Unicorn, okay? Let it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think I just did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, they were simply frozen there, neither making a sound. Other then occasional belch of course, all the drama in the world can't stop the workings of a stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a huge teddy bear, Banagher. I want to sleep on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I, uh, want to sleep on you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise that you will. And that you'll let me sleep on you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher ungracefully waddled into his and Marida's home, he wasn't surprised to see his big sister here but he was surprised to see that Gilboa was here. Banagher just hoped Gilboa would leave before the Neo-Zeon member started yelling at him over last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is.\" Marida said. \"I see you're looking... quite well-fed.\" She stood up, like anyone who saw Banagher in his current state would assume, she knew that Banagher was about to flop down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... UUUUUUURP! One way to put it.\" Just as predicated by both Marida and Gilboa, he flopped onto the bed as ungracefully as when he wobbled into the house. Marida sat down on his thick legs, which wuld've been incredibly painful had Banagher not put on over fifty pounds. She placed a meaty hand on his stomach and began rubbing, Banagher let out a cute moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure had fun. I usually only see guys that happy after a really good date.\" Gilboa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher panicked a little, did Gilboa see him with Audrey? If he did, then did that mean he knew what hotel Audrey was staying at? \"But if he did then he would've followed her to it, right? Then there's no way he would be here.\" He thought. \"At least I hope that's the case.\" He tried to think of something to say but another belch left his mouth before any words did. He tired to clam himself down by thinking about how this was the first time he ever saw anyone sitting in the chair Gilboa was using. \"Is that -URP- the only time you ever see people like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did seem pretty happy when you were having dinner at my house last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sighed in relief, Marida and Gilboa assumed that was just from getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of, that's actually why I'm here.\" Looking up at the ceiling, Banagher did his best to brace himself from the scolding he was about to receive. The only solace he could take in this was that it wasn't Marida doing the scolding. \"I wanted to apologize for how things went last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher blinked twice, he couldn't deice what was more shocking, that or Marida telling him he got a letter from Audrey. \"You mean you're not mad at me?\" As he looked at Gilboa, he accidentally showed him his trademark puppy dog eyes that would keep all but the most vile of individuals from saying yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, it was Tikva that started that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't think you think I should've just -UURAP- stood down so things wouldn't escalate? I almost made him cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, absolutely not. You have to stand up for yourself, no matter what. And to be honest, I think we all needed to hear that little speech of yours. We... well, no one here really gets any reminders that Zeon isn't the bastion of morality we all wish it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was about to ask him why he hasn't left Zeon if he doens't like the way Zeon does things, but then the image of the cross in the old church flashed before him, like if someone suddenly put a photo in front of his eyes. \"You sure Tikva will take it to heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't admit it, but I think he already has.\" Gilboa then looked at Marida. \"You can say something, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best if this conversation stays between you two. Besides, I have an impressively overfed belly to rub.\" That last part made Banagher blush a bit as he sported a goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of these days you'll have to admit you're his big sister.\" Gilboa chuckled and then returned his focus to Banagher. \"Almost forgot. I heard you're working at Vincent's bistro now, it's about time he got an employee. You want to have a little talk over there? Since we had to cut dinner last night short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam pilot swallowed down a belch. \"Sure, I have lots of breaks there anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Marida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm free tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you two then. Good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Gilboa got up and left. As soon as the door closed behind the pilot of Zeon, Banagher released that belch he held down, unaware Gilboa could still hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you enjoyed yourself.\" Marida gave his belly a pat before resuming her rubbing activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did! UUUUURRRP! Me and-I mean I pretty much cleared Palau out. How -UUURRP- was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. After jogging I did some working out at the park. I beat my record number of sit ups before I got too exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's -UUUUUURP- great. UURRRRRRP! How many did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven, I'm making progress. I'm sure you could do that many too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know, we've been wo -UUURAAP- working out a lot together but I don't think we ever talked about how we got fat in the first place.\" Banagher pointed out, at the same time he was looking at his huge stomach, which took up the majority of his view, and the pleasing movement's Marida's hand was making on it. \"So what's the story behind your gut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her obese little brother, the redhead thought back to when she was his weight. Were this past version of Marida standing side by side with the current Banagher, one would see that Banagher had the bigger belly but Marida was fatter everywhere else except the face. She wondered, if he had come sooner into her life, and he was just as chubby as he was now, would they be skinnier by now or even fatter? On one hand, living with another fatso, especially one as friendly as Banagher, helped motivate them both to exercise more. On the other hand, Banagher is the kind of guy you just want to pig out with and then just relax together as you digested, chatted, burped, and gave each other belly rubs until you both fell into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recall exactly when my weight gain \"journey\" started, if you want to call it that and I have feeling you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped before he said something. \"You know me so well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I used to have a diet and exercise regime, and it just started slipping over time. I was working out less, I was eating more and what I ate was much less healthy. By the time I realized what was happening to me I was already pretty overweight and out-of-shape.\" She decided to leave out the bit about how she came to that conclusion because she broke a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big were -URP- you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around your weight. I tried to cut back on the eating but, as I'm sure you know, as you get bigger your stomach demands more and more food and it gets harder to resist it. And now that dedicated exercise was so hard, there was nothing stopping me from ballooning up. Honestly, I hadn't made any meaningful progress until you moved in. So you have my thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, though I don't feel like I've done much to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having someone like you to exercise with is more helpful then you think.\" She made her point with a few friendly pats to his stomach before she resumed rubbing it. \"So what's your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda a long story. it all started when I met Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't mention anything about gaining weight in your report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it -UUURRP- it's not important or anything. And I'm a bit too embarrassed to have it on some military record somewhere.\" He then cleared his throat. \"Anyways, after I saved Audrey we were both starving so did a quick pit stop for some hot dogs. Heh, you should've seen her. At first she was complaining about how impolite it was to eat while walking but as soon as she took a bite she had this huge smile on her face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever seen her smile like that.\" Sure, Marida had seen Audrey smile, but it was never like how Banagher described it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she doesn't really like -URP- it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of that but she has her obligations.\" She said before Banagher let out a giant burp, both because it helped his tummy feel better and in order to end that topic before it got heated. He felt that if Audrey wasn't currently free, or as free as anyone can be in their current situation, he probably  would've flown off the handle at Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, she really likes hot dogs so she orders a ton of them, which left her with pretty stuffed belly but I know she didn't regret it. I gotta say, I was pretty impressed with how she can really pack it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why her stomach was so large when I found you two. I was wondering why she was like that, it's not like her to pig out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher resisted the temptation to explain precisely she doens't Audrey act like that but he elected to instead answer with humor. \"Well, -UUUUURRP- that's probably how -URAP- she felt about you before you got fat, right? UUUUURRRRP!\" He flashed her a cheeky grin, the puffiness of his cheeks didn't deter from his charm at all. If anything, they increased it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida chuckled and pinched one of his cherubic cheeks. \"True.\" His cheek jiggled when she let go. \"I also noticed you also gave the princess some much needed belly rubs, you did an excellent job of escorting her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, -UUURRRAP- giving her belly rubs is what I do now, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do it very well. So how does the princess' appetite relate to your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's what got rid of her reserv -UUURRRAAP- ations about binging. She later got me a ton of food for me to apologize about getting me roped into all this. I didn't blame her but I ate it anyways, we shared it of course, and we were pretty stuffed -UUURRP- by the time we finished it all. After that, we grew to like pigging out so we just kept eating and eating together. And well, here we are.\" He grabbed the sides of his well-fed tummy and gave it a lazy shake, making it jiggle in a very cute manner. He let out another giant burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a unique reason to gain weight. I thought your laziness just caught up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a protest burp. \"UUUUUURP! Hey, I'm not lazy. I'm just... you know, normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Marida showed him a small smile, the small smile of a big sister amused by her goofy little brother. \"I take it the princess was rubbing your belly when you were bloated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How -UUUURRRAP- did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty obvious from the way you talk about your binges with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it is.\" A gurgle sounded from Banagher's big, busy belly. \"Hope she's okay with me telling you this, but yeah, we -UUURRRP- gave each other belly rubs all the time whenever were stuffed. Which was often, heh heh! Plenty of belly play too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida imagined her two little siblings, fat as can be, bigger then they were currently, and stuffed to the brim on all sorts of yummy food. They laying down in bed together, their giant tummies, which Marida would dare describe as adorable, were hanging out, completely free, just like Audrey and Banagher. Everything that got in the way their glorious bellies had been popped or busted, even Audrey's collar had been popped by her neck fat. They were rubbing and playing with each other's rounded stomachs, filling them with a very pleasurable warmth, sporting goofy but sweet smiles the whole time. They unleashed an amazing belch in unison, one so loud their entire bodies jiggled. As soon as it stopped after ten whole seconds, they burst out laughing, which sent them right back in a state of jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew being fat -UUUUURP- would be so much fun?\" Audrey was grabbing a handful of Banagher's belly fat, grabbing it as tight as she could to get all the fat she could between her fingers, and gave it a big shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, yeah... UUUUURP! That's the stuff.\" Banagher said almost in a dazed like state, which he snapped out of thanks to a slap to his belly from Audrey, which made him burp again. \"I-I mean. Yeah.\" He then poked his pal's incredibly deep navel, which made her burp as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're suck a dork -UURRRRRP-, Banagher.\" Audrey giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged, heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, Banagher continued speaking. \"You think my stomach would make a good pillow? Audrey wants to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down at Banagher, Marida pinpointed the exact spot on Banagher's tummy the princess of Zeon would rest her head on. \"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When this is all over, you should eat with me and Audrey. It'd be great! I have some other friends who could join us too. There's Takuya, who is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they from the Federation like you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was a little surprised, it made him realize how this wasn't the first time he had forgotten that Marida was a member of Neo-Zeon when he was enjoying her company. He raised his head. \"Don't think of them like that, I'm from the Federation and we're friends, right?\" His heart had gone from calm to pounding, he felt like hearing anything other then his desired answer would completely destroy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a special case, but I suppose you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Banagher rested his head and breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's good enough.\" He thought, his heartbeat returning to normal. He looked over at the TV in hopes of finding a new topic on it, but what saw on it was displeasing. \"The TV's been off this whole time? UUUUUURRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAAP! URRRRRRRRP! No. C'mon, you gotta turn it on, something really good might be on.\"</span></div></div>",

UUUUURRP! Surprised I haven't fallen into a food coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not but let me try.\" And try he did, but effort alone wasn't enough to meet success when he was weighed down by his overstuffed stomach. He made very little progress, a slight blush was on his chubby cheeks when he ended his first try. After some quick panting, he tried again and met an equal amount of failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at how much Banagher was struggling, Marida thought on how normally she would see such a display as pathetic and pitiful at best, disgraceful at worst. But when it was a sweet and goofy guy like Banagher doing it, it was purely charming. Here was the chosen pilot of the Unicorn Gundam, the one picked decide the fate of the Earth and all it's colonies, the soldier who forced the second coming of Char to actually try, the pilot who fended off Marida herself, the knight sworn to protect the princess. And he couldn't even get on his feet, his toughest enemy was his own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need some help.\" He knowingly pointed out the obvious, showing a sheepish grin that complimented his blushing, chubby cheeks perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida got up, which made Banagher wonder if he somehow ate so much he now weighed more then Marida. She extended her hand and Banagher grabbed it. Banagher grunted and puffed as he tried his hardest to stand up, and Marida grunted and puffed as she pulled with all her strength. It took ten seconds of build up and lots of effort but they did manage to get launch him off the couch, he landed a good foot away and jiggled as he tried to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hope that was -UUURRRAAP- some good exercise for you.\" He half-jokingly said and sheepishly rubbed the back of his head. He started waddling to their bedroom but he only made a single step before Marida decided to lend him a hand. It was a very small walk but Banagher was REALLY bloated and could some help making sure he didn't fall over. Marida wobbled over to him, her body jostling as much as Banagher's if not even more and threw his arm over her shoulder. Their bellies were touching together, which felt oddly pleasant to both of them. Banagher's belly was so sensitive from how gorged he was that just touching Marida's tummy made him burp right before he thanked her. This wasn't the first Neo-Zeon pilot had to help him down the small walk to the bedroom, she also did so after the dinner at Gilboa's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they both entered the room and brushed their teeth, it was time to slip into their pajamas. The brunette was tempted to just slip off his pants, jacket, and hoodie and simply go to sleep in his underwear and a shirt, less work that way, but he knew that he had to keep his dignity. Plus, Marida was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Marida changing her clothes in the bathroom to give him privacy, Banagher peeled off his out-of-date clothes, his gut safely censoring his crotch. \"I really gotta go clothes shopping when this is all over, before all my clothes explode in public.\" He thought. \"Huh, I wonder if Audrey would get me clothes as high-class as hers.\" He imagined himself wearing wearing a high-class blue sweater with black slacks and expensive white sneakers. He was still fat but at least his clothes fit him, his tummy was comfortably contained within the hem. \"It really doesn't suit me but I guess I might as well give it a try if Audrey wants me to.\" He then poked one of his soft moobs. \"Oh yeah, I forgot to ask Audrey about how she puts up with her chest bouncing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of his clothes was easy, even though the tightness did make a slight problem, slipping INTO his pajamas was more difficult then Banagher felt it should be. Putting on the shirt was easy, he knew better then to think the buttons could contain his mighty stomach, so he only buttoned the top one to cover his man boobs. His pants, however, were much more difficult to slip into. In fact, slip wasn't the right word, he was squeezing into them. His large booty and thick legs were a big (no pun intended) part of the problem but it was his belly that was the biggest obstacle. Banagher looked down at his huge gut, which completely blocked him from seeing his feet, and grunted as he fought the sphere and the pajamas, a look of frustration on his face. Now Banagher had no problem letting it all hang out in front of his big sister, so he didn't have to go through the extra trouble of bringing the waistband up around his stomach, he was fine leaving it under his middle, but the problem was that, as previously mentioned, his stomach was so heavy that the laws of gravity had caused it to hang down enough to censor his crotch. He sucked it in as mcuh as he could it wasn't even close to enough. The simple solution was just to lift it up but as Banagher knew well by now, nothing is ever simple with his life these days, not even clothes or adipose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was so full and heavy from the food it was packed with that Banagher couldn't lift it all the way with one hand. Two hands, yes, but he needed one of those hands to pull his pants up. \"Come... on... damn it!\" He grunted, grabbing his tummy as hard as he could as pushed up, feeling the soft fat in between his fingers just as Audrey had done earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Marida asked from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped and then swallowed down the next one he felt coming up. \"Nothing! My stomach's-I mean everything's fine!\" A gurgled sounded form his stomach and he burped again, louder then the first time. Marida knew he was lying but she decided to not press the subject, she didn't know exactly what was going on but her little bro was clearly embarrassed and she didn't want to increase that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen seconds later of grunting and frustration, Banagher finally managed to lift his stomach up enough to raise his pants to above his crotch. The second he did so, he breathed a sigh of Leif and let his stomach flop back into it's normal position, the malleable orb and his soft thighs jiggling from the impact.</span></div></div>",

Just an hour ago, Audrey was fighting a fearsome battle with her pajamas pants. Just as Banagher did, she grunted as she tried to force her pants up, though she less frustrated and more embarrassed then in Banagher's case. Also unlike Banagher's case, her belly wasn't the part of her body giving her the most trouble, it was her bubblebutt. The whole time she was paranoid that she was going to rip her pants. She was having so much trouble getting her pants up over it she had to take a break to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My butt's -UUURRRAAP- not that big, is it?\" She asked to one one in particular as she self-consciously ran a hand over one of her impressive butt cheeks. \"It's not, right, Haro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't. It isn't.\" Haro lamely said. He wanted to say more but he couldn't think of any way to convincingly lie beyond just saying it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually managed to get her pants up over her ass and then went right to sleep. In the present time, it was time for Banagher to do the same. With no grace at all, unlike when did the same, he flopped down on his bed, hands on his stuffed gut, feeling it gurgle and bubble as it digested his meal. He belted out a giant belch without shame, he kinda wish Audrey was here to hear that one. \"I'm all done, Ma -UUUUURAAP- rida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida left the bathroom and took her spot on the bed next to him, the mattress creaking as she did so, mcuh to her embarrassment. Laying on her side, she placed a hand on his hard yet soft stomach, which Banagher knew the blanket wouldn't be able to cover, and resumed tenderly massaging it. \"Ah, yeah... UUUUURRAAP!\" Banagher moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a puppy when I do this.\" Marida remarked. \"A fat, stuffed, belching puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey -URRAAAAAP- gets like this too when i rub her stomach. Is she more of a fat, stuffed, burping kitten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're both puppies.\" She said as she playfully shook his gassy tummy, making him belch yet again. \"By the way, I noticed you broke your belt, does that mean you really did manage to get it to clip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Aud-It only lasted about a second. UUUUURRP! Maybe two. Guess I was wrong about finding a way to clip it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, even though your stomach broke it, you were able to clip it. Even a second is longer then I thought possible. So your ideology is correct here, mine wasn't. You're still goofball though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're talking about my gut. UUUURRAP! It's got nothing to do with ideology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not true, everything someone does is driven by an ideology, even something as mundane as wearing a belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me put it like this.\" Banagher belched as Marida said that. \"You're in an eating contest, your stomach is starting to get full and you're slowing down but your competition doens't seem to be. Do you give up or keep trying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd keep trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. That reflects your way of life, that you never give up, even when things seem impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that actually makes sense.You should tell Audrey that some day.\" Before this interesting discussion could continue, a really loud gurgled sounded from the brunette pilot's stomach, Marida could feel it beneath her hand. As both of them predicated, Banagher belched loudly et again, loud enough to impress Marida in fact, which neither of them predicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, man my stomach's busy -URP- tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, one of everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole town, I ate one of everything being served in the whole town. Actually, it was way more then one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer when Banagher drifted off into a deep slumber. His belly sticking up into the air like a mighty mountain, moving in and out with every loud snore he made, drooling. He dreamed about pigging out with Audrey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Audrey... I couldn't eat another bite...\" Banagher talked in his (deep) sleep, still dreaming that he and Audrey were pigging out. At this point in his dream, he asked Audrey if she thought he was still in good enough shape to be a Gundam pilot, to which she jokingly suggested he might be after finishing yet another slice of pizza. He thought she was serious and told her he couldn't eat another bite, a sentence he followed up with a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've got room for breakfast.\" Marida teased as she jiggled Banagher's tummy to wake him up, which worked. She was actually expecting it to be a little harder then that. Waking him up that is, not his belly, that she was expecting to be completely soft with zero hardness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher yawned as he came to. The first thing he saw was the plain ceiling of the bedroom. Then he looked down from it and saw his big belly and Marida, chunky as ever and with part 1 of his breakfast. He sat up and Marida placed it on his dome of a middle. \"Thanks.\" He then chomped down on his toast. \"Sorry if I'm a little drowsy, I really stayed up late last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" She saw Banagher just use his hand to wipe some breadcrumbs off his round cheek, not even bothering with the napkin she gave him. \"Actually, if you're too tired I could go do your job for your. I'm sure Vincent won't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot coughed. \"No thanks. If I'm getting a gift for Audrey then I can't be lazy about about it. I have to give it my all.\" He then drank some of his orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good attitude to have but let me know if you feel too tired to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher started part 2 of his breakfast by taking a hearty bite of a waffle. \"I haven't seen the captain since I got here, is he really busy or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting across him at the kitchen table, Marida was balancing a big breakfast and writing yesterday's daily report on Banagher. She normally did them at night but she was too busy tending to Banagher's belly to write about him. \"No, he lives on our ship. He's paranoid about something happening to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded Banagher that the rescue operation was happening tomorrow, meaning that there was a decent chance of something happening to it. \"You should, uh, have him come out more often. URRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried. He's too stubborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher drank some water. \"Are you writing another report on me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but there hasn't been much to write about for a while.\" The Neo-Zeon pilot had just finished the writing the first paragraph of it. \"Don't worry, I don't include your binges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're writing a lot though.\" The subject of the reports took a big bite out of a strip of bacon, it tasted really good. The thing about bacon is that it's so delicious but you eat it all so quickly, unless you're eating an omelet but that's a separate dish. But Marida had given him so much of it that he could chow down on them all he wanted without feeling like it was over too quickly. He still wanted to lose weight but no way in Hell was he going to deny that getting to eat all this was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just say nothing happened, I have to still write a detailed report. Or else they'll think I'm being lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the writing assignments I got in school. You had to always make them a certain length even when something short works better.\" Thinking back on those simple days at school, Banagher couldn't believe he actually felt nostalgic for them. Sure, he felt incredibly disconnected from everything and he was rather aimless, which only changed once he met Audrey, but there was a charming simplicity when your worst nightmare was annoying homework. \"You should try padding it out with adjectives, it makes it much longer without having to come up with a way to stretch out the sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... actually would help.\" She wished him giving her that helpful was advice was something Full Frontal would want to hear, then she could put it down in the report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished their breakfast, it was time for them to jog to Banagher's last day of work. He was excited for a moment to make the money for Audrey's phone but then he instantly remembered that most of his work would just be sitting down and waiting for a customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. UUUURRP! I really gotta work off the pounds I packed on from last night.\" He said as he looked down at his belly and gave it a jiggle inducing slap, it was a little more puffy then usual because of the big breakfast he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small smirk, she grabbed the sides of her fat little bro's sphere of adipose and gave it a good shake, resulting in plenty of jiggling goodness. \"You've got quite a lot of belly to lose. We both do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we've got each other.\" He sincerely said. His gut took a good couple of seconds to stop it's gelatinous motions after Marida's meaty hands let go. He bumped his belly into Marida's, sending both their stomachs jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" A confused Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher blushed, he thought on how he was blushing nearly as much as Audrey these days. \"Sorry, I'm still used to hanging out with Audrey, like I said we mess with our stomachs and bump them a lot. I was thinking we could do a little belly bump for luck on losing weight but I forgot we don't really do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Banagher's surprise, Marida didn't scold him or change the topic, instead her smirk returned. \"Well,\" She lifted up her hefty belly, almost as if to present it to her little brother. \"if it'll bring us good luck, then how can I refuse?\" She let go and let her belly drop, it wobbled as it hit her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's smirk returned too. \"That's the spirit.\" And with that, they happily bumped their massive bellies together, once again making both orbs jiggle like jello. it felt weird but nice and fun to Marida, to Banagher it was simply nice and fun. \"Now that we've got luck on our side, let's get jogging.\" Enthusiastic, they began their jog to Bistro Gleissner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started panting after thirty two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:08 PM. That was when Audrey woke up from her food coma that day. She knew when she went to bed last night that she was going to wake up really late, but she still felt upset at herself. At least she didn't wake up too late to hang out with Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled, begging for some food. She blushed and placed her hands on the soft orb. \"What's wrong with me? I've been waking up hungry ever since I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing her teeth and yet again going through the hassle of changing clothes, Audrey took Haro with her and left her room to eat a big breakfast with Shin. It wasn't as big as Banagher's were these days, but certainly bigger then hers used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your time with Banagher?\" Shin asked Audrey as they ate their breakfast together at the hotel's diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fantastic, it felt so good to see him again after all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling it was. Only a good time will you get you as full as you were last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like Banagher.\" Audrey remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you two do last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating! Eating!\" Haro exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haro...\" An annoyed Audrey grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin laughed. \"I could tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a sight how an incredibly bloated Audrey looked as she waddled in through the hotel doors last night, letting out a gigantic belch as she did so. She followed that up with a meek \"E -URP- Excuse me\" and then a groan as her stomach gurgled and bubbled, all the bobbing and bouncing it was doing thanks to her waddling was not helping. Haro was bouncing right alongside her, pretty much as spherical as her stomach. Shin, who was waiting in the lobby for her return in order to make sure it was safe, was somehow not surprised by how stuffed the princess was. He wonder how Dozle would react to seeing his daughter so large and round and quickly came to the (correct) conclusion that his only problem with this scenario would be that she had a non-daddy approved boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question, yes we did in fact do a lot of eating, thank you very much for informing him, Haro.\" Audrey was a little surprised he didn't jokingly say she was welcome. \"We talked a lot. About normal stuff, the rescue operation, of course, each other, what's been happening since we were separated, pretty much whatever we could think of.\" Audrey then ate another spoonful of cereal. \"It was so great. I know I already said that but it bares repeating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it was as enjoyable as you were hoping it would be. I'm actually glad we're staying here longer, I would've hated to have torn you two apart again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably explain why that it is.\" There was some clear shame in Audrey's voice. \"I need to apologize, both for changing the plan all of a sudden and for not explaining it to you sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey returned to hotel she told Shin that they would be staying here until the operation and that she would explain why tomorrow, as she was way too full to explain now. After letting another huge burp and apologizing for it, she then started wobbling to her room. Shin asked her if she needed to be carried but she said no, she didn't want to give him such a difficult task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Shin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no grand or practical reason for it, I just can't bare to part with him again, even if it's only for two days.\" She rubbed her chunky arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep saying those words like you expect me to yell at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to chide me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Like I said, I didn't want to tare you two apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi sighed in relief, her tummy moving in and out. \"Thank you. I was worried I was being selfish again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"UUUUUUUURP! Excuse me.\" Marida belched out before she wiped her mouth with a napkin, a now empty plate on her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's plate number 15.\" Banagher said as he took the plate and started bringing it to the kitchen. \"You're doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank -UUUUURRP- you.\" Marida said as she rubbed her now even fuller belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" Gilboa asked, sitting at the same table but not currently eating anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm rather f -UUUUURAAAP- ull but I think I'll be able to finish. URP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour into Banagher's work shift, he asked Vincent if, being a bistro owner and all, he ever saw someone get fat off his food. It was obviously something Banagher asked out of worry he was getting even fatter but Vincent decided to give him a legitimate answer, which was that only one person had gotten fat off his cooking and that was Chloe. Granted, she was already getting chubby from her large appetite but Vincent always cooking for her was not helping her lose the pounds. He offhandedly mentioned that she also held the record for biggest amount of food eaten at the bistro, a grand total of 25 plates. Well, technically it was 20 plates and five bowls of pasta, but just saying plates rolls off the tongue. For Chloe's sake, he left out the part about how eating that much made her so overstuffed she broke the chair<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Banagher call that amazing, Marida asked if she could try beating that challenge. Vincent had no objections to someone spending money at the bistro, so he said yes. Banagher and Gilboa were a little surprised to see Marida have an interest in something like this but they were both excited to see her beat the record, having faith that she would. Plus, Banagher felt like had hadn't been doing enough to earn his paycheck, so he was glad he could now properly earn it by bringing plates back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher entered the kitchen to return plate number 15 and get plate number 16. \"Time for plate number 16.\" He cheerfully said as he entered and placed the dish in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's bowl number 3.\" Vincent said as he held up a bowl of pasta for Banagher to receive, it had just cooled off enough to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that looks good.\" Banagher said as he grabbed it, his and Vincent's tummies were touching. Vincent's took up 75% of the gap while Banagher's took up 25%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. How's Marida doing so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's really packing it away, she's got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she does then I owe her a trophy.\" Vincent said, it was mainly a joke since he didn't think he'd have a torphy to give her for a long time, if ever. But if he did have one, he would definintly give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you owe Chloe one too.\" Banagher pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" The pilot chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where is Chloe by the way? I haven't seen her in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...\" He suddenly seemed unsure about something. \"She's sick. She's been sick these past few days so she hasn't left the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hope she feels better soon.\" Banagher didn't understand where all these sudden tension was coming from. Was it possible to offend someone by asking where a mutual friend of theirs was? He really wanted to ask why Vincent looked like he just asked something incredibly inappropriate, but he didn't want the tension to be as thick as Vincent's body, so he let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Vincent awkwardly said. Equally as awkwardly, he coughed into his fist, it was obviously forced. Banagher was starting to feel like the tension was only going to get even more thick at this point, he was doing his part to lower it but Vincent sure wasn't. \"Did Marida tell you about me and Chloe? Our story, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but not mcuh.\" Banagher shrugged. \"All she said is that you opened a bistro and that you and Chloe have something complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Vincent finished saying that, Banagher said \"Well, I better go get this to Marida before she gets hungry, right?\" and walked right out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" Gilboa said as he Banagher waddled over. \"What took so long? poor Marida is starving over here.\" He worded his question as a complaint but his grin and friendly voice made it clear he was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.\" Banagher said, absolutely positive that was the best way to describe the conversation he just had with Vincent. He placed the plate in front of Marida. \"Sorry about the wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Sh said and then started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already you've got apologizing for late meals down pat, you're a fine waiter, Banagher!\" Gilboa complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far but thanks.\" The brunette said as he planted his fat ass back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched Marida eat the pasta, he couldn't stop thinking about her, Vincent, and Chloe. What was going on? Why was everything so complicated? Why won't they tell him what the problem is? It's obvious hiding it like this is just as uncomfortable to them as it is Banagher, so it must be something they really want to keep secret. And why was Marida allowed to know but he wasn't? Sure, she knew them longer then he did but this came off like something they wouldn't even tell long time friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one explanation he could think of that would explain everything, something he had experienced himself. It would explain why Vincent was so uncomfortable when he asked him where Chloe was, why he was being left out of the loop, why Marida said the relationship between Vincent and Chloe was complicated, why Vincent said she was sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Chloe die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something, Bana -UUUURRP- gher?\" Marida asked before eating more pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He realized he had accidentally mumbled his thoughts, though thankfully not loud enough for them to be sure he was saying something. \"No, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard you're pretty close friends with the princess.\" Gilboa asked Banagher. \"What do you two do when you hang out? From what I've seen of her she's pretty no-nonsense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She used to be but she's really loosened up since we met.\" Banagher said, fondly looking back. \"Heh, and to think the first thing she did was tackle me and demand to know who I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that sounds like her. But how did that little thing manage to tackle a big guy like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Banagher imagine how that tackle attempt would've went if Banagher was as fat back then as he is now. pressing up against him with all her might, Audrey would've managed to barely tip Banagher, so slowly he had time to turn around, which would've caused him to lose his balance, both of them falling down together, Banagher's chunky body jiggling as he hit the ground. Audrey face would've landed right into Banagher's jiggly tum, unintentionally burying her face in his creamy belly flab, both of them thoroughly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't fat back when I first met her.\" He grabbed the sides of his dome of a stomach and jiggled it for emphasis. \"We spent a lot of time hanging out and, well, eating. We both got pretty fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks to me like you've been showing her plenty of good times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she tells me.\" Banagher noticed Gilboa wasn't taken back to hear that Audrey got fat. Either he couldn't care less about her weight or he viewed the weight gain they both went through as a sign of the two enjoying themselves, a viewpoint Banagher could get behind. \"She can really pack it away, she's almost as good as Marida, you should see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never took her for a big eater.\" Gilboa noted. \"She seemed like someone who didn't eat much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was pretty surprised too. But as soon as she tried a hot dog, she was hooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did you two do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, we chatted a lot and watched TV. She wants me to introduce her to video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRAAAP! Excuse me.\" Marida didn't seem to realize how good her belch was. \"There's an arcade here, you could -URRP- take her to it once she's returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but I think she'll want to start with a console game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her bowl and burping again, Marida leaned back undid her sash, pants, and top, sighing in relief as her swollen gut bugled out three inches, completely free. She let out a manly belch, apologized for it, and requested that Banagher retrieve her next plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later and a grand total of twenty six plates were situated firmly in Marida's bloated stomach. \"D -UUUUURRRRP- Done...\" Placing the plate down and leaning as far as she could, Marida was utterly stuffed. She moaned and belched as she tenderly massaged her gut in hopes of soothing the gurgling beast. If before the best way to describe Marida's tummy was saying it was a beanbag chair, now the best way to describe it was to call it an extra large one. She even had to push her chair away form the table so it wouldn't cut into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew you could do it.\" Banagher said with a grin. He placed his hands on Marida's tummy and started rubbing it. This was tied with the night at Gilboa's house for the most stuffed he had ever seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Thank -UURRRRRRP- you. URRRAAAP!\" Marida said, relaxing her hands now that Banagher was taking care of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Vincent asked. He took a seat at their table once plate number 26 was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP! Accomplished. Ooohh.\" She moaned as her tummy gurgled. \"And glad no one else is here to see me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilboa laughed. \"So, Banagher, how do you think the princess would react if she saw Marida like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She'd definitely be impressed.\" He said without a shadow of a doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, today you'll have enough to get her that phone, right?\" Vincent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll go buy it as soon my shift's done.\" He looked at the clock and saw that he only had thirty minutes left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Here you go, with this you've got one hundred and seventy dollars, more then enough to buy princess Mineva the phone.\" Vincent said as he handed Banagher the cash, who placed it in his pocket with the other $120. \"You were an excellent employee, I'd compliment you more but since you're the only employee I've ever had, there's not really much more I can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I didn't really do much.\" He said. \"Well, until Marida did that contest anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we had more then five customers a day, you would be doing a lot of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was about to say \"If you had more customers then me, you wouldn't be calling me a great employee\" but he realized it sounded close to an argument, so he dropped the subject. \"Anyways, I know it's closing time but you don't mind letting Marida stay here to digest, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, though it'll probably take her hours to digest all that.\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's stomach gurgled right before she unleashed another loud belch. \"I can confirm that.\" She moved her right hand to the underside of her belly and resumed her rubbing activity there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help her get home when she's ready.\" Gilboa said. \"You'll be heading home after you buy the phone, right, Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I think I'll just do some walking around after I get it.\" Banagher felt a little guilty that he wasn't going to be there to help Marida wobble home. \"You know, just wandering around and doing whatever seems fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still haven't gotten a feel for Palau? I can show you around if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Banagher wondered if he could trust Gilboa with the knowledge of Audrey being on Palau. He seemed pretty friendly, like the sort of person who would support Audrey in what she's doing. Then again, that might be what he would think of Marida if he hadn't seen her chase Audrey. \"Anyways, I'll see you guys later.\" He started to walk out, his thighs rubbing together and jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec.\" Banagher stopped moving and faced Gilboa. \"I forgot to say this earlier. Audrey's caretakers, and probably some other people at Neo-Zeon, won't approve of how you and ht princess have been acting together, they'll say it's disgusting and unbecoming for someone like her, but don't listen to them. You're making her happy and that's all that matters, so next time you see her, do what you two always do together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had a small smile. \"Thanks, I will.\" He then left the bistro and headed for the electronics store. \"Does he know?\" He pondered as his belly, ass, legs, and moobs jiggled and jostled. \"I gotta remember to ask Audrey how she puts up with her boobs jiggling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was about to enter the electronics store when got cold feet about it, remembering what it was like the last time he was there. He looked down at this stomach and tried once again to pull his hoodie down, to no avail. It didn't surprise him, he certainty hadn't gotten any skinnier since then. If anything he had gotten even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was for Audrey, so he had to do it. Steeling himself, he was going to push open the door as he walked in but he had underestimated the size of his belly and found that it opened the door for him. Blushing, he noted that this little feature of his tummy was both very convenient and very embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, no one was in the store to see that, not even the cashier or any other employee of that matter. He sighed in relief. Since the door was unlocked, the store was definitely open, so whoever was manning the cash register was probably checking up on something in the back of the store or whatever. The way Banagher saw it, the less a cute girl other then Audrey, Micott, Marida, or Mihiro sees his tummy, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to where he remembered the phone was, glad that he could jiggle in here without being embarrassed, even if it was only for a little bit. Just as he grabbed the phone, a vaguely familiar female voice called out \"Hi! Can I help you find something?\", making a startled Banagher jolt. It was the cashier who had just returned to her post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I actually found it.\" He said as he slowly turned to face her, even just turning made his gut jiggle and swish. Obviously nervous, he waddled over to the counter, the cashier not sure if he was nervous because his stomach was showing or because he had a crush on her. \"It's one hundred and fifty dollars, r-\" Blushing, he looked down and saw that his squishy tummy was pushing into the counter. \"R-Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I actually just bought that model myself.\" She said to strike up some casual conversation to help Banagher feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it would make a good gift for a girl?\" He said as he reached for the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did just say I bought it.\" As soon as she finished saying that, Banagher placed the money on the counter. \"Don't you have a credit card or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Banagher felt like an idiot for saying something as cliche as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, money is money.\" She said as she counted up the amount, sure enough it was a hundred and fifty dollars, Banagher kept the other thirty dollars he made in his other pocket. \"If you don't mind me asking is this for your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we-we aren't sure if we're a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a yes to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey smiled as she saw Banagher run over to her, his face was red and sweaty from exhaustion. For anyone in shape, it wasn't a long run from the store to the park, but to someone as fat Banagher, it was a marathon. How sweaty the poor guy was wasn't only detail about his body she picked up on, she also noticed all the jiggling his belly was doing. \"Hey. Audrey!\" The brunette said as he reached the bench, it was the same park bench they sat at last night. Banagher had to take some time to catch his breath as he sat down next to Audrey, technically he was also sitting next to Haro, since Audrey was holding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Banagher.\" Audrey said, curious about what the rush was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* *huff* Yeah, you *huff* you too.\" Some more huffing later, he was finally ready to present his friend her gift. He didn't feel that he had a right to say that he worked hard for it, but he did feel he had a right to say he worked a while for it! \"I *huff* I got you-\" Before he could finish that sentence, Audrey suddenly lifted up his stomach, eliciting a startled gasp from the chubby pilot. \"A-Audrey, that's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still wearing your belt? You do know it's broken, right?\" She said and then let go of the chubby stomach, leaving it to slap right back onto Banagher's crotch area with a predictable shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to wear it as a memento.\" He answered. \"Tonight was pretty special for us, so I kept the belt around as a souvenir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you're rather weird,\" She bluntly said, wearing an expression that said \"I have no idea that what I said could be hurtful\". \"Though it's a big part of your charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you really know how to make a fat guy feel good from being called weird.\" Banagher said with a small smile, which his puffed up cheeks emphasized, making it even more heartwarming. \"Anyways, I got you a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher of course expected Audrey to be happy about this but he didn't expect her to look so truly touched. \"You-You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a phone so you'll always be able to talk to me and everyone else.\" He handed her her gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Audrey was looking at it, it was almost like she had to confirm this was really happening. \"I-Thank you so much, Banagher. I-I-I don't know what to say. Well, of course I know-I know to say thank you, I just don't know how exactly to word it.\" She seemed so overjoyed it was almost like she was out of breath. \"I've never had a friend give me a present before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, I'm really glad you're so happy about this.\" He was tempted to ask about her former life but he realized the answers would be as depressing as he could imagine, and he didn't want to make Audrey even slightly less happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm overjoyed!\" She said a bit louder then intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher guided Audrey through the process of setting her phone up,it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for all three of them. Audrey had no idea what most of the names he mentioned were, so he had to pretty much hold her hand through it but that didn't detract from the fun they were having. Banagher had a feeling teaching her how to play video games would be kinda similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're done, it's all set up.\" Banagher said as he finished successfully guiding Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I never would've been able to do that on my own. It's all so confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it. Just look at how quickly you got used to Haro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haro! Haro!\" Haro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave the orb (Haro, not her belly) a few affectionate pats. \"True.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"By the way, does staying with me change the rescue operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but not much.\" Audrey started. \"Shin just left this morning to return to the Nahel Argama. He left me a chair, it's the type a passenger uses in a mobile suit cockpit. Apparently he brought it with him in case there was an emergency that would require me to escape Palau in a mobile suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes  but it's not comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed and looked away from him. \"It's too small for me.\" She self consciously run a hand over her butt. \"I mean I can use it but it'll be a tight squeeze.\" Next she took that same hand and grabbed a handful of her creamy belly flab. \"Remember when we said we would quickly lose all this fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down at this stomach in shame. \"Yeah...\" He poked his malleable tummy, it almost felt like poking a pillow. \"You know, our bellies do feel really soft. I wonder if they'll get even softer...\" Banagher muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get our appetites in check, or else they'll be rolling us around.\" The strawberry blonde cautioned, the two of them imagining themselves as big balls of fat being rolled around by Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't turn down all the meals Marida is giving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher placed his hands on his stomach, thinking about the many meals it had digested. \"She's been stuffing me silly. Every morning I wake up to this big, big breakfast. I'm completely stuffed by the time I'm done. Then while I'm at work, she drops off a big lunch, twice. And if we're not out somewhere pigging out together, then she cooks me a big dinner. You should see how much pasta she can make. Oof, I feel stuffed just thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like she's trying to fatten you up.\" Audrey briefly imagined herself being the one overfeeding Banagher but she quickly pushed it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher didn't want to admit it, but that would make complete sense were it not for one fact. \"She's not, we work out everyday... Not that it shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I can't figure out why she would completely spoil you.\" Audrey placed a finger on her double chin in thought. \"Oh, I get it now. She feels guilty for kidnapping you, so she's trying to make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're right, but I really don't know how to feel about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, you need to turn down Marida before you explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, it'll make her feel even worse... Plus I like being spoiled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to explode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if I offered to cook a meal for you and I really wanted to do it, could you really say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're right, I can't.\" Audrey used this as an excuse to pat her big pal's jiggly gut. \"At least you and your big belly will be happy.\" She teased with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure will.\" He said, thinking about how stuffed he would inevitably be by the time he went to bed. \"Anyways, I've got a question that only a girl can answer, and well, I'm too embarrassed to ask Marida, do you mind if I ask you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Audrey didn't really have an idea of what Banagher was about to ask, but she had to make a guess it wouldn't have been even close to what the question actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher cupped his squishy moobs in his hands, immediately turning Audrey as red as a tomato, her eyes utterly incapable of looking at anything other then the sacks of chub. She didn't know it but even Haro was looking. \"How do you girls put up with your chests jiggling all the time? My moobs keep jiggling whenever I walk and it's really annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Two sentences wanted to leave Audrey's mouth, one was to answer Banagher's question to the best of her ability, and the other was to ask Banagher if she could feel his moobs. \"Your chest is completely made of fat, so it's much more jiggly then breasts. The only thing you could is, well, wear a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher joined in on the blushing. \"I'm not going to wear a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you are a boy after all. I was just saying that's the only thing you could do, which you actually can't.\" Audrey would never admit it, but that option took longer to leave her mind then she would've liked. \"'m suffering from some chest problems of my own.\" She looked down at her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like having bigger boobs? I think they\" He eyed her large breasts, which he thought were really hot, the way they'd jiggle and bounce reminded him of the girls from Super Robot Wars, the jiggling Audrey's did were as hot and sexy as their jiggling was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, but thank you.\" Audrey felt herself tingle at that. \"The problem is  my bra, it's getting too tight. I'll need to get a new one soon.\" Her bra wasn't just getting around her big boobs, it was also starting to cut into her backfat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you lose the weight.\" Banagher pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a normal observation, but it gave Audrey an epiphany. \"You're right, what are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Banagher was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Communication Error!\" Haro shared his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep talking about losing weight but we're doing anything. Let's get up and do some exercise.\" She then stood up and looked back at Banagher. \"Are you with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Banagher remarked as he followed suit, holding Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies broke out into jiggling as they started jogging, their massive bellies hitting their thighs with every bounce. It didn't take long for Banagher to start panting, and it took Audrey even less time. The distance between the two started to increase as the blonde got more tired at a rapid pace. As much as Banagher's from was thrown off by his own exhaustion, he looked like an Olympic gold medalist next to Audrey. She was swaying all over the place, her chubby face red and covered with sweat, her speed was terrible. \"I *huff* *huff* need to take *huff* a break.\" After forty five seconds of jogging that could accurately be called forty five seconds of intense jiggling, Audrey collapsed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Banagher ran over and sat down with her. Audrey was surprised to see that he wasn't nearly as exhausted as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to spend three seconds panting before she could answer. \"I'm exhausted. I can't *huff* go on.\" She wiped some sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, I'll go get you some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Bring *huff* as much as you can carry.\" The princess weakly handed Banagher her wallet, who grabbed it and left her with Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was back in less then a minute, carrying four bottles of water, hoping Audrey would leave one for him but willing to give her all four. \"Here you go.\" He said as he handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey yanked the bottle out of his hand and started chugging, REALLY chugging. Banagher was genuinely impressed by how she downed three fourths of that bottle in one go. \"Thank you, Banagher.\" Audrey said after taking a second to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Whew, this is like when Marida chased us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except his time I've got a gut too.\" Banagher said with his usual goofy charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a tired laugh. \"We still make a good team. I think I've come into my role as the brains and the blubber of this team quite nicely since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Banagher sat a little closer to her. \"But what's my role? The brawn and the blubber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brawn doesn't suit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Haro concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart and the blubber, of course.\" Audrey said as she rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect.\" Audrey and Haro said at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Besides, I might need more then just one more bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mcuh as he hated that Audrey's \"I'm expendable\" mentality was acting up again, he had to concede the point there. \"Then how do you feel about walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still really tired but I'll have to put up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've got a better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could carry you.\" His tone made it clear he saw none of the obvious flaws with this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to work. I'm way too heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you're obese, you're just really chubby.\" Before Audrey refute that, she was cut off as Banagher placed one arm under his legs and another behind her back and tried with all his might to pick her. He met not even a single percentage of success. He couldn't even make her jiggle, that was how poorly he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to throw out your back.\" Audrey didn't even budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not *grh* that heavy.\" He (poorly) lied through his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be able to pick me up if you were skinny and in good shape, how are you going to pick me up while you're fat AND out-of-shape?\" Her tone didn't show it all but Banagher could tell she was only saying those harsh words out of concern for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By *grh* giving it my all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abort, Banagher! Abort, Banagher!\" Haro suggested, a suggestion that sounded better with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the suggestion sounded too good to pass up after only ten seconds of grueling effort. \"Whew, I give up. Guess we're gonna have to walk.\" He wiped some sweat from his brow, the fact that he got got a little red in the face from trying to pick her up made Audrey feel embarrassed and ashamed, even though she knew from the start this would be the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm even more thirsty.\" Audrey complained as she took a seat on a park bench, the very same one she and Banagher sat down at earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anyone get so exhausted from less then a minute of jogging, not even me.\" As he said that, he put the necessary money into the adjacent vending machine, it took him longer then he thought it would've to find a dollar bill in Audrey's wallet that was worth less then fifty dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I was ever athletic.\" The princess of Zeon looked down self-consciously at her chunky legs. She placed a hand on one of her thighs, feeling how soft it was and how it had absolutely no tone to it. \"Even before I gained weight, I was probably incredibly out-of-shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did any athletic stuff either, Takuya and Micott didn't either.\" He said as he sat down next to Audrey, holding four bottles of water, which he handed two of to his friend. Haro sat on Banagher's side, he would've liked to sit in between them but there wasn't enough room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a big sip from their water bottles, Audrey more so, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRP! Sorry about that.\" Banagher apologized with a small blush. Burping during and after a big meal with Audrey was one thing, one couldn't really help but belt out some belches when they were absolutely stuffed, and usually their big meals were when they actively decided to let go and enjoy themselves, not to mention that Audrey was belching herself, and quite impressively at that. But belching during a normal outing? That was something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be. Check this out.\" With a smirk, Audrey fist bumped her chest, sending her big boobs jiggling, it only lasted a second, maybe two, but that didn't diminish Banagher's enjoyment of the sight. \"UUURRAAP! How's that?\" She said as she looked at Banagher with a sort of playfully proud look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. But don't forget that you drank more water then me.\" Banagher teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sore loser.\" Audrey joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi then looked at the Vist's exposed belly. God, there was something so cute about how Banagher couldn't fit his belly in his clothes, the way the massive ball was just hanging out there so causally for all to see, the way his incredibly deep bellybutton was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we should-\" Before Banagher could say anymore, his blonde pal reached out and placed a hand on the top of his stomach, it was just as incredibly soft as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Banagher noticed this. As soon as he did, Audrey blushed, immediately removed her hand from the malleable expanse, and looked away in shame. \"I'm sorry. I know I should've asked for permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, we've been playing with each other's bellies a lot.\" He assured. \"So why would I have a problem now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked back at him and replied as she ruffled a little of her hair. \"I know. I'm still not used to, you know, having friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if it makes you feel any better, I'm officially giving you permission to touch my stomach whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even your incredibly deep navel?\" Audrey said with a hopeful yet nervous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but onto more normal matters.\" Audrey ruffled a bit of her hair again as she let out an awkward chuckle, very clearly too nervous to advance on this topic. \"What were you going to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say that we should take a picture together with your new phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea, but you'll have to tell me how.\" She took her phone out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's much easier to teach an electronically clueless princess how to take a picture, then it is to teach how how to set up her phone in the first place, so it wasn't even a minute before they took a photo of their round faces together, barring charming smiles that their chubby cheeks made even cuter. Banagher thought they would go back to chatting but before he could say anything, Audrey told him they needed to take another picture, but not of their faces. Confused, Banagher received a poke to his gut, making the blonde's meaning clear. They did so, it felt weird taking a picture of their puffy bellies together but it was too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more chatting, Banagher drank some more water and belched loudly, giving his belly a few pats. This gave Audrey a competitive smirk. She jiggled her belly and burped even louder then Banagher for the second time today. \"Now it's your turn.\" She said as she looked at him with a face that said \"Give me your loudest belch, I'll let out an even bigger one\", but her friendly competitive look vanished when she realized she didn't know mcuh about belching contests. \"That's how belching contests work, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Banagher belched \"YES\" at her, which really made the Zabi laugh, she was laughing so hard her boobs and belly were jostling. \"Oh God, that was hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it was that funny, but thanks.\" Banagher could tell from how hard Audrey was laughing that she didn't even know it was possible to belch words. Who knew ignorance could be so charming? \"Now show me what you can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lovebirds enjoyed themselves, Marida was working out as much as humanly possible for someone as fat and stuffed as her. And the only way to do so without upsetting her packed belly too much was to lift dumbbells on the couch. Five pounds dumbbells specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty -URRRP- one...\" Marida grunted, her bingo wing jostling slightly as her arm lifted the object. \"Forty... two.\" Marida placed her dumbbells down on the floor, she was taking her tenth break. It wasn't lifting the dumbbells that was causing her so much duress, she wasn't THAT out-of-shape, it was that lifting dumbbells meant she couldn't rub her aching middle. \"UUURRRP! This is much -URP- harder then it should be.\" She said as she rubbed her stomach. \"I can't believe I'm losing to a -URRRRRRP- stomachache. Somehow my gut has become -URRRRAAP- my mortal enemy.\" She sighed, looking down at her dome of a middle, a look of disgust on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer break ended up lasting longer then she intended, only a quick, causal glance at the clock made her realize her break was seven minutes long. \"What's wrong with me? I used to be able to do fifty -URRAAP- lifts without breaking a sweat.\" She placed a hand on her brow feeling the sweat on it. \"I need to get back in shape.\" With renewed vigor, she picked her dumbbells back up. \"I need to be able to protect master, the princess, and Banagh -UUUUURRRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty... three...\" While her aching middle was the biggest issue, doing fifty lifts was genuinely exhausting for the incredibly obese soldier. \"Forty... four...\" Her chunky biceps felt like they were filling up with pain. \"Forty... five... forty... six...\" Her belly gurgled as it struggled to digest her massive meal. \"Forty... seven...\" She took a quick mini-break to pant. \"Forty *pant* eight... forty *pant* nine... *pant* *pant* fifty.\" With her mission accomplished, she uncermousnly dropped her dumbbells and practically deflated into the couch. \"Done...\" She belched triumphantly, like a victory cry except far less dignified. She started laying on her back and belched again as she rubbed her swollen gut. She closed her eyes, she thought she was just resting them, but that rest didn't take long to turn into a full nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAP!\" Banagher belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRP!\" Audrey belched. \"Okay, I -URP- can't drink -URP- any more.\" Audrey groaned as she tenderly rubbed her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me -URRAP- neither.\" Banagher concurred as he did the same to his own middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo had ended up drinking so much water and soda for their belching contest that it left them completely bloated, their bellies had swelled to nearly twice their size. It was a good thing neither of them were planning on standing up for a while anyways.</span></div></div>",

He looked up to the sky to see dark clouds. \"Speaking of water, looks like -URRAAAAP- it's going to rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Audrey looked up at the sky and belched in an unladylike manner. \"Can't -URRRRRRRRP- believe we didn't notice this until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably got too caught up -UURRRRP- in our burping contest to notice.\" Banagher gave his belly a few pats, it still jiggled even in it's bloated state. It was actually already raining, but it was only drizzling and the leaves of a tree shielded the bench, so they didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pulled up his hood, it couldn't cover all of his messy hair but it was obviously better then not putting it up at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's -URAAP- so rare to see you with your hood up that I forgot you even have one.\" Audrey commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, -UUUURP- I'm not much of an outdoors kind of guy, so I don't use it much.\" He explained. \"URRP! I just really like how hoodies feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've never worn one but they do look rather comfy. Like wearing a blanket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that's a good way to put it. So why do you wear a hood? Do you like the style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that.\" She pulled up her hood to demonstrate her reason. \"It's to make me harder to recognize. I put it up whenever I think someone is looking for me specifically. UUUURRRP! Does -URRRRAP- it work with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's pretty redundant now, I've gained so much weight I'm almost unrecognizable now.\" She grabbed the sides of her tremendous tummy and started jostling it. Banagher thought that would be really hot and sexy if she wasn't doing it as she demonstrated that she has zero self-esteem. \"UUUURRRP! I'm surprised anyone can recognize this -URRAAP- big ball of dough I've become as Mineva Lao Zabi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look THAT different, Audrey.\" A worried Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just look like a heavy Audrey now.\" Haro concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I look that different, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Audrey sighed. \"UUUURRP! You're right, sorry for making you worry. Who knows what I'd do without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous smirk, Banagher held Haro right up to the Zabi's face, startling her. \"Give Haro some credit too! He helped too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering, Audrey chuckled. \"Yes, thank you, Haro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Audrey!\" The orb cheerfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the rain started to pick up, and it picked up quickly. It didn't ease from drizzling into decently heavy rain, it seemingly went from drizzling to decently heavy rain in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRP! There's something relaxing about the sight of rain.\" Audrey commented as she drummed her fingers along the blubbery surface of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could fall asleep to that sound. UUUURAAAP!\" Banagher concurred, Audrey wasn't surprised that rain could put him to sleep. \"Reminds me of playing in the rain as a -URRRRRRP- kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -UUUUUURP- never did that, actually.\" Audrey said as her belly gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? URAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My caretakers never allowed it.\" There was a small hint of frustration in her voice. \"They said it was behavior unbecoming of royalty, and they were worried I would get -URRRRP- sick. She ruffled a bit of her strawberry-blonde hair. \"They were probably more concerned about the former.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry -UUUURRRP- to hear that.\" Banagher said. \"Hey, I've got an idea, you should spend some time in the rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not -UURRRAAP- five years old.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean play in the mud or any -URAAAAP- thing. I mean just stand in in the rain and soak it all up. UUURRP! Pun not intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just wat -UUUUURP-! It's just water, don't let it stop you from enjoying yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess looked down her huge stomach, the result of much feasting done in the name of enjoying herself. She grabbed a handful of the pale flab, she squeezed it as hard as she could. She belched, her tummy was still soft and squeezable even when incredibly bloated. She thought on how Haman would react if she saw her now, probably grab her tummy in the exact same way as she talked about the \"damage\" Banagher had done and that she was going to put her on a diet ASAP. \"We've been enjoying ourselves far too much, it's why we're so obese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big friend thought on what to say, he couldn't deny that she did have a point, even if she was likely to take it too far in the other direction. He thought on what he could say, and a certain memory popped into his mind before long. \"Remember what we said to each -URRRRP- other the day after we met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Audrey released her grip on her gut, an eyebrow raised in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grabbed he sides of his gut and gave it a jiggle fit-inducing shake, just as he did that day. \"That even if we became completely obese -UUUURRP-, we still wouldn't regret pigging out together. Bring on the pies! UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked and then a look of renewed vigor shone on her face as she raised her fists in excitement. \"You're right! Bring on the pies!\" Her look of vigor left in an instant when she realized she forgot to do something. \"Oh, hold on.\" Just as they did together that day, Audrey grabbed the sides of her stomach and gave it a good, jiggly shake. Her vigorous look had returned as quickly as it had left. \"Bring on -UURRRAAP- the pies! UUURRP! ...Or rain, in this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some difficulty, turns out even if it's only water and soda, a very bloated tummy still weighs a lot, she stood up and walked into the rain, her hood pulled back down. She looked down at her bare tummy, and the calming sound of raindrops hitting it, it sounded similar to when she drummed her fingers on it, but softer. She then looked up at the raining sky, the rain drops coating more of her chunky body. \"This feels -UUUURRP- amazing.\" Her hair color was starting to darken from the water. \"Ah!\" She stopped looking at the sky and rubbed her right eye, obviously shocked by something. \"One of the rain drops got in my eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gonna happen when you look up at rain. You'll get used to it.\" Banagher chuckled, Audrey was always cute when trying out something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Audrey made a \"come here\" gesture at Banagher, who was feeling rather lazy at the moment. \"No thanks.\" He said. \"I'm too full to stand up.\" He then forced a burp in hopes it would convince Audrey that he wasn't just being lazy. It didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes in a way that said \"You're a goofball, but that's part of your charm\", Audrey waddled over and pulled him up with great difficulty. \"Oh get up, you lazy -UUUURRP- bum.\" She teased in a friendly manner right before she started trying to pull him up. heir tummies collided when she got him up, sending waves of blubber jiggling, and forcing huge belches out of their mouths at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling sweetly, Audrey pulled down her friend's hood, letting his hair get wet alongside hers. \"It feels good, doesn't it?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does.\" He said, he and Audrey looked down at their touching massive guts as the rain drops fell on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is -UUUURRRP- perfect for slow dancing, but you don't know how to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give it a sh -URRRRRRP- ot.\" He said, knowing full well that he'd be terrible at dancing, and he wasn't trying to convince Audrey otherwise. \"Though these huge guts of ours miiiiight -UUUURRRP- get in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRAP! They'll just make this even more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pairs of soft hands grasped each other, and their owners began slow dancing. Their rain-soaked bellies hugged each other as they danced, Audrey danced as elegantly as she could in such a bloated condition, Banagher on the other hand was incredibly clumsy , which threw off Audrey's part of the dance. With the two often stepping on each other's feet, the loud burps they belted out, sometimes into the other's face, and how off-balanced their swollen states made them, it was far from a graceful dance. But that wasn't the point, the point was to enjoy each other, and watching from the bench, Haro could see clear as day on their soaked, double chinned-faces, their hair darker and fallen out of their usual style from the water, that they were enjoying each other very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher backed up as part of his assumption of how the dance went, causing Audrey, who was following a separate idea of how the dance went, to accidentally push Banagher onto his back, with Audrey herself right on top of him, their bellies still hugging. Both heavyset bodies jiggling violently from the fall, Audrey and Banagher each simultaneously unleashed an incredibly loud belch, a belch that was then followed up by joyful laughter, both bellies jiggling some more from the laughter, Banagher's cheeks were jiggling from it as well and so were Audrey's boobs. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Banagher's gut touched the door to his and Marida's home as he grabbed the knob. He was absolutely soaked, his hair had lost all it's poofiness, every bit of his hair and clothes was darker, all of this was from how drenched with rain he was. The door wasn't locked, so that meant Marida was home. \"Wait, if Marida wasn't home then I wouldn't be able to get inside. I should probably ask her about getting me a key... Oh yeah, I'm getting rescued tomorrow.\" He opened the door to lay eyes on the rare sight that was a lazy Marida sleeping on the couch. \"Huh, usually I'm the fatass on the couch.\" He walked over to the couch to get a better look, only for his foot to hit something. \"Ow!\" He jolted. Looking down, he saw that what his foot hit was a dumbbell, a second one was adjacent to it. \"Dumbbells?\" Banagher then belched. \"You were working out while you were that stuffed? Damn, Marida, you're tough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he would've liked to sit down on the couch, he was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to lift Marida's massive legs, at least without waking her up, so he sat down in the nearby chair, letting out a little groan as he did, and started watching TV. Placing a hand on his orb of a stomach, he noticed that he already felt less bloated then before. \"That's odd, usually it takes hours longer for me to digest this much. Guess water and soda digests quicker. Does that mean I'll have enough room for dinner tonight? Marida'll sure be happy she gets to stuff me again. Man, if I was still skinny when I got kidnapped, she would've fattened me up to my weight.\" He chuckled, thinking on how the others would react if he came back over a hundred pounds heavier. Then he turned his attention to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Marida finally woke up, her belly still tremendously bloated. She sat up and looked down at her middle. She gave it a poke, which made it gurgle before she let out another manly belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marida.\" Banagher said, startling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Banagher. You're -UUUURRRP- home. What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Oh, you mean why am I wet? That's-Uh...\" Banagher cut himself off as he remembered that he couldn't tell Marida that Audrey was here. And the idea of of him dancing alone in the rain was so cringe-worthy he wouldn't dare use it as his cover story. \"I like walking in the rain.\" He didn't feel like he told that convincingly at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with your gut gut hanging out like that? UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain drops hitting your belly is actually pretty soothing.\" He said as he tapped his fingers along the blubbery surface of his big gut, which had completely digested all the soda and water.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" She said as she looked down at her tummy. She then looked back at Banagher. \"Speaking of your stomach, you must be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it wanted to answer her question, Banagher's stomach let out a loud growl of hunger. \"Well, you heard the belly.\" He chuckled, sheepishly rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on her bed as she watched TV, with Haro on the bed with her, Audrey was bored. She wasn't sure what it was, but TV wasn't as entertaining as it usually was. Maybe she just didn't like what was on, or maybe it was that she was lost without Banagher to guide her through the strange and almost intimidating world of normal television. Yawning, a certain memory of her and Banagher popped into her mind's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they went on their reunion binge, right after they had purchased a bunch of snacks from a grocery store. They couldn't even wait to find a bench to sit down at before they started stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ These mini pretzels are divine, Banagher.\" Audrey said right before she munched on another handful of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're perfect snacks for watching TV.\" As for Banagher, he was snacking on a bag of popcorn. \"Like popcorn.\" He said through a mouthful of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manners, Banagher.\" Audrey lightly teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all this belching is fine but eating with my mouthful is impolite?\" He joked before eating another handful of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm aware of the irony.\" Audrey ate some more pretzels and practiced what she preached, by waiting until she swallowed her food to ask something. \"Anyways, is it normal to eat while watching TV? I never thought of doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I do it all the time. Or when I'm playing a video game. It makes it better.\" He then took a big drink from his can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to try that sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURP!\" Was the only comment Banagher felt like making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you always this good at belching?\" Audrey asked as she poked him deeply in his tummy. As she hoped, it made him burp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I never really thought about it.\" He then jiggled Audrey's tummy as she ate more pretzels. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey swallowed her handful of pretzels and belched. \"I definitely wasn't this good before. I always made sure to keep my belches to a minimum and not audible. I still do when I'm not alone with you, unless I'm so full I can't stop myself.\" Then she smirked. \"Like right now. UUUURRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Audrey certainly didn't mind thinking back on it, the orchestra of belches they let out after that was irrelevant, her main takeaway from that memory was Banagher's advice on eating snacks while watching TV. Since she was bored and not quite sleepy enough to go to bed now, now was the perfect time to try it out. So she left her room for the hotel lobby, where three vending machines were placed. She made three trips from the lobby back to her room, carrying all the junk food that she could each time. It was exhausting to the poor girl, she had to take a break between the second and third runs, a break she spent snacking on her haul, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her third run was done and she had wiped the sweat from her brow, Audrey started gobbling up snacks and soda as she watched TV from the comfort of her bed, her impressive booty sinking into the mattress, which made her feel even more self-conscious then usual. Thankfully she managed to push those thoughts away by reminding herself of the vow she made with Banagher. \"Bring on the pies\" indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnacking while watching TV turned out to be as enjoyable as she hoped, there was something so great about kicking back and stuffing your face as your TV entertained you. Far more enjoyable then all those political dinners and banquets she had to attend under Haman's care. If only Banagher was with her then, she firmly believed that he would've convinced her to go to town on the food there with him. Even with them only being eight years old, Audrey had a feeling they still would've been able to out-eat any of the adults there, even Haman herself, if she knew what fun was. Though now that she thought about, the Zabi was pretty sure Haman would've lost on purpose to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the shows seemed better with snacks, even with her loud belches drowning out the dialogue sometimes. Fittingly enough, one of the animated shows she was watching just happened to show a petite, redheaded girl eating herself silly and getting a huge stuffed belly as a gag. She kinda wanted to watch that scene with Banagher now but she had forgotten the name of the show, and wasn't going to use the remote to look it up on the TV guide when she would be snacking instead. She did partly remember the show's name though, it was something starting with \"Gin\". Presumably the show's full title was a pun based on the beer of the same name, though she didn't see anyone drinking gin in the episode she watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde had heard the saying that time flies when you're having fun. For her that proved untrue, whether it was binging or watching TV, it always seemed to last forever. This time was no different. Once she had finally eaten everything she brought up, Audrey's belly was just as inflated as it was when she was full of soda. Letting out an unladylike burp, she looked at her stomach and gave it a poke, it gurgled in response. Rubbing it, she felt a little drowsy. \"Banagher, -UUUUUURRP- your advice is as wise as that of a life guru. UUUURRRP!\" She joked with a goofy smile. \"I wonder what he's saying to Marida right now. Knowing him, he's saying something weirdly charming charm like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRP! Ahh~\" Banagher burped as he finished another big forkful of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse you.\" Marida teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Banangher then finsihed his last slice of pizza for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed Ital -UUUUURP-! Excuse me.\" Marida was still firmly bloated, and Banagher was starting to rejoin her in that category. \"I've noticed Italian cuisine is your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURP! Oh yeah, pizza and pasta are great.\" He heartily slapped his big belly, which had started to bloat up around the time he finished his second slice of pizza. \"A lot of people prefer spaghetti, but pasta is way better.\" He eagerly dug into the last bits of pasta in his bowl, he ate so quickly even Marida was a little shocked by his gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the now empty bowl down on the coffee table, along with the other dishes, and leaned back in the couch, tapping his full belly. He let out a sigh of pleasure. \"That was good. UUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that seems to have satisfied your gluttonous appetite.\" After a brief struggle, Marida got up and headed towards the kitchen as Banagher rubbed his gut. Soon she returned with a plate in one hand and a big bowl in the other. \"Would you like some dessert?\" She said as she placed them on the coffee table, the plate contained a hearty helping of cookies and the bowl contained a lot of chocolate ice cream, with a spoon to eat it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRP! Ahh~ That hit the spot.\" Banagher moaned, a content look on his chubby face, hands on his stuffed belly, it was as massive as it was after the burping contest.</span></div></div>",

To her amusement, this took a bit to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm awake, I'm awake.\" He then yawned, his tummy took a second to stop jiggling.

Or I could put stuff like a controller or my phone on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't think that's proper etiquette for eating with the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she'd mind.\" He took a break from his waffles to gobble up some cereal. \"Hey, what time is it? You said you have to go on patrol today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 3:18.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you wake me up at 12 PM like usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You earned a few extra hours of sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished pigging out on his breakfast, Banagher let out a pleased sigh as he rubbed his tummy, a content look on his round face. Though when it came to Marida's own round face, she had a look of expectation. \"What?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just waiting for you to belch, you always do after you finish breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't -UUUURRP-!\" Predictably enough, he did belch, leading to a goofy, embarrassed grin on his pie-like face, and an amused one on Marida's. \"Well, it was a compliment in France. That's what Audrey said, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Marida taking the plates, Banagher went to the bathroom to shower. As much as he had come to view this place as a second home, it still felt really weird to take a shower here, mainly because of how he had to be naked. Even though his heavy, hanging, belly pretty much censored his crotch. \"That's another nice thing about being fat.\" He thought as he poked it. \"Though it's a pain having to move this big thing when I need to get water there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his shower was done and he brushed his teeth, Banagher squeezed into his outdated clothes. \"God I hope I can get some new clothes before I explode right out of these things in front of Audrey. I'm leaving today and I'm sure Mihiro has bigger clothes for me and Audrey on the ship. So I've just gotta go through a few more hours without ripping anything. Hope I don't drop anything, I know I'll just forget about my clothes and lean down to pick it up like a dumbass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of his preparations for the day finished, it was time for the best one: Getting to stuff himself with part 2 of his breakfast. But once he was about to dig in, he realized this was probably the last time he and Marida were going to do this. No more getting woken up by the best big sister he could've asked for. No more asking her for advice. No more getting stuffed with food she prepared for him out of love. No more cheering her on as she wolfed down mountains of food. No more walks in the park with her. No more exercising together. No more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like someone had taken hold of him and replaced all his joy with sorrow. Having to say goodbye to someone like her, it all felt so familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Those words from her made it so hard for Banagher to not just spill it all to her. He was positive that he would've if only he was at stake, but he wasn't, telling her the truth would endanger Audrey. And even if she wasn't, there all the soldiers of Londo Bell and ECOAS that were going to kill and be killed for him tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can-Can I see you off today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually just about to leave, but I'll wait for you to finish eating on one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed a small smile. \"Enjoy your breakfast like you always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled back at her, it was different type of smile, one of relief. \"I will.\" That was what he said right before he dug in with gluttony rivaling the night at Gilboa's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was eating at that speed a compliment in France too?\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a pretty universal compliment.\" He said through a mouthful of bacon, Marida barely understood what he said, and she was pretty sure the only reason she could at all was because of her special abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished up his breakfast in record time, not because he wanted to hurry up so Marida would be on time, but because he wanted to make their last meal together as enjoyable as possible, he felt he succeeded in that. Contently resting a hand on his somewhat bloated tummy, Banagher leaned back in his chair and unleashed a booming belch, looking very pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're -URRRP- welcome.\" Banagher casually tapped his fingers like a piano on his gurgling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed you put your belt  back on even though it's broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I wear it as a memento.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A memento of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a second for Banagher to realize his careless words had backed him into a corner. Obviously he couldn't tell her the truth, as hat would mean telling her that Audrey was on Palau. \"Oh, you know the time where\" Then he felt like a cartoon character when a light bulb appears over their head. \"Where you said my philosophy of trying even when it seems impossible was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I didn't think there such a logical reason to wear a broken belt before but like usual, you never fail to impress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marida guided Banagher to where he would see her off, the sights of the town seemed to grow more unfamiliar the closer they got their destination. \"I don't think I've been here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised, there's nothing of note this way besides the spaceport.\" Marida said. \"No arcades, eateries, video game stores, model shops, or anything else you'd be interested in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just listed some hobbies you know people my age like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're into all those things, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida chuckled, she was starting to think a doughy look suited such a goofy little bro. \"I actually brought you through here when you were captured. I had to carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That couldn't have been easy.\" The brunette ran a hand across his jiggly tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't, I had to take a lot of breaks. When I pulled you out of the Unicorn, I was surprised to see the pilot was so fat and out-of-shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush appeared on Banagher's face, he looked down at his beanbag chair of a stomach, noting how he couldn't even see his feet. \"Yeah, most people probably would've-Oof!\" Banagher was cut off as his fat belly collided with another, waves of blubber jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going!\" An obnoxious voice rhetorically said. The voice sounded familiar to Banagher but he couldn't quite recall where<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try it, Angelo. It was obvious you meant to bump into him.\" Marida said, Banagher didn't even need to look at her to tell that she had an annoyed expression on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Banagher and Marida nearly did a double take when they saw how different Angelo looked. He looked to be over at least a hundred pounds different. He once flat, though not muscular at all, stomach was now a large orb-shaped tummy that was very soft and jiggly. The buttons on his uniform were visibly tight, and very much so, there was even a gap at the bottom where some of his pale blubber could be seen. His tummy had a hang to it, causing it to slap onto his meaty thighs whenever he walked, which he wasn't doing much of these days. Speaking of his legs, they were impressively thick. They so were thick and meaty that they constantly rubbed together, with zero separation. They jiggled with every step, and not just because his belly would bounce into them. These chubby legs went perfectly with his bubble-butt, which was so big it was rivaling Micott's booty. Each cheek was incredibly soft and plush, the size of bowling balls. Any normal sized chair he planted his booty in, including in the cockpit of his mobile suit, would be filled up up, with fat spilling off the sides. Assuming the chair didn't break. His butt jiggled with every step he made, they would be especially jiggly on the rare occasion that he was running. His chest had turned into a pair of two, small puffballs of fat that rested on his tummy, which they jigged with. His face was round, pie-like in fact, complete with chubby cheeks and a double-chin. These features left him completely incapable of appearing intimidating, only cute, much to his dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're feeling quite protective of the enemy today, Marida.\" Angelo snidely said. He looked down and was dismayed to see that Banagher's belly was significantly bigger then his. \"Impossible! I've been eating far more then you!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Angelo, no one is ever going to beat him at having a huge gut.\" She slapped his belly for emphasis, making it jiggle like mad. \"This boy is talented at getting a huge belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're that guy who hit me!\" Banagher shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Marida grabbed Angelo's shoulder, tightly. He grunted in pain, rage written on his face. \"What did you do?\" Her voice was like a massive icicle. Icy, sharp, and deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Marida gripped even harder, and Angelo grunted in even more pain. \"Okay! I threw him against a wall and hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded to that answer by swiftly throwing him against a wall, far harder and stronger then Angelo did to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling over, she looked down at him, literally and metaphorically, and gave her superior officer orders. \"Don't bother my little brother ever again.\"</span></div></div>",

Okay! Take it all and consider it a bribe for you to leave me alone forever!\" He pulled out all the money he had out of his wallet, it was around a hundred dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how it works.\" She causally said as she started counting up the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even know I had my wallet with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't hard to tell you were going to a buffet to gain more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Glad to see it's obvious I'm working hard.\" Trying to hide his wounded pride, Angelo stormed off back to his house so get more money to pay for the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that problem out of the way, Marida walked over to a shocked Banagher, who had been watching the whole time in stunned silence. \"How does a tirp to the ice cream parlor sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me your little brother.\" Banagher was smiling so hard he had dimples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did.\" Marida looked a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really happy you're my big sister.\" He got a little more up in Marida's space as he excitedly said that, their soft tummies were now touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" That look of brotherly admiration he had made Marida's heart warm, how round and soft his face was made the look even more endearing. \"Thank you. I'm happy you're my little brother. Now why don't we have some ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for a certain obese blonde, Banagher was so caught up in the moment that he didn't realize that there was someone else he was supposed to be spending time with right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" A frustrated Audrey said to Haro, mainly to blow off steam. The two were all alone together in at the usual park bench. \"He wasn't found out, was he? No, if he was we'd have all of Neo-Zeon on top of us right now. He's probably just sleeping. Has he always been this lazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher's not that lazy.\" Haro defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He absolutely is. I know I've been sleeping in lately, and I wish I wasn't, but Banagher wakes up at 4 PM with no shame!\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your upbringing is showing! Your upbringing is showing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed, the frustration her face was displaying replaced with regret. \"I know, sorry. I guess I'm suffering from Banagher withdrawal... I can't believe I just said that. You'd be laughing right now if you could, wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yip yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growling of Audrey's stomach brought up another reason why she was in such a bad mood. \"Or maybe it's because I had a small breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should always have a full breakfast, it's good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi placed her hands on her round stomach, Banagher wasn't kidding when he said their stomachs were soft. \"I know but ever since we got here I've always been starving when I wake up, so my breakfasts are even bigger then usual. I was hoping I could cut down on that, I don't need to be eating even more then I already do. I don't know what's wrong with me, does being within a hundred mile radius of Banagher just make me hungry or something?\" Her belly growled again, like a child trying to get her mother's attention. \"Let's get some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the incredibly loud belches Banagher and Marida unleashed in unison. The obese pilots were absolutely stuffed! Their big bellies so full of ice cream that they had bloated to twice their size, making Banagher and Mairda look like they had eaten large beanbag chairs. Banagher didn't suffer any wardrobe malfunctions, barring his shirt being forced up even further, as his clothes had come pre-broken, so to speak, but Marida was a different story. The poor woman's magnificent belly had done quite a number on her uniform. Her belt was broken, her pants' button was vanquished, her zipper was forced all the way down (thankfully her belly acted as a censor for her underwear), and the best part of her uniform was forced open, showing the world that her gut had force the shirt part up so much it was practically a tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger stomachs and wardrobe malfunctions weren't the only change in their appearances, their messy and excited eating caused them to get plenty of ice cream on themselves, from their boots, to their legs, to their bellies, to their double-chins, but mostly on their mouths and puffed-up cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was good!\" Banagher gave his bloated belly a big slap, sending it jiggling. \"UUUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRAAAP! The ice cream or the two of us earning the title of this parlor's best eaters?\"  Marida rubbed her swollen tummy with both her hands, she was pretty sure she knew the answer but she loved talking with Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bloated pair were finally finished eating and laying back in their seats as they waited for their taut stomachs to digest enough for them regain the energy to stand up, letting out many manly belches of indigestion, the owner of the parlor, who was also the bartender there, unexpectedly came over and told them how amazed he was by how much they could put away. As thanks for them enjoying his parlor so much, and for all the money they had given him, he bestowed upon them the title of his parlor's best eaters. He even planned to put their names faces together on a plaque in the place. When he got ready to take a picture of them together, the tubby redhead realized she and Banagher were covered in ice cream and should probably clean up first, but the owner said it works better this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, -UUUURRRP- getting to spend more time with you.\" Banagher added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rubbed each other's packed-full tummies as they wobbled to the port, those full bellies jiggling and wobbling, along with their chunky legs and big boobs. The incredibly obese big sister and little brother burped many times, occasionally starling a passerby, and earning them many stares. Banagher and Marida would compliment the other when they unleashed a particular loud burp, which never failed to elicit a sense of pride in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome groaning, belching, and jiggling later, the two arrived at the port. Banagher felt his heart rate increase and his body tense up, he felt so stupid for getting so caught up in the fun that he had let it slip his mind that he was going to have to say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before -URRP- I go, there's something I need to say.\" Marida said, she and Banagher still massaging in each other's tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP! About what?\" Banagher didn't want to let go, metaphorically or literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I was assigned as your guardian,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or more accurately, your big sister,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about what exactly the captain's goal with it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he already told us, he said it was to convince me to join you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would like that but I believe that he was betting on something else happening. I think he wanted to use you to -URRRP- lure the princess, or as a bargaining chip for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he think Audrey would come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy to deduce from your testimony that you're very close with her, which would make you the perfect bait for her.\" Mairda's explanation was making a scary amount of sense to Banagher. \"And since you're very valuable to the Federation, they would undoubtedly try to rescue you. Either by trading the princ -UUURRRP- ess for you, a deal the captain would never honor, or by attacking Palau. The princess would definitely use what political power she has to stay on the Mock Trojan Horse as it rescues you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Mock Trojan Horse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's codename we've given to the ship you were on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, that all -URAP- makes sense but what about someone sneaking me onto a ship or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would never work, your name, face and, ahem, body shape is known to every dock officer, it would never work, and ECOAS must know that.\" The redhead burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this? This all came out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did? I'll try to work on that. But the reason I told you is that you deserve to know everything about your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher showed a small smile. \"Well, thanks. I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Marida looked at the port before looking back at Banagher. \"I should be going now, my master is mad enough at me for being so late. I'll see you when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like this could very well be his last chance to do this, Banagher embraced Marida in a big hug, surprising her, their bellies were like two pillows pushing together. As soon as the short-lived shock was gone, Mairda smiled and hugged him back, she supposed she should've expected that. It only lasted fifteen seconds but to Banagher it felt like eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the embrace ended, she patted Banagher on his head and warmly said \"See you soon.\" It was hard for Banagher to fight back his tears, he could only do so until she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's Audrey?\" Banagher said to no one in particular as he looked at the completely empty park bench. \"That's odd, she's always here before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn incredibly loud and manly burp shocked Banagher. He looked at the source, which turned out to be a an equally bloated Audrey wobbling to him as she held Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuggh... Too much cheese... UUUUURP!\" </span></div></div>",

The hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Audrey paused to let out another burp, she thought to herself on she seemed to losing the right to be called a proper princess more and more with ever passing day. She wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. \"I had a light -URRRP- breakfast and, well, I got hungry while waiting for you, so I had to \"make up\" for the difference.\" She gently pet her tummy a few times, even that was enough to make it gurgle loudly, Audrey groaned as her belly did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess mercifully plated her humongous booty on the bench, groaning again, this time in relief. Banagher sat down next to her, also groaning in relief. \"So -URAP- why are you as bloated as me this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher contently drummed his finger along his belly as he explained. \"I has a good time with Marida at the ice cream parlor. UUURRP! We're now it's best eaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling that was the case, since you're -UUURRP- covered with the stuff.\" Audey snarked as she poked Banagher in his belly and listened to him belch loudly, making for what was quite the adorable scene to the blonde. \"Your eating habits could use some work.\" With a sweet smile, she took out a napkin from her pocket and began cleaning up Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where did you eat?\" Banagher said as Audrey started her clean up by wiping the bits of ice cream off her pal's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza. You remember that one pizzeria we ate at during our reunion? The -URP- one where -UURAAAP- that man got upset at you for beating his eating record without even trying. I ate there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get why he took it so badly. I know this is a poor place but two extra-large pizzas isn't that impressive. UUUURRP! Must be a new place if that's the most anyone's ever eaten there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was lying. I checked and the owner doesn't keep track of stuff like that.\" She finished cleaning Banagher's bare belly, then she moved onto cleaning his shirt and man boobs. She felt tempted to use as an excuse to sneak a grab but she knew that would be wrong of her, and she was still too embarrassed to ask for permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should've figured he was a -UUUUURP- a scam artist when he started talking about us having to pay him for \"cheating\". How do you even cheat at eating?\" A small smirk formed on Banagher's face as he remembered how Audrey stood up for him that night. \"I gotta say you can really-Ah!\" Banagher was silenced when Audrey's napkin reached his flabby man boobs. For a brief moment, both were frozen as they looked at the sight of her soft, napkin-covered hand on his squishy man boob. Blushing, words failed both of them. They both knew beforehand that she would obviously have to touch his moobs in order to clean the bits of ice cream on that part of his shirt, but it was still an awkward moment when it happened. The scene was only five seconds but it felt way longer to them. And Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained the ability to move, Audrey hastily cleaned up his chest and then started cleaning his pants, returning to her normal calm speed of cleaning. \"Um, what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just gonna say that you really know how to make yourself look imposing. Being chubby sure hasn't affected you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, though I think that was just my status doing all the work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're tough. Just like -UUUUURP- your dad and Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt embarrassed having such a big smile in front of Banagher. She hoped looking down at the pilot's thighs as she cleaned then kept him from noticing it, she was incorrect. \"Thank you. Oh, you'll have to clean the rest of your pants, I can't reach past your thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" Audrey handed Banagher the napkin and started wiping. He had tl lift his legs up, bending over was way too painful while he was this stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked up at the sky as Banagher cleaned, she saw nothing but dark clouds. \"Looks like -URAP- it's going to rain again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we're dancing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to risk getting distracted. I don't know if you read the details on the map I gave you yet but we're supposed to initiate our part of the plan as soon as it gets dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guards will get suspicious if they see us loitering outside the spaceport. Even my authority -URAP- won't stop them from reporting it to Full Frontal. He might've even chosen to inform them about my disappearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher finished cleaning his pants and boots and handed the napkin back to Audrey, who then cleaned his face. he loved feeling up his round as a pie face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said, showing his appreciation with a smile. He followed it up with a big belch, still smiling. Audrey found it oddly charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" The princess placed the napkin back in he pocket, he would throw it out as soon as she passed a trash can. \"How are you feeling? About the operation, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful. It's the worst kind of dread I've ever felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped into her fist. She apologized with a polite \"Excuse me\", both for the expulsion of gas and for accidentally making Banagher's moment a little harder to take seriously. \"I see. That's natural, it is the first time you knew beforehand that you were going to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, when we get back to the Argama, there's something I need to tell you. It's very important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell me now? We've still got an hour or two until it gets dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to say it when I've got a clear head, I don't need anymore stress and this is something I don't even really understand myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two should be spending this time having fun.\" Haro interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey both smiled at this. \"Yeah, you're -URAP- right.\" The pilot said. \"You wanna do anything or just sit here and chat?\" He asked the Zabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could use a belly rub.\" Audrey then emphasized her point by burping loudly and patting her jiggly stomach. \"And it looks like you could too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I could never turn down a belly rub from you.\" The two started rubbing each other's swollen bellies, moaning in pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one other thing I'd -URRRP- like to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small burp left Banagher's mouth. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we -UUURAAP- could go on a nice walk in the rain, rubbing our stomachs the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for that. UUUUURP! But, well, getting up is going to suck when we're this full.\" He poked his stuffed tummy, it gurgled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot about that.\" The princess looked down at her massive belly that completely covered up her lap and then some, getting up certainly was going to suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey attempted to stand up but her overstuffed belly was giving her a lot of trouble. She had to give up and plop her big butt back down after five seconds. She took a moment to catch her breath, her face a bit red, if there was one positive thing one could say about her attempt, it's that it didn't fail due to a lack of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher tried right after Audrey. He needed a lot of build-up before launching himself off the bench. With an \"Oof\" he landed a good foot away, he turned around, his tummy and in a gelatinous fashion, and offered a hand to his blonde friend, revealing that he was looking a little red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey extended her other and grasped Banagher's soft hand. \"Good thing you're the one doing all the fighting.\" She snarked. With grunting from both parties, she was lifted up, though the momentum was unfortunately uncontrollable, it sent her slamming her right into Banagher, knocking him onto his back, with Audrey right on top of him, belly to belly. Their entire bodies jiggling violently, the duo belched at the same time and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... sucked.\" Right after he said that, Banagher felt a rain drop hit his head, the first of many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Audrey was resting her head on Banagher's shoulder. \"Though snuggling together like this feels, well, rather nice.\" Once she said that, the redness in their cheeks wasn't just from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it really does.\" Banagher gave her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was still skinny, all your fat would've probably shielded me from the impact like a pillow.\" Smiling, she reached down and grabbed handfuls of the pale, creamy fat of her buddy's big gut, making him moan in pleasure. That wasn't the only fun she had with his stomach. For a few minutes she did stuff like grabbing different handfuls of his tummy, shaking it, jiggling it, patting it, and poking it deeply to make him belch. She would playfully say something along the lines of \"Well, excuse you!\" to every belch, always getting a laugh out of Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had her fill, she sloppily rolled off Banagher onto her back. She looked at her stomach, the giant orb was looming over her like an intimidating enemy. \"I can't -UUURP- see my feet. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see mine either. UUUURRP!\" Banagher casually said, the rain starting to pick up, just in time to get the tops of their bellies wet. \"Haro's been staring at us this whole time.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two big bellies bobbed and bounced in the rain with every step their respective owners made, those were the big bellies of Audrey and Banagher. The princess tenderly rubbed her knight's tummy as her knight returned the favor, filling each other with this soothing warmth that told them everything was going to be okay. Both stomachs were absolutely soaked with rain, along with the rest of Audrey and Banagher. The blonde and brunette's hair had lost all their poof, and the color had darkened. Besides their conversations, they mostly only heard belching, the gurgling of their stomachs, moaning, their hands feeling the other's belly, the rain hitting their bodies, ground, and the trees, and the occasional comment from Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell -URAAP- you about the thief on the Argama.\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. UURRRP!\" Banagher was holding Haro by his side, with his jacket covering him. It was a tight fit but even though Haro was water proof, the pilot didn't want to risk anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you were captured, someone comes to the kitchen at night and raids the fridge, I never saw the aftermath but from what I heard the thief eats an obscene amount of food. UUURRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you allowed to pretty much eat all you want before bedtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly it! It's ridiculous that someone could be given so much food and not only be unsatisfied, but so entitled that she would steal even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any suspects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My number one suspect is Riddhe. He's gotten awfully chunky ever since these midnight raids started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, Banagher couldn't see anything about Riddhe that would hint at being greedy enough to steal so much food. He wouldn't call him the most disciplined person he ever met, that's a title that went to his father and Daguza, but he seemed disciplined enough that he wouldn't knowingly cause harm to the ship's crew, especially not over mountains of food not being enough for him. \"UUUUURP! I can't really see him doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have suspected him either had it not been for that huge -UUURRAAP- belly he's sporting. It was definitely big enough, soft enough, and jiggly enough for him to be the culprit. I'm very disappointed in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You felt it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only to emphasize my point. Don't worry, I'll still be giving your belly plenty of attention.\" She playfully patted Banagher's tummy a few times, making it jiggle like jello, Banagher felt himself go red in the face from that, Audrey's face was pretty red too. Just as suddenly as it came, the confidence vanished from the princess, replaced with her usual awkward personality. \"Ahem. That is if you don't mind, of course.\" She avoided eye contact out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a giggle, which suddenly turned into a big burp. \"Of course I don't. I gave you permission to feel my gut whenever you want, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly got darker as they continued their walk, filling them with a sense of growing dread. For once they were glad to have stomachaches that required belly rubs, besides of course that it meant getting their tummies rubbed, it helped distract them from their anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm forgetting something.\" Banagher commented, he would've cupped his double chin in thought if he had any free hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it something you wanted to tell Marida?\" Haro suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm -UUUUURP- I'm pretty sure I told her everything I wanted to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to feel like I'm forgetting something too.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it'll come to us later.\" Banagher then burped. \"By the way, you're not getting cold, -UURP- are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a huge burp, it almost seemed like that was somehow her answer. \"No, your hand is keeping me nice and warm.\" She said as her knight's hand made soothing circles over the middle of her stomach. He suddenly gave the orb a hearty slap, making it jiggle like mad, Audrey watched the way her fat danced from the impact. \"UUUUUURP! How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, you're keeping me-Oh! I just remembered what we forgot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The causal way Audrey said that made it completely clear she was not expecting the way she was about to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot your seat and your normal suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's eyes practically bulged out of her sockets. \"Oh shoot! I left it at the hotel!\" Taking Banagher's hand, she bolted off towards the hotel as fast as she could. Which wasn't very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Slow down, Audrey!\" A caught off-guard Banagher requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, there's no time! UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jiggling both bodies were doing put the dancing Audrey's belly did earlier to shame. Everything from their legs, to their guts, to their boobs, was jiggling and jostling like someone was shaking a tray full of jello. It was so much jiggling it was actually hindering the digestion their stomachs were trying to do, stirring up the gas in their tummies, resulting in lots of belching. Of course there was also lots of sweating and panting, thankfully the decently heavy rain was able to cool them down somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was amazed by how long Audrey kept this up. Sure they weren't going that fast, but by the standards of the incredibly out-of-shape Audrey, this speed and endurance was incredible. The brunette was rather impressed by his chubby friend, he guessed this was the power of determination and an adrenaline rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they barged through the double doors, the duo collapsed on the ground, like a car suddenly losing gas at high speed. They panted heavily, struggling to catch their breaths, feeling like they were about to lose all their food. Perhaps the only thing keeping their upset sounding stomachs from forcing their meals back up was that the duo really didn't want to embarrass themselves in front of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike one would expect, someone saw this and thought the situation was far worse then it seemed. This someone was a bellhop. \"Princess Mineva!\" He exclaimed in worry as he rushed to her side. \"Are you okay? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey panted before she had enough breath to answer. \"I *pant* was in a rush. *pant* *pant* I need you to get something from my *pant* my room.\" She feebly handed the bellhop her room key. \"It's room 7, there's a mobile suit seat -UUUUURP- and a normal suit there.\" She was too exhausted to care that she just belched in front of a total stranger. \"Please get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, your highness. I'll get some water for you and your friend too.\" Said friend was laying flat on his back, the way his gut stood into the air highlighting how massive it was. He belched loudly, making the bellhop wonder how someone as polite as the princess could be friends with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time they spent waiting for the bellhop to return was a merciful break between the two periods of movement they would have to make, the one they had just performed and the one they would have to perform once they had everything they needed. Once he returned with what he said he would, Audrey and Banagher promptly gulped down three fourths of the bottles of water he had given them. They needed rest of that and another full bottle before they were ready to leave, the bellhop helped them get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe start of Operation Billiard would be announced with rumbling to the people in Palau, and with flashes to those outside of it. At 6 PM sharp, a series of bombs planted by ECOAS' mobile suits on the connecting shafts of Palau would detonate, these explosives were specifically placed to insure damage would only be done to the industrial sector and not the civilian sector. Once that had occurred, the Nahel Argama would fire it's Hyper Mega Particle Cannon at the base, pushing the two halves in the type of effect the operation was named after. Not only would the collision crush some of the Neo-Zeon mobile suits and ships, it would also push Neo-Zeon into a panic, forcing a hasty response out of them. Full Frontal would undoubtedly remain as calm as ever, but the initial period of chaos before he could give orders would be massive advantage, one that would allow Banagher and Audrey (and Haro) to escape with the Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, they were doing their part as best as they could in their bloated states. They were running even slower this time, in Banagher's case this was partly because he had to carry the (admittedly lighter then it looked) chair while Audrey had the easy job of carrying the normal suit and Haro, which was Banagher's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're *pant* almost there *pant*, right?\" Audrey groaned, for once she couldn't wait to be in a mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah *pant*, I recognize this street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were jiggling as abundantly as they were before, their tummies and faces glistening with a combination of rain and sweat. The Vist find himself staring at the Zabi's jiggling form, there was something so mesmerizing about the way her meaty legs jostled, her belly bobbed up and down, and her big tits bounced. It reminded him of the girls in Super Robot Wars and the way their boobs would bounce during the animations, only Audrey was fat, yet that seemed to just make the sight even cuter and hotter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta snap out of it. This isn't the time to appreciate how cute Audrey is.\" He thought. That was when his watch started beeping. He felt his heart race even more. He already knew what this meant but he had to see it anyways. He pulled his sleeve up and saw the numbers on his watch: 6 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's started.\"</span></div></div>",

Inertial flight!\" Otto ordered. \"Transfer all power to the Hyper Mega Particle Cannon!\" He looked at the ever larger sight of Palau. \"We've only got one shot at this.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disperse Minovsky Particles at combat density!\" Liam order with just as power as the actual captain of the ship. \"Mobile suit corp launch in sequence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the hanger, Takuya and Micott watched at the mobile suits ascended up to the catapult deck. Some of them they had worked on, some of them would soon vanish along with their pilots. It was a bittersweet feeling for them, to see machines they had worked on, piloted by people they had gotten to know, march off to war. It was what they had been preparing for, and they had all been deemed ready for it. But some of them were going to simply be unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya rested a rand on a solemn-looking Micott's shoulder. \"Don't worry. Banagher, Audrey, Haro, Riddhe, they're all gonna be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to enthusiastically agree with him, but ell, after everything they had seen and been through, it was hard. \"I hope so.\" Then she remembered the conversation she had with Audrey. \"No, you're right. This is all going to work out. I saw the look in Audrey's eyes, she's bringing Banagher and Haro back with her, and Riddhe going to be helping them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit. But I don't get why looking at her eyes makes you so sure. Is that a girls' thing or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so clueless.\" Micott bluntly said before she turned around and started walking towards a hallway, treating Takuya to the sight of her humongous bubble butt that bobbed and bounced with every step, a sight complemented by the jostling of her thick legs. \"Let's get a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get girls.\" Takuya lamented before he joined her. Their normal suits were already tight on their rotund forms, and Takuya had a feeling they were about to get even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two machines to rise to the catapult deck where a Prototype Stark Jegan and Riddhe's Delta Plus. \"I'd like to think all those sparring matches prepared me for this, but I know even wit the Delta Plus this is going to take all I've got.\" He looked at Palau, he could see a little of his tummy even as he looked forward, he still wasn't quite used to that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Nahel Argama flew towards Palau via inertia, a small bit of debris struck close to the bridge. It wasn't big enough to cause any damage but it was enough to give a bit of a shake. Mihiro let out a small shriek, she felt her entire body jiggle form it. She shot her fat stomach a glare and grabbed a handful of it through her tight normal suit, even through the materiel of it she could feel the softness of her tummy. \"Damn it.\" She muttered. \"At least seeing Banagher's boulder of a gut will make me feel less fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insanity!\" Alberto loudly shrieked, a shriek everyone did their best to ignore. Mihiro did the best at ignoring him, as she had a belly to be mad at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyper Mega Particle Cannon ready to fire!\" The helmsmen announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare to attack once we've reached the designated point!\" Otto said, he then looked at Mihiro to order her specially. \"And remind all friendly suits to stay clear of our line of fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro let go and looked away from her stomach and at her captain. \"Yes sir.\" She looked down at her console, making her double chin more pronounced. \"Bridge to all mobile suits. We are about to fire the hyper mega particle cannon. All friendly mobile suits, evacuate out field of fire. I repeat all -UUUUURRRP-!\" Blushing like Audrey at her most embarrassed, Mihiro instinctively slapped her hands over mouth. Hastily turning her communicators back off, her eyes were then drawn to the cause of her gaseous eruption, an almost empty can of soda on her console. She inwardly chastised herself for drinking it right before an operation, she prayed Riddhe and the others would let her live this down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the guards having left the port to participate in the fight, Banagher and Audrey made into the port with no issues besides their exhaustion, and even that wasn't that big of a deal anymore, as they gotten to the zero gravity section. In order to go to one's desired space gate, one would need to use a jetpack-like device to reach it. Multiple racks of this device were available at the end of the hallway Audrey and Banagher were currently in. Banagher had plenty of experience with this device, he had to use them plenty of times at his old job of clearing space debris at Industrial 7. Pulling out one of these devices reminded him of that job, he wondered if all the others were back to work there. He frowned when he realized they might've come to the logical conclusion that he, Micott, and Takuya were dead. If that was the case they were sure to be shocked when they saw them again, not just because they were alive, but also because they had gotten so damn fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one device for himself, Banagher pulled out another for Audrey and handed it to her. \"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey pointed out something Banagher hadn't considered. \"I don't know how to use this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's not that hard, just a little tricky at first. I'll teach you.\" Banagher then began to put his on, putting the harness on was easy enough, if very uncomfortable for his squished moobs, but the belt part was another story. The poor guy grunted as he tried to clasp it together but his gut simply wouldn't allow that to happen. He sucked in his gut as hard as he could but it still wasn't enough, the blubbery ball was a great wall between the two halves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey wasn't doing too better. Not only was it EXTREMELY uncomfortable to have that strap press down so much on her big boobs, which she had a bit of struggle even getting it on like that, but she had the same problem with the belt portion. Her tummy wasn't as big as Banagher's it sure as Hell was still big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Fit, damn it!\" Banagher grunted as he tried to force the clasp past his plentiful fat, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did not come this far just for our stomachs to stop us!\" Audrey sucked in her tummy but it didn't go back far enough for the halves of her belt to meet. She soon had to give up and release a breath of air, her tummy coming flopping out and pushing back what little progress she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro was just floating by the whole time, watching his friends grunt and belch as they fought their soft blubber. Sometimes they would try to push in their stomachs, usually causing a belch int he process, and then quickly clip the belt together, which always failed, as their stomachs came flopping out too fast. Many loud belches escaped their mouths, a result of all the pressure that was being put on their rumbling tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURP!\" Audrey belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" UUUUURAAP!\" Banagher complimented, still looking and sounding frustrated despite the positivity of his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too!\" Audrey returned the compliment, sounding and looking just as frustrated as Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tummies were jiggling and jostling the whole time from all the frantic movements, almost as much as if the two were shaking their bellies for fun again. Though fun was the last word they would use to describe this, and you could tell from just their faces. They were red in the face, due to a combination of exhaustion and embarrassment, and wore frustrated expressions that were rendered cute and dorky from how chubby their faces were and the belching fits they were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pushed and pushed against their big bellies, feeling how incredibly soft and malleable they were, the added pressure making them belch up a storm. Eventually Audrey was miraculously able to clip her belt together, it was a very tight squeeze and cut painfully into her tummy. She wasted no time and moved the belt down off her belly, letting it come bulging out and hang freely, grazing the control pad. She sighed in relief. \"I got it! UUUURP! How about -URP you?\" She said as she grabbed Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still haven't -UUURRP- got it!\" Since he had the bigger belly of the two, Banagher was having bigger trouble. Banagher and Audrey need to search for a bigger version</span></div></div>",

A handful of of Neo-Zeon soldiers were instantly vaporized as their mobile suits were caught in the blast, not intentionally, that was simply the power of the blast.

Once the beam had hit it's target, more mobile suits were crushed by the larger pieces of debris, or torn apart by multiple smaller ones. While their deaths weren't painless like the others, they at least had the dignity of knowing what killed them and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of the beam caused the two halves of Palau t slam into each other, sending the civilian population and even most of Neo-Zeon into a terrified panic. Yet despite this, there were a few people closer to the effects then anyone else, and yet showed no fear even as their machines shook from the intense vibrations. This was the ECOAS unit, their Lotos standing primed and ready on the surface on the asteroid. \"You better be there, son, I'm coming to get you.\" For people like Daguza, the intense damage and chaos the blast caused was just a signal for him to head to the next point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before the beam was fired, Marida was involved in something much more mundane on the outskirts of Palau airspace, sitting in the cockpit of the Kshatriya, her giant butt and meaty legs making the chair a very tight squeeze for her. No, patrol wasn't what she dealing with, she was still on patrol duty but that wasn't her main focus. What was was giving herself a much needed belly rub through the tight materiel of her normal suit and burping up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURP! Ooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor young woman was tempted to take her helmet off and unzip her normal suit, both so she could better rub her tummy and ease the aching going on inside it and so her gut would have all the freedom it needed. As much as she wanted to make her belly as comfortable as possible, she knew it was too dangerous, sure it was unlikely that she would get attacked but it was still a risk he couldn't take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead sighed and then let out one of her biggest belches that day, it was so loud it actually surprised her. \"UUUUUUURP!\" Blushing and raising a hand to her mouth in surprise, she was glad she had turned her microphone off, both because command and the other patrol units would not want to hear it, but also because it would be highly embarrassing, Banagher was the only one allowed to hear her belch. \"Banagher probably would've complimented me if he heard that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down past her massive tits and at her humongous tummy, perhaps her biggest and toughest enemy yet. Her normal suit was so tight one could still make out her cavernous bellybutton. She gave he belly a big slap, even dressed like she was, it still sent her stomach jiggling. \"UUURRRAP! Poor Banagher, all alone with a massive stomachache and no one to rub his belly. I'll have to give him the best big sister -UUUURRP- belly rubs I can as soon as I get home.\" Her stomach gurgle loudly, she clutched the massive orb in pain as she desperately tried to rub the pain away. \" Urgh! While he -URAAP- rubs my stomach too. UUUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the aching settled down and Marida felt drowsiness overcome her. She had been feeling drowsy for half an hour by now but she had been fighting it the whole time, as she was determined to not slack off on duty. In fact, she pretty much never slacked off, the only time she ever did was when she was incredibly stuffed and on the verge of a food coma, and even then it was never willingly. And that was the exact situation she was in now. Her eyelids grew heavy despite her efforts to stay awake. As she started to feel slumber overtake her, she figured that since she couldn't stop herself, she might as well enjoy her nap, she knew Banagher would definitely agree with her on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her eyes close but that was only a very brief rest. Just ten seconds later was when Palau was hit. She could feel all the panic and chaos of her fellow citizens of Palau hit her like the beam that hit Palau itself. her eyes instantly shot open and all her drowsiness vanished. \"Master! UUUURRRP! Banagher!\" She gripped the controls and turned the Kshatriya to Palau, flying at the top speed the machine could manage. She checked her fuel levels, at around 95%, it was slightly less full then Marida herself. More importantly, that was way more then enough fuel needed for her to reach Palau and fight without having to waste time refueling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled sickly. \"Grgh! UUURRAAP!\" Marida grunted as she clutched her upset stomach with one hand, still continuing to control her mobile suit. As much as her big gut hurt, she wasn't going to let it get in the way of protecting her \"master\" and Banagher. Not one bit. She applied all the rubbing she could with one hand and belched many times, even forcing a few out with a slap or a poke, to get as much gas out as she could. To someone like Marida, it didn't feel weird to apply tactics to belly rubbing and belching. Once her stomach settled down, she removed her hand and gripped the part of the controls her hand had let go of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocks and other debris were speeding towards the military port facilities, dooming many of the ships stationed there. In order to at least save the mobile suits, any inside the ships were ordered to immediately leave and move into combat. Most of the mobile suits were able to escape in time but nearly every ship stationed there at the time was crushed, along with the crew inside. Some were destroyed by other ships being knocked into them from the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the teams that managed to escape rushed out in a panic, with no plan beyond killing any Federation machine they see, just as ECOAS planned. One team consisted of four Geara Dogas and a Dreissen. The leader, a pilot of a Geara Doga Commander Type, was in front of his team, feeling it was his duty as the leader to take the most dangerous position in a time like this. But even he had no idea how quickly he would be killed. Just seconds after he entered the open, his team not far behind, a shot completely knocked off his machine's right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What did that?! There's no one here!\" He moved his machine towards his right, where the shot had come from. Zooming in on what he correctly suspected was the firing point, he could just barely make out what was two Lotos equipped with Long Cannons. Before he could say anything more, the Lotos began firing again, wiping out the all entire team in short order, leaving only one Geara Doga and the Dreissen. They didn't last much longer, as a team of Jegans and ReZELs led by Shin began firing upon them from the left, destroying the last Geara Doga and grazing the Dreissen's right shoulder. The Dreissen's pilot spotted Shin's gold mobile suit but just two seconds after he did, Shin had closed the gap between them and cut the Dreissen in half with his machine's Beam Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza's Loto stood outside of the tunnel that the Unicorn was to escape through, a hole not too far from a depressurized part of spaceport that no one had ever bothered to fill up with any sort of machinery. It as thanks to the keen eyes of the spy ECOAS had stationed on Palau, for months at this point, that this hole was Incorporated into the escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're two minutes past the scheduled rendezvous and there's still no signs of the target.\" Conroy informed Daguza, he was in the same Loto as as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, where the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're okay down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to read a map while I'm carrying all this stuff but I'll manage.\" Audrey really was given a difficult task. Reading a map while holding it, Haro, a chair, a normal suit, a helmet, and Banagher's leg was harder then it sounds, and it sounds pretty damn hard to start with. AND that's all while trying to avoid being distracted by the panicked workers in the port. Banagher wished he could give her a hand but even in zero gravity, his stomach was big enough that it would always be touching the control pad, or at least blocking it, unless he had it lifted with one hand. \"The map says the entrance is the second left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the sign for it.\" The \"it\" in question was the 14th space gate, according to the map, the Unicorn was shortly past it's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd shortly past it's entrance it was, they came across it, placed in a mobile suit cage on the ceiling, so soon it actually surprised them. Adjusting his pack so it would leave them floating in front of the center of the Unicorn, both he and Audrey gazed upon it. \"What are you doing here?\" The brunette asked the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey contemplatively raised an eyebrow. \"This doesn't feel right. It's placed so obviously, the cockpit is open, I don't see anywhere a guard could've been placed, and it's shield and gun are still with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get what you mean.\" He looked under where the Beam Magnum was placed. \"I didn't have that gatling gun when I was captured, Zeon had that put there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full Frontal wants you in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, we don't have a choice. It's not safe for the Argama and ECOAS if we stay. Not me, not you, not Haro,\" He looked up at the Unicorn's masked face, the Gundam almost looked like it was placed in an unwilling sleep. \"and certainly not him.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the objective of preventing Neo-Zeon's advance, the Stark Jegans of the Nahel Argama fired a barrage of missiles into the field. Two of these three were the regular Stark Jegan model, their missiles were large but meant for mobile suit combat, but the third one was different. It was the prototype version, a version superior in a few ways and inferior in a few others. The prototype had less pieces of armor but each piece was stronger then the ones the regular version had. The biggest difference however were the four large anti-ship missiles it carried, each one capable of producing a blast larger then all six of the standard type, a single one able to destroy a whole ship. These differences made it more expensive to produce then the standard version, and it was this reason, along with the fact that it was a two seater, that caused it to be produced in even more limited numbers then the standard version. However, an operation like Operation Billiard was exactly the type of mission that called for the prototype version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blasts created orbs of fire that prevented Neo-Zeon form advancing form that side. The goal wasn't exactly to destroy them, that would be a happy coincidence, it was merely to push two bits of Palau together in another billiard effect. Instead of a massive hole, all they could out from this side was now mere cracks. The first two that made it out were a Gaza D and Dra-C, painted in green and pink retrospectively as their new Sleeves colors. They didn't last long, the Dra-C was picked off almost immediately by a Mega Machine Cannon armed Loto, it's many shots tearing the pink machine to shreds. The Gaza D did a little better, it's pilot used the explosion of his friend's mobile suit as camouflage and then fired at the Loto. Despite what one would naturally assume from it's Guntank-like appearance, the Loto was a nimble machine. It's thrusters moved it to it's right, almost looking like it was skating, and fired all four of the missiles in it's right Missile Container. The Gaza D got off another shot as it tried to doge, but such efforts were in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Geara Zulu that had arrived from the left side of the battlefield opened fire on the Loto, which quickly evaded the shots as the ECOAS pilot moved it to higher ground. That Geara Zulu wasn't the only Neo-Zeon suit to come from that direction, he was part of an entire wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Jegans were attacked by another Gaza D and a Geara Doga, the Jegans were about to return fire when the Zeta Buster quickly appeared and destroyed both Zeon suits with it's beam Saber just as suddenly as it appeared. \"Looks like their command structure's been reestablished, Full Frontal will be here any moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a big event, Full Frontal's arrival was so subtle. An ECOAS team inside one of the Lotos taking potshots saw a red afterimage, one of them could only let out a panicked \"A red mobile suit?!\" before the Sinanju quickly closed the distance between them and stabbed the machine in it's chest. The team inside the LOTO next it saw this and was about to open fire on the red machine, only for a green light to envelop them as Angelo impaled them with the beam spike on his Geara Zulu's Beam Tomahawk. Seeing that Angelo's job was done, Full Frontal had his machine look back at the seemingly defeated Loto, it suddenly extended it's Beam Burner at the blond's mobile suit. He effortless dodged it and grabbed, bending it. \"That's odd, I couldn't have possibly missed the cockpit... Oh, I see now. A mobile suit manned by a small ECOAS team, allowing it to serve as a command hub and an infiltration unit. Well done, ECOAS, well done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sick as Angelo was feeling, piloting a mobile suit while stuffed to the brim was NOT a comfortable feeling, the sight of his captain's magnificent skills made it so easy to ignore that sickness. He burped and then turned his mic back on, using this brief break from combat as a chance to rub his tummy. \"Captain, I can't get a read on the size of the enemy force. Even taking-Excuse me for a moment.\" He hit mute again to let out a few small belches. Once that was done, he was disappointed his belches weren't bigger but he figured he just needed to do some training once this was over, he turned his mic on again. \"Even taking this fraction into consideration, it's far too small to capture Palau.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking at this from the wrong perspective. Their goal isn't to capture Palau, it's to capture the Unicorn. This force is large enough to create an opening to reclaim the target. It's just as expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant, why do you keep turning your microphone on and off? And for that matter, why are you set to voice only?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that unusual conversation went on, two Jegans were destroyed by a pincer attack coming from above and below as Neo-Zeon forces arrived from those directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juliet 005 laser signal terminated!\" Mihiro sadly confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Multiple enemy contacts! Friendly suits are being surrounded!\" The sensor operator called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a relatively inexperienced captain, Otto seemed unfazed. \"Send in our own escort units to back them up! And take us in as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anti-air defenses open fire! Release dummy asteroids!\" Liam added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any word from ECOAS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Communication is still dark.\" This bit of news from Mihiro left Otto visibly frustrated. This operation was to completed in thirty minutes at the latest, ECOAS should've gotten back to them by now. \"Can we hang on that long?\" He thought, he was fairly certain the delay wasn't due to the ECOAS team being annihilated, Neo-Zeon would have to look pretty hard to find them even in a peaceful situation. Regardless, this was a situation that would require them to time their retreat perfectly, and as much as Otto would hate to abandon ECOAS, Banagher, and the princess, failing to retreat at the proper time could cost the entire crew their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We walked right into their trap!\" Alberto shouted, slamming his fist onto his chair's armrest as he angrily flailed about. \"They anticipated everything we were gonna do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain! I'm reading a new com signal from Palau!\" All eyes and ears were now honed in on Mihiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it ECOAS?\" Liam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, it's not ECOAS!\" She silently worked on the communications panel until she got the best read possible. \"It's the Gundam!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Unicorn Gundam flew through a large hole in Palau, having just entered a part of it that was exposed to the outside, letting him see what was going on, like raising the blinders on a window after waking up. \"They're not attacking with much, are they?\" This brought some relief to Banagher, the smaller the battle the better for everyone. Though there was another battle he had attend to, the battle going on in Audrey's stomach.  \"How are you holding up?\" He turned his focus to his suffering soulmate, who looked like she was about to vomit all over the place. One hand held Haro and the other clutched her gurgling belly and trendily rubbed it, groans and burps of a troubled tummy leaving her lips.. \"UUURRRAP! I'm alright, don't mind me.\" Her abdomen looked like it was rising and dropping in a painful manner, her eyes were widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. UUURRRP! Just let me know if you need a break.\" He returned his focus as best as he could to piloting and had the Unicorn resume moving. He looked back at the sight of the battlefield the opening in this part of Palau had given him, he was mainly trying to find one specific thing. \"It's the Nahel Argama.\" However, the Unicorn wasn't alone in that tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Federation mobile suit?! You won't escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn alerted Banagher to the presence of an enemy machine above them. Looking up, he dodged the shot that would've hit him otherwise, flipping the Unicorn over (much to Audrey and Banagher's discomfort) to see who his opponent was: An AMX-009 Dreissen that was aiming his Giant Bazooka. The machine fired again and again, Banagher electing to go on the defensive, holding the Unicorn's shield up to cover himself from the shots and he moved backwards. Both shots missed but hit the bottom of the tunnel, the blast kicking up rubble that the Unicorn's shield protected itself from, as well as the flare of the blast itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one-eyed machine fired again, this shot landing particularly close to the Unicorn, the blast and debris sending vibrations to it's enemy. Those vibrations traveled from the Unicorn to Audrey and Banagher, their bodies briefly jiggling from them, it made both feel even more queasy, Audrey more-so, who was worried that she was about to vomit. \"Stop!\" Banagher cried out, he knew there was no way for the pilot hear him but his desperation forced those words out of his mouth. Without even thinking to, his hands began preparing to fire on the enemy and removed the safety on his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back her nausea, Audrey leaned over and began working on the Unicorn's communications system, leaving Haro to float aimlessly. \"I'll switch us to Palau's frequency. Don't worry, I have it memorized.\" Thick densities of Minovsky Particles prevent communications via radio, except for those from a command center like a battleship, however close enough proximity would allow communications between mobile suits under even the harshest of conditions. \"We're good! UUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please -UURAAAP- stop! I don't want to fight you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis plea fell on deaf ears, the Neo-Zeon pilot continued firing and the Unicorn dodged once more. \"Good! Now stand still and let me kill ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast again sent vibrations to the overweight duo's jiggly bodies. \"All this shaking is making me sick.\" Her stomach matched her groans. Were her visor not down, the princess would've held a hand over mouth in case she felt it all coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pressed for the Unicorn to fire but there was only the worrying sound of a click. \"Come on!\" He kept pressing the button in frustration, each time he still only got the same frustrating click. He looked to the weapon screen on his left, it showed that the Beam Gatling Gun wasn't finished installing yet, only at 63%. Now 75%. Another missed shot, more nauseating vibrations, this time the worst yet. \"C'mon, hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt her cheeks bulge up. Eyes widened in worry, she had no choice but to raise her visor and slap a hand over her mouth, looking down her free side, like someone about to vomit over a bridge. Banagher looked at her in sympathy but had no chose to quickly return his attention to the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dreissen's main weapon was out of ammo. In a manner that made it look as frustrated as it's pilot, the descendant of the Dom tossed it aside and yanked out it's Heat Saber. However, it's Giant bazooka wasn't ti's only raged weapon, as the pilot sent out it's two Tri-Blades, one having to be sacrificed for the Heat Saber to have a slot. Those blades rushed at the Unicorn, both fended off with it's shield, the second one putting up much more of a fight. Once again, the poor, unfortunately-jiggly duo was sent unpleasant vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Haro could hear Audrey's groans of discomfort, the blonde removed her hand, all three parties in the Unicorn expecting huge amounts of vomit to come flying out of her mouth. Only for a giant belch to fly out instead. \"UUUUURRRP!\" She slumped back in her chair, her boobs and belly jiggling greatly, Haro and Banagher looked at her as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -URAP- okay?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine.\" She lowered her visor, she looked exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was starting to think it might be better for her sake if she just let it all out. Regardless of Audrey's condition, he returned his focus back to the fight. \"You have to let me go! If you don't the Federation will keep attacking! Do you want to turn Palau into a battlefield?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're why Palau's being attacked in the first place! I'll make you pay!\" His machine readied it's 3-barrel Beam Cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey leaned over as much as her bloated middle would allow. \"I'm-I am the person you know as Mineva -UURRRAP- Lao -UUUURP- Zabi! UUUURP! I am in this mobile suit and I demand you stand down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words were the first to give him pause. \"The princess?! Just hold on while I deal with this Earthnoid scum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been captured, I am aiding this pilot's escape! Now stand down or he will crush you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You've betrayed us?! Damn you!\" Enraged even further, the soldier of Zeon fired on the Unicorn with the three beam cannon equipped on his Dreissen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Unicorn's shield as a protective wall against the shots, Banagher winced screamed at the chaos, here the weapon screen beeped, announcing that the gatling gun was fully installed and ready to fire. Angry and gritting his teeth, Banagher pressed for the Unicorn to fire, and fire it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shots tore his enemy to shreds, piece by piece, yet the enemy pilot seemed to not care, he kept firing, not even bothering to try evading or guarding. It scared Banagher how similar it looked, the way chunks of it were torn off it in rapid succession, to an actual human being ripped apart by a gatling gun. It was mercy when the machine finally exploded after five seconds of constitutive firing, a fate sealed in less time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't you listen?!\" </span></div></div>",

He wasn't expecting someone to chime in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" The one who chimed in was Travis, his ZII just floating near Riddhe's Delta Plus. They were two of the crew members given the duty of guarding the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always pull through, it's in my nature. And that luck rubs onto whoever's with me.\" The next part he said notably more quietly, not like he was trying to hide it, more like he didn't care if anyone heard it. \"Not everyone though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis talk of luck brought Riddhe's eyes down to the good luck charm wrapped around his pudgy wrist: a bracelet with a miniature biplane attached, he remembered building it with his father, a sign of the times they spent putting model planes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm picking up five heat signatures!\" Those words from the sensor operator indicated the time for chit-chat was over. \"They're coming straight from Palau!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are any of them the Red Comet?\" Riddhe asked, this newest wave was too far away for his machine to identify them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, they're coming in too slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this'll be easy.\" Riddhe cockily said, an emotion Travis quickly shot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it won't. That's less then they sent last time, if more didn't work, why send less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they thought they weakened us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't lose anyone, they wouldn't get cocky from making us waste ammo.\" That was when he it hit him. He zoomed in as much as he could at the soon upon-them team. It consisted of one green Geara Doga, two Dra Cs, and far more importantly, two blue mobile suits. One a Commander type Geara Doga painted in blue with a wolf on it's chest, and the other the machine known as the Pale Rider. \"Vincent!\" Travis looked the most serious he had ever since arriving on the Nahel Argama. \"Do whatever you want with the others but leave the blue Geara Doga to me!\" Unlike Audrey, Travis didn't know the frequency his son was using, and since they were in space, he couldn't simply use his machine's speaker like before. The only option this left him with was to establish a connection by physically touching Vincent's Geara Doga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team defending the Nahel Argama consisted of eight units: Four Jegans, three ReZELs, Riddhe's Delta Plus, and Travis' ZII. Were the Pale Rider not involved, getting to Vincent would be relatively easy with this set up. WITH the Pale Rider however, this was the bare minimum he would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teams about to engage, Riddhe's switched the Delta Plus into it's Waverider mode. He quickly closed the gap between him and the green Geara Doga, the machine seeming to share it's pilot's surprise, and ejected one of it's Beam Sabers, transformed, grabbed it with one hand while the other held the Beam Rifle, and quickly slashed off both is opponent's arms as they gripped it's firing Beam Machine Gun, all without losing any momentum but causing much jiggling to his tummy. \"That should give you an excuse, now go home!\" His computer alerted him to the two Dra Cs closing in on him. One charged close to him, hoping to fire it's gatling gun at point blank range, but the Delta plus' quick mobility allowed it to dodge both it and the other's one fire and retaliate with a slash to the first one's shoulder, disconnecting the entire arm that held the weapon. Continuing to ddge the second's one's attack, he fired his Beam Rifle in it's Guillotine Burst mode, slashing off the binders of the other and causing an explosion that knocked it away. \"Now for the blue one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to it, he saw it using INCOM units, six of them, in an attempt to destroy the defending force, with Vincent providing supporting fire. The pale machine seemingly burning like last time, it's INCOMs destroyed one of the Jegans in three shots, then moved onto the next one, who lost it's right arm and left leg, only being spared because the Pale Rider had to dodge incoming fire, movements it performed seemingly without effort. A ReZEL pilot had almost completely forgotten about the other blue machine and was unable to defend himself in time when he saw it about to slam it's Beam Sword-Axe into the ReZEL's chest. Seeing this as his chance to make contact, Travis carelessly rushed towards him. An ignorant Vincent saw this and pulled back, switching to his Beam Machine Gun and opening fire, Travis dodged those shots but noticed a beam from the Pale Rider's hyper Knuckle Buster too soon. He dodged it but the shot still hit the thruster on the ZII's right leg, the explosion knocking the machine away. He might've been finished off if the rest of the Defense team didn't force Vincent and the pale Rider to return their attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hit the Geara Doga!\" Travis shouted, his eyes locked on it's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not aiming for the cockpit!\" Riddhe informed. He fired another shot, a shot the Pale Rider's partner dodged. Riddhe thought he was damn lucky the team's attention was split between him and the Pale Rider, otherwise he would've been killed a dozen times over by now. Even without the others saying so, Riddhe had zero doubt he and Travis were the only ones not aiming to kill Vincent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dying for a damn terrorist!\" A Jegan's pilot shouted out. His shield was then torn to shred by the Pale Rider's Tri-Blades. The Pale Rider was about to finish it off with it's Beam Sabers, already perilously close, but was stopped by a ReZEL that blocked the would-be fatal attack by locking blades with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target sighted!\" Conroy informed Daguza, their radar picking up on it as it reached the rendezvous point in the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, send a message to the Argama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it.\" Conroy then set up the connection, battleships being one of the few things a mobile suit could communicate with despite a heavy amount of Minovsky Particles, even far away, \"729 here, target 1 retrieved. We'll confirm if target 2 is with it. If it is then we'll depart shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis message made it clearly to the bridge of the Nahel Argama, where Mihiro informed Otto of it's contents. \"Captain, we've received a message from ECOAS! They've rendezvoused with the Gundam and will return soon.\" The officer chose that choice of words as she knew that Banagher wouldn't even consider leaving Palau if Audrey wasn't already with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally we can get out of here!\" Alberto reclined in his chair, probably the first sign of relief he had shown all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, we might need it to fend off the Pale Rider! Tell them to be ready for a fight when they get back!\" Otto commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I tell everyone to return?\" Mihiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Otto could reply, Liam interjected. \"Not yet, that'll just draw enemy forces here. Wait until the Unicorn is closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's exactly what I was gonna say.\" Otto claimed, which would've elicited a sigh from Mihiro were Alberto not there to make her sigh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And I was just about to come around to that line of reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConroy and Daguza's Loto received the message just as the Unicorn reached them. \"There you are, is the Zabi with you?\" Daguza questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, a visibly stressed out Banagher was rubbing poor Audrey's tummy. \"Her name is -UUUUURRP- Audrey! And yes, she is.\" Audrey burped and then moaned cutely as the pilot said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's time to leave. We have a route planned that'll keep us away from most of the fighting. I can't guarantee we won't see any combat though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Match your speed with ours, Banagher.\" The Loto began moving as Conroy said that, the Unicorn following it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all better be worth it.\" Banagher muttered, only Audrey and Haro heard him, the princess would shortly then speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURP! Excuse me.\" Or rather, belch and then speak up. \"Banagher, Daguza was one of the most vocal supporters for the Argama rescuing you, rather then reaching Luna 2 and waiting however long it takes for the Federation to mount a rescue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He -URAP- He did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He called it a hostage rescue operation, he said everyone on that ship owed it to you to get you out of here. I'm not sure if the captain would've agreed to the operation were it not for him, Conroy, and Alberto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might say it was just to acquire the Unicorn, and you might think that was why he did it, but I assure you he did it because he truly felt it was his duty as a person to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mr. Daguza, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConroy looked over at his commander, he seemed to have the same stern look on his face, but Conroy was sure what was he feeling was anything but sternness. All this time as a soldier of the Federation, one truly trusted to obey any order given, a man who had even given up the life of a family man for the sake of it, and this was the first time he had even been \"Thank you\" because of something he did, truly told that, by a member of the naive population. \"... I'm a cog in the machine called the Federation, I'm not allowed to have a sense of self, an ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even back then I understood that once you step into a mobile suit, you're a combat unit.\" He thought of those similar words, and thought on how similar their eyes were. Cold and hollow, like they led to a dark cave that never ended. \"No, that's wrong... Everyone has an ego.\" The Kshatriya intercepts the Unicorn</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Don't die before your old man does.\" Thinking back on that day, Travis charged his ZII straight at the Geara Doga that housed his son. \"Vincent!\" His only defense from the firing of it's weapon was his machine's left arm. Even as the shots chewed it up, along with parts of it's head and chest, he kept pushing on, until he truly, finally reached him. One machine grabbed hold of the other as the momentum pushed them on. \"Vincent, is that you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you-Father?!\"  He felt goosebumps on his meaty back, his pudgy hands subconsciously gripping the controls harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you!\" Relief shined on his dad's full face. \"It took me a long time but I finally fulfilled my promise! Now let's get out of her before you break yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any reply, he couldn't see his son's face but he looked incredibly guilty. \"Vincent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? We've both been waiting for this, haven't we?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" He shouted, but his next words sounded far more defeated. \"But... But there's someone who needs me. She's not well, the Sleeves are the only ones I can trust to get her the medicine she needs. I can't trust the Federation to give it and I won't abandon her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis gritted his teeth. For so long finding his son felt like trying to find one specific grain of sand in a desert. Now it was like there was this clear cage separating him from his son, he could see him right there but there was no guarantee he would be able to open the cage. \"Then we'll find it for her! I've still got Diver, Hire, and Bomber! We all know all sorts of people, we'll find it for her, no doubt! Now just come with me!\" Before he could hear an answer from his son, his computer warned on the quickly approaching Pale Rider, a yellow Beam Saber in each hand. \"Damn! Not now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat his computer couldn't tell him was that Riddhe had a lock on the Pale Rider. \"Got you!\" He clicked and the Delta Plus fired it's Beam Rifle, a shot that would've been fatal were it not for the borderline inhuman reaction speed the Pale Rider's pilot had. The machine dodged, but in their worry, the pilot didn't realize this meant the shot would instead hit Vincent's machine instead. Fortunately the shot only hit it's right thigh, cutting of the entire leg from the rest of the mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seeming burning the pale machine did evaporated in an instant. It dropped it's Beam Sabers and instead used a bare hand to rip the ZII away from the blue machine, then grabbed hold of the Geara Doga and sped off as fast as it's thrusters would allow. \"Vincent!\" Travis tried to keep up with them but every passing second away from them evaporated more of Travis' belief that he could catch up while his machine was missing a thruster. \"Damn it!\" He stopped the ZII dead in it's tracks and slammed his fist on the armrest until his the rage was replaced by sorrow. \"Damn it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Enemy sighted right up ahead! It's a Geara Doga, he'll notice us any second, we're gonna have to take him out.\" Conroy announced, Daguza preparing to fire a Missile Container at the upcoming target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's grip on the controls tightened. \"We're -URP- so close to the Argama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conserve your ammo, Banagher. The Loto can handle this.\" Said the third crew member on the Loto, his role was that of the the vehicle commander: The one who would drive the machine when it was in it's tank mode. ironically, the one boasting of the Loto's skills didn't actually have to do anything right now. Unlike Daguza and Conroy, he didn't have a face or a voice Banagher recognized, so he come to the correct assumption that he was part of the reinforcements that joined the Argama after he was kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the Loto could fire, the strangest thing happened. He turned around, looked at the Unicorn briefly, like it was doing a headcount, and then just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did he -UUUUURP- give up already?\" Normally Banagher would've felt relived, but the oddity of how this soldier behaved, especially compared to the far more ferocious pilot of the Dreissen, prevented him feeling like a fight had just been avoided and a life saved. The way he left didn't even seem to give an aura of fear, it was more like he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrorists almost never give up so easily, even when it's clear they're about to die.\" Daguza's statement made Banagher flashback to the encounter in the tunnel, something a concerned Audrey noticed just by looking at him. \"Something's wrong, keep your guard up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sudden sensation they felt put one thought on the minds of both Audrey and Banagher. \"Marida?\" Banagher uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's coming from above!\" Conroy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnels! Move! UUUUURRP!\" Audrey shouted, very glad that she was able to keep her belch down until after she said that. She was not going to let her eating habits impede her ability to warn others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Loto's speed and small size allowed it to completely dodge the shots, but the Unicorn had more trouble, not just because it was bigger but also because it was the only thing the Funnels were interested in. The unicorn came very close to being hit a few times, and would've been were it not for the shield. \"Get to the Argama! You can't fight Marida!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Loto team was willing to sacrifice themselves if it meant getting Banagher back to the Argama, but as close as they were, the space between them and the Argama was still too great for a distraction to buy enough time for Banagher to reach it. \"We'll come back with reinforcements, just you hold on!\" Daguza said as the Loto left, the Funnels paying it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya moved in closer, the three in the Unicorn now able to easily see it. It descended from above and released the remaining half of it's Funnels, but they didn't fire, instead they each got into a position and just waited, staring at their prey. Like a statue or painting that seemed to always have it's eyes on you. The Kshatriya ignited it's Beam Saber and closed in, the Unicorn igniting one from an arm and locking blades. This lock quickly ended and they both moved away from each other, the Funnels now firing at the Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Securing that mobile -UURRP- suit has top priority, even if all that remains is -UUURRAAP- the cockpit.\" Marida repeated the exact order she was given. \"No war is ever truly justified. UURRAAAP! We both agreed on that, right? Neither of us are in the wrong, and neither of us are in the right, that's just how war is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher aimed the Unicorn's weapon at the Kshatriya as it got closer. \"I won't hurt her. I won't hurt her. I won't hurt her.\" That mantra, or any combination of words for that matter, couldn't stop the pilot from thinking back on what happened to the last person he used this weapon on. The more times he saw those images, the more the chunks of metal being chewed off seemed more human. He couldn't fire, all he could do was fight defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey began switching the frequency back to the Palau one, the crash of the two blades locking made each obese body jiggle like pudding. The two machines lbacked away again, Audrey looked down to see that the force from the crash had caused her to mistype, she quickly fixed the errors and got to the correct setting. \"Do it! URRRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, stop!\" The Unicorn lowered it's arms, telling Marida \"I'm a friend\". \"We can talk this through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I wish I could forget that was you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya nearly tackled the Unicorn, it's right arm and two of it's sub arms firmly holding the machine in place. The green one deactivated it's saber and pushed it against the chest of the white one. \"Surrender immediately, Banagher -UURRRRP- Links. If you don't, I'll toast the cockpit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're still full from that meal we had together, UUUUURRP! Aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes, I am. UUUURRAAP!\" For just a few, unbearable seconds, no one said anything. \"That's why we have to work this out, so we can have moments like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words should've calmed everyone, everyone knew that, but they didn't. It felt more like she was pleading God to listen, then for Banagher to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we want too! Come with us! We can give you a new life! One where you don't have to fight anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry but I can't. When we first met, I said the princess has to return to us because of her obligations. And just like her, -UUUURRP- we both have obligations. Right now, you and I are nothing more then combat units called pilots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Combat units?! You're -URRAAP- wrong, you're Marida, my big sister!\" Shin interrupts them</span></div></div>",

The NT-D should've activated by now.\" These words were said by Full Frontal on the bridge of the Rewloola. \"We've met all the requirements for it's activation without a doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we all made a mis -URP- understanding. Of course, I'm only saying this in hindsight, so it's no fault of yours, captain.\" Angelo suggested, standing right next to his captain, just the way he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What factor do you think we got wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only came across this bit of information this morning, sir. I happened to have passed by the lieutenant and Banagher without incident this morning. From what I overheard of their conversation, they seem to have grown quite close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I get it. You believe he truly doesn't consider her an enemy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need only wait. In spite of their connection, I have no doubt that Marida will still carry out her mission, and once she does, Banagher's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you leaving Marida to fight alone?\" Zinnerman growled, his gruff voice and barely hidden rage brought all eyes on the bridge towards him. All except Full Frontal's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a job only few can perform. The way to activate the NT-D is to get him to fight an enemy Newtype. We've installed a Psyco-Moniter onboard the Unicorn. We'll intercept any Box data that gets revealed by the activation of the NT-D. Since we cannot analyze the :LA+ program itself, our best option is to break the seals one by one. To accomplish that, we had to use the Federation's inside-man to bring Banagher back to the Unicorn Gundam. It is, of course, regrettable that I had to leave you and Marida in the dark, captain.\" The way he said that last sentence made it very clear he couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Marida is a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain. I know. A Cyber-Newtype can't be said to be a true Newtype. But then again, what exactly is a true Newtype? No one has the answer to that. What we need at this moment is a catalyst that will trigger the NT-D.\" An anticipating smirk appeared on his face. \"We've yet to see what this Gundam is capable. We're going to have lieutenant Marida draw out the true potential of The Second Coming of Amuro Ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant of the true nature of this duel they had both been forced into, Banagher continued to plead with Marida. \"Palau is your team's home, -UUURRP- right? If the Federation gets the Unicorn back, they'll retreat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the rhetoric of the Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Audrey broke her silence. \"Then why am I also saying it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curt words were truly shocking to everyone on the bridge, not just because of it's meaning, but also because it meant that she was in the Unicorn too. Even Full Frontal and Angelo's smug sense of invincibility seemed cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the princess' voice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's siding with the federation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she in the Gundam?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were just what a few members blurted out, everyone on that bridge was pondering something about the princess that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You miscalculated!\" But none were as angry as Zinnerman, except for Angelo, but that was merely at the disrespect the former showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tongue, cur!\" He turned around in an instant, glaring daggers at the captain, daggers that failed to hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the princess would be on the ship! I even asked you if you were positive and you said you were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, I made a mistake.\" Full Frontal seemingly recovered from his shock, he still kept his eyes glued onto the screen. \"One that we can easily recover from. All this means is that we can recover the Gundam and the princess at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hurt that brat, you'll hurt the princess as well! If Marida has to give him another concussion, you'll be giving Mineva one too! That pilot was out for hours after Marida captured him, she said his head was still pounding when he woke up, are you gong to have her do that to Mineva too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since he had returned to Neo-Zeon, Full Frontal felt the pressure of multiple eyes being drawn on him. He didn't even have to look to know that everyone on that bridge was looking at him. \"... That is up to her and Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that you were there, princess.\" Marida solemnly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why won't you listen to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have a role to play!\" Marida flinched at her own words, she wasn't expecting to raise her voice like that but she found herself powerless to stop. \"So make this easier -UUURAAP- for all of us and surrender!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to -UUURRP- do this! Reject your role, just like I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, please!\" Banagher shouted, sweat starting to run down his face. \"The whole reason I even met Audrey is because she tried to -UUUUURAP- stop all the fighting! Please consider not figjithng, jsut for now. Think of all the civilians in Palau, like Mr. Gilboa and his family, they could die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you surrender, we'll withdraw our forces too. That's your only option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not listening to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you don't understand what's going on. Banagher, you talk about how you want all the fighting to stop, but your -UUUURRAP- perspective is that of the Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not -UUUURRRP- I'm not on their side!\" He placed a hand over his heart without even noticing it, where the Vist Foundation emblem was, the version of it only given to the rider of the unicorn. \"You're not like most people in Zeon, you're not single minded, that's why I don't get it! You told me about the importance of having a light in your life, so why won't you just let us end this fight?! It's getting your friends killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just repeating more enemy rhetoric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words killed Banagher's ability to speak. His mouth was agape, he tried to force something out of it, something that would change Marida's mind, but he couldn't even stutter something out. His head just slumped down in defeat, he felt like his body was filled with bile. Audrey and Haro looked at him in sympathy, Banagher couldn't notice. He felt like he he in this void, completely alone, no hope of someone saving him. That was when it happened, his mouth suddenly shut tightly, his teeth gritted, his hands gripping the controls harder then he thought possible of himself. \"Damn you... stubborn idiot!\" His head shot up, his eyes filled with his rage, the words NT-D reflecting on his visor. The Unicorn sensed that rage and acted upon on it. The Unicorn broke out of the Kshatriya's grasp so ferociously it broke it's sub-arms, and delivered a brutal punch to it's face, the impact cracking some of it, the force knocking it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree, the Unicorn ascended and it shifted into it's Gundam form. \"There's no point in trying to reason with an enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gun -UUUURRP- dam!\" Marida called on her Funnels to attack the Kshatriya backed further away. The Unicorn blocked the shots with it's shield and aggressively chased after it's enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NT-D activation confirmed. The enemy has engaged the Kshatriya.\" One of the bridge crew informed, the worry he held for the princess laced his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? What did I tell you? From friend to enemy just like that. Humans truly are foolish creatures.\" Full Frontal gloated, gloating that even some of the most loyal of the bridge crew found off-putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ability to predict human nature is truly second to none, captain.\" Angelo said through a forced, smug smile. \"Why is the captain making me think of... them?\" He thought, a thought he would never allow himself to make public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinnerman found himself almost too angry to say something, and at the same time, too angry to not say something. \"You're sure happy about it.\" He snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm merely glad that the operation is back on track.\" The Red Comet condescendingly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, everyone on the bridge continued to watch the visuals being displayed on the monitor. It showed the Unicorn destroy two Funnels with a single slash of it's Beam Saber and charge towards the Kshatriya, like the mere annoyances they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnels!\" Marida called on her other Funnels to fire again, her enemy kept making rapid movements, dodging every shot, even when Marida added shots from her Mega Particle Cannons to the mix. Only one beam from a Funnel landed a hit, and that was on the Unicorn's gatling gun, causing it to explode. She saw the Unicorn then just float there, motionlessly. She put aside the dread she felt and had her Funnels close in. Before they were ready to fire, the Unicorn suddenly moved, in an instant it was glaring right at her, the Sleeves soldier feeling like those were Banagher's own eyes glaring at her in pure hate. It emitted this \"air\" of presence, Marida didn't physically feel anything when it hit her, but she could still feel it. It was like hate had taken form and hit her. She tried to force her dread aside and order her Funnels once again. \"Funnels!\" They did nothing. They just sat there, but not aimlessly. Marida's mouth opened, quivering as she saw her console register them as enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing red Unicorn slowly lifted out an open palm, aimed at the Kshatriya, and quickly clenched it. \"Go.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mercilessly, unhesitatingly, the Funnels turned on their master and fired, the machine they came from frantically moving about in a desperate attempt to dodge. Machines like the Kshatriya were widely deemed more then capable of engaging in combat with another Funnel equipped machine. However, that was solely because their Funnels would be able to distract the opponent's, in a scenario like this, where the Kshatriya was robbed of it's Funnels, the pilot holds no chance of putting up a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you recognize me?!\" The pilot yelled in desperation at her Funnels, the machines that once instantly responded to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya had to cover itself with it's binder, the wings creating a Minovsky Particle barrier, it was the only way for Marida to survive even so much as half a minute longer. The appearance and rationale behind it was not dissimilar to a turtle hiding in it's shell. However, shielding herself like this left her completely unable to attack, again, not dissimilar to a turtle. Her Funnels were able to attack when she defended herself like this when she commanded them, and there was no reason for them to not able to now that the Unicorn commanded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! How are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey balled her fists as she watched, something she was barely able to do. \"I know this is hard for you to do, I'm so sorry that I led you to this... Banagher?\" She looked at his eyes, they were locked onto the sight of his enemy's destruction. They didn't move, not even slightly, not to look at Audrey, not to avert his eyes from what was happening. Not at all. \"Banagher?\" She placed a hand on his, she felt no shaking, not even the slightest vibrations from his hand. Aside from the slight movement of calm breathing, his body was completely still. \"Banagher?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not Banagher! Not Banagher!\" Haro said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confusion and worry was mirrored by Zinnerman. \"What's going on? Is it the boy that's making that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" Full Frontal started his answer. \" As you know, the Psyco-Frame receives and amplifies thoughts and feelings, in this case we're seeing Banagher's angry and sorrow at what he feels is Marida betraying him. Those amplified feelings have overcome him, leaving him as just a processing mechanism for converting Psyco waves into hostility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what exactly is piloting that Gundam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that would be the NT-D. If it identifies someone as both a Newtype and an enemy, the suit's performance limiters are disengaged. It combines the paranormal interface of the Psyco-Frame and the power to control an enemy's Psycommu weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo bridge the gap between normal and abnormal, to give power to the powerless, to allow the have-nots to stand up to the haves, to give hope to those swallowed by despair, to allow anyone to decide their future, that is the philosophy behind the NT-D: NewType Destroyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible! No normal human could handle something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, they could not. Which is why the everyman the machine is meant to give power to would need to receive enhancements. Should a machine ever be able to destroy a Newtype, that is the day they will be cosigned to history. The Universal Century is approaching it's hundredth year, the UC Project was aptly named indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn viciously slashed off half of the Kshatriya's front left binder. Fighting back the force of the blow, it's enemy ignited it's Beam Saber and they clashed once again. The force of the Unicorn's blade pushed it back, it quickly used this chance to sever the machine's right hand, the one holding the saber. Looking as scared as it's pilot, the Kshatriya hid behind it's binders again, just in time to block a stab. The Unicorn just left the sword there, it was faster to pull out another and then use it to completely slash what was left of the front left binder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or more simply out, you threw Marida out there to be bait.\"  Zinnerman said, burning rage barely hidden just below the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puru 12, that is her designation.\" Full Frontal matter of factly stated. \"She is an artificial Newtype who has been engineered through cloning and genetic modification. The twelfth in a series of prototypes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinnerman growled, just barely able to keep himself from striking his commanding officer. He swore that if Marida died from this, he would kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn stabbed the Kshatriya straight through it's mono-eye. It left it there, perhaps a monument to the pain he had dealt. Or to disgrace it's enemy even further. The enemy was soundly defeated now, but the Unicorn wasn't finished yet. In it's rage, it began cruelly ripping out parts of it's enemy, an ugly fluid spilling out of it. Audrey tried to tear Banagher's arms away from the controls but they wouldn't budge. \"Am I really that weak? No, it's forcing his arms down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all your fault, you're the ones who branded me an enemy just because I wasn't on your side. All you do is rampage, destroying everything that's not you, you're the reason why everything turned out he way it did! Not just on Industrial 7, but forcing me to pilot this thing and kill! This damn box. The Federation, Neo-Zeon, everyone keeps screaming their ideals without listening to anyone else. Audrey, Micott, Takuya, Haro, they're the only ones who will listen to me! They're the only ones on my side! No one else! Dad's dead, I don't have any hope, why does everyone keep ruining me?! Why can't I just be happy?! Why am I even still here?!\" The Unicorn kicked the Kshatriya down and sent the Funnels to crash into different parts of it. The airbags in the cockpit activated but they couldn't keep up with the constant application of more pressure. The airbags popped, and the next explosion sent Marida's head crashing into her console, shattering her visor and knocking her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn felt no mercy for it's helpless enemy, instead it readied it's Beam Tonfa. \"Go on, destroy the enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey hugged his body, looking like she was about to cry. \"Please don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could, Banagher would've listened. But the Unicorn didn't, it charged at the Kshatriya, ready to do something Banagher would never be able to forgive himself for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the miracle occurred.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was light. All Banagher and Audrey could see was this aurora, and a little girl. A familiar little girl. They both felt their hearts pound as that little girl reached out to them. As soon as it seemed like they connected, there was light again. A different kind of light. The light of entering something new, your eyes needing to adjust themselves for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't seeing through their own eyes anymore, but from Marida's. They saw a hand, Marida's hand, reach out, feeling the cold air, and be grasped by another hand, this was the first time she felt human warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to this word. Do you feel cold?\" Neither Banagher nor Audrey recognized this youthful voice. \"You\u2019re the 12th sister. Your sisters are working outside. Come together with me to the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, there was light. A different kind of light. The light of the destruction of war, the mobile suits exploding and the beams that caused them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They killed Puru Three!\" They heard a sister cry out in grief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master\u2019s dead too. He\u2019s dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" The young Marida called out, even now, she found herself instinctively asking for orders from her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. There\u2019re still enemies left on the battlefield. We have to purge the Federation. We have to eliminate all of master\u2019s enemies, whether it\u2019s the Gundam or Haman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third voice had always been the leader if the group when the master wasn't there. Her words able to calm her sisters some, their black machines lined up together and attacked, understanding what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to destroy every enemy with our Funnels. We won't be whole without master but we can do this. It's why we were created.\" That was the mindset of Marida during that day. \"But what is an enemy? Is it something that's hurting master?\" Not everybody was pondering something like that but all the sisters had some question on their mind. Their master was gone, the only ones they could look to for answers were each other and themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout their master to guide them, the only tactic they could think of was to line up together and raid the enemy with their Funnels. Their mobile suits' movements were slow, and they would be massacred if they gathered together.For the first time, the young Marida broke a rule and broke formation. She wasn't far away, just away enough to survive the beam of light that ripped through space in an instant, and the black mobile suits were devoured. Her own mobile suit was ripped apart by the unforgiving light, forcing her to eject her cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, there was light. A different kind of light. A searing, obnoxious light. The neon lights of the city, designed to be impossible to not see. They saw the young Marida be led to this seedy place that held an awful smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do with a child like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised by what some of my clients want.\" They saw a middle aged woman look down, both figuratively and literally, on the young Marida. \"Starting today, I am your new master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, there was light. A different kind of light. The anxiety inducing light of the operation room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... she's so young...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have the dead weight removed, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there was warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what are ya?! If you're some kinda of Zeon fugitive, I'm callin' the cops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the poorly kept bedroom she had been given, the Marida of then could only hear muffled gunshots. Soon a bearded man entered her room, the man who now fulfilled the role of her master. He looked at sympathetically and approached slowly, and lightly held her hand. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories ended there, Banagher and Audrey now saw with their own eyes the product of those memories. Even though they were separated space and metal, it felt like they were right there. They could feel her, like they were holding her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn's beam ended, instead it held onto the Kshatriya and kept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... this is just too sad.\" That was all Banagher could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida... I understand, that's why I can't allow you throw away your life like this.\" Audrey wouldn't claim she was wise, but even so, she knew without a doubt that was the right thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compassion alone cannot save people. \"It can't erase sin or wash away impurities.\" That was the hard truth Marida knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Marida's beliefs came from her memories, so did Banagher's. Just as Zinnerman's words led her, his father's led Banagher. \"Even so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so.\"</span></div></div>",

She knew this was a very delicate subject, and she wouldn't claim she even knew what to say, but she felt that she had to say something. Or else there would just be this painful silence between them when they desperately needed to hear something.  \"how -URRRAAAP- are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher lowered his head and closed his eyes, looking frustrated. \"I... I just don't know. I feel terrible but at the same time I kinda feel relived. Like I just found this answer I've -UUURRRRP- needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you-Did you know about all that... that stuff? About Marida, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as specifically as we do now, but yes, I did know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher placed himself against a wall and slowly sat down. He, Audrey, and Haro were in the hallway right outside of the airlock to the hanger. \"When we first met, I remember that you said she feels like a sister to you. Did you ever call her your big sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sat down besides him, her back to the wall. \"No, but after all that, I think I need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll make her smile, she needs it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just sat there for a bit. There was silence but it wasn't the painful silence that they both feared. It was a relaxing silence, the kind that came about of two people just taking a break together. And no one in their right mind wouldn't say they had earned it and a lot more. It was only a little past 7 PM, but they felt like they hadn't slept in ages. For perhaps the first time in their entire lives, they had so much free time and no idea what to do with it. All they had planed besides going to sleep was visiting Marida in the med bay once they had rested some. They knew she probably wouldn't be awake until tomorrow, but aside from just simply wanting to see her and hear what the doctor says, they felt it was their duty to do so as her little brother and sister. They had even offered to help carry her to the med bay but they were told that carrying someone who is in physical pain is far more complicated then it seems. Carrying Marida the wrong way could make her condition worse, and to people without medical training, it wasn't obvious which ways were the wrong ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear a voice when I was fighting Marida?\" Banagher spoke up after a while. Until he did, the only sounds they heard was their belches, the bubbling of their full tummies, and the commotion still going on in the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped in a loud, unladylike manner. \"No, it's not like there was anyone besides the four of us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I just -ORRRRRRP- imagined it then. It's not like I was sane back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's -BWURRRRAAP- putting it a little too harsh but yes. No one would blame you for hearing things in a situation like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher didn't reply, he looked like he was mulling things over. \"BWUUUUURP! How are you holding up? Physically, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, -BOOOORRAP- I'm still a little nauseous but other then that, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time the Unicorn's NT-D activated, I was knocked out by the g-forces.\" Bringing that up made his soulmate perfectly recall the imagine of his unconscious and still skinny body in the cockpit, a bloody mark on his face Audrey still didn't know the cause of. \"I'm only able to stay wake because -UUUUURRP- of this special normal suit. So I don't get why you weren't knocked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the answer is obviously that -OOOORRAP- I'm a lot tougher then you!\" She joked as she gave him a light punch to the arm, making his bicep jiggle, a big grin on her chunky face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing a smile, Banagher laughed. \"Thanks, I needed that.\" He then belched loudly and deeply, Audrey felt that somehow made what he said even more pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserved it too, you're always making jokes that help me.\" Audrey placed her hands on the top of her soft stomach and began rubbing it, Banagher doing the same with his own giant gut. \"UUUURRAAP! Anyways, I think I forced myself to stay conscious, I was worried about both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at her stomach and blushed, hoping to hide the massive smile she grew. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Banagher then slowly got up, grunting as he did so. \"Still, we should probably have Dr. Hasan check up on you just to be safe. And see Marida, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Audrey followed suit, both her and Banagher's belly jolted as they stood up. \"We haven't seen him since our first day here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, you're right. This is gonna be awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it'll be more awkward for us or for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably for you two.\" Haro said as Audrey and Banagher removed their tight normal suits, very glad to be out of them. When they reached the med bay and entered it, Banagher carrying Haro as usual, they saw that only one bed was in use, which was indicated by the curtains around it being closed. Even without seeing Marida's corpulent form, just a sign that she was there made them feel a little anxious. And not to mentioned distracted, since they hadn't noticed the doctor typing a report up on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hello there.\" Hasan's calm voice still managed to startle the two out-of-shape teens. \"Are you here for visiting or medical aid?\" He didn't expect them to answer with the former. After all, his only current patient was a POW, assuming terrorists could even legally count as POWs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, both actually.\" Audrey answered as she and Banagher jiggled over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just a quick check up, that is.\" Banagher said as he looked around the room for needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do. I just need your names, I don't think we've-Wait, aren't you Banagher and Mineva?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo blushed and averted eye contact. \"Yes...\" They said, really wishing they could tuck in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHasan audibly struggled to find a way to be polite. \"It-\" he cleared his throat. \"It's only been a week, hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't trying to but the doctor's words made his two new patients blush even harder as their tummies bubbled. \"Yes...\" Banagher then belched, while Audrey swallowed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't think it was even possible to gain that much weight in so little time. Have you two weighed yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no.\" Audrey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like, you could use my scale. We could also measure-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That won't be necessary!\" Audrey interjected louder then she meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it later.\" Banagher added, he and Audrey's blushing intensified once again as they imagined the scale pointing out exactly how obese they were, right next to someone they didn't know well. They didn't know what was worse, that or having the doctor measure their massive bellies, he would undoubtedly have to feel the giant orbs as he measured them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching their drift, Hasan changed the subject. \"Alright, so is this checkup about the Unicorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're supposed to wear a special normal suit when -URAP- it goes into NT-D mode, or else the g-forces will knock you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Mineva wasn't wearing one when you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked guilty. \"No, she wasn't. So we'd like if you could check her heart, make sure everything is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as Banagher's.\" Audrey interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this won't take long.\" Hasan put on his stethoscope and placed the resonator on Audrey's chest, hearing the sounds of a normal, healthy heart at work. \"Everything sounds good, especially considering what you went through. Still, activating the NT-D was incredibly risky, you know that, so why in god's name did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher clenched his fist as he looked down. \"I'm pathetic.\" He thought. \"I completely forgot about her and Haro when I did that. Wait, I did that?\" Thinking back on the three times he activated the NT-D, Banagher couldn't see how he did it, no matter how hard he wracked his brain. \"I just wanted power, and then I got it. Does the Unicorn pick up on that and activate the NT-D? ...This is all just semantics, I'm just trying to dodge responsibility.\" Here, he spoke up. \"I was being selfish -UURRAP- and I wasn't thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can blame you for being upset back then.\" Audrey said without hesitation, without uncertainty. \"And using the NT-D was our only hope of getting here.\" She looked at Banagher when she said that, but Hasan felt like she was looking at him at the same time. \"Now, doctor, if you'd please examine my dear friend.\" Her stomach gurgled as she forced down yet another burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Hasan did so, finding evidence of a healthy heart. \"Everything's fine on that front, though your stomachs are a different matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know they're big.\" An embarrassed Audrey as she shamefully rested a hand on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, that is a problem too, but I'm referring to the organ. They've been making quite a lot of noise, which I can't imagine is pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFittingly enough, their tummies did indeed each emit a low grumble, drawing all eyes to them. \"We're just -UUUURP- really full.\" Banagher sheepishly said as he scratched the bake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you some digestive pills if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you. We have our own special remedy for this.\" As she said that Audrey, sneaked in a quick jiggle of Banagher's tummy, a jiggle she made sure to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like that stuff, don't ya?\" Banagher commented as he jiggled Audrey back, aware that question could just as easily be directed as him.</span></div></div>",

He and Audrey walked over to it, Hasan returned to his computer, both to continue his work and to give them as much privacy as he could. The Gundam pilot grabbed the curtain but found himself unable to move it. He gripped tightened and grew less steady. Audrey saw the sad look on his face, rather then say something, she grabbed his other hand, the one he held Haro with. Banagher looked back at her sympathetic face, and then he opened the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked peaceful as she slept. Despite the painful circumstances that put her in this place, perhaps this sill served as a rest for her. There was plaster on her face, Because her head bobbed back as soon her visor broke, none of the shards of it pierced her face, though it did scrap her skin. Only Hasan knew at the time, but some of her ribs were broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords escaped Audrey and Banagher as they looked at the wounded Marida. Haro was the only one of the three who hadn't met Marida, not counting the confrontation in Industrial 7, but he still knew this was someone who had helped Audrey and Banagher dearly, someone who they cared for, someone who cared for them. Banagher reached out and placed a hand on the top of Marida's belly, still stuffed to the brim with all the ice cream they had so much fun eating together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't been that long...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when?\" Audrey was worried this would cause Banagher to breakdown, but after the life she had lived until she met him, she knew it was better for him to let it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since... Since the last time I was with her. We were having so much fun together, it feels like it was so long ago but it's been a few hours. It's just 7. We were just talking, we were eating together, it was so wonderful, and then just a few hours later... I... I... I...!\" As he shut his eyes closed, he felt Audrey embrace him. \"Thanks...\" he opened his eyes again. \"I... I need to lay down, it's what Marida would suggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I'm suggesting too.\" Taking him by hand, Audrey led Banagher out of the med bay. Hasan didn't say anything, as a doctor, he knew they didn't need him interrupting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recreational room was empty. There was no doubt they weren't the only ones who needed to relax, so it was probably just that everyone else was busy with whatever. That was the conclusion they would've come to were they not so exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about doing some stargazing?\" Banagher asked as the last Zabi led him into the large room, their tummies bobbing and bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think it would be a good way to unwind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looking up at the stars is just what we-\" Before he could finish that sentence, the Vist and the Zabi suddenly found themselves tackled to the ground, by one person for each of them. Having caught the two large figures out of their peripheral vision shortly before contact, the only had time to turn to face them before they got tackled, all four bloated forms jiggling and jostling from the impact, their big bellies all touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOOOOORRP!\" The collision stirred up the gas in all their bellies, making Banagher and the two unknown figures belch loudly in unison. Since she didn't know who they were yet, Audrey desperately tried to hold down all the gas she had been kept bottled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts!\" \"Gyah!\" Cries like that could be heard from the four now thta belching wasn't keeping them from complaining about the impact, Haro not included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher opened their eyes to see that their mysterious assailants were Micott and Takuya. The chunky girl had tackled Banagher while the chubby boy had tackled Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back!\" Takuya said with a huge smile and all the enthusiasm Banagher and Audrey had missed and needed from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really missed you!\" Micott said with her own huge smile, a relief in her voice and on her face that everyone was glad to hear and see return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys!\" Banagher happily said as Audrey's soft tummy gurgled and bubbled, the biggest smile the Vist had on his fat face since Marida called him her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWWWOOOAAARRRP!\" A massive belch, even bigger then the group one the others had done, came roaring from Audrey's mouth, startling all but her. Maybe it was just because they were caught up in the surprise (embarrassment, in Audrey's case), but they all swore they could've felt their entire bodies jiggle and even the room itself shake from the princess' massive five seconds long belch. What Audrey had meant to say was a simple, happy \"It's good to be back.\", but that was what came out of her mouth instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them knew who started laughing first, maybe it was Takuya, maybe it was even Audrey herself, but the room was then filled with the group's laughter. It even somehow seemed like Haro was laughing too with the way he excitedly flapped his ears, saying \" Go Audrey! Go Audrey!\". Audrey and Banagher were blushing, but for different reasons, as they laughed. All their bellies jiggled as they laughed. Banagher and Takuya's pie-like faces joined in on the jiggling, as did Audrey and Micott's big boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I should be.\" Banagher's heart was filled with feelings like that. \"I'm not going to ride that mobile suit again; I'm not going to get involved with the Federation, Neo-Zeon, or the Vist Foundation. Our nightmare is finally over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya made his shot with his pool cue, not scoring a point from this move but that was okay, he was still in the lead. \"So, yeah. OOORRAP! We just go to Luna -BWAP- II, answer whatever questions they give us, and then we go home.\" Unlike the last time Audrey and Banagher were here, the group was using the 3D pool tables, which was basically pool played in zero gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be the same without... you know, all the others. UURAAAAP!\" Micott said as she looked down, her tummy blocking her view of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya frowned. \"I know...\"His smile returned once he thought of what to say. \"But hey, we've got Audrey now!\" He cheerfully pulled a visibly startled Audrey close to him, to the point their chubby arms were touching, which jostled slightly. \"And we'll keep in touch with Riddhe and Mihiro. And we've got actual experience with mobile suits under our belts now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our much tighter -UUUUUURRP- belts, that is.\" Micott snarked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually broke mine -URRRRRRRRP a few days ago.\" Banagher chimed in as he held up a side of it, he was still wearing it. Banagher blushed from embarrassment, while Micott and Audrey blushed for a certain different reason. \"God, that's hot.\" Was all Micott could think when her pal said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of everything.\" Banagher answered as he absentmindedly rubbed his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then some.\" Audrey gave her belly a big slap, making it jiggle and her burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Takuya continued. \"working on actual federation mobile suits is going to look really good on our grades. So what I'm saying is that while we've lost a lot, but we've also gained a lot too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gained a lot of weight, that is.\" Audrey joked as she removed Takuya's hand from her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all seriousness, it's admirable -BWAAAAARRP- that you're keeping a positive outlook. It's something we all needed to hear.\" Audrey eyed Banagher before looking back at Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Like you said, somebody's gotta do it. URRRAAAP! Speaking of doing, you're up, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey lined up her shot, adjusting it as she thought back on everything on physics she had been taught by her very well-paid tutors. After ten seconds of deliberation, she made her shot, and once again, scored zero points. She let out a disappointed sigh. \"Why is this so hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody sucks at something.\" Micott causally said and then casually burped. \"Besides, pool doesn't really suit someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I wanted to be good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, BOOOORRRAP! You're still new at this.\" Banagher reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind. UUUUURRAP! Anyways, it's your turn.\" Audrey said and then handed Banagher the cue.</span></div></div>",

No, now that he thought about it, it was something he needed to tell all his friends. \"A-Actually, there's something I need to tell you guys.\" He stopped lining his shot and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded Audrey. \"Oh! BUUUURRAAP! Is this that ting you wanted to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think I should tell you guys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting the feeling this is important.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. I...\" It was hard to say it, perhaps because it was something he thought he would never say. \"I know who my father is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Banagher did a second ago, everyone who heard that had trouble saying anything. Takuya was the first one who could say something. \"Well, that's great!\" Takuya and Micott smiled then, a frowning Audrey was the only one who knew this wasn't going to be a happy story. \"So what's he's like?\" The bottom-heavy brunette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's our school's chairman, Cardeas Vist. And he's dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott and Takuya lost their smiles. \"Oh...\" That was all Micott could say, Takuya couldn't even say anything. Audrey was the only one who could say a whole sentence. \"Are you talking about THAT -BUUUURP- Cardeas -BUUUUURRRP- Vist? Then, you're the Vist family's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Banagher kept looking down, though it was more accurate to say he wasn't looking at anything, his body trembling with a mixture of emotions. \"My mother separated us when I was young, and I couldn't even remember his face. He didn't even come to my mother's funeral, he wouldn't even meet us, and all out of a sudden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever the reason, his thoughts after that couldn't become words. Before anyone could say something, Banagher felt something round rub up against his foot, he looked and saw that it was Haro. Just like that, all his anger and sadness was gone. He dropped his cue and picked up Haro, smiling in a tired manner. \"Sorry for snapping, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. \" Takuya said. \"We're here for ya. When you need someone to talk to, and when you need someone to vent to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're helping us get through this, and we're helping you get through this.\" Micott added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what I said, I should've realized now wasn't a good time to ask questions.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, I shouldn't have snapped at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my fault for being insensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's my fault for being a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's my fault for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough.\" Micott injected. \"You don't -UUUURRRP- need to get into some dumb cycle of apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" Audrey said, Banagher sharing her slight embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheeky grin, Takuya lightly elbowed Micott in her big tummy,upsetting it and making it's hefty owner burp. \"You're just -BOOOORRRP- jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you saying?!\" Micott's enraged voice rang. \"It's -UUUURRAAP- not like -BORP- that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous of what?\" Audrey and Banagher said in unison, blinking innocently. This combined with Micott's adorably childish anger made Takuya laugh.</span></div></div>",

This left the score with Micott at 4, Banagher at 3, Audrey at 2, and Takuya at 3. The four of them, plus Haro, were sitting at the massive lounge chair together, their huge butts touching, something they definitively didn't mind, even if it made them blush initially. There was a bunch of soda cans, some empty, some not yet used as fuel for their powerful belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more and I win!\" The big-bottomed brunette bragged, giving her gut a proud slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, who won the eating contest?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Was Takuya's initial answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when the Argama was attacked?  You guys were finishing up the eating contest with Riddhe and Mihiro, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-Oh, yeah! Now I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that feels like ages ago.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back then, Takuya, Riddhe, and Mihiro only had potbellies.\" Audrey's finger sank into her friend's belly fat as she teasingly poked Takuya's full belly, forcing a belch past his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's cheating!\" He jokingly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not, we didn't start the next round yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who won?\" Banagher got them back on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a tie.\" Micott answered. \"Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't imagine Mihiro was pleased.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She blamed Riddhe.\" Takuya chuckled as he tonight back on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher wanted to say something about that, but one gurgle from his stomach later and he was letting out a huge burp. \"BWAAAAAARRP! Damn, I should've saved that one for the next round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to work on swallowing your belches.\" Audrey said. \"Not just for this contest, but also for when you're in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Anyways, I guess we'll have to finish up the contest tomorrow or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea! We're going to hold a welcome -BUUUURP- back party tomorrow, how about we settle things there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting a party?\" Audrey and Banagher said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Party time! Party Time!\" Haro cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! You two earned it.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for your first party, Audrey?\" Micott asked, she had a feeling Audrey's first time at a party would be pretty much the same as that of a medieval princess transported to the Universal Century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't it be like that party you and everyone else threw to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What party?\" A confused Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just to help you perk up, this is going to have way more energy. This time we're celebrating, it's going to be a REAL party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey disposition instantly changed,. \"Oh, um, exactly how different is it going to be? Is there any way I can prepare myself? Some sort of practice I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Audrey.\" Banagher gave her a friendly pat on the back, making her burp loudly. \"She's just trying to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You walked right into that one.\" Takuya said, grinning with Micott, somehow their chubby cheeks and double chins amplified how amused they looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh princess could actually feel the nervousness be drained out of her body. \"I guess I did.\" Audrey awkwardly said as she ruffled a bit of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll just be a little more active then the party we threw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me you'll be there for me if things get too chaotic, alright?\" Audrey said with emerald green eyes no one could resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. UURRRAP!\" Banagher said with a heartwarming smile, his chubbiness making it even more effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider us your body -BOOORRP- guards.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've hosted tons of parties before, I've got you covered.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help too! Like when we first met!\"\" Haro bounced up and down as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed in relief. \"Thank you all.\" Talking about the time between Banagher's kidnapping and when she left to help him return reminded Audrey about the thief. \"If you don't mind me changing the subject, has anything happened with the thief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you scared him off.\" Takuya's answer truly surprised the princess, it felt too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or he finally exploded.\" Micott said, subconsciously give her belly some rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't done anymore raids since -BBBUURP- the party we held, I think.\" Takuya smirked as he thought about what happened between Audrey and Riddhe. \"Guess he heard about you roughing up Riddhe and got scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or Riddhe -UUUOOORP- is the thief.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think he did it, it's really not like him.\" Banagher commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, I'm glad we can finally put this all behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever means more food for us.\" Micott said, grabbing a handful of her tummy fat. \"God, I'd be a mess if they started rationing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming doctor Hasan doesn't ration us anyways.\" The way Takuya said that made it obvious he had an annoying conversation with the doctor about his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been nagging you guys about it?\" Banagher asked, knowing the answer would be some version of \"yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever he gets the chance.\" Takuya practically groaned as he said that. \"We got unlucky and he saw how huge our stomachs were after the party, he dragged us into the med bay and lectured us for ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It -UUUUUURP- felt way longer.\" Micott added. \"He tried to get us to weigh ourselves, but that's way too embarrassing to do in front of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at her massive tummy, as well as her plentiful boobs, the result of collecting all the calories from her many binges. \"We probably should weight ourselves though.\" Her finger sank into the plush fat both times she poked it. She then looked at her friends and how chunky they had all gotten, feeling a mixture of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but not in front of some guy we don't even know. I sure as hell don't want him feeling up my belly and measuring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that would be...\" Audrey was distracted as she imagined Banagher's hands running over her nearly perfectly round belly as he brought the measuring tape together, his own gigantic belly pressing into her back and huge butt. It felt like she was being hugged by the huge orb. Banagher gave her stomach a light slap when he announced the number to her, making it sway in a gelatinous fashion. Both their faces going redder at the number. She then imagined the roles reversed, herself putting a finger in Banagher's cavernous navel as she brought the tape together at the apex of his middle, the big brunette moaning.. \"BUUUUURRP! Really embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where do you think we should hold the party?\" Takuya changed the subject. \"Here or your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Banagher, both had their pros and cons. The recreational room had a lot more couches, space, and games, and an amazing view of the stars, but no video games and it would be REALLY awkward if someone just walked in on them, or if there another group spending time there who now had to put up with all this belching. That wouldn't be good for either party. On the other hand, Banagher's room was of course much smaller, had no view of the stars, only one couch, but it also had more privacy and video games. \"Don't know, I'll have to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we gonna have another round or what?\" An impatient Micott held up a new can of soda as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they grabbed a can of soda, each bloated teen turned their head towards the ceiling and started chugging, downing the whole thing in one go. Their bellies were already so incredibly full and bloated, it wasn't comfortable to put even more into the overstuffed sacks, but this was just way too fun. Once they each pulled the now empty can from their lips, their waited just a few seconds for evidence of their drink to come gushing out. They could feel their bellies gurgle and bubble as they got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUURP!\" Banagher belched first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOOOOOOORP!\" Takuya burped second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Micott burped third. \"Looks like I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRP!\" All five of them were shocked by the power of Audrey's massive belch, and yes, that included Haro and Audrey herself. They knew the Zabi could really belt out monsters, after all, they got an example a few hours ago, but they didn't think they would get a second example in he same day. Audrey looked shocked even as she belched for five seconds straight, a blush on her chubby face. She was trying to belch as loudly as possible, but even she was shocked by that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Audrey!\" A grinning Banagher pulled Audrey closer and gave her a friendly noogie, their soft tummies touching, making Audrey start smiling too. Haro was cheering on Audrey again by saying \"Go Audrey! Again! Go Audrey! Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a burp!\" Micott sounded thoroughly impressed, she and Takuya were grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, for a princess, you're good at this!\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys.\" The princess felt another burp coming up. \"BOOOOORRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

It was filled with boxes. As Takuya explained to him earlier, Mihiro had gone through the trouble of convincing Daguza to order ECOAS to retrieve everything from Banagher, Takuya, and Micott's dorm rooms. officially, they were \"evidence\" but it was obvious that Daguza was being sympathetic. Since it was clear that they would be living in the Argama for a while, Mihiro and Daguza wanted them to feel like they were living here, not being held prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut decorating his room could wait until tomorrow. Right now, they had well-deserved food comas to slip into. Once they collapsed onto the couch to take a break, it was very tempting to just fall asleep right there and then, and very difficult not to. They slowly got up to brush their teeth, take a shower, and get changed for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bathroom, dressed in her unbuttoned pajamas, except for the button that kept her tits decent, of course, Audrey saw the adorable sight of her pal ungracefully laying on his bed, his huge gut displayed in it's full glory as it bulged straight up into the air, his pajama shirt unable to contain it. Banagher belched in an equally ungracefully manner. \"BUURRUURRP! Man, I'm tired.\" Haro was sitting on the bed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know how we -BWAAAAAAP- stayed up so long.\" Eyes locked onto his gut, Audrey wobbled over to him, her tummy, legs, boobs, and ass jiggling. She flopped down next to him in bed with a little more grace then the bloated pilot. \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better. BURP! A lot better, how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling better too.\" She then sighed in what seemed like relief. They were then silent for a bit until Audrey brought up a new topic. \"Ready to fulfill your promise tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What promise?\" He sounded worried as he said that, worried he had hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smirked. \"You said you would introduce me to video games, remember? I've been looking forward to that this whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a second to process what she said, but once he did, he heartily chuckled, his cheeks folding and bouncing. He couldn't help it, Audrey was just being too cute damn cute. \"Don't worry, I'll show you every game I've got first thing after breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good -UUUUURRRP- to have you back, Banagher.\" Audrey placed her head on Banagher's gut, smiling peacefully. Even as packed full as the orb was, there was still a layer of soft adipose. It felt just as wonderful and soft as she hoped it was, it was truly the world's best pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to be back.\" His big belly gurgled as both lovebirds felt a powerful surge rise up from the gigantic orb, it quickly flew out of Banagher's mouth. \"BUUUUUURRRRAAAARRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" An amused expression matched Audrey's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Banagher said, patting his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, they fell into mutual food comas. They slept soundly that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey pressed deeply into Banagher's gut to support herself as she got up, forcing a shocked \"UUUUUUUURP! Ooof!\" out of her friend. \"What the hell, Audrey?\" He sat up, understandably annoyed. To his further shock, Audrey said nothing, she didn't look back at him, she didn't even seem to hear him. He saw her lumber out of his room, he watched her bubblebutt and legs jiggle and jostle. Wanting to just go back to sleep and forget this ever happened, the bloated pilot returned his head to his pillow. He wrote it off as Audrey just needing to use the bathroom, whether it be to do her business or just to get a drink from the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed of him trying to fall asleep. \"It's like when I had to walk down the hall in the middle of the night just to get some water.\" He thought back on his days at the school dorm. \"If there's one thing better about the Argama then the dorm, it's that I don't have to walk down the hallway just to for a some water. It's way better with a bathroom in my room........... My bathroom's in my room?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as a fat guy (who wasn't really athletic before he got fat) with a packed-full gut could, which was surprisingly fast in his case, Banagher bolted out of his room, his entire body wildly jiggling, though he to stop as soon as he got of his room to catch his breath and clutch his belly. To be fair to him, it IS genuinely hard to run with a belly that stuffed. \"Damn it! What's she getting up to now?\" He looked around for her, the lights in the Argama were significantly dimmed, as they were set to do at this time when there wasn't a combat alert. \"God, she could be anywhere on this ship! Well, anywhere except one of the bathrooms.\" With only two paths he could go, he had a 50% chance of picking the right one. So already he was off to a bad start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how long he searched for, but he knew that the more he did, the more he wanted to grab Audrey go back to bed. He kept wracking his brain to figure out what the hell the princess he knew and loved was up to. She certainty wasn't the mischievous type, barring the two times she slapped Banagher's tummy to wake him up. Was this some sort of espionage? She was the type who would sneak around in the middle of the night if there was something important to find out, but she would've told him beforehand, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked every room he passed by, except for the bedrooms, but found nothing. He called out a few times, burped a few times, but he didn't get any reply. It felt creepy, like he and Audrey were the only people on the ship. The fact that Audrey had genuinely gone missing made it even worse. He realized he should've brought his phone with him, he could've use some background music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUURRAARRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed towards the source of the loud belch, if that was Audrey, that was a damn good one, which led him to the kitchen. As it was a room, the lights were off he moved to turn them on but stopped himself at the last moment. He had no idea what was going on, and he didn't even know for sure if that burp came from Audrey, so he felt he should approach this cautiously and not let himself be seen until he was sure it was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a light, it was a refrigerator light but a rotund figure was blocking a lot of it. \"Is that the thief Audrey's been so pissed off about?\" Holding his belches down, he slowly approached the figure, hoping he could see his face, the sounds of the figure's munching and burping getting louder. Getting closer, he could make out the figure a little better, he was fairly certain now that it was a girl and that she had medium sized hair. Getting even closer, he could the color of her pajamas and hair. The pajamas were pink, while her hair was strawberry blonde. \"Wait, pink pajamas and strawberry blonde hair? It can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting almost as close as he could, he now knew that it was. It was Audrey; she was the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Audrey?\" He said, but he really had no idea what he was going to say after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seems Audrey wasn't doing much better at figuring out what to say, because she didn't say anything, she just kept pigging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad or anything, -BUUUURRP- I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to. Just tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Banagher heard was munching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you wouldn't do this unless you felt like you had no choice, so whatever the problem is, I'll help you fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reply he got, if it could even be called that, was more of the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter again getting no answer, he walked over and tapped her on the shoulder. \"Audrey?\" Once again, all the blonde did was stuff her face. He looked closer and saw that while her eyes were open, they were glazed over, like she wasn't even using them. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when it all clicked. \"She's sleepwalking!\" He was a little relieved, it looked like this was going to be much easier to fix then he initially thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked like, being the key words here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her shoulders and gentle shook her, his belly touching her back and huge ass. \"You there?\" The blonde seemed unaware that she was being shaken. So the brunette shook her even harder. \"You're sleepwalking, you've gotta wake up.\" Again, he wasn't acknowledged. \"C'mon, Audrey, you've gotta snap out of this! Before someone finds you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that attempt also failed, he grabbed hold of her and tried to pry her away from the fridge, which was really tough. He didn't think a sleepwalker would be able to resist physical force. \"You're going to get sick if you keep eating!\" Eventually he was able to pull her off, but because of inertia, he accidentally sent her flying into the counter. Seeing her collaspe to the ground, he was hit by guilt just as badly as the blonde was hit by the counter. On the upside, the impact actually woke her up. \"Ugh...\" She woke up like normal, but was clearly confused. She looked around, at the room she was in, at the open fridge, and then at Banagher ('s belly before she looked at his face). \"Banagher? What''s going on? Where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher sheepishly scratched the back of his head, only now did he realize how awkward this was going to be to explain. \"Well, you're in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why am I in the kitchen?\" She felt a gurgle from her stomach. \"Ooooh. And why do I feel like I'm about to -UUUUURRRRP- explode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, weeelll, you're the thief. You've been been sleepwalking this whole time. I just stopped you from clearing out the whole thing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked twice in confusion, and then her face grew extremely red, as red as the tomato sauce on the frozen pizza slices she had just eaten, as the realization hit her. \"Oh... Well, this is embarrassing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, BUUURRRAARP! Now I'm going to explode.\" Banagher groaned as he gave his belly a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, you -UUUUUURRP- didn't need to eat as much as I did.\" Audrey pointed out as she massaged her swollen tummy, her emerald green eyes locked onto Banagher's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grinned at her as he rubbed his belly. \"You know me. BOOOORRRP! I'm never one to leave you alone with a problem.\" Those charming words made Audrey smile as her pal yawned loudly. \"Any -BURP- way, lets go back to bed. can you stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you? You look like your legs are about to buckle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher blushed, if they weren't ready to go to bed, and they didn't need to leave before someone walked in, he would've plopped down right next to Audrey. \"I'm okay, I just need someone to lean on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes two of us. UUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some difficulty, Audrey was able to stand up with Banagher's help. They leaned on each other for support as they wobbled back to the brunette's room, a pair of big tummies, ample boobs, huge butts, and two pairs of chunky legs jiggled and jostled with every step the lovebirds made. Their stomachs were so large and full that they rubbed together, which felt really nice to both teens. It kinda felt like being hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no reason not to, Banagher started up some small talk. \"Marida says I'm like a puppy when -BOOORP- I get my belly rubbed, do you think that's true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped before she answered. \"Yes, definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so what breed am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Banagher's chubby face, the princess found herself tempted to say a French Bulldog. A typical French Bulldog did have rather adorable chubby cheeks like Banagher did, though that was partly because of how fat he was now. Then again, he did always shave some chubby cheeks. She found her eyes focusing on his hair instead of his face, which is where she found her answer. \"A Shih Tzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Shih Tzu, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at how he didn't get it. \"Because you're both incredibly fluffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning sheepishly, Banagher self-consciously ran his hand over the top of his head, feeling that yes, he was incredibly fluffy. \"Now that you mention it, I guess I am. Oh, Marida said you're a puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what breed do you think I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a Chihuahua.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a Chihuahua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. It just feels right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they returned to Banagher's room and went back to sleep, Audrey still using Banagher's belly as the world's best pillow. They slept soundly that night, this time for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey woke up, she knew even before she looked at the digital clock that she (and Banagher, but that's nothing new) had slept in. The clock read 3:17 PM. It sounded about right to her. She actually didn't feel ashamed of herself like she normally would've. She looked at Banagher's round face, you'd never be able to tell from how he slept like a log, adorably snoring with a lazy look, that he had been through an incredibly traumatic experience yesterday. The Zabi felt that was admirable in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving a few loving pats to her friend's stomach, Audrey carefully got out of the bed, making sure she didn't accidentally wake up Banagher, though she was pretty sure that was hard to do, and went to his bathroom to take a shower and brush her teeth. It was tempting to take a bath but she didn't want to risk accidentally falling asleep again. Once she was done with that, she grabbed her ill-fitting clothes and put them on in the bathroom. It wasn't easy, in fact she was pretty sure they fit even less then when she left for Palau. As she thought back on all the pigging out she had been doing, she knew it wasn't surprising. Still, she didn't regret it, it the extra pounds were worth hanging out with Banagher, well worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants were the last article of clothing she squeezed into, she saved it for last because it was hardest part, thanks to her huge butt. Going through that again made her feel pity for Micott. The Zabi could barely squeeze into her pants, and Micott's ass even even bigger. Audrey thought it was a miracle Micott hadn't ripped her short shorts yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her black socks and brown loafers on, Audrey left the bathroom to see that Banagher was still sound asleep, which was no surprise. Audrey smiled at that, her pal was just the cuddliest thing. She walked over to him. \"Banagher, it's time to wake up now.\" She politely said as she not-so-politely grabbed the sides of his gut, tightening her grip to get all the fat she could, and gave it a good shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, I'm up.\" Banagher drowsily said as he watched his belly bounce, which actually felt kinda nice. If he hadn't just woken up, he probably would've moaned instead of yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Banagher.\" Audrey said as if she wasn't still shaking the sleepyhead's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day you finally introduce video games to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, bringing that up helped get rid of some of Banagher's drowsiness. Some of it. \"Oh yeah. You're pretty excited for that, aren't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you as soon as we get some breakfast, that's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One that I know you'll keep. I'll wait for you outside while you shower and get dressed.\" Audrey let go of the pilot's big stomach, causing it to jiggle and wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited outside, and making sure no one was coming, Audrey passed the time by playing with her belly, including her cavernous bellybutton. She poked and jiggled her belly, watching with childlike wonder the gelatinous way the orb reacted. She grabbed a handful of her belly fat, her stomach felt like an even more malleable pillow. Now that she thought about it, having a gut was kinda like having a pillow strapped to your middle 24/7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she poked herself in her bellybutton, which she fit her entire finger without difficulty, that fact made her feel even fatter. After a burp, she started moving her finger around, making her gut wobble all over. As weird as it made her feel, she got so caught up in her belly play that she didn't notice Banagher coming out of his room, Haro in hand, until he already saw what she was doing. Her chubby face as red as a tomato, she immediately let go of her belly, which took a second to stop jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast?\" A friendly Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I could go for some toast right now.\" Audrey said, eternally grateful Banagher didn't comment on what she was doing with her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to the cafeteria, they found themselves looking at how much both their bellies jiggled with every step. \"We've definitely gotten fatter.\" Audrey said as she ran hand over her blubbery tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I'm surprised. We've really been pigging out.\" Banagher pat his well-fed belly a few times as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No regrets though, right? Bring on the pies and all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grinned, he lifted his belly up and started shaking it. \"No regrets, bring on the pies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled and started doing the same. \"Banagher, you're worth getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bizarre compliment but it still managed to warm Banagher's heart. \"Thanks. You're, uh, worth getting fat too.\"</span></div></div>",

Audrey's lazy!\" Haro chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did happen to have the world's most wonderful pillow last night.\" Audrey reached over and grabbed a handful of Banagher's belly blubber, making it obvious to Takuya and Micott what she meant. \"No excuse for you though, Banagher.\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, glad to see I lived up to your expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised you two did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to let me try out your gut someday.\" An obviously jealous Micott said, obviously jealous to all but Banagher and Audrey that is. She imagined herself as the one using Banagher's belly as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think my belly would be such a popular pillow.\" Banagher joked as he lifted up his gut and then let it drop, making it jiggle and wobble when it landed back onto his chunky thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two got anything planned today?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was going to answer that, but an excited Audrey did so first. \"As a matter of fact, Banagher is going to introduce me to video games just as soon as we finish our breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you picked out what your going to start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Banagher was about to reply, only for a very eager Audrey to beat him to it. \"Danganronpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you didn't get the name wrong.\" Banagher said, partly for the sake of getting to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be interesting.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to see how you react to the characters.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Audrey innocently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Takuya chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still completely determined to become a geek, Audrey suddenly felt a little in over her head. Then again, that wasn't anything new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the gym on the Nahel Argama, Riddhe and Mihiro's corpulent forms jiggled all over the place as they each ran on a treadmill. Their round faces were red and drenched with sweat. While they had been exercising for half an hour at this point, they had only been using the treadmills for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep *huff* up for just a little *huff* longer.\" Mihiro said, without even looking at Riddhe or hearing him say anything, she knew that he was on the verge of giving up. Sure enough, when she looked at him after saying that, she saw that he was already off the treadmill, desperately trying to catch his breath. She sighed and returned her focus to losing weight. For ten more seconds that is, after that she had to join Riddhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they caught their breaths, the two officers of the Federation wobbled over a bench and plopped their fat asses down on it. \"At least we burned some calories, right?\" Riddhe comforted his friend after they both drank some much needed water. They didn't look like tomatoes anymore but there was still some red left on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Mihiro replied. Then she looked past her big boobs and at her gut. She placed a hand on it, it was just as soft as ever. \"It's just that I went into this thinking we would do a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how good could we possibly be?\" Riddhe pointed out. \"We weren't exactly the athletic type even before we got fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Mihiro looked at Riddhe's stomach and then back at her own, two big tummies that were going to get even bigger at the party tonight. Her belly covered up her thighs and then some, while Riddhe's almost reached his knees. It was a small relief to her that she didn't have as much of a gut as Riddhe did, even if she did still have a gut, and not to mention, a much bigger ass. \"Let's just hope the party doesn't set us back that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, how do you think Banagher is holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be exhausted, physically and mentally. At least he'll finally be able to enjoy himself again at the party. The poor guy must be skin and bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do all video game characters look like this?\" That was all Audrey could say as she looked at the very unusual cast of Danganronpa, realizing, after the appearance of the game's protagonist seemingly dispelled her worries, exactly what Takuya and Micott meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just this series.\" Banagher said, only to immediately realize that wasn't completely true. \"Well, not just this series, but most have characters that look a lot more normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Audrey sounded like she wasn't completely convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was a visual novel, and they weren't too far into it yet, Audrey had already demonstrated just how bad she was at video games. It took her a little time, and a few reminders, before she memorized where here the X button was, and the ones who reminded her were pretty sure she will have forgotten by tomorrow. When it came to movement, she wasn't any better. When she wanted to move the cursor or walk, she would look at the controller, spot the control sticks, and (assuming she didn't mix them up again) would very carefully move it, like this was her first time driving a car. It was more or less the level of skill Banagher, Takuya, Haro, and Micott expected her to display, but actually seeing it was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she lacked in skill, Audrey more then made up for with her interest in the story. Whenever something new occurred, Audrey would always chime in with her thoughts, especially if it affected one of her theories. An excellent example of this was the scene where each character gave a short introduction. After each one, Audrey said her initial thoughts on them, as well as whether she believed they would be a killer, a victim, or a survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her three most notable reactions during the introductory scene was her reaction to Hifumi. Or more accurately, Hifumi's physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's impossible for us to get like that, right?\" Audrey subconsciously placed a hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere it anybody else who said that, they would've thought they were joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Banagher said with a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a game, Audrey.\" Micott teased in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know.\" An embarrassed Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anybody who should be worried about getting like that, it's Alberto.\" Takuya joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole discussion about weight made Audrey wonder if now might be a good time to tell them that she was the one raiding the fridge at night, and Banagher had a feeling she was thinking about that. Ultimately, Audrey decided not to, as she didn't want to kill the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was at Sakura's introduction. Or rather, right before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's next?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'll go with her.\" Audrey said as she selected Sakura, the pronoun she used surprising the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait,how did you know that was a girl?\" Micott interjected almost the second Audrey refereed to Sakura as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey seemed perplexed by the question. \"She's wearing a skirt, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean she's not a guy wearing a skirt.\" Takuya pointed out what he thought was common knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would a boy wear a skirt?\" The way Audrey said that wasn't condescending, she didn't sound like she thought that would too idiotic for anyone to do, more like she thought it was impossible. \"It's not male fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, yeah, but it's also not male fashion to have your stomach exposed, yet look at Banagher over here!\" Takuya teased with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Banagher blushed a little with a sheepish grin as he fruitlessly tired to pull his hoodie down over his gut. \"You're showing off your stomach too, fatty!\" He shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but at least I can keep my pants closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got you, there, Banagher.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back on topic,\" Audrey sated as she snuggled a little closer to Banagher, feeling their love handles touch. \"Banagher isn't showing his big belly out of fashion,\" Banagher felt like he should've expected her to refer to his stomach with those words. \"he's simply gotten a little too big for his britches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to make that pun for a while, didn't you?\" Was Banagher's only comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third notable reaction Audrey had was after Byakuya's very stand offish introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, thoughts on him?\" Takuya asked, not expecting a single positive word out of Audrey's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if he'll be a victim or a survivor, but he's definitely not a killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-I mean, what part of that makes you think he wouldn't kill a a guy to save his own skin?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wouldn't be a mystery if the most antagonistic character was a killer. I thought it was pretty obvious.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida's eyes slowly opened, the unfamiliar sight of the med bay ceiling greeting her. Well, it wasn't exactly an familiar sight, she had seen the coldness of a medical room before, when she had still yet to find her light. Of course, unlike back then, she was in good hands this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to jump out of bed and go find Banagher and Audrey, she still felt rather weak and tired, which was no surprise. \"Doctor?\" She wearily said, just loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Hasan quickly walked over to his patient and moved the curtains. \"Ah, you're awake. How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt cautious about being treated by a Federation doctor, but thinking back on Banagher and Audrey's words, she tried to force those worries away. After all, she knew they wouldn't leave her with someone she couldn't trust. \"I'm feeling tired and my body is aching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All things considered, you're healing at a remarkable rate. Which isn't surprising, given your enhancements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida subconsciously placed a hand on her stomach, she knew what he meant but talking about her body like that seemed laughable. Then again, she'd be even more out-of-shape if she didn't have those enhancements. \"I see you know about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I actually met two of your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida blinked, she couldn't recall the last time she had talked about her sisters, she couldn't even recall the last time someone brought them up since the end of the First Neo-Zeon War. \"Which ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puru and Puru 2. I didn't know Puru 2 that well, she was only on the Nahel Argama for a day. Puru, however, I knew quite well. She was always so full of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been told she was like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know Puru 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not well, she was often given missions separate from the rest of us. Though I did see her sometimes, she was very feisty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how Judau described her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat name held an interest to Marida, she had been given standing orders by her first master to exterminate him but she never actually saw him, not even during the last battle of the war, which they both participated in. She had no plans to hurt him, but given the history he had with her sisters, she would still like to meet him. \"You know Judau?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I served on this ship during the Gryps Conflict, only member of it's original crew to stick with it. Last time I saw him, Judau left for Jupiter with Roux. I don't know if he ever returned, we haven't kept in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoux. That was another name Marida had heard. Like Judau, Roux was someone Marida and her sisters were given standing orders on, but despite being on opposing sides with her, they were told to protect her. Even all these years after, her first master was still someone she didn't understand. \"I see.\" She wished Hasan's answer was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry for taking up so much of your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm sure you want to see Banagher and Mineva. I'll just call-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey. Her name is Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridge to, err...\" Otto paused, realizing that saying \"Bridge to Banagher's room\" would sound rather unprofessional. \"Bridge to Banagher, the patient has regained consciousness and is waiting for you and Mineva in the med bay. That is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Audrey...\" The princess pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just when we got to Free Time.\" Micott complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will probably want to visit her alone, right?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry we have to leave you again.\" A guilty Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard to-\" Audrey started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you guys. I get it's been a tough week for you but you're just going down the hall.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right, thanks.\" Banagher said as he and Audrey got up, the brunette holding Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to thank us, ten minutes isn't some big sacrifice.\" A bewildered Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Banagher and Audrey's bodies, especially their bellies, got jiggly. Audrey looked down at her belly, also as she expected, she still couldn't see her feet. Watching the large expanse of chub bob and bounce reminded her of Marida's gut. Back when she lived at Palau, which wasn't long ago, she often found herself watching the way Marida's tummy would jiggle whenever she walked. or made any sort of movement, for that matter. She was pretty sure one particularly huge belch the Puru made even caused it to jiggle. Watching Marida's belly didn't give her the same sort of feeling that Banagher's belly did, it was more that she looked at it because of how much of a stark contrast it was with her former fit form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back on that made the Zabi wonder if now Marida would watch hers jiggle, that thought caused her to realize something. \"I just remembered that Marida has no idea how fat I've gotten.\" As she said that, she poked her soft tummy, which gave her finger some leeway before it met resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I mentioned it a few times to her.\" Banagher said, trying to keep himself from staring at his friend's jiggly belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better, but it'll still probably be a huge shock to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they entered the med bay, they were surprised to see Marida was in the middle of a friendly chat with Hasan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My original master never mentioned that Judau was so... odd.\" Marida said in response to something Banagher and Audrey didn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was certainly a headache for captain Bright. They all were.\" Here, Hasan noticed who had entered. \"There you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Marida okay?\" Banagher asked, as Marida nearly did a double take when she realized the huge fatass next to Banagher was the princess of Zeon. Audrey noticed that, which made her feel even more self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine. Just some fatigue and minor aching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your work, doctor.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, though I'm just doing my job.\" Hasan replied, pretty much the most stereotypical answer a doctor could give. \"Now then, I'm sure you'd like some privacy as you talk.\" He then got out of his chair. \"I'll be right outside if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence once he left. Banagher wanted to apologize so badly but he couldn't even began to know how he should say it. Just looking at the wounded Marida was nearly unbearable. \"Why am I even here?\" He thought. \"I'm the one who put her here, I don't deserve to see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida showed a small smile as she looked at them.\"Hello, little bro.\" Those words nearly brought him to tears. \"Bro\" that word sounded so unnatural coming from her. Was the use of such a casual word an attempt to make him feel more comfortable? Or was it that she felt a big sister should use casual words like that to refer to her little brother? Banagher didn't know, and wasn't going to ask, it would feel ungrateful to him. \"Hey, sis.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida then looked at Audrey and said \"And hello, little sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too. I'm glad you're okay but is there something I'm missing? I know you and Banagher are close but when did you decide you were siblings?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Banagher's idea.\" Marida thought back on Banagher's charming, cherubic smile. \"Actually, it was him a few others, but he was the one really pushing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've figured.\" Audrey said as she looked at him. \"It's just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked back at Banagher. \"Don't stare at me like that.\" On paper, those words sounded harsh, like she was reprimanding him. But the way she said made it feel like she was telling him he doesn't have to feel so awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't make easier for Banagher to not stare at her, to not feel awful. \"I'm still a bit fuzzy.\" That was all he could say to her. \"Can you tell me what happened back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what happened either.\" Audrey added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've been swallowed up by the machine. A Psycommu backflow.\" Marida started. \"You're controlling it but then suddenly it's controlling you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher wanted to find relief in those words, but he couldn't, they didn't seem true. \"... That's not what it felt like. I-I remember wanting... to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you did, I hurt you badly. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize!\" Banagher didn't mean to yell, but he couldn't help himself. \"I'm the one who hurt you! I'm the one who needs to apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving him a sympathetic look, AUdrey held Banagher's hand, she could tell from how his breathing calmed that it helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher,\" Marida began, her voice filled with care. \"You were angry at me, you wanted to punish me for hurting you, that's everyone's first reaction to being hurt by someone they care about. But you weren't why it went so far. Your own pain and anger, the amplification of emotions from the Psycho-Frame, and the instinct embedded in that Gundam to seek, hunt down, and destroy Newtypes, even artificial ones, it all made for a violent combination. The way your emotions were influenced to the point you did something you would never do, it's not unlike someone being drugged against their will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I can't, I can't stop feeling guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just further proves it wasn't your will.\" Audrey pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was your will was when the machine stopped. Your will, your foundation, forced the system into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People like me don't have that, that's why we can merge our consciousness with machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind me, you shouldn't be spending a break talking about stuff like this.\" Marida showed him a small smile again. \"I heard you're having a party tonight, would you mind if I join you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that surprised Audrey, Banagher, and Haro was an understatement, and not just because the conversation's mood had been flipped 180 degrees in less then five seconds. \"Don't you have to stay in?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already got permission to leave, I just need to take some pain medication and check in every day.\" Marida explained. \"My original master gave my bodies enhancements as he created me.\" To demonstrate this, Marida got out of bed. Slowly, but with no pain. \"See?\" She was dressed in the typical medical garb, unlike the ones worn in the old world, these were designed with pants, essentially making it proper clothes. That said, one part of the original design that couldn't be fixed was that it would still show off a huge, fat belly, like Marida's. While her bellybutton wasn't showing anymore, the way it hugged her belly wasn't much better. Her belly wasn't the only thing it hugged, it hugged her very chunky legs as well, and it wasn't a good thing either that her fat calves could now be seen. That said, not nearly as much of her flabby legs were shown compared to her arms. The shirt only covered her shoulders and left her huge, bulging bingo wings out in the open for anyone to see how out-of-shape the redhead had gotten. And it wasn't like she was proud to show off the rest of her arms either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do that to you?\" Banagher solemnly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, you mean these?\" Marida placed a hand on the burn mark on her left arm, Banagher was also referring to some scars on her right arm. \"These are years old, silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Banagher said, his face returning to a more normal look, specifically embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know guilt could cause you to forget basic biology.\" Audrey teased. It was a little insensitive but Banagher could tell she was saying that to help him relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I'm surprised by how fat you've gotten, Audrey.\" If Audrey's joke was a little insensitive, then Marida's completely serious remark was a three time gold medal winner in the Insensitivity Olympics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida!\" Her chubby face having turned as red as a tomato in an instant, Audrey futility tried to cover her huge, hanging free belly with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher told me you had gotten fat, but I wasn't expecting you to be as big as him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He still has the bigger belly! ... No offense, it is a very nice belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" Banagher casually said as he rubbed his big belly, which actually did feel kinda nice, like he always had a pillow with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I noticed your clothes are just as ill-fitting as his.\" The oblivious Marida continued. \"Is your stomach cold? You're holding-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please stop this conversation?!\" Audrey begged, covering her gut even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want but I don't see what the problem is. We're only talking about your weight, and I'm just as fat and out-of-shape as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was (mercifully, for Audrey) interrupted by a hearty chuckle from Banagher. Marida was glad to see him feeling better, and Audrey was glad too but she really wished it could've been done a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that topic out of the way, Marida slipped on her slippers and threw on a light tan jacket Hasan had given her, both to look less like a patient and to hide her arm fat. \"So when does the party start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, uh, huh. You know, we never really decided on a time. I guess it's whenever Riddhe and Mihiro show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two good friends, they're members of the ship's crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem, is it?\" Audrey asked, no longer covering her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the room and telling Hasan they were done there, the trio wobbled back to Banagher's room, along with Haro, though he wasn't walking. As per the usual, the bodies of all three engaged in a lot of jiggling and bouncing, especially the stomachs. Marida looked at her little siblings' tummies, just like Audrey, Banagher did truly have the bigger gut of the two. Which wasn't surprising, like as she told Angelo before, Banagher was talented at getting a huge gut. To think just a week ago, it was flat as a board. Of course, Marida did have the biggest gut out of the three of them, but she was also much fatter then them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they engaged in idle chatter, Marida would notice that every now and then, one of the two love birds would be taking a look at the other's tummy and how it bounced. Normally she would've thought it was simple curiosity, but after listening to Banagher describe his journey with her, and seeing their closeness herself, she knew exactly what it was, and she whole-heartily approved of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered Banagher's room, Audrey and Banagher had to go before Marida so all four wouldn't get stuck, the redhead's appearance was a bit of a surprise to Takuya and Micott. Banagher had mentioned to them that Marida was fatter then they were but they didn't think she would be over a hundred pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, didn't know Marida was going to be joining us.\" Micott remarked as Banagher, Audrey, and Haro sat back down with them on the couch, whilst Marida had to use the second couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you should be up already?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already got permission.\" Marida informed, the couch cushion sinking more from her huge bubble butt then the ones the others were using. Her ass was even bigger then Micott's, but were the brunette to pack on enough pounds to rival Marida, she would reclaim her title of having the fattest ass on the Nahel Argama. She wasn't sure if she was ready to accept that title with pride yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, as long as you can really stuff yourself full of food, you're all set for the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida ran a hand over her tummy, this was the first time in months it was fully clothed, not counting her nightgown or pilot suit, but she could still feel it's incredible softness through the fabric. Most people in her situation would never plan to eat so much their belly comes bulging right back out, but for Marida, having fun with Banagher and Audrey was more then reason enough for her. \"Don't worry, I've got more then enough skill when it comes to binging. After all, how do you think I got so fat?\" Marida boasted, giving her belly a hearty slap for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can really pack it away, she once ate twenty six plates in one sitting!\" Banagher bringing that that feat up to his friends brought joy to Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Twenty six?\" An impressed Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And she won Best Eater at two different places!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget that we won that title at the ice cream parlor together.\" Marida reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott really wished she was there to see them win that title, though only for Banagher's part. She wasn't entirely comfortable with Marida's prescience, not only was she the one who kidnapped Banagher, but she was why the fight that killed her class started. Still, Banagher was clearly close to her, so she was going to try to see the good in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I just remembered!\" Before he was about to say it, he realized he should probably ask Marida first. \"Is it okay if we tell them about, you know, how you were born?\" His choice of words got Micott and Takuya interested, so it was a good thing Marida gave him permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Banagher looked back at Takuya and Micott. \"Guys, Marida is also Puru 12.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they drinking anything, Takuya and Micott would've spit it right out. Takuya's would've hit a very annoyed Audrey right in the face, while Micott's would hit the back of Takuya's head. \"What?\" Micott flatly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Marida said like this wasn't a huge revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought all the Purus were killed.\" Micott pointed out, yet she somehow could feel that Marida really was a Puru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them were, as far as I know, I'm the only survivor. I actually don't see why this is so interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cuz we've been watching you for years!\" Takuya suddenly shouted, this startled Audrey (again) and Marida, but it had no effect on the ones more used to his personality, namely Banagher, Micott, and Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" A VERY confused Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth choice of words, dumbass.\" Micott snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, that really came out wrong. I mean we've been watching you on TV, there's an anime based on the First Neo-Zeon War, and all the Purus were in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was? Was Audrey in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I wish I got to voice myself.\" Audrey pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, since you're a Puru,\" A grin started to appear on Micott's round face. \"Does that mean you used to say it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrins suddenly appeared on the faces of the rest of those present except Haro, but if he could, he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Micott started. \"It!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida now looked very embarrassed, it was one of the rare times Banagher and Audrey had ever seen her blush. \"Oh, that... Well, I don't anymore if that's what you're asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it!\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, say it!\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just once?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably couldn't do it even if I tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Marida.\" Audrey asked with her best puppydog eyes, the increased softness of her face made them even more effective. And they were pretty damn effective anyways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just once, is that clear?\" Looking away from the group, here was a pause as she awkwardly rubbed her hands together. \"... Puru puru puru...\"</span></div></div>",

She too was interested about video games, but unlike her little sister, which was a sense of childlike wonder, the redhead's was more out of curiosity as to what her little siblings were so interested in. Upon finishing the second Free Time event, Audrey figured now was a good time to try out a different game. Once asked what they should play next, Banagher, Takuya, Haro, and Micott had some difficulty coming up with an answer. Since this was her first time, they wanted her to play something she wouldn't lose at during her first session. Danganronpa fit the bill perfectly for that, but they didn't want her to play another visual novel just yet, as that might give her the wrong idea of what most video games are like. Given that her skills were, put bluntly, absolutely horrendous, there weren't many other games they were certain she could tackle yet. Even a Zelda or Mario game was dubious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, I've got an idea.\" Takuya was the one who came up with a game. He got up and waddled over to one of the boxes that held Banagher's games and started shuffling through  \"You know, we probably it, hoping it had the one specific game he was looking for. \"You know, we probably should've set your room up before throwing a party in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but I'm really not feeling up to it.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone-\" Audrey was going to finish it with \"a little lazy\" but she realized just in time that would come off as making fun of Banagher's very justified fatigue. \"Er, really tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're still tired tomorrow, I could set it up for you.\" The ever dutiful Marida suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but I should do it myself. Besides, you don't where I'd like to put my stuff.\" Banagher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" Takuya said as he pulled his game of choice out. \"This here's a little obscure gem called Fable 3. Well, pretty much every game's obscure to you, but anyways, it's got a lot of story to it, parts of the gameplay that don't involve fighting, and what does isn't too hard, and it's co-op, so Banagher'll be there to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question, what's 'co-op'?\" Audrey asked, very clearly unaware of what was and wasn't common knowledge among gamers, which she was trying to consider herself one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It mean you play the game with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what we're already doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Co-op is when you and someone else play the game at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?!\" A very excited Audrey said a sort of childlike wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've REALLY got a lot to teach you.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot to mention you can make your character fat.\" Banagher pointed out, patting his chubby belly cheerfully for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Can't believe I forgot that when we're all, you know.\" Takuya looked down at his stomach and jiggled it. He noted that it wasn't as giant ad Banagher's, but it was still pretty damn big, so he felt he had earned a few peaks from Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that an option?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun.\" Micott answered. Even Audrey knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm understanding this right, you create your own character in this game, right?\" Audrey asked s Takuya handed her the game case. Just to look at the art though, she had no idea how to put a game disc in a console yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though it works differently then most games.\" Banagher began. \"Your character's appearance changes based on what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never would've thought a video game could have a feature like that.\" The amazed princess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Fable 3 was the first proper video Audrey played, if one counted visual novels as something else, so it was fitting that it starred a princess. One who leads a rebellion against a tyrannous kingdom run by her own family no less. Upon starting the game and being asked to pick the gender of the hero, it was very clear that even this little bit of control she had over the game amazed her, which the others found endearing. After picking her outfit, going with the Elegant Princess outfit, a choice that didn't surprise anyone, she started exploring the castle courtyard at the very beginning of the game. She asked how she could make her hero gain weight, figuring her avatar should look a little more like her, and was disappointed when Micott told her there's no place to get food yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after her first real battle, a swarm of bats that dealt very little damage but Banagher was there to help just in case, that Mihiro, Riddhe, and Shin walked in, each carrying a bunch of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys. Ready to eat? You must be starving, Banagher.\" Mihiro said as she and the others each put down their respective hauls, but when she looked at her fellow party members, she was very confused to see that Banagher was just as fat as ever. In fact, Mihiro was pretty sure he was even fatter! \"Erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do something wrong?\" A confused Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I thought being a prisoner would make you lose some weight.\" She felt she said that a little too harshly but she couldn't really think of another way. \"You know, since you wouldn't be given a lot of food.\" She looked at the huge gut that filled up Banagher's lap, the result of many binges. It wasn't the only result either, there was also those man boobs that rested on it, that huge butt filled the chair in the Unicorn's cockpit, chunky and out-of-shape legs, and that adorable round and double-chinned face. Despite it all, he was still incredibly soft and jiggly, like he was never even gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida took really good care of me.\" Smirking, Banagher rubbed his chubby belly as he thought back on all the tasty meals Marida stuffed him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made sure he never went hungry. He even won Best Eater.\" Marida complimented, obviously proud of her fat, little bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we won that together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro couldn't tell if Marida kidnapped him or adopted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's focus shifted to Shin. \"Have we met? You look kinda familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot you two don't know each other.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Shin Matsunaga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're the White Wolf? That Shin Matsunaga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think I'd still be well-known among Federation citizens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've played as you in games!' A starstruck Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to show me that game later.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so unreal, I'm surrounded by people I've seen in games and TV!\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd react like that.\" Micott commented, an amused look on her face. \"You should've seen Takuya when they met. Pretty sure he pissed himself in excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not.\" Takuya whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey's told me a lot about you, Banagher.\" Shin started as she sat down in a chair next to the couch Marida was using. \"She tells me you're everything she could ask for in a knight and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I'm glad I'm doing a good job. Wasn't expecting you to call me her knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was her words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then looked at Audrey, who felt all eyes were on her. \"I thought we were joking when we talking about how I'm your knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed. \"I may have seriously called you my knight on one or two occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should keep calling him that, it's cute.\" Mihiro commented as she smiled and took a seat with Riddhe on the couch Marida was using. While she said that, Takuya looked over at Micott, the brunette didn't show it but Takuya knew she wished she could call Banagher her knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to be cute.\" Audrey pouted, her soft chubbiness make her look even cuter, especially the chubbiness of her face, a side effect of her weight gain she did not appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been too long, Banagher. How are you holding up?\" Riddhe asked in a friendly way, showing an equally friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher opened his mouth but for a moment, nothing came out. He REALLY wanted to say he was good as new, or something to that effect, but he couldn't bring himself to lie that much to his friends, even if it was for their sake. \"I'm still kinda, you know out of it, but it's great to be back.\" He scratched the back of his head. \"A-Anyways, how are we going to do the eating contest? Round-based like last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Takuya said through a mouthful of chips. Thankfully he finished chewing before he started to explain things, or else else Banagher, Audrey, and Marida wouldn't be able to understand him. \"This time we're just going to see who can eat the most, works way better with a party this way. Same teams as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I join in?\" Marida asked, figuring her gut was big enough to fill up a whole team. Marida demolishes the competition with her gut</span></div></div>",

He handed her her beer but just as they were about to start drinking they suddenly found them yanked from their hands as Mihiro said \"Give me that!\" She glared at them like a mother would, a glare most people could instantly identify as that of a worried mother. They couldn't explain why, but somehow to Takuya and Micott, Mihiro's chubby body, which had a lot of weight go to her ass and legs, made her give off even more of a motherly feeling. \"I can't believe you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught these two trying to drink beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Audrey instantly paused her game, which annoyed Banagher, and joined Mihiro in glaring at them, glaring that Marida joined in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon, it's a party.\" Micott defended herself and her pal. \"Everyone does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like we drink all the time.\" Takuya argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be drinking at all.\" Mihiro was about to say that, but Audrey beat her to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too.\" Micott whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've known whose side she'd take.\" Shin chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me out here, Banagher. Maybe they'll listen to you.\" Audrey requested, using this as an excuse to pat Banagher's belly to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher didn't look too concerned. \"it's not really a big deal.\" He casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!\" Audrey glared daggers at him, daggers that were dulled by both how close they were, and how chubby her double-chinned face was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, they're not even not even the heaviest drinkers at her parties.\" He noted that he probably shouldn't have used the term \"heaviest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you've been at those parties.\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\" He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you.\" Audrey chided, she didn't yell but her disappointment was conveyed just as well as if she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, you have a problem,\"The way Marida said that reminded Banagher of his mom. Sometimes he forgot Marida was only eighteen. \"And we're going to help you through this. the first step is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah! You guys completely have the wrong idea.\" Micott interpreted. \"Banagher is like, the only person at my parties who doesn't drink or smoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's completely straight-edge, and I don't get how you thought for even a second that a guy like him would even touch the stuff.\" Takuya had trouble even imagining Banagher doing any sort of drugs or alcohol. Well, maybe wine but that would solely be when he's an adult, and only because Audrey was drinking it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" An embarrassed Audrey said. \"Sorry, I should've known you were \"hard-edged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight edge.\" Takuya corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too.\" Marida said. \"I could cook you some pasta as an apology if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, no wonder Banagher's fatter then ever.\" Takuya said as he looked at Banagher's massive belly, the jiggly orb filling up his lap and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, no worries. Let just get back to the game.\" Banagher said, with is trademark reassuring grin, a grin that allowed Audrey to grin too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we still have to find the relic.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you want me to make any pasta?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher told her she didn't have to, Mihiro elbowed Riddhe in the gut, making it jiggle. \"You should've said something, this was a serious conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when do I have to be a part of every conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe partygoers ate like there was no tomorrow, which was a pretty good attitude to have for a party. Whether it was sweets like ice cream or fast food like hamburgers, it all went into their growing bellies. They could all feel their bellies swelling up, getting bigger and fuller, pressing more against the waistband of their pants. Or short shorts, in Micott's case. If someone just met them and saw them like this, they'd  think their stomachs had never seen a single skinny day in their life. Micott and Takuya were mainly eating classic junk food like potato chips and the like, along with some burgers and pizza. They drank plenty of soda, no party was complete without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher were enjoying a similar diet, but without the chicken. Looking to rectify that, Banagher said \"Hey, Taku -URP- ya, can you pass the chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem. BUUURRP!\" He said and belched as he handed over a bucket of chicken, which he correctly assumed Banagher wanted instead of the nuggets. His stomach was looking swollen and was pressing against the waistband of his belt even more hone usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, good one.\" Banagher pulled out a drumstick and starting eating it, earning a curious look from Audrey. Which he had long learned by now wasn't hard to earn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" The princess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Banagher swallowed and then charmingly burped. \"It's chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen chicken like that before. It looks like a weapon, like some kind of mace\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled. \"Guess it kinda does. It's called drumstick chicken. You wanna try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"Audrey paused their game and was handed two drumsticks by Banagher. She looked at them hesitatingly, they were easily the most bizarre looking food she had even seen. Granted, she knew was naive in that department, but she still felt her opinion counted for something. She slowly took a bite, partly because she was unsure about eating it and partly because it was a lot harder to chew then she thought. And then just like that, she did a complete 180.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face lit up and she started ferociously taking bits out of her chicken, alternating between each one. The speed was eating at was incredible, it actually impressed Banagher and the others. This was almost the most enthusiastic anyone had seen her over food. The others had trouble saying anything as they saw her chew and chew, stripping pieces off of her drumsticks with a truly ravenous appetite. It was like she was going too fast to even enjoy the taste, though she certainly was enjoying it, and that was exactly like she was being such an eating machine. Crumbs were getting all over her lips and cheeks, and the normally very polite princess didn't seem to give a damn. The speed at which she was eating was even greater then that of some professional eaters. Banagher couldn't say way, but for some reason this was really hot. if he wasn't so amazed he would be cheering her on to eat the entire bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good God, Audrey, slow -UURP- down! You're going to eat yourself sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose concerned words from Mihiro snapped Audrey out of her gluttonous stupor. She needed a second to process what she had done, and when she did, her chubby cheeks grew scarlet. \"Sorry! BBBBUUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" She looked at how much of the drumsticks she had eaten, which was a lot, and then down at her huge tummy, past her plentiful tits. It was definitely more swollen then before, if her pants and coat still had their buttons her little eating frenzy would've definitely popped them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, let her -BURP- enjoy herself.\" Riddhe placed a soft hand on Mihiro's soft shoulder. \"It's what partying is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and besides, that was really awesome.\" Banagher said, his grin showed how impressed he was by his friend's gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Audrey asked, her chubby face looked pleased to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've never seen a girl go to town on chicken like that before.\" Banagher said, unknowingly making Micott jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were your father here he'd say you can eat even more then he can.\" Shin's lips formed a nostalgic smirk. \"Without realizing that you could take offense to that, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've truly got an appetite -BWWOORP- to match Banagher's.\" Marida said before she resumed digging into her ice cream. She thought on how adorable they must look at dinner dates, just completely demolishing all the food in site as a couple, and then giving each other sweet belly rubs after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I knew you were good, Audrey, -BUURRARP- but not that good!\" An amazed Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that means we're losing, -BOOOORRP-, right?\" Micott pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Audrey and Banagher completed the first real quest of Fable 3 and had earned themselves some pocket change, it was time for them to use the long awaited weight gain system. Three times Audrey had asked Banagher if they could make their characters fat yet. The first was naturally at the start of the game, the second was when they entered the Dweller Camp (which turned out to be a a bit inappropriate, as she learned literally seconds later the people living in it were suffering from starvation), and the final time was upon arriving at Brightwall. But now it was time. When they headed to the food stalls Banagher said \"Let's plump them up.\" but Audrey surprisingly suggested they don't have their Heroes reach obesity yet. Instead she proposed that they only have them gain a little weight for now, saying that it would be more interesting to have them slowly gain weight during the story, you know, much like they had themselves. Banagher said it was a good idea and Riddhe teased that Audrey is really putting a lot of thought into how she and Banagher are going to make their characters fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after their Heroes had their first binge, and demonstrated their belching prowess, Audrey and Banagher decided to switch to a new game. Both to switch hings up and because Micott and Takuya complained about how they wanted to play. Speaking of switching, they went with Super Smash Brothers. Banagher wasn't sure about that, Audrey's reaction times were still abysmal, and not only was Smash Bros a fast game but now she would be going up against other players. Micott was able to convince him saying they'll all just play against the CPU. It was a fun experience for them all but Audrey wasn't much help. She enjoyed herself but she was clearly rather overwhelmed and not able to do much. She wished she was able to help more but the others reminded her that the point was to have fun, which she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they were playing this game that they became noticeably bloated, making their respective performances more sluggish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof. BUUUURRP!\" Takuya removed one hand from his controller to place on his belly and massage it, his belt was very close to breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Micott burped loudly as their bellies gurgled, stilling holding their controllers. The male brunette was glad his button and belt had been popped beforehand, it made being this bloated way more comfortable, while the female brunette was on the verge of popping the button on her short shorts. On the other couch Marida was seen still shoveling loads of ice cream into her mouth with one hand and rubbed her gut with the other, already the lower parts of her top were starting to part as her swelling belly pushed them apart. She was both the one who had eaten the most food so far and the one who was the least full, she was completely correct in thinking she could eat enough to make up for her lack of a partner. Riddhe and Mihiro next to her had first class seats to all her gorging and belching. It both impressed them and made it clear how completely outclassed they were by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Riddhe and Mihiro, they had to take a complete break from eating to give their tummies some much needed rubs. \"OOOORRRP! I'm going to put on so much weight from this.\" Mihiro said as she looked down at her big belly, her uniform's belt was visibly straining. \"How much bigger is this thing going to get?\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No regrets though, -UUURRAAP- right?\" Riddhe said, his belt in the same state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at -BUURRP- all. For me at least, my waistline -BURP- has plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Banagher? BUUURRRUURP!\" Audrey belched, still holding her controller with both hands despite her belly asking for rub, she simply wanted to play that much. Like Banagher, she was very swollen and very glad she had already popped off all her buttons. Though she wished she had popped them here, where she could impress her friends. \"What does the B button do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher burped again. \"The B button makes you -BUUURRRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The B button makes you burp?\" Audrey blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the B button makes you -OOORARRRP-! It makes you -URRRRRRRP-! It makes you -BURURRRARP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! BUURRP! This is so -URRRAARRP- annoying! BUUURRURP! Where's the off button on this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly! BUUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir already bloated stomachs grew even larger as they kept eating and eating. It was pretty amazing how much Audrey, Banagher, Micott, and Takuya were able to eat while gaming, having no problem at all keeping up with the others. Everyone's eating speed was starting to slow down and they found themselves having to take more breaks, Mihiro in particular. With how much bigger their already bloated bellies were getting as they kept on eating and eating, it didn't take long for the buttons to start flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe partygoers ate like there was no tomorrow, which was a pretty good attitude to have for a party. Whether it was sweets like ice cream or fast food like hamburgers, it all went into their growing bellies. They could all feel their bellies swelling up, getting bigger and fuller, pressing more against the waistband of their pants. Or short shorts, in Micott's case. If someone just met them and saw them like this, they'd  think their stomachs had never seen a single skinny day in their life. Micott and Takuya were mainly eating classic junk food like potato chips and the like, along with some burgers and pizza. They drank plenty of soda, no party was complete without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on Micott's short shorts was the first one to go, blasted off her big, gurgling tummy, exposing some of her underwear. Micott's only response was to belch loudly for the umpteenth time as she looked down at her gut, but in a pleasant surprise, she actually got a response from Banagher. He gave her a thumbs up and said that pretty good, that she really sent that thing flying. Micott thanked him and couldn't stop herself from having a huge smile that her chubby cheeks and double chin made even cuter. Takuya teased her on how Banagher always brings out her biggest smiles, which made her pout at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's belt and pants button went next, not long after Micott's button. It happened right after he ate another big handful of chips, finishing his fifth bag of them, and downed it with more soda. He sighed in relief as his tummy bugled forward. The freckled brunette took it as a sign he and Micott were making good progress in the contest. He was also pleased to see that Micott was currently looking at this gut, impressed with it, but before either of them said something, Banagher took the opportunity to get a little friendly payback at him over what he said about his inability to wear a belt. Though Takuya shot back (after burping) that he had to stuff himself to break his belt, Banagher didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Well...\" That was Banagher's weak comeback as he adorably pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little smirk on her face, Audrey placed a hand on her pal's gut and stroked it. \"He's got you there, Bana -OOORRRP- gher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was to burp as he kept pouting, which Audrey though was incredibly cute. She couldn't help it, she just had to pinch those puffy creeks. \"Marida is right, you are a puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Riddhe and Mihiro's belts were snapped in half. Riddhe's went first, not surprising since he was the better eater of the two. When it did, he sighed in relief, he and Mihiro already were nearly at their limits, and pat it, then went right back to eating, unaware of Mihiro staring at his tummy. \"To think he used to be skinny just a week ago. I don't get how he can be so nonchalant about it... and why am I still looking at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -UUUUURRP- need something?\" Riddhe casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H -URP- Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're staring at me like you want something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wasn't staring! UUUUURRP!' Mihiro quickly turned her red face away from started shoveling cookies into her mouth as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe stared at her in confusion for a few seconds before he shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later was when Mihiro's belt broke. She leaned back in defeat, moaning with her hands on her gut. \"That's it. BUUUURRRP! I can't eat any -BUUURRP- more, I'll explode.\" She moaned again as she slowly rubbed her beach ball of a gut with both hands, desperate to sooth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe was in a similar sate as her, not feeling quite as defeated but definitely feeling just as stuffed. He too was leaning back and rubbing his belly.\"OOOORRRP! Whew, I was hoping -UUURRRRARP- we wouldn't come in last place again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least that means we'll gain the least weight out of -BURP- everyone.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thirty minutes later and right after their latest match, Takuya put his controller down and leaned back, hands on his swollen gut as he sighed. \"I think I'm too -UURRAARRP- stuffed for more Smash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three immediately followed suit. \"Oof, yeah, me too BUUURRP!\" Micott groaned as she rubbed her belly. The she and friends were right next to each other with their bellies bulging out almost made it look they were a group of giant Haros sitting side by side. Haro actually sitting next to Banagher helped the comparison. \"Let's switch to some -URP- thing a little slower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Audrey said before she burped again in an unladylike manner. It was certainly unbecoming of a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher licked some ice cream off his lips. \"Hmm... How about Pokemon? BOOOORRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya burped. \"Oh yeah! BURRRP!We've still got an extra copy of Pokemon Shield, right? I'll go get it.\" Grunting, Takuya heaved himself with all his might, and even then it still took a few seconds for him to get up. Not that anyone blamed him for having trouble with that while he was still so incredibly bloated. When was able to launch himself off the couch, he landed a good foot away with an \"Oof.\". Cradling his belly, he slowly lumbered along to one of the boxes, letting out a groan or a belch here and there looking like he was about to fall over any second now and take forever to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -URP- want me to get it?\" A concerned Mihiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, that's fine. You just stay there and digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'll get it. I'm not bloated.\" Shin was correct, he was the only one in the room who hadn't overeaten, not counting Haro for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know what it looks like. UURRRRP!\" Takuya was partly correct. While it would take a little longer for someone who isn't familiar with the box art to pick out, the giant, colorful letters reading \"Pokemon Shield\" would be more then enough of a hint for even Audrey. However, he was way too stuffed to the gills to realize that. Plus he really didn't want these painful step that made his belly slosh and jiggle to be in vain. When he got over to the box, he took a small break before she bent over and rummaged around in it, unaware that Micott had been paying great attention to his massive ass, as she had been since he started slowly waddling to the box, each step making his legs and butt jostle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't excited when he saw that the game was at the very bottom of the box, but still, he had to grab it. Bending over a little, the squishing did not help with the rumblings in his gut, and picked it up. \"Got it! OOORRRARP!\" He said as he grabbed, standing up as quickly as he could in his bloated condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, please bring it over here.\" Audrey requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" As much as he didn't want to, Takuya started slowly lumbering back to the couch, it was just as uncomfortable as it was last time. In fact, it was actually felt worse, since this time it was adding discomfort onto discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, Takuya! You can do it!\" Haro cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you -OOOORRRRP- want me to help?\" Marida asked after gulping down another mouthful of ice cream. She shoveled another one into her greedy mouth right after she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. UUURRAARP! I'm fine.\" Takuya said, wobbling even slower then he was the first time. When he finally reached the couch, he ungracefully flopped down onto it, his soft and plentiful tummy and moobs jostling. He let out a big sigh of relief, he reminded Banagher of how he and Marida looked that one time they jogged to the Bistro Gleissner. \"Here you go.\" The poor guy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to put it in the Switch, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya did not look amused. \"... You do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Micott did it and the game started up, Audrey was clearly blown away by the graphics. Compared to the good but outdated graphics of Fable 3, the stylized  drawings of Danganronpa, the mix of realism and carton that was Super Smash Brothers' art style, Pokemon Shield's incredibly colorful graphics were something she had never seen. And when she saw the Dynamax feature in the opening, after only just comprehending the basic idea of the game, she was truly amazed. If one was to only look at her chunky face with zero context, they'd think she was watching a fireworks show. When it was time for Audrey to pick her starter, she went with Scorbunny, whom she took a liking to as soon as she saw her. Of course, she liked all three, but Scorbunny was the one she could look and immediately pick. In terms of appearance, she went well with Banagher's Sobble. Takuya had a Grooky while Micott also picked Sobble, though hers was a girl, unlike Banagher's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they played, Riddhe, who had noticed a while ago how much of a big eater Marida was for ice cream, asked her about it. \"I see you're a big fan of ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida had just finished her latest bowl. She let her spoon drop into. She wiped off the splotches of ice cream that was on her lips and cherubic cheeks, and then belched loudly \"BUUUUURRRP! Excuse me. It's my favorite.\" here, she looked a little embarrassed, a bit of a blush to her puffy cheeks. \"Though I'm sure you could tell, since, well...\" Rather then finish that sentence, she choose to look down at the piles of empty bowls and give her giant, stuffed gut a few pats before belching loudly. \"UUUURRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't exaggerating when said you could tell just from the bowls that ice cream was her favorite. On the coffee table in front of her couch, there was five piles of empty bowls, each pile had at least three bowls, most of them had more. It was like that gag in cartoons where a character would be shown with a huge pile of empty plates after an enormous meal, but this was real. Before today Riddhe didn't think it was possible to impress him with eating prowers anymore, after all he had spent nearly a week living with Audrey, but Marida was here to prove him wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty impress -URRRRRP- ive. As you can see,\" Riddhe gave a light slap to his stomach, jiggling it. \"URRRRRRP! I can't eat nearly as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked a little surprised, she wasn't expecting her ability to gorge herself to impress anyone but Audrey and Banagher. Her surprise and embarrassment then left her visage, returning to her normal, stoic but fat look. \"You may have come in last place but you ate much more then -URP- most people can. That's an achievement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So is this the first time you've been in an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though I've won Best Eater at two different places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I used to think Audrey -BWWAAARP- and Banagher had this in the bag but now I'm not sure.\" Mihiro commented as she massaged her aching tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey wanted to complete the Pokedex but that wasn't the main reason she was catching every new Pokemon she came across, it was because each new one she found instantly interested her. The first one she caught was Wooloo, who she loved because he was sweet, round, and fluffy, just like Banagher. Banagher was about to tell her about the evolution feature but Takuya stopped him and told him they shouldn't spoil it for her, so she'll be surprised when it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer most notable capture was Stufful, not because of the Pokemon himself but because how capturing it went. At level 13, it was higher then most of her Pokemon but still manageable. Once she got his health into the red, she threw a Pokeball at him, only for him to break free. So threw another at him, which he also broke free of. She threw it again, and again, and again. When she asked the others what she was doing wrong, they couldn't explain why, she did everything wrong, it just looked like she was having bad luck. She kept on throwing Pokeballs, even as most of her Pokemons' health got low. Takuya suggested leaving and coming back to Stufful but Audrey immediately shot that down after she burped again, saying he was too cute to wait on. Thankfully her persistence eventually paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it was a good time for her to try out the camping feature. Again Audrey's chubby face lit up as she played with her Pokemon, though you could argue it was lit the entire time she was playing. She was truly just as full of joy as she was food and soda as she played with her Pokemon. When she tried cooking curry Audrey looked interested in it. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's curry. I used to make it all the time during camping trips with my family.\" Takuya explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Looks delicious.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still hungry?\" Micott said before eating a huge handful of pretzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, I prefer the term curious.\" Audrey said as she ruffled a bit of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, while Audrey was preparing more curry, Takuya let out a massive belch, easily his biggest that whole night. \"BWWWAARRRP! Alright, I'm stuffed. I've gotta drop out before I explode.\" He pat his tummy in a satisfied fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still -BURRRRRP- I'm still in the game.\" Micott forced more pretzels into her mouth, she then grunted as her tummy gurgled loudly. She took a break from eating to rub it, she could feel it gurgle. \"Ah, forget it. Third place ain't bad when it's up against you two gluttons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G -BUUURRRP- Glutton?\" Audrey blushed, placing a hand on her soft tummy as she looked down at it. She still couldn't even see her feet. \"I'm not a glutton, right, Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm just going to sit here and belch. Uh... belch.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While everyone was still chatting like normal, and Audrey wasn't done with Pokemon yet, the eating contest was starting to become as entertaining as a good show or video game. So it was natural that they would discuss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who -URP- do you guys think is gonna win?\" Takuya asked, he and Micott were still massaging their gurgling stomachs. \"My money's on Banagher and Audrey. I mean, just look at them -BUURRRRP- eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Marida is way bigger. BUUURP! Err, no offense.\" Riddhe said, he and Mihiro tending to their own bellies. Out of all of them, Mihiro seemed to be handling her stomachache the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None -BWAAAP- taken. it's not like you said was untrue.\" Marida finished another bowl of ice cream, then immediately began scooping chocolate ice cream out of it's cartoon and placed the scoops into the large bowl. Belching, she rubbed her now completely exposed stomach with one hand as she did the scooping with the other. \"if anything, it's a compliment in this context, since having the bigger belly is my key to -UUUURRAARP- victory.\" Showing a rare, small competitive smirk, she gave her gut a proud slap, she belched again as it jiggled, the jiggling emphasizing her point further. Even as packed full as she was, the Puru's stomach still had plenty of jiggle to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen you this pumped up -UUUURRRP- since we won Best Eater at the parlor.\" Banagher commented, looking at the way her tummy jostled and swayed from the impact of her pudgy palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you even get like this -BEEEELLCH- when you're in a battle.\" Audrey said, also looking at Marida's jiggles as she chowed down on a hamburger. Saying theta reminded her of how much trouble Marida has when she tires to zip up her normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, BURARARP! But you're both pretty pumped too.\" Micott commented, rubbing her underbelly. \"And it's two on one. ORARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm actually engaging in this discussion, but that's a moot point. UURRRAARR!\" Mihiro said as she tenderly rubbed the middle of her gut with both hands. \"Marida is as big as the two of them combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida gulped down another spoonful of ice cream. \"Actually, that's not true. I'm not THAT big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya casually burped. \"So that just leaves Haro and Shin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have faith in the princess and Banagher.\" Shin answered as he fondly looked on at them as they kept pigging out and gaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! Me too!\" Haro said as he excitedly started bouncing on Banagher's big belly, each bounce forcing a burp out of the poor guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! BURP! Haro, -URRRRRP- watch the -BOOORRP- belly! UUURRRRP!\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at this, though said giggling was quickly interrupted by a startled belch she let out once Haro decided to start bouncing on her huge belly instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were already so full, it took way longer then one would think for them to start slowing down. Whether it was ice cream, cake, chips, pretzels, cookies, hot dogs, burgers, or whatever, they just keep on shoveling more of it into their mouths, their bellies growing with every gulp. While Marida and Banagher were sitting normally, with their massive bellies past their laps, Audrey was sitting with her legs crossed, which meant the sides of her gut were touching her legs. Banagher thought she looked pretty cute like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Banagher grunted and ten burped loudly as he rubbed his stomach, his round face showing some exhaustion. \"Oof. BBBUURRRP! Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" A concerned Audrey asked, taking a quick break from her gorging to check up on him. She saw that his belly was nearly as large as it was when they finished their \"reunion binge\" (as they liked to call it), which is to say it was nearly the most bloated Audrey have ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm -URP- fine.\" Banagher said before he resumed eating a bag of chips. \"How about you?\" He said through a mouthful, Audrey barely able to understand what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk with your mouthful.\" Audrey then burped into her fist. \"And I'm fine too, thank you for asking.\" She looked down at her gut, seeing that it too was starting to reach the size it had at the end of the reunion binge. \"Though I think I'm going to need some belly rubs to get through this.\" Smirking, she grabbed Banagher's pudgy hand, she nearly dropped it out of surprise (having never touched a salt covered hand before), and led it over to the top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll be happy to oblige. Though I'm gonna need some too.\" Smirking as well, his had more emphasis from his chubby cheeks, Banagher did the same with Audrey's hand, a hand which still wasn't used to the feeling of a salt covered one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies. Still smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended and Banagher saw Audrey's emerald green eyes as she saw his chocolate brown eyes, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly rubs really helped but as much as they did, Audrey ten minutes later could feel herself reaching her limit, and looking at Banagher told her that he was too. Looking at Marida told her a different story though, she looked stuffed but ready for more. She had to keep massaging her big gut, which let out some gurgles here and there, often announcing a belch was coming up, but her fat, double chinned face showed no signs of fatigue. Audrey never would've thought gluttony could look intimidating but here she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she got an idea, and her face showed that instead of fatigue. She whispered something to Banagher, who looked interested. \"You sure that will work?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works in porker-I mean poker.\" Was her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida heard that and while a bit curious about it, she simply decided to not interject herself into that conversation. It was obviously private if Audrey whispered most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two suddenly stopped whispering amongst themselves, then shifted their blubbery bodies back to face the table filled with food. Marida couldn't help but notice the glances one would shoot the other as they slowly ate around a cupcake or a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marida was casually talking with Riddhe, she found their conversation to be interrupted by the unmistakable sounds of cheerful giggling. She and the blond stopped talking and looked at the source of said giggling, which was Audrey and Banagher, who Marida expected to be the source. Almost as soon as they looked t them, the chubby couple forced themselves to stop giggling. With that oddity seemingly over, Marida and Riddhe returned to their chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was far from the last time Marida or Riddhe caught them doing something suspicious. Every now and then Marida would have to take a break form eating to look at her little siblings, who would immediately stop whatever they were doing, be it mischievous giggling or equally mischievous whispering. One time when Marida caught them they opted to distract her with some belching. Which they probably needed to do anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as all three bellies grew even more bloated, the giggling didn't cease, if anything, it seemed to become even more common. Each bout of giggling or whispering made Marida even more curious, it was very clearly related to her somehow, and most likely the eating contest too, but what could you say about an eating contest that's so important you'd want it secret? How do you strategize an eating contest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Marida had to take a break from eating. She let he spoon drop into her bowl of ice cream and immediately leaned back into the couch. She unleashed a mighty \"BUUUUURRRAAARRRP!\"as she massaged her blubbery belly with both hands, letting out a few more burps. here, she heard Audrey and Banagher giggling again, but this time when she looked at them, they weren't able to contain it. \"Alright, -OOOORRRRP- what are you two plotting?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you caught us. UUUUURRRRP!\" Banagher said, he and Audrey were still grinning. \"It was a good plan, Audrey. Guess we got -BWWWAARP- a little too enthusiastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRAPPP! Ah... haha... yeah, but it was so much fun, I couldn't stop giggling!\" His bloated partner in crime said as each give the other a soothing belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we saw how you kept eating without looking at all tired while we were running out of energy, we actually considered giving up.\" Audrey began. \"But that gave me an idea, what if the roles were reversed? What if we looked like we could eat far more then you? So we hid how tired we were and made you believe that we ready for five more courses.\" She then placed her free hand on her very bloated tummy. \"Of course, that didn't really work out.  UUUURRRRP! Oof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida showed a small smile on her double-chinned face. \"Well, that's the quite the impressive plan you come up with. It's -BEEEELLCH- a good thing I caught you when I did. I'm not sure how much more ice cream my stomach could've handled.\" here she gave a few pats to her orb-shaped middle. \"BUUUUURRRRRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

This was a match that could go either way. While Marida was mush fatter then both of them, and could definitely defeat one of them alone, the amount of food the fat princess and her obese knight could pack away together was truly impressive, plus they could also give each other belly rubs. But even with that in mind, Marida was still an eating machine who had won Best Eater twice. So the question was which was more powerful, blubber from months of pigging out, or blubber from pigging out with a dear friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size their bellies reached amazed the other party members, Audrey and Banagher already had some impressive bellies, each one being a huge ball of dough, with Banagher's being even bigger then Audrey's, and Marida's was even bigger then Banagher's gut. While the brunette and blonde's tummies were already hanging out for all to see even before the party, the redhead's actually forced the lower part of her top to spread, like someone opening a door and revealing themselves. Already each of the remaining contenders had eaten enough to make their stomachs swell to greatly. And as their bellies grew bigger, so did their belches, some of them reaching a level of sound that was able to send vibrations through the air. They also became more common as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone was still chatting like normal, and Audrey wasn't done with Pokemon yet, the eating contest was starting to become as entertaining as a good show or video game.

Saying theta reminded her of how much trouble Marida has when she tires to zip up her normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, BURARARP! But you're both pretty pumped too.\" Micott commented, rubbing her underbelly. \"And it's two on one. ORARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm actually engaging in this discussion, but that's a moot point. UURRRAARR!\" Mihiro said as she tenderly rubbed the middle of her gut with both hands. \"Marida is as big as the two of them combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida gulped down another spoonful of ice cream. \"Actually, that's not true. I'm not THAT big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya casually burped. \"So that just leaves Haro and Shin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have faith in the princess and Banagher.\" Shin answered as he fondly looked on at them as they kept pigging out and gaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! Me too!\" Haro said as he excitedly started bouncing on Banagher's big belly, each bounce forcing a burp out of the poor guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! BURP! Haro, -URRRRRP- watch the -BOOORRP- belly! UUURRRRP!\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at this, though said giggling was quickly interrupted by a startled belch she let out once Haro decided to start bouncing on her huge belly instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were already so full, it took way longer then one would think for them to start slowing down. Whether it was ice cream, cake, chips, pretzels, cookies, hot dogs, burgers, or whatever, they just keep on shoveling more of it into their mouths, their bellies growing with every gulp. While Marida and Banagher were sitting normally, with their massive bellies past their laps, Audrey was sitting with her legs crossed, which meant the sides of her gut were touching her legs. Banagher thought she looked pretty cute like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Banagher grunted and ten burped loudly as he rubbed his stomach, his round face showing some exhaustion. \"Oof. BBBUURRRP! Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" A concerned Audrey asked, taking a quick break from her gorging to check up on him. She saw that his belly was nearly as large as it was when they finished their \"reunion binge\" (as they liked to call it), which is to say it was nearly the most bloated Audrey have ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm -URP- fine.\" Banagher said before he resumed eating a bag of chips. \"How about you?\" He said through a mouthful, Audrey barely able to understand what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk with your mouthful.\" Audrey then burped into her fist. \"And I'm fine too, thank you for asking.\" She looked down at her gut, seeing that it too was starting to reach the size it had at the end of the reunion binge. \"Though I think I'm going to need some belly rubs to get through this.\" Smirking, she grabbed Banagher's pudgy hand, she nearly dropped it out of surprise (having never touched a salt covered hand before), and led it over to the top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll be happy to oblige. Though I'm gonna need some too.\" Smirking as well, his had more emphasis from his chubby cheeks, Banagher did the same with Audrey's hand, a hand which still wasn't used to the feeling of a salt covered one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies. Still smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended and Banagher saw Audrey's emerald green eyes as she saw his chocolate brown eyes, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly rubs really helped but as much as they did, Audrey ten minutes later could feel herself reaching her limit, and looking at Banagher told her that he was too. Looking at Marida told her a different story though, she looked stuffed but ready for more. She had to keep massaging her big gut, which let out some gurgles here and there, often announcing a belch was coming up, but her fat, double chinned face showed no signs of fatigue. Audrey never would've thought gluttony could look intimidating but here she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she got an idea, and her face showed that instead of fatigue. She whispered something to Banagher, who looked interested. \"You sure that will work?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works in porker-I mean poker.\" Was her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida heard that and while a bit curious about it, she simply decided to not interject herself into that conversation. It was obviously private if Audrey whispered most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher continued to eat with the same pace as they had, while Marida stifled a burp, feeling near her limit. She looked in awe at the double-chinned duo as they packed away whatever seemed to strike their fancy. Just watching it made her feel packed even tighter than before, and she didn't even take another bite! As if to spite her, they both released a belch, one after the other. Boy after girl, the little gluttons flexed their superior satiation on Marida while she sat there with her mouth slightly agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Clink!' Marida threw down her spoon, as if to make a point. She couldn't keep up with the pace that those two were going at, not like this. Audrey and Banagher stared at her with snickers kept poorly hidden behind their mouths that were already filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing their food, the chubby princess and her doughy knight grinned at each other and high-fived, belching loudly in victory. The soft fat of their faces highlighted their joy \"Your plan worked perfectly!\" Banagher complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually wasn't sure if we'd be able to pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her aching belly with both hands, Marida had to belch very loudly before she could even start her question. She didn't even mean to let that out, it just came flying out of her mouth. \"BUUUURRRRRAAAAP! What are you talking about? What plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tricked you into giving up.\" Banagher said, he and Audrey sounded very eager to tell her, like that they wanted to even as they performed their scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we saw how you kept eating without looking at all tired while we were running out of energy, we actually considered giving up.\" Audrey began. \"But that gave me an idea, what if the roles were reversed? What if we looked like we could eat far more then you? So we hid how tired we were and made you believe that we ready for five more courses.\" She then placed her hands on her very bloated tummy. \"In reality, we were two hot dogs away from giving up. UUUURRRRP! Oof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of emphasis, and because he really needed to, Banagher belched alongside her. He had swallowed and kept that one down as long as his packed tummy would let him so Audrey could give her little speech uninterrupted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Marida a second to process that someone had come with this in-depth a strategy for something as mundane, some (including Audrey just a week ago) would say undignified, as an eating contest. But when she did process it, she laughed. It wasn't a hard laugh, but it was enough to her belly and chubby cheeks jiggle and jostle, which made another burp bubble up. \"Well, that's quite the impressive plan you come up with. BEEEELLCH! I didn't think it was possible to strategize an eating contest but you two never fail to impress.\" Those words filled her little siblings with a warm feeling. \"I think you've earned some victory belly rubs.\" Micott hoped they would accept, she'd feel less jealous if it was Banagher's big sister doing it, and not his obvious girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Victory -BOOORRRPP- belly rubs'? Seriously, Marida?\" A cheeky (literally and figuratively) Banagher teased, he and Audrey chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAARP! That's something I'd expect from you, Banagher.\" Audrey said in a friendly teasing sort of way. \"We'd like that, but can you actually stand up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida answered her question by trying to get up but that was less successful then it usually was after a good meal, even with her trying to use the chair itself as support. The poor woman was so full she could hear gut sloshing as she tried to push herself up. She could only try for ten seconds, which she spent red in the face and grunting, before plopping back down. She considered herself and the chair lucky that she didn't demolish the poor thing with her massive behind. She rested her hands on the top of her orb-shaped middle and resumed rubbing it. \"I can't. UUUUUUURRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, it's not like we can get up either.\" Banagher assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even have to try to know that.\" Audrey said as she looked down at her gut and rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can any -BURURRRRRP- of us besides Shin stand up?\" Riddhe asked aloud. No one answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party slowed down after that, and how could it not when every single member of it besides Shin was absolutely stuffed to the brim? There was still plenty of gaming between the four Anaheim Electronics student but they had to stick with Pokemon, anything else (except Fable and Danganronpa) was too fast-paced for them when they were so bloated and sluggish. And for Audrey even when she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly it got harder and harder to stay awake, the massive amount of food they had eaten putting them on the edge of a food coma, being pinned to their seats by their giant bellies also made it harder to stay awake, and then there was the belly rubs Audrey and Banagher and Micott and Takuya gave each other. All of them dozed off at least once, only to be quickly awoken by someone sitting near them. The first one to doze off was (unsurprisingly) Banagher, who was woken via a playful belly slap from Audrey, who knew he fell asleep the second she felt his hand stop moving over her tummy. He wasn't the only one woken up like that. Riddhe, the second one to doze off, was awoken the same way by Mihiro. He later got a little revenge by waking Mihiro up the same way when she dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Shin (and Haro), Marida was the only one who never dozed off. In fact, she didn't even seem sleepy, and the others couldn't tell if she just didn't let her drowsiness show or if she simply wasn't drowsy at all. She was definitely full though, no doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Takuya paused to let out a big yawn. \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro was the one to answer his question. \"It's -UURRAARP- 1:13.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she said something, Audrey had to belt out yet another loud, unladylike burp. \"Wow, we're really -URRRRRRRR- staying up late.\" She said with a hint of pride. Unfortunately for her, she was the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that late.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we stay up later even -BOUUURRRP- on school nights.\" Micott added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Audrey said, trying to hide her disappointment. She didn't sound disappointed but in this context, a simple \"Oh\" told them she was disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hey,\" Banagher suddenly threw his arm around Audrey and pulled her closer, their chubby bellies touching. Audrey was a little startled by this, and visibly so. \"UUUUUUURRRRRAP!\" Banagher burped loudly with a goofy grin before he actually said what he wanted to. \"All things considered this is pretty late for your first party. Princess aren't known for staying up late, -BURRP- you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or for b -UUUUUUUUURRRP- ing.\" Micott added, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOUUURP! Or for out-eating adults nearly twice their weight.\" Takuya also added, he too was smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we mainly won because of our plan, but yes, I suppose I am doing pretty good for my first party.\" Audrey said, the sound of pride returning to her voice as she gave her tummy a few pats. She then burped loudly on purpose for emphasis. \"BUUUURRRAAARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse you, Audrey! Excuse you!\" Haro sarcastically yet cheerfully as always said, resting right next to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two hours later when it as finally time for everyone to turn in, which filled Audrey with two hours worth of pride in staying up so late. Staying up this late while being incredibly bloated was hard enough, no one was even sure how they managed to stay up like this, but getting up and waddling to your room, your body jiggling all over the place the whole time, was even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would -UUURRRP- you guys mind if I just slept on the couch?\" Riddhe said as he rubbed the lower half of his big belly. \"Ow!\" He jolted, as Mihiro had just pinched his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After stuffing our faces like that, -URRRRRP- being lazy is the last thing we should do.\" She said, looking a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can get up, then you can too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can.\" Getting up wasn't quite as motivating as Mihiro wished it was. She slowly heaved herself up, visibly and audibly struggling. The others stared at her in curiosity if she would actually pull it off, and the answer was given in the form of having to plant her impressive ass back down in the couch. The others returned to focus to whatever they were looking at before, mainly to spare Mihiro the shame. Except for Riddhe, who was about to say something when Mihiro stopped him. \"I'm -BUUUURRRP- not done yet!\" True to her words, she tried again and was succeeded. After fifteen seconds. \"There, -huff- you see that?\" She said to Riddhe. \"If I can do it then you've excuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Riddhe supposed. \"But since you're already up, you think you could give me a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro rolled her eyes but the officer obliged. \"Sure.\" Riddhe reached out and she grabbed his soft hand. Trying to get him almost felt like lifting weights, which Mihiro planned on doing tomorrow. It was a big (no pun intended) struggle for both of them. When he was finally up, the force ended up making him slam his big gut right into Mihiro's causing plenty of jiggling and blushing from the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... -BOORRP- really needed to work out.\" Mihiro ruefully said as she looked down at their swollen, jiggly bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. UUUURRRRP!\" Riddhe said, giving his middle a poke, it was hard but with several layers of soft adipose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore wobbling out of the room, Mihiro looked at Micott and Takuya. \"You two need any help getting -URP- up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we'll be sleeping over.\" Micott answered as Takuya belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are?\" A confused princess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't we tell you?\" Takuya said. \"Guess we forgot but you guys don't mind, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but where are you going to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The couches, obviously.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're -BURRP- fine with sleeping on a couch?\" Audrey sounded as if she were speaking with a group of savages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it happens at parties.\" Takuya causally said, further making Audrey feel like she was talking to barbarians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Riddhe and Mihiro waddled out with as much grace as they could muster, which was not much, Shin looked at Marida, who was as bloated as ever, and saw that she was in need of assistance. He found it a little funny, he had been briefed on her before the attack on Palau, heard how many skilled Federation soldiers she had killed on her own, including a veteran of the Second Neo-Zeon War, yet here she was, fat and defeated by her own stomach. It was rather endearing to him. \"You need any help, Marida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUURRRRP! A -BURRRP- Actually I think I'll be staying here too.\" She answered before burping again as she massaged her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then burped right after her. Hearing her belt out a big one like that just made him want to burp with her. \"But we've only got two couches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind sleeping here. BWAAARP! And, I, uh, don't know if it's actually possible for any of you pull me up until I digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin chuckled. \"Then all see you all tommrow.\" Shin got up but before he left, he walked over to the bloated princess and gave her an affectionate pat on the head, smiling softly at her. \"Good night, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Shin. BUUUUOOOORRP! Excuse me.\" A bit of a blush appeared on Audrey's smiling face. For some reason belching while talking to Shin felt different then when it was with her other companions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was annoying how only one person could use the bathroom to get changed, which could mean it would take a while for it to be your turn to get dressed. It didn't help that getting changed could take some time when you were as bloated as these four, both because their pajamas, while still very comfortable, were more of a squeeze these days. At the same time, no one was really eager to get up before they had completely digested. Well, except Banagher, who was still enjoying how he could wear his pajamas again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how can you two get dressed if your pajamas aren't here?\" Audrey asked Takuya and Micott as Banagher struggled to squeeze into his pants. Since he was dealing with that, Audrey had to nurse her bloated stomach herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya causally belched. \"We do, we put 'em in your dresser before the party started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's pudgy face instantly bore an annoyed look. \"Please don't ever go through my dresser without my permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Banagher  left the bathroom, wearing the same white t-shirt and pajamas he wore when he first went to bed on the Argama. \"Well, they fit even worse then I remember, but I'm glad I get to wear these again.\" Banagher said, looking down at his gut as he rubbed it in circles around the middle of it. \"Means I'm home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really wanna call -URRRRRRP- this place home?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sorta is.\" Banagher said as he walked over to his bed,  and sat down on it, Audrey and Micott couldn't help but notice how much his belly was jiggling. The mattress creaked when Banagher planted his large butt down on it, a noise he was starting to get used to. \"I mean it's safe, comfy, has stuff I like, even my old stuff now, and you guys -BUUUURRRP- are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good -OOOOORRP- atti -BURP- tude to have. URRRRRRRP!\" Poor Marida said as she continued to massage her belly. Out of everyone, she seemed to be the one belching the most. \"But does that mean -URAAAAP- you didn't consider our house home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he didn't! UUURRRRP!\" Micott angrily said, though the belch and bloated stomach dampened the effect she was going for. \"Why would he after you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Micott,\" Banagher started as he rubbed a hand against the back of his head. \"It's complicated.\" Bringing up Palau made Banagher think about the friends he had made there, Vincent, Chloe, and Gilboa and his family. He realized he hadn't thought of them since he left, he wondered why that was. Was it simply because he was too worried about Marida? Too glad to be home? Or perhaps it was out of guilt. He didn't know, all he did know was that he hoped they were all safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Micott didn't sound convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was the next person to get changed, after getting up with Banagher's help. After Micott and Takuya also got changed, the group exchanged their goodnights and went to sleep, this time with Banagher using Audrey's big gut as a pillow. Even when the gigantic orb was stuffed to the brim, it still felt soft and fluffy to Banagher despite it's hardness, like a big pillow. Audrey initially felt rather nervous about letting Banagher using her tummy as a bed, despite it being something she wanted, but she soon enough eased into it, it really helped that Banagher looked like the cutest thing to her as he slept on her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's tummy gurgled, the blonde felt a powerful surge from it, and the brunette did too. Before either of them knew it, the princess let out a massive, unladylike \"BUUUUURRRRRAARP!\", loud enough that her boobs and tummy jiggled from the force of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Blushing, she held a hand up to her mouth, but Banagher could see an amused smile behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at her, the bloated Gundam pilot give her soft tummy a few pats, leading to some more jiggles and short but deep burp. \"Good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Audrey, it feels really weird knowing that I was watching you, Shin, and Marida in shows and games and then ended up meeting you all.\" Banagher said as he pulled a High Grade of Shin's Zaku II out of one of the boxes that held his stuff in it. The Zaku even had a similar color scheme to the Unicorn Gundam. Now that he thought about it, was the Unicorn going to get a Gunpla once this newest conflict inevitably gets an anime? He liked how the Unicorn looked and normally he would love to get a Gunpla of it, but after all this, he never wanted to see it again. At least an anime of would mean Audrey would get her wish to voice herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's weird? We've gained nearly a hundred pounds in just a week and can't even fit in our clothes anymore.\" Audrey said before turning towards Banagher, holding a High Grade Delta Gundam. \"We've got these big bellies hanging out and everything!\" With her free hand she left her belly up and removed her hand, making it come flopping back down, jiggling wildly and bouncing up and down, the fat acting like waves of adipose. It was a sight Banagher couldn't keep his eyes off until it was over. There was something he liked about the way his blonde pal's gut jiggled like jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for someone who wants to lose weight, you sure do like playing with 'big bellies'.\" Takuya pointed out in a cheeky way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that supposed to mean?\" The princess defensively said with a blush, placing a hand on a chunky hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya chuckled. \"Oooh nothing.\" He grinned. \"In all seriousness, we should lose some weight before beach season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a lot of weight.\" Micott snarked, pinching more then an inch of her plentiful love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I've never been to the beach before.\" Audrey said, wonder in her eyes, laced over her voice, and visible on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do ANYTHING before you met us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey searched her mind's eye for something fun she did in her childhood. There was that time she went to a public library, with Haman as her escort, but that wasn't something that would impress her much more normal friends. \"I once took a canoe across a lake with some other kids. I think that was the only time I did something with kids my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your childhood really was bo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get along with them?\" Marida cut Micott off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got along well, though they complained that I talk like an adult.\" Audrey said nostalgically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah I can see you talking like that even as a kid.\" Takuya said in a bemused way, he imagined her wearing all these fancy clothes as a back then, and what he imagined wasn't too far from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of my childhood,\" Audrey then presented the HG Delta Gundam with both hands. \"I actually saw this machine in person, when the AEUG held negotiations with Neo-Zeon. Haman said it was Char Aznable's machine, I think it was called the Hyaku Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually that's not it.\" Takuya got closer to her, his tummy jostling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, this is the Delta Gundam, it's the original design to the Zeta Gundam but they couldn't figure out how to make the transformation sequence work. So they shelved the design and just made the Hyaku Shiki, which is basically this but without the shield and wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a mobile suit that failed to become Gundam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I never thought of it that way before but that's a pretty good way to put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned the model back towards herself, she found herself looking at it deeper then she had meant to. Even now she could still looking back on her memories with Char, but it was bittersweet, and every day she found it to be a little more bitter and a little less sweet. Part of her wished he never cared for her, that he treated her as horribly as he does everyone. Half of her was saying it was better to suffer abuse and feel nothing but hatred for that person. The other half said it was best to just enjoy it for what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad her younger self been aware of what Zeon truly was, she would've supported his AEUG actions completely. But now, knowing how disappointing he would become, she couldn't feel any pride for those actions. Even so, she was certain he genuinely tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar Aznable, the man who failed to become Gundam: That was how she would see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Audrey?\" Those words from Banagher brought Audrey's attention back to the here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, yes, I'm fine. I was just noticing how the gold on this is so shiny I can see my fingerprints on it. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's definitely lying.\" Banagher thought without the shadow of a doubt. \"She never spaces out like that unless something's gotten to her. Still, it's probably best if I just pretend to buy it, no point in making whatever she's going through even harder.\" Banagher showed her a reassuring, chubby grin. \"Actually, I'm pretty sure those are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are? Don't you polish these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not vases.\" Banagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unpacking was always a bothersome chore, and as Banagher, Audrey, Micott, Takuya, and Marida found out, being overweight only exacerbated that. Their large, orb-shaped bellies meant they couldn't maneuver properly when they tried to unpack. When leaning over to pick something up, they had to reach around their gut to grab it, crouching would make their bellies push their arms up, and when they were carrying something bigger then your average toy, their bellies got in the way of it, so they have to use their soft middles as a makeshift table for it. Not only did this make these acts more annoying to do but it made them more exhausting to do too. It was fine in small does, but to say \"Banagher had a small amount of personal possessions\" was to say an easily disproved lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the game systems was easily the worst, and they all dreaded having to do it. They'd have to do it by holding it just above their stomach as they carried, actually using their soft orb as support would be too uncomfortable. To all of them except Marida, it felt like lifting weights, and how out-of-shape they had gotten was not helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grunted as he tried to lean over to reach a Gunpla at the bottom of a large box, his belly getting in the way like it had been all day. Like the rest of them, except for Haro, he had gotten a little sweaty by this point, with some slight redness in his cherubic creeks to go with it. \"Gh! Come... on!...\" He suddenly heard what sounded like someone falling over. He got up and turned around to see Audrey sprawled on the floor, her gigantic belly sticking straight up into the air like a mighty mountain of dough and gluttony, looming over her, making it look even bigger to the poor girl. All eyes were upon her, including a pair of robotic ones. Her exhaustion had caused her to make a clumsy misstep that completely wrecked her balance. Her face was far more sweaty and red then then the others as she laid there in defeat, panting like she had had just run a marathon and won the gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall the sight was not surprising at all to her companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher returned his focus to trying to reach the Gunpla, a HG Zeta Gundam, the Revive version to be specific. With some tummy squishing, he was able to grab it. Standing back up straight, he took a closer look at it. It was gonna suck when he had to that again to pick up the other parts (specifically the parts for the transformation, the Hyper Mega Launcher, and the Beam Sabers and the effects for them) but at least he had the main thing now. Turning around and seeing Audrey's bloated form (mostly her belly), having not moved at all, and the Zeta Gundam model at the same time made him remember a scene from Zeta Gundam that showed little Audrey (or Mineva, as she was known as back then) seeing the Zeta Gundam arrive the Neo-Zeon ship as she practiced her violin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette had two thoughts, the first was how absolutely massive Audrey was now compared to when she was a child. She looked like she could eat her child self! And the second was that she would love to see his model of the Zeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his exhausted friend, sat down next to her, and put the High Grade Zeta Gundam on the very top of her chubby belly, juuust past her deep navel. Given how soft and squishy the strawberry blonde's stomach was, it was a miracle how the model stayed perfectly still on it, almost as if it was willed to do so by them. \"Hey, Audrey, you saw the Zeta Gundam in real life, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Pant- Huh?\" You'd never guess from looking at her face that Audrey was in an air-conditioned room, but when she focused on the model specifically instead of Banagher, her face lit up with a smile that chubby cheeks placed emphasis on. \"O-Oh! Yes! I did see this.\" She said as she picked it up and brought it closer to her face. \"I was practicing my violin when it landed in the hanger. I never saw one before so it was really interesting. Huh, they actually really got it close to the real thing.\" On paper, the Zeta and the Unicorn had vastly different appearances. The Zeta was sleek with small shoulders, while the Unicorn had a more average body shape, the Zeta was white with blue, while the Unicorn was pure white, the Zeta transformed into something completely different, while the Unicorn transformed into a stronger form of itself. Even so, looking it, she could still see the same heroic spirit. \"There's something about Gundams you just don't see in a Zeon mobile suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they're not chunky like them?\" Takuya commented, partially joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, that too. But I was referring to something deeper. It's amazing that a model was able to capture that.\" Audrey wasn't sure if that was more a compliment to the ones who manufactured this, or to the spirit of Gundam. Or perhaps to Banagher. Looking at the young man, she could feel from him that heroic spirit all who piloted the Gundam had, despite, well, him being rather obese and a complete goofball. And somewhat lazy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had never meet a Gundam pilot before him, barring that Kamille was there for the negotiations with Neo Zeon, and even then they did not directly talk  to each other, she had seen many images of them, as well as read about them. In Amuro's case she had also the anime that chronicled him. And in each Gundam pilot that she looked into, she felt the same heroic spirit she felt in Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get what you mean.\" Banagher said. \"There's just something heroic about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heroic, that's the right word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Audrey concurred with him, Marida looked on at her tubby siblings. \"Heroic's not the word I would use.\" She thought. Even with someone like Banagher in the cockpit, the sight of Gundam still filled her with rage and a desire to exterminate it. While mere toy replicas like these didn't do that, the face of Gundam still didn't elicit any positive emotions from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn't say anything. There was no point in trying to ruin their fun. But what did end interrupt them was a big growl of hunger from Marida's stomach, loud enough that she instantly knew the others hard it. Blushing, she looked past her impressive bosom and down down at her large, fat stomach. Placing her meaty hands on it and feeling how incredibly soft it had gotten from her many binges, she thought on Takuya's recent comment on how many Zeon mobile suits had a very \"chunky\" appearance. The Kshatriya was no exception, so it's pilot felt it was rather fitting she too would have a \"chunky\" body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she saw the others smirking. \"Well, someone's hungry.\" Banagher teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that hungry, I can still help with the unpacking.\" Despite the blushing, Marida regained her serious, stoic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, haven't you heard of a snack break before?\" Micott teased, throwing her hands behind her head. \"I can see where Audrey gets her seriousness from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not I was actually like this before I met her.\" Audrey said, missing Micott's joke. \"Anyways, now actually is a good time for a snack break.\" As it they waited for the perfect timing, all five chubby bellies growled loudly in unison, it was almost like they wanted to encourage the idea of a snack break. Everyone looked at their soft middles, except Haro, of course, since he didn't have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we've worked up quite the appetite.\" Takuya said what everyone was thinking, giving his chubby tummy some eager pats.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey, Banagher, Marida, Micott, and Takuya happily snacked together on the couch, well, Marida had to sit in a chair like last time. It was mostly stuff like potato chips and miniature pretzels, of which the initial appeal still hadn't entirely worn off for Audrey. The TV was on but it was mostly just white noise to them, the fatties and Haro were more focused in chatting with each other. It felt really rewarding to just rest after some hard work and snack to their heart's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time into their snacking, Audrey felt pressure suddenly in her stomach and chest. She knew what it meant but before she could catch it, it flew out of her mouth as a big, unladylike burp. \"Excuse me!\" She said, blushing. She was fine with belting out some big ol' belches when she and her friends were well into a stuffing session, just completing pigging out. She even held some pride in the loud burps she could unleash, especially when they elicited a compliment from Banagher. But during some regular hanging out over a modest snack? That wasn't the time or place for burping, the princess still placed a lot of importance in manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe Audrey at this point is more manly then you, Banagher.\" Micott teased with a chubby grin as she lightly elbowed the obese pilot in his chubby tummy, not only did that jostle it a little but her elbow sank in slightly. Truly Banagher had gotten fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How is Audrey more manly then me?\" A confused Banagher asked before shoving some pretzels into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's burped more then you today, and you're more soft and cuddly then her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here you know.\" Audrey interjected. \"And I haven't belched more then him today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and she's way more soft and cuddly then me.\" Banagher argued, thinking on all the belly play he had done with her massive gut, and how incredibly jiggly it was whenever she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta side with Micott here.\" Takuya chimed in after eating some more chips. \"You're the big sister, right, Marida? What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida wiped some crumbs off her face (having found the Argama has really good potato chips) before giving her official big sis opinion, which carries as much what as Marida does. \"BUURRP! Excuse me. Well, I haven't spent as much with Minev-Audrey since she became overweight, but I know Banagher is very soft and cuddly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would know, since you've played with my stomach so much.\" Banagher admitted as he rubbed his stomach in memory, he and Marida thinking fondly back on those days. If Marida could reach, she would've responded with some belly play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has everyone but me played with Banagher's gut?\" A frustrated Micott pouted, puffing her already chubby face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't.\" Takuya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Haro?\" Audrey asked the robotic ball that was sitting next to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About who else has played with Banagher's big belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean about if I\"m more manly then Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Equally unmanly! Equally unmanly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping for a different answer.\" Banagher grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, all messing around aside, you've got a really good thing going.\" Takuya said in his usual carefree tone. \"You're really approachable and friendly when you aren't staring out into space. Audrey's tough and has this iron will.\" He said about the girl who had her fat tummy used as a pillow last night. \"You two compliment each other like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we did call ourselves the brain, the heart, and the blubber.\" Audrey proudly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one of you is the blubber?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both are.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the record, we can all agree that Marida is the manliest one, right?\" Audrey asked and voted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Takuya voted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Banagher voted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She totally is.\" Micott voted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the big sister! The big sister!\" Haro voted, flapping his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida just burped loudly again and apologized for it, which just made her more manly in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Mihiro barged in, her huge gut, big boobs, chunky legs, and gigantic butt jiggling. She evidently hadn't gotten a replacement uniform, as her stomach, the first thing the group noticed, was still hanging out, completely free in the air, as much as she wished it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mihiro.\" Takuya causally said as Micott casually belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing them all shoveling jack food after junk food into their greedy mouths, not minding at all how their big, soft, jiggly stomachs were completely exposed and sitting atop their chunky laps, Mihiro could only come to one conclusion. \"Looks like I came just in time. C'mon, we've got a lot of weight to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Micott asked before eating another handful of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nahel Argama has a gym on it, and we've been putting off exercise for way too long. So let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just diet or something?\" Takuya groaned. No gym class was one of the few positives of their current living situation and he wasn't eager to throw that away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating potato chips is not dieting.\" She sternly said. \"Dieting was our plan this past week and now look at us, we're fatter then ever!\" To drive her point home, she lifted her fat gut up with both her hold and then let it dropping, jiggling and bouncing like mad. It did work at driving her point home, the problem was that Banagher and Takuya thought that was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatties! Fatties!\" Haro teased, bouncing on Banagher's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya, you even broke your belt last night.\" The ensign said as she pointed towards to the broken belt he was still wearing, having forgotten to actually remove it from his pants. To be fair to him, he was REALLY stuffed last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means he can't poke fun at me over mine anymore.\" Banagher smugly said with a smug grin before shoveling another handful of pretzels into his mouth. Audrey was tempted to literally poke him in the gut but she felt that would be too childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be good to get back in the swing of exercising, right, Banagher?\" Marida shifted to face her little brother. \"It was hard work but work but we had a good streak going, until, well...\" Marida placed her hands on the sides of her meaty gut and shook it, her fat belly bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No regrets about last night though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all. I actually think I'll miss binging with you and the princess once we lose all this weight.\" The Puru fondly patted her stomach a few times as she said that, it undulated. \"Thank you for arranging this, ensign Mihiro.\" Nonetheless, she said that as she got up with some minor difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see I'm not the only one here putting effort into losing weight.\" Mihiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this talk about exercise got Micott wondering something about Audrey. \"I know you had a private tutor and all, but did you ever do something like gym class?\" She lazily scratched her bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I did do a quick jog with Banagher once.\" The princess was well-aware calling not even a minute of jiggling a \"quick jog\" was still giving her way too much credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you've got no idea how bad this is going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gulped.</span></div></div>",

Still, the presence of the others would make this more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got you too, huh,  Riddhe?\" Takuya could tell from Riddhe sitting on a bench and not  working out that he wasn't much more enthusiastic about this then he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He dejectedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had no problem getting some exercise in yesterday.\" Mihiro sassed, hands on her chunky hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,  I wanted to take a break today, maybe get some practice in with the  Delta Plus. And your slave driver attitude is making me worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not acting like a slave driver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be if you got Alberto to show up.\" Micott snarked, amused by how  after all this weight gain, Alberto was still tied with Marida for the  title of Fattest Person on the Nahel Argama. Though neither could yet  claim the title of fattest Person EVER on the Nahel Argama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that!\" The fat man chided. \"And I'll have you know I won't be  doing any exercise at all, I'm merely here to observe.\" He choose to use  the word \"observe\" instead of \"watch\" in an attempt to make himself seem more a esteemed gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's just a self-own, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlberto pouted as he wisely decided to keep his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the only unexpected guest there, nor was he the only sitting at  the bench adjacent to Riddhe's, as Shin and Daguza were also there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, is Mr. Daguza going to be our instructor or something?\" Takuya asked. \"Cuz if he is, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,  I'm not.\" As always, Daguza spoke with a stoic and stern tone, like  they were in the middle of a military operation. \"Like Alberto, I'm just here to watch.\" The others had a feeling that was the only time Daguza would ever use the words \"Like Alberto\" when referring to himself, including Alberto.<br>\r\n\"And myself.\" Shin added. Audrey, who hadn't noticed him until now, was happy to see him. It gave her some hope this wouldn't be that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone jiggled on over to either a machine or a mat to start  exercising, Banagher wobbled over to Alberto while Audrey waddled to  Shin. The princess aimed to catch up some more with the White Wolf, while the Gundam pilot had a more specific topic in mind for the Anaheim Electronics member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for all the help, Alberto. I really appreciate it.\" The brunette said, how chubby his face was with it's cherubic cheeks and thick double chin made his smile even more friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlberto had almost found  himself at a lost for words. He tried to view his dealings related to  Laplace's Box as just a simple matter of doing his job, especially one  very unpleasant act he had performed a little over a week ago. He tried  to view Banagher as just simply a piece of the puzzle he had to treat very delicately. But hearing those words from him... felt a lot better  then he thought it would've. \"Ahem. You're welcome. It's good to see someone here knows how to show a little gratitude.\" He was only willing to say that last bit because he knew Daguza couldn't care less what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not the only one  who's grateful.\" As Banagher said that, Alberto saw the incredibly obese visage of Marida as the fat Puru walked past her chunky, little bro. A small burp passed her lips as she ran a hand threw her long, red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Alberto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  The blond pried his eyes away from the Neo-Zeon pilot's beautiful hair and massive, jiggling ass. \"I-I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm not the only one who's grateful. The others just haven't said it because they haven't talked to you before or they're one of those  gruff, military guys who aren't big on saying thanks. Right, Daguza?\" He cheekily said that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Daguza humorlessly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully some of your friends will thank me, since I'm here.\" Alberto stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take this the wrong way but why are you here? Me and the others exercising isn't going to be that interesting.\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TV is an effective way to pass the time and all but I was up for a change of pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others partied, gamed, talked, ate, and belched to their heart's content last night, Alberto was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the darkened monitor room, the only source of light Alberto had as he  sat at the terminal was from it's monitor. The image it showed as it  made this light was that of Martha Vist Carbine, Alberto's aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nahel Argama will conduct an inspection of the coordinated airspace, before the Unicorn is shipped off to Luna II.\" Alberto informed her, a tiredness seen in his eyes. \"Information regarding the key to Laplace's Box will be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Alberto?\"  She cut him off, her voiced contained a mock aura of concern, it was only able to serve as a faint cover of condescension. \"You're not looking well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she said so, Alberto had been finding each report he made to her more tiring then the last  one. He couldn't see exactly why that was, and he didn't want to say something that could make her lose faith in him, so he decided it was best to claim there was no problem. \"No, not at all.\" A drop of sweat on his cheek, he uncomfortably cleared his throat. \"I-It's just that after all these battles, the men are exhausted. And, well, I... i was just thinking that couldn't hits matter have been left to another unit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frown shifted into a small, amused smile, unlike the ones Audrey would show Banagher, this smile didn't show a fondness for traits the wearer found endearing, this smile showed nothing but haughty amusement. \"You wouldn't be getting attached to them, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlberto found his mouth slightly agape, he didn't want to believe that his emotions were impacting his assignment, but he found those words more worrying then he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you've landed on Earth. you'll be able to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Landed on Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm currently arranging a transport for you. It'll take some time to arrive  but once it does, you'll use it to take the Cyber Newtype whose being held prisoner to Augusta in North America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augusta?\" He was familiar with that name, particularly when used to refer to the  Federation's Augusta Newtype Labs. Even back during the One Year War that place had a reputation as a place where lives held no value. A  place where people left it completely different then when they entered. Yet despite, higher ups in the Federation held a deep, vested interest  in keeping them operational. Even heavy damage dealt to it during the war, followed by a major leak of the work done there, wasn't enough to  keep someone from resurrecting it. As of now, it had been shut down for  years, one of the many concessions made towards the AEUG and like-minded  folk, but it was no surprise that humans would still be able to use hat  facility's dark legacy. \"Gah!\" Alberto's mouth opened further as he realized what he was going to be forced to participate in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. As you know, the labs have long been shut down but my agents have  informed me the facilities needed for readjustments are operational.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I'm  not sure that would be wise.\" He stammered. \"That facility is what gave birth to the Pale Rider, which is part of why we lost the Unicorn in the first place.\" It was hard for him to keep his anxiety from raising his voice against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your  concerns, but I wouldn't say the Pale Rider is a complete waste. If Puru 12 could be captured, then so can the Pale Rider.\" She said as if she hadn't noticed her nephew's obvious discomfort. \"And while 12 will do more then fine for Unit 2, Chloe would be my ideal pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unit 2? You mean it's been repaired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As a matter of fact the chest had to be completely overhauled after what Unit 3 did to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if father had simply told me the location of the box, I wouldn't  have to resort to such underhanded measures.\" She smugly ran a hand through her long, pale blonde hair. \"Speaking of our family, how is that arrogant child, Banagher, doing? Still gravely underestimating the burden his father placed on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I'm no psychologist, and I haven't talked to him since before he was captured, so-so take all this was a grain of salt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like he wants to just run away from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning literally run away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven making that small, incredibly minor mistake made Alberto feel like his fat neck got just a little closer to the chopping block. \"Ah, no! No, I-I mean figuratively. He's mostly been burying himself in his hobbies, as well as a newfound appreciation for, um, eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a typical teenager then.\" There was some amusement in Martha's voice, Alberto wasn't sure if it was at the fact that her ambitions were being derailed by someone like that, or if ti was simple condescension at someone she found beneath her. No, know that he thought about it, he knew the answer. It was both. \"What was that you said about a newfound appreciation for food? How do you know it's new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's put on quite a lot of weight. When he first arrived on the Nahel Argama, he was slim as a board, now he can't even keep his stomach covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smirk formed on Martha's face, the sight of it giving Alberto's goosebumps. \"That gives me an idea. Let's fatten him up even further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, we need him alive, and capturing him would be difficult when there's a risk of him running to the Unicorn. But if his weight makes him immobile, then we can just roll him out of the Nahel Argama and into our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I suppose that could work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and get close to him, see what you can learn about my poor nephew's eating habits.\"</span></div></div>",

It was a little awkward, especially with how her big gut got in the way, but it was far more endearing. \"You have my deepest gratitude, as well as that of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm glad you're so happy, princess Mineva.\" Although Alberto smiled at her, she and Banagher could still see some discomfort on his round face. They weren't sure where it was coming from, and they didn't want to pry and make him more uncomfortable, so they didn't ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too much to ask, could you call me Audrey Burne? It's a long story but that's my name now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a charmingly chubby face like that, how could Alberto refuse? \"Princess Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Audrey in casual conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, Audrey. Don't let me keep you and Banagher from working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Banagher. We've got some big bellies to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovebirds wobbled over to a small line of treadmills, Banagher holding Haro, their legs chaffing together and jostling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he saw the two of them, equally obese and jiggling together, and about to work out, that it all clicked for Alberto. \"Of course!\" Ringed in his mind. \"Audrey is why Banagher has gotten so fat! It makes perfect sense, she's being an overly-generous girlfriend to him and vice versa! Oh lord, what is aunt Martha going to do when I tell her that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this machine work?\" Audrey asked Banagher, referring to a treadmill. She had only seen them a few times before, when she watched Marida exercise, and also in a few movies, so she had no idea how they worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically you pick a speed for the tread to run at and you try to keep up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a good speed for a beginner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Banagher crossed his arms over his flabby chest. \"No idea. I never did any exercise outside of gym class. You know me, I'm into video games, models, and TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start with three miles per hour.\" Shin advised from the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Shin.\" Audrey thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little nervous, the blonde stepped onto the treadmill, her friend getting on the one to her left. Right after Banagher did, she started the machine at 3MPH. The tread suddenly moving shocked her, causing her to lose her balance, almost falling over before she regained her balance. She had no doubt that if she had fallen, it would've been the most humiliating start to working out ever, and it would've happened right there for her soulmate and her adoptive father to see the whole thing. At least her belly would've cushioned the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir running created plenty of jiggling on their bodies, with their bellies, chests, and butts being constantly in motion as they bobbed and bounced. Their meaty legs chaffed and jostled, which wasn't helping their form. The bouncing their puffy tummies did caused them to constantly slap their thighs, which contributed to making the jiggling of both even more intense. As Banagher had the fatter belly, not only was his more jiggly, it had more to jiggle. It was like he was carrying a huge water balloon on his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had even more of a bubble butt then her friend, and was worried all this jiggling would cause it to her rip pants, exposing her pink underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took ten seconds for Banagher to start panting, Audrey only took seven. The princess soon started sweating and getting red in the face, symptoms Banagher showed after her. As they got more exhausted, their forms got more sluggish and clumsy. But while Banagher was merely clumsy, Audrey was running like she had just cleared out an all-you-can-eat buffet and was trying to run a marathon while still stuffed. The fat princess' face took on the coloration of a tomato, her panting getting more frequent and loud, her mouth agape in fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she had to call it quits. She shut the treadmill off, stepped off it, and then collapsed onto the floor, her huge ass jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, her run lasted fifty seconds. Better then last time, she lasted almost a full minute this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, Banagher shut his machine off and rushed over to her side. He knelled down next to her, Haro joining them. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor young woman panted before she could answer. \"-Pant pant pant- Exercising -Pant- is hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel.\" He placed a hand on the top of her belly sympathetically and gave it a little rub. \"I'll get you some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Before Banagher could even start getting up, Shin was there offering four bottles of water, two for each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Audrey hastily said as she snatched one of the water bottles out of the White Wolf's hands and started guzzling it down with incredible speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them let out refreshed gasps once they chugged down as much as they could in one go, only one fourth of their first bottle was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better? Feeling better?\" Haro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Pant- Yeah.\" Audrey answered for both of them. Here, she wiped some sweat off her brow. \"... Maybe I'm just not made for this sort of stuff. I-It's not like I was ever-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so disheartened.\" Shin stopped her as he knelled down in front of her. \"Many start out as unfit as you, but they end up getting a little better every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really can't see myself ever being good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But did you ever think you would see me again? Even if you knew I was alive, would you have thought that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if you can't do it,\" Banagher started his advice, though he didn't think he was helping nearly as much as Shin. \"It doesn't say anything about you as a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She found herself struggling to think of something to say. \"I want to keep trying, but let's do something that doesn't require running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't take long.\" Micott remarked as she and Takuya saw that Audrey was already a sweaty mess for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is kinda funny.\" Takuya admitted. \"But cut her some slack, she's never done this before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. It's not like we're much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had picked push ups, as that seemed like the easiest form of exercise to them. Partly because their puffy tummies meant they could cheat. Since their abdomens were so large, they were always just an inch off the ground when the two teenagers were in position. So this meant they could just go down slightly, say \"Well, I touched the ground, guess that counts as one\", and call it exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how you do a push up!\" Of course, that scheme was quickly foiled with a quick scolding from Mihiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! We'll do it right this time!\" Takuya quickly said to placate her, her scolding had startled the two overweight teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you really are a slavedriver!\" Micott whined as they started doing actual push ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, their stomachs, what they used to make doing push ups easier, now made push ups harder for them. They would have to press them as hard into the ground as they could, their deep love handles flaring out as the bellies squished, in order for their chests to reach the ground. Unfortunately, the expansion all those calories gave their chests couldn't help, their chests specifically had to touch the ground, not Micott's large tits or Takuya's big man boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mihiro and Riddhe, the brunette was doing pull ups and the blond was lifting with a barbel, and both were struggling in different ways For Riddhe, he used to be able to lift 5 pound weights no problem, his personal best being fifty lifts in one session, but the tone of his arms had melted into soft pudge that would jiggle a little if slapped. They were struggling to lift two pound weights, causing Riddhe to start sweating earlier then he should've. The hardest part was when the bar got close to his chest, as it pressed into his squishy moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the nearby pull up bar, Mihiro was having just as much trouble. It was a true struggle for the brunette to pull her hefty body up. She would grunt with a very strained look on her pudgy face with every pull up, and when she actually reached the top, she'd left herself flop right back down, her gut slapping her upper thighs, and her tits slapping her gut as they, her butt, and her legs jostled violently. She'd have to take an at least ten seconds long break after each one, panting as she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was facing a wall, Mihiro's humongous booty was hanging out there for all to see, her pants doing nothing to make it less noticeable. If anything, the obvious strain her gigantic ass put on it just highlighted her behind's enormity. Riddhe found himself looking at it a lot, even when he didn't mean to, and was glad Mihiro was unaware of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This -pant- is going to be harder -pant- then I thought...\" She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Pant- Are we still going to do -pant- this for a whole hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro did not know the answer to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"One two, stretch two!\" Over at one of the mats, Marida instructed Audrey and Banagher as all three did their stretches. This had been going on for a while by now, all three were obviously in need of a break, red in the face and sweating. It took all of Marida's strength to not pant when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now trying to reach their toes, which their bellies were determined to make very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. -Pant pant- I'm too fat.\" Banagher groaned, this being one of those cases where having most of your weight go straight to your gut was not a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining, Banagher! Any bigger and you won't fit in your Gundam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't -ngh- need to be so harsh, Marida.\" Audrey said as she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I heard being -pant- harsh can be a good motivator.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jumping jacks were a much more simple form of exercise then stretching, but they were just as exhausting, and the way it made Banagher, Audrey, and Marida's bodies jiggle all around the place was not helping. Their humongous bellies, huge chests, large bubble butts, and chunky legs were constantly in motion, like jello on a plate during an earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they didn't merely jiggle, their bellies bounced up and down with each jumping jack, slapping their upper thighs and doubling the jiggling of both. The flabby sacks of fat that made up their chests did the same to their guts. And while their big butts didn't have anything to hit, they absolutely did tons of bouncing. Each part of their bodies were jiggling in perfect synchronization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm -pant- gonna -pant- collapse! -Pant pant-\" Audrey complained, looking as exhausted as she sounded. She and the others had faces so red with exhaustion, it was comparable to her at her most embarrassed. This image of exhaustion was compete with plenty of sweat on their pie-like faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher wanted to say something to help the nanosecond he heard that, but first he had to do some panting in order to have enough breath to actually say something. \"-Pant pant- Hold on just a little -pant-, we're almost -pant- done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up! Keep it up!\" Haro cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's -pant- right.\" Marida confirmed, both to keep their spirits up and her own. \"Just ten left! -Pant pant-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took ten more seconds for them to reach their goal of fifty jumping jacks, a reasonable time to do so, but to them it felt more like ten minutes of nothing but pain and thirst. It was no surprise to anyone that as soon as they reached their target number, all three collapsed onto the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far from the sight one would imagine the last surviving Zabi, a Cyber Newtype, and a Gundam pilot to be in. They didn't seem to embody grace, power, and will, instead they all looked like a wreck. Not only were their faces still red and sweaty, but now that Audrey and Banagher's exposed bellies weren't constantly in motion, one could now see they were glistening with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Marida's belly was completely covered by her new wardrobe, something she had really missed, but all the shaking and jiggling from the jumping jacks caused her gut to come flopping out of her medical outfit, showing that it was just as sweaty as as the tummies of her little siblings, and not to mention reminding the poor redhead of how fat she truly was. If her face wasn't already red as a tomato from exhaustion, she would've blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the way they collapsed didn't have much dignity, with Audrey once again sprawled out on the floor, this time with Banagher lazily leaned against the massive sack of softness that was her gut. The princess and pilot looked like they were both about to pass out. Haro rolled over to in between them, partially out of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good -pant- job. -Pant pant- We burned a lot -pant- of calories today.\" Marida said as reassuringly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher groaned their (somewhat disingenuous) agreement in between panting and wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is exercise -pant- supposed -pant- to hurt so much?\" The blonde princess asked, not even trying to sit up. She knew she would be exhausted but she didn't think she would be as exhausted as when she was running for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be honest,\" Banagher took a quick break to catch his breath. \"This is making me feel even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pain, -pant- no gain.\" Marida reminded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Shin showed up with more water for the three of them, at this point he was practically their water boy. And surprisingly, so did Alberto and Daguza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" Shin kindly asked as Audrey chugged water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde could only respond three seconds later, once she had gotten enough water. She knew it was impolite but she couldn't help it, the poor thing was just so thirsty. \"-Pant pant- I I'm exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you did so well.\" Hearing those words from Shin filled the princess with pride, \"Do you want to keep going or call it a day? You've earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting to say she was done for the day, it truly was, but unless Banagher was also willing to call it quits, she felt like she would be letting him down. \"I...\" She took another sip. \"I want to keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin's proud smirk grew bigger. \"That's the spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Daguza was providing Banagher with constructive criticism. Constructive AND harsh criticism. \"Your form is sloppy, you get tired far too quickly, and you seem to have very little knowledge of how exercise works. Still, it's not impossible for you to shape up with time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Banagher dejectedly said, he found himself looking at his gut. He poked it, his finger easily sinking into the malleable fat. Such a big, soft orb it was, he never saw any of the other Gundam pilots with a torso like this. \"Mr. Daguza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever serve with someone as fat as me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher frowned and looked back down at his tummy. \"Of course that was the answer.\" He thought. \"How did I think it was possible he would say anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Banagher looked back up at him. \"That's not the quesiton you should be asking. What you should be asking me is if I ever saw someone your weight at training. And I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he pass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Daguza said that as stoically as usual, Banagher found his frown leaving his soft face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third conversation being held simultaneously was between Marida and Alberto as the latter gave the former lots of water. \"Here you go, all the water you could possibly need.\" The blond said as he handed her two out of six bottles of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Marida quickly started chugging like she was part of a contest to see who could finish their water first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Just make sure you don't push yourself too far.\" He said as watched her guzzle as if Alberto wasn't there. He found that there was something kinda amazing about how quickly she was drinking, and how much she drank in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" She said when she was done drinking. \"Especially not when it could lead to them overdoing it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, and let me know if there's anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And I don't just mean physically, I mean emotionally as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys -pant- mind sharing some -pant- of that water?\" An exhausted Micott said as she, Takuya, Mihiro, and Riddhe lumbered over. Sweating and red in the (chubby) face, they all looked like they had been hit by a truck, not unlike how Audrey, Banagher, and Marida looked before they drank. That trio still looked like they had been hit by a vehicle, just by merely a small car now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all out.\" Riddhe groaned. He then wiped some sweat off his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhn!\" Audrey's big, bulbous belly pressed and squished against her meaty legs with all it's blubbery might. The way her stomach squished and folded made it look like she had a double belly. Her face was right back to being red and sweaty. Even so, she wasn't going to give up, not while Banagher and the others were watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing it, Audrey!\" Banagher cheered on Audrey as he anchored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Audrey! Go Audrey!\" Haro cheered on, bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took five more seconds, for a total of 20, and as soon as she finished, she triumphantly shouted \"O-O-One!\" and then flopped right back down with a thud in less then a second. Her gut, boobs, legs, and ass jiggled from the impact, which Banagher couldn't help but feel some attraction to. Once again, her stomach loomed over her, she could only see Banagher's fluffy, brown hair over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Audrey? I knew you could do.\" He complimented with a sweet smile. \"So this is how Marida felt watching me doing it.\" He thought. \"It does seem a lot more impressive when you're the one watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job! Good job!\" Haro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Audrey said after catching her breath. Here, she focused on her tummy and gave it a disapproving poke. \"Somehow after all this, my stomach is my worst enemy. I guess it's my final boss. That what's you said they're called in video games, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled. \"It's more like a really tough bonus boss.\" For emphasis, he grabbed the sides of his gut and gave it a good shake, the fatty orb bouncing up and down in a gelatinous fashion. \"That goes for both our stomachs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, Micott was watching all that jiggly goodness unfold, and she couldn't, nor did she want to, take her eyes off it. \"Damn, Banagher's so jiggly!\" She thought. Unbeknownst to her, someone was watching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you're looking at.\" That someone was a very amused Takuya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was so caught up in her best pal's gut that she jolted when she  heard her other best pal's voice. \"Shut up and do your sit ups!\" She snarled, with a cute blush on her chubby cheeks.</span></div></div>",

It took him fifteen seconds to do it, and each pull up left him a little more tired then he was before. With how much harder having a gut was making this for him, he was glad he wasn't Banagher. He was struggling so much he didn't notice the way Micott kept her eyes on his fat stomach as it squished against his chubby legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher's the one who's really got a gut around here.\" The brunette thought. \"But Takuya's also got a belly I wouldn't mind giving a rub.\" All these thoughts about puffy bellies made her think of her own. She looked down at it, while it wasn't her biggest asset, that would be her ass, she still did have a pretty big belly.  With it being a fat enough orb that her short shorts were only able to barely hold it back before it finally popped the buttons off during the party. She gave it a couple slaps, making it jiggle. \"Since Banagher and Takuya are into fat chicks, I wonder if I'm fat enough for them yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor every member of the group, a single sit up would take around fifteen seconds, except for Audrey, who as demonstrated, took twenty, and Marida, who took even more then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida loudly grunted as she slowly forced her upper body upwards, her huge,massive, blubbery belly was pressing against her very meaty legs and squishing before she was even halfway there. She fought her gut with all her strength, her fat, double-chinned face scrunched as she kept on. Unsurprisingly, her face was red and sweaty from exhaustion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her thirty seconds to complete her first sit up, and when she dd, she ungracefully flopped back onto her back, just like her little siblings, but with a louder thud and even more jiggly action. Her dome of belly rose up and down with each labored breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some would see an absolutely defeated woman, Shin, who was acting as her anchor, saw some positivity in her performance.\"Impressive! You've still got a perfect form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank -pant- you.\" The redhead said, her gigantic tummy blocking her view of Shin, it made her feel like she was talking to her stomach. \"At least I haven't lost all traces of my thin days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you've still been doing exercise. Have you ever done it with Audrey or Banagher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times with Banagher, this is my first session with the princess. They've got enthusiasm and spirit, but their form is terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked over to see Audrey struggling greatly with the start of sit up number 2 as Banagher and Haro cheered her on, confirming what the Puru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group did hit their target of one full hour of exercise, and when they wobbled out of the gym, they looked like they had been doing it for ten hours straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day.\" Audrey groaned as she held Haro, Banagher waddling with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I think we did a really good job.\" Banagher said. \"I think I actually lost enough weight to close my jacket now.\" He boasted with a chubby grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the sides of his jacket and tried to close it but he found his big belly was giving him a lot of trouble like usual. He pressed as hard as he could, even making his gut squish a bit. \"C'mon!\" He realized this wasn't working, and making him look like a fool in front of his soulmate, so he sucked in his stomach as much as he could. It did make the sides get a little closer but not nearly enough. Even so, he kept at it, grunting all the while, looking and sounding more frustrated by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, all he was succeeding in was putting a lot of emphasis on his gut to Audrey, who was just looking at him the whole time in amusement, along with Haro. In fact, he actually made his belly look even bigger, and it was already the biggest belly on the Argama, aside from Marida's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 seconds of effort, he realized he was still too big and gave up, releasing his jacket and letting his gut come flopping back out. \"I'm gonna need to lose a few more pounds.\" He said, a cute, dorky smile on his fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled with a sweet and amused smile. It was the type of giggle that said \"You're a dork but it's really charming\". \"You'll get it one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two resumed walking, normally Banagher would've felt particularly self-conscious about all the bouncing his stomach was doing, but what his soulmate said really did help. It didn't satisfy his worries, but they had found themselves appeased. For now, just having possibility was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the group kept walking, Micott, Takuya, Shin, and Marida waited for them to be done with their little scene. Now they walked as one group, and jiggled all the way, except for Shin and Haro, of course. Like always, Micott's gigantic, nearly needing two chairs ass was jostling with every step as her chunky legs chaffed together, but this time that actually gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscreetly, she ran a hand over her left ass cheek, her ass as a whole being large enough that that the lower cheeks were rendered bare.\"Definitely big enough for him.\" She thought. \"If Banagher thinks Audrey has a big ass, then wait till he sees this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved in front of him, making sure to wobble in a way that had her bubble butt swaying from left to right like a pendulum as it seductively jiggled. \"So, Banagher,\" She looked back at him, pleased to see the brunette was looking at her massive ass. She would've liked to see a little jealously in Audrey, but this was fine. More then fine. Besides, she wasn't mad at her anymore. Jealous, of course, but she still regarded the princess as her pal. Her very awkward pal. \"We're not gonna do any more unpacking today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, after all that, what we need is a lazy afternoon.\" That was what he said, what he thought was \"Damn, Micott's ass is big! How has she not ripped those shorts yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya wiped some sweat off his brow. \"Man, I feel like I just went through boot camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\" Shin said. \"Trust me, that was nothing compared to what you'll all be doing in a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just making me dread exercise even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them, Mihiro and Riddhe were lumbering along in their own group. \"You know, we should've worn some work out clothes.\" The blond pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to show off even more of my flab then I already am.\" She looked down at her stomach, the bulging orb that was it was. She still hadn't gotten around to getting herself a bigger uniform and especially a bigger belt. And given how tired she was right now, she really didn't feel like doing that now. Or today at all. \"And I doubt anyone else does either.\" Mihiro didn't know it, but Micott would love to show off her corpulent figure to Banagher, and to see him show off his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so. I sure don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, the more the two thought of each other like that, with even more of their chub hanging out, they found it harder to stop thinking about it. Or to stop looking at the other's belly, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddhe and Mihiro went to the former's room to cool off and watch a movie together, nothing in particular, as they had agreed nearly a week ago. They would've liked to see it in a theater, but it was obvious they weren't getting shore leave anytime soon, so this would have to do. Still, it was great to finally do this after days of postponing it because of the depressing mood on the Argama after several members of it's crew were killed in action and Banagher was captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza went to the monitor room, to review information and continue planning the ship's next step with Conroy. Alberto decided to retreat to his room for his own bout of planning, planning what exactly he'll say to his aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group went to Banagher's room to collapse on the couch, except for Shin and Marida. \"Marida, can I talk to you in private for a moment?\" The White Wolf asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She replied as stoically as ever. They stayed outside Banagher's room as the others went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The princess told me about you, how you looked after her for all these years. I wanted to thank you. I only wish I could've helped you protect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to feel guilty. She told me about you, there wasn't anything you could've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just... hard sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that the princess is just happy you're in her life again, that's what matters. That you're here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin smiled at her. \"You must be a fine older sister to the princess and Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida averted eye contact out of embarrassment, looking down to her side. \"Is it really that obvious that's what my relationship with them is?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Marida and Shin rejoining the group, Audrey, Banagher, Takuya, and Micott spent some much need relaxation time watching TV. The fat blonde and obese redhead found that they still hadn't completely adapted to the type of shows their companions watched, more then once having to ask things that the ones from Industrial 7 assumed were perfectly clear to new watchers. Still, they were doing much better at understanding the shows normal teenagers watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching two episodes, each one being of a different show, the four youngest members of the Argama's crew had recovered enough for some video games. Though Audrey wanted some more time to recover, plus she felt like she had been hogging the game system lately. Takuya decided to play Fallout: New Vegas, and the sheltered princess once again found herself blown away by gaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Curiosity was plan as day in the princess' voice. The \"this\" in quesiton was the level up screen, more specifically the section where Takuya gave his character a perk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean?\" Takuya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what is this screen? It doesn't look like you're increasing stats.\" She saw many odd sentences, most of which seemed to be titles or descriptors of some sort. \"Animal Friend? Sneering Imperialist? Vigilant Recycler? What does any of this have to do with your character's abilities?\" It felt weird for the others to hear her spouting video game terminology like that, it was almost hearing her suddenly speak French.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you haven't seen this before, only Fallout does stuff like perks.\" Micott commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're like personality traits. They change what your character says and give you gameplay bonuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Audrey's face lit up with amazement and wonder. If she was a dog, she'd be shivering with excitement and waging her tail nearly as fast as bird turns his head. \"S-So it's creating a entire person separate from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda.\" Takuya casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing!\" The Zabi didn't mean to exclaim that, it just sorta came out that way. Like a big belch after drinking soda, a scenario she was very familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to give it a try soon.\" Banagher suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to, but I'll need more training before I can handle a first person shooter.\" Audrey's completely serious use of the word \"training\" made the other teens chuckle internally,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard, we can change the difficulty, and VATS makes it like a turn based game.\" Takuya said, only to immediately remember Audrey had no idea what that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to that realization, she asked \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically chess, except we know how to play it.\" Banagher clarified, he still had no idea how she was able to remember all the rules of chess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll definitely have to try this later then.\" They returned their focus to the game, only for Audrey to realize something ten seconds later. \"Wait, if \"perks\" are personality traits, then what does Sneering Imperialist make your character like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, a large grumble from Marida's stomach announced it was time for dinner. Looking down at her gut, past her huge tits, the one formally known as Puru 12 placed her hands on it. \"I need to keep this thing under control.\" She thought. \"All that exercise will be for nothing if I pig out again. And that goes for them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her hands off her stomach and looked at the others. \"Is anyone ready for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I am pretty hungry.\" Takuya said as he saved the game and turned off the Xbox. Remotely, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess exercise really does work up an appetite.\" Micott gave her stomach a few pats, jiggling it, a sight Takuya payed attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could definitely go for some pasta.\" Banagher rubbed his belly for emphasis, he didn't notice it but Micott's eyes were drawn to his hand and gut for the few seconds he did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the others' more enthusiastic reactions, Audrey looked at her tummy and grabbed a handful of it's blubber, squeezing it and feeling how squishy and soft it was, it was like cookie dough. Well, you are what you eat after all. \"This isn't good.\" She thought with a sad look. \"It doesn't matter how well I control my appetite, I'm going to sleepwalk and raid the fridge again. Oh, what do I do? Can I even do anything about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher noticed his friend looked down in the dumps, and was about to ask her what was wrong, when Marida said something he had to reply to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can cook you all some pasta.\" Marida suggested. \"Including you, Shin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it but aren't you tired? You're still recovering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do everything, Marida.\" Banagher held some guilt in his voice, guilt that Marida noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" She matter of factly said. \"My wounds have mostly healed and I didn't use all my energy for my workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still....\" He could see some truth in her words, aside from her walking speed being a little slower then usual, the sister he knew and loved was moving like nothing had happened. And she was a Cyber Newtype. \"Just let me know if you could use some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know how to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher could say that he could bring the ingredients (and some snacks) to her, Audrey let go of her belly fat and spoke up. \"Everyone, there's something I need to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, what's wrong?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about, you know, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Are you sure you? I thought you didn't want anyone to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't, but if I'm going to lose weight, they need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, you two are being dramatic.\" Micott said, a look of second-hand cringe on her face. \"This is probably just some coming out thing.\" The brunette thought. \"She's gonna admit she likes fat guys, like we didn't already know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dramatic! Dramatic!\" Haro playfully chanted in between the lovebirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got through finding out you're the last Zabi, whatever you've got to say can't be more serious then that.\" Takuya threw his arms behind his head, that combined the carefree way he said that and how pudgy he was (the gut poking out and chubby, freckled cheeks especially made him look cuddly) helped calm the princess' anxieties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" The princess then took a deep breath (making sure she didn't accidentally summon a loud belch) and said what she needed to. \"I'm the one whose been stealing food from the kitchen every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Was Takuya's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're the one who was going on about how you were gonna catch the thief.\" Micott pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective Audrey! Detective Audrey!\" Haro flapped his ears excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never called myself that.\" Audrey pouted, blushing. \"But yes, I did say I was going to catch the thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you steal?\" Marida sounded like a parent. \"It's unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't meant to.\" Despite that protest, she sounded incredibly embarrassed, and even after learning the truth, no one there would blame her. \"Banagher said I've been sleepwalking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleepwalking?\" Shin parroted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sleepeating, if you want to get specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now everything makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does?\" Micott skeptically said. If anything, things made LESS sense now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back during the One Year War, Vice Admiral Dozle once told me about how taxing the war was being on new recruits, and that he was making an effort to get to know them, he hoped his presence would help raise morale. He said some of them got sick from stress, or even sleepwalked.\" The White Wolf stood , walked the very short distance to the Zabi heir, and warmly pat her on the head. \"You haven't been feeling well, have you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... no.\" She sounded defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you at least feel a little better now that you let all that out?\" Banagher looked at her worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every bit counts.\" Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to help you through this.\" Banagher placed his hand on Audrey's, it felt nice for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no psychologist, but it sounds to me like what you need is some rest.\" Takuya suggested, he knew that helped him whenever he was feeling down. \"I know that's not gonna fix it completely, but it'll help a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we do in the meantime?\" Micott pointed out. \"If we don't keep Audrey from pigging out every night, she'll be five hundred pounds before the week is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to believe I wouldn't be that big.\" The princess ruffled some of her hair. \"But there is something I know I have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey stood outside Riddhe's room, Banagher by her side as he held Haro. Even though this was something she was determined to do, she found it hard to move her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do this either way, but are you really sure Riddhe will forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it wasn't like you did anything bad. All you did was accuse him of a minor crime, with decent evidence, and shook his belly.\" He then showed her a chubby grin. \"Which for for a guy like me,\" here, he gave a big slap to his own jiggly belly for emphasis. \"Is a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey smiled, Banagher was always good at making her feel better. \"I'll give you a few jiggles after I apologize.\"</span></div></div>",

There's something I need to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second of dead air to get a reply, which was just a big burp. Then she got a proper reply from Riddhe, whom she assumed the belch came from. \"Oh, uh, sure! Just give us a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out he didn't need just a second, he needed fifteen. To do what, his three friends waiting outside had no idea. They could only guess from the muffled words they heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try sucking it in.\" They heard Mihiro say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" They heard from both of them simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurts.\" They heard from Riddhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just gonna have to put up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey looked at each other in confusion, and in hopes they had some idea of what was going on in there, but their double chinned faces told each other they were just as clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Riddhe's words, the two walked into Riddhe's room to see him and Mihiro on the couch together. That was normal, what wasn't normal was that they were covered by a blanket. In fact, their faces seemed a little strained too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk about?\" The room's owner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the blanket?\" Banagher bluntly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We -URP- were just feeling a little chilly.\" Was Mihiro's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm the only one here wearing a coat, and even then my stomach is exposed, but it doesn't feel cold to me.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, we -URP- were.\" At the same time Riddhe lamely said that, Banagher felt Haro turn to the left side of the room and flap his ears to alert Banagher. The brunette looked over in the direction his nearly lifelong companion was, seeing a lot of empty snack bags and boxes shoved into and around a garbage bin. Hastily too, it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? You both look rather uncomfortable.\" Audrey felt Banagher tap her on the shoulder. Looking at him, she saw him wordlessly point to the garbage bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we're-Whew!\" Something forced Riddhe to sigh, his stomach rising under the blanket suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddhe!\" Mihiro scolded, only to immediately also unwillingly sigh as her tummy bulged out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zabi and Vist looked at each other and nodded, which made their double chins more pronounced, right before Audrey gabbed the blanket and dramatically pulled it off the Federation officers, revealing a pair of very swollen and distended bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones the bellies belonged to blushed as their guests' eyes went from their tummies to their faces. \"Okay, -BWARP- you caught us.\" As much as Riddhe would prefer his and Mihiro's recent binge remained secret, he appreciated that he didn't have to hold in his belches anymore, an appreciation Mihiro shared in regards to her own gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you guys trying to hide it in the first place?\" A confused Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not exactly in-shape ourselves.\" To drive the point home, because she found it oddly fun, and because she wanted Banagher to see, Audrey grabbed her fat belly and shook it, which Banagher and Riddhe enjoyed seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't like we planned this.\" Mihiro's face grew even redder as she began her excuses. \"We were just watching a few movies, and we thought a few snacks would go well with it, and we just sorta got carried away. BUUUUUUUUURRP!\" She slapped her hands over her mouth as soon as she unleashed that massive belch, her face scarlet. She would've preferred to have what she said be peppered with several smaller belches, instead of letting out that monster. She decided she was gonna have to rethink exactly how she should hold down her burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why did you try to hide it?\" Banagher repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's embarrassing that I was encouraging everyone to exercise and lose weight, only to pig out myself.\" While she said that with shame, Riddhe lazily belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to -URAP- set a bad example either.\" Riddhe added, rubbing his gut as he missed Mihiro's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've pigged out far too much ourselves to judge you for that.\" Audrey said as she thought back on their many binges. \"As I said, my stomach IS exposed, and so is Banagher's.\" Banagher gave his belly light slap when Audrey said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank, -URAP, you, Audrey. I was worried you were going to scold me.\" Mihiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not gonna with a gut like that.' Riddhe teased, eyeing said gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess self-consciously placed a hand over it, she was blushing a little but she didn't take offense to his joke, she actually found it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk to me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, that...\" Audrey nervously rubbed her arm, she needed a few seconds to muster up the strength to look Riddhe in the eyes. \"I'm the one whose been stealing food every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief silence that followed was pure agony for the princess, no one even belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro was the one who broke the silence. \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it.\" Riddhe said, but his tone made it obvious he didn't. \"This is that trick where you say you did something that I did, and you watch my reaction for anything suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Riddhe, I'm serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make any sense, why would you draw attention to it if you did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I didn't mean to!\" Her shame made her exclaim, shocking the others. \"Sorry.\" She said after clearing her throat. \"I've been sleepwalking. Sleepeating, if you want to call it that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro scratched the back of her head, looking like she was feeling the awkwardness of this whole mess. \"Well, it's not like we can blame you for sleepwalking, you've -BURRRRP- been through a lot, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Mihiro said would've helped ease the Zabi's fears if there still wasn't the something she had to seek forgiveness for. \"Thank you, Mihiro. I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But does this mean you're going to steal again tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where me, Takuya, Micott, and Haro come in.\" Banagher took a step forward, his gut jiggling as he stood side by side with his soulmate. \"We're gonna do what we can to keep her from reaching the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I won't give you all too much trouble.\" Audrey imagined her sleepwalking self knocking the others away with her gigantic gut, as if were a wrecking ball. \"But before we get too off topic, I have to apologize to you, Riddhe. I shouldn't have accused you based on circumstantial evidence. I'm truly sorry, if there's something I can do to make it up to you, just tell me and it will be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I -BWOOOORP- never really cared.\" Riddhe casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't?\" Her voice made it clear Audrey couldn't even comprehend the idea of Riddhe not being offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really wasn't a big deal. It was kinda annoying, and you were actually a little scary there, but I stopped caring, oh say, a few minutes later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Looking away, she placed a hand over her chest, making sure her tits didn't get in the way, she still wasn't 100% used to being fat. \"This is awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but things have been awkward on the Argama for over a week at this point.\" Mihiro drily pointed out. She didn't mean to, but the big burp she belted out after really helped drive her point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, is there anything we can do to help you with your sleepwalking?\" Riddhe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the offer, but I think it would be best if you left it to us.\" Audrey answered, here a loud rumble of hunger from her stomach forced it's way into the conversation. Blushing, she felt all eyes on her gut, including her own, as it shook and jiggled from the growling. \"If it's alright, we'd like to get dinner now.\" Another roar of hunger sounded, this time from Banagher's belly, the malleable orb shaking and jiggling just as much as Audrey's did. Also just like with Audrey, he blushed as everyone looked at his stomach, even himself. \"We're starving.\" Audrey added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro and Riddhe couldn't help but chuckle at the cute, tubby couple. \"Don't let us -URP- stop you.\" The blond man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher then left the room, their chubby bodies jiggling in synch. If the other fat couple there didn't immediately return to giving each other belly massages, they would've seen the Vist and Zabi's butts bouncing together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon leaving the room, they both came to a stop as the brunette started speaking. \"Sooo...\" A big, goofy smile grew on Banagher's face. \"How about those jiggles now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a small laugh, the blonde smiled back at him. \"I did say I'd give you a few, and I'm a woman of my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Banagher placed Haro on the ground, his chunky friend got to work. She grabbed the sides of his gut and shook it up and down. \"Aw, yeah...\" The brunette moaned in pleasure from the combined sensations of his soulmate's hands on his belly, her shaking it, and the resulting jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelfless as always, Banagher reached over and did the same to Audrey's stomach, who let out a very pleased \"Ahhhh...\" as she felt her belly fat be grabbed by the brunette right before he started shaking. The Zabi felt like her middle was a huge bag of marshmallows, and that Banagher was shaking it all around, and that somehow, that was an absolutely amazing feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a while, Haro watching two huge bellies bob, bounce, and jiggle as his friends shook them. They were truly lost in the feeling of having a loved one's hands on your belly and playing with it, and they had no problem with that. Their big bellies jiggled like mad as they went up and down, they could literally feel the jiggly goodness, both of their stomach and of their friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the growling of their stomachs returned, each fatty could literally feel the rumbling of the other's gut. They let go of each other's tummies and then bumped them together, keeping the jiggling going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it's time for dinner.\" Banagher asked as his gut kept bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's own gut was just as jiggly as she replied. \"Let's not keep our stomachs waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something about my sleepwalking that I'm confused about.\" The Zabi heir then started eating her bowl of pasta, cooked by Marida. The taste put a little smile on her face. \"Wow, this is really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you Marida's a good cook!\" Banagher gave his jiggly tummy a few pats, the large orb being the accumulation of calories from many meals his big sister has cooked for him, and stuffed him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're enjoying it as much as Banagher does.\" Marida said, thinking back on the pleased looks Banagher had on his round face after each meal she prepared for him. As much as she wanted to help him lose weight, those chubby, heartwarming smiles were worth all the pounds in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of Audrey, Banagher, Micott, Takuya, Shin and Marida was sitting at a table in the cafeteria, each digging into a tasty bowl of pasta Marida had each cooked around the same time. As much as they'd like to, they knew one can't just go from eating a ton to eating a normal amount in just one day, it was something that had to be built up to. So each bowl was, much like the ones eating out of them (except for Shin), extra large. They all felt rather guilty that Marida was making so much for them, not that they could stop her, but that feeling mostly dissipated when they saw her cook all this without breaking a sweat. Apparently cooking meals for herself for years really paid off in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for cooking this.\" Audrey said before eating more of her pasta. \"Anyways, what I'm confused about is that if every night I wake up and raid the fridge, then why didn't I didn't do that at Palau?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure you didn't?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive.\" She firmly said. \"I remember waking up every day there a lot more hungry then usual. I had no idea why at the time, I even thought it's possible there might just be something about Banagher that makes you want to pig out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that part's true.\" Micott commented and jiggled her own gut, a little disappointed Banagher didn't pa more attention to that then a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Takuya ate more pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing another forkful of pasta, Marida paused in her eating to look down at her massive stomach. Discreetly opening her medical ware, she placed a hand on her ball of a middle and felt it's incredible softness, comparable to a pillow. Thinking back on her binges with Banagher made her feel even fatter. Still, while she definitely gained even more weight since the day he moved in with her, she still felt like she was a little more in-shape then before, though she was well-aware that could just be a fluke or Banagher energizing her with his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have that kind of effect on you guys?\" Banagher scratched the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting off topic.\" The Zabi said. \"Do you have any idea why I didn't sleepwalk at Palau?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know where the kitchen was?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess brought a palm to her face. \"I can't believe I needed you to tell me something so simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's THAT supposed to mean?\" Takuya objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She defensively said. \"I just said I should've figured something that simple out of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've worded that differently, I know you didn't mean it like this but it sounded like you were saying you were above Banagher.\" Shin very lightly scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Audrey sank in her seat in guilt. \"I'm sorry, Banagher. I didn't realize how I came off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine.\" Banagher said as he kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All is forgiven!\" Haro sweetly said from under the bench the teens were sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how exactly are we gonna stop, Audrey?\" Takuya said later into dinner, everyone was about one fourth of the way into their bowel, except for Shin, who was halfway done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,\" Banagher started, his mouth full of pasta. He wisely swallowed it before continuing. \"The first time it was really hard for me to wake her up.\" He cringed as he flashed back to the image of poor Audrey hitting the counter. \"So our best bet to drag her back to my room, shouldn't be too hard with me, Takuya, and Micott working together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot about me and Marida.\" Shin noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Shin, I think you and Marida should sit this one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Marida asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's wrong with more help?\" Takuya asked before eating another forkful of his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, they're both trained soldiers, the techniques they were taught to restrain someone are way too rough, they're not meant to be used on your friend.\" Banagher explained as he tried to keep himself from visualizing such an event. \"And they're way bigger then her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean we couldn't restrain her without hurting her.\" Marida objected, using the same tone she would if she were objecting to the strategy during a combat mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I would pull her arm behind her back and apply pressure to ensure she can't move it. If she tries to escape, I'll tackle her and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, with your fat ass, that sounds pretty painful.\" Micott cut her off with her snarking, as she said that, Banagher looked at Marida, his arms crossed over his flabby chest, with an unamused look that said \"C'mon, how do you not realize that makes you look worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bully! Bully!\" Haro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" Was all Marida could say, as much as she wanted to say more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Excellency would never forgive me if I hurt his daughter.\" Shin said with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he would... In time, that is.\" Audrey comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your sake, you shouldn't encourage them.\" A completely converted Takuya told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their dinner firmly situated in their bellies, leaving them pleasantly full, Audrey, Banagher, Haro, Takuya, and Micott retreated to the Gundam pilot's room, with the latter two bringing their pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of their night playing whatever games they felt like, Audrey performing terribly like usual, until they winded down with some TV. This time it was mostly some cartoons, the blonde was very clearly unused to the idea of watching something that focused solely on being funny, but she still enjoyed herself. Another thing she and Micott enjoyed was that when Banagher laughed heartily at a particularly funny scene, his belly and cheeks jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of that, three minutes of which were spent explaining to Audrey the idea of a show not having continuity, it was time for bed. Each one, except for Haro, as much as the others thought he would look cute with clothes, got dressed in their pajamas, taking turns in Banagher's private bathroom to change and brush their teeth, the princess going last<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's were similar to Banagher's, with a simple green shirt and black shorts, his belly poking out of his shirt, which highlighted his man boobs, while Micott wore an orange tank top that couldn't cover her bellybutton, and blue short shorts that accentuated her bubble butt.</span></div></div>",

It was a yearly tradition for them, a fantastic way to settle into a lazy summer. Lord knows they'll need one after all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relaxation! Relaxation!\" Haro chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, we need a vacation.\" Despite the joyful topic, Micott then suddenly frowned. \"But it's not gonna be the same without... you know, everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the others shared her mood, even Haro looked sad. They tried to not think about it, but there was a strong part of all of them that dreaded returning to a normal life in Industrial 7. To see their once daily life without any of their classmates... it wasn't something they were sure they could handle yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggled to find the words to say, all any of them found was a sad \"Yeah...\" courtesy of Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the savior of the conversation, Audrey Burne, exited the bathroom in her ill-fitting and pink pajamas. \"What were you talking about? Something about the beach?\" She wobbled over to them, her tummy bouncing in front of all them, all four pairs of eyes watching it's gelatinous action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the Zabi's surprise, none of the others said anything, they just stared at her massive tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're not gonna pop out of that?\" Takuya asked, pointing to the heavily strained buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to look decent!\" She said with an angry look, though the blushing of her chubby cheeks dampened the effect she was going for. She then realized she forgot something. \"And no, I'm not. I'm not that fat.\" The buttons were holding on, but just barely. Each one, except for the one keeping her chest decent, was being stretched to their very limits, bubbles of fat had formed in the huge gaps between them. Overall, it looked ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" A disbelieving Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't look comfortable, Audrey.\" Haro pointed out. \"You should let your belly out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please go back to whatever you were talking about?\" The strawberry blonde requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just talking about about going to the beach when this is all over.\" Banagher answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how causally the pilot said that, the Zabi's round face lit up with childlike curiosity,  \"I've never been to the beach before, can I come?\" A flash of visible embarrassment later, she cleared her throat and abruptly forced that enthusiasm down in favor of a professional attitude. \"I mean, may I please come? I would appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can come! You're one of us now!\" Takuya enthusiastically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of us! One of us!\" Haro chanted as he bounced and flapped his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Banagher would pass up a chance to see you in a bikini.\" Micott teased with an amused look, enjoying how she got both of the lovebirds to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of, uh, swimsuits,\" Banagher couldn't stop himself from imagining Audrey in a white bikini, her fat belly, large tits, and bubble butt all being shown off. \"We're gonna need some new ones ourselves. No way we could fit into our usual ones like this.\" He grabbed a handful of his plentiful belly fat, with there being plenty of blubber to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The photo we take this year is certainty gonna look different from the others.\" Takuya, along with the others, found themselves looking at their guts. The orbs of adipose being so large each was nearly touching two others in a circle of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would a one piece swimsuit at least do a good job at covering my stomach?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Micott bluntly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother half hour spent watching TV, and the group was ready to go to bed. With two couches and a bed, Banagher's room was perfect for Micott and Takuya to sleep over. Both of them slept on one couch, covering themselves with a blanket from their own rooms, the shapes of their huge bellies sticking up into the air could be easily seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting together on the bed itself, Banagher asked Audrey a question. \"So, knowing that you're going to wake up later and raid the kitchen, how do you feel?\" The pilot wished he could've worded that a little more pleasantly, but there really wasn't a kinder way to say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel anxious, and I wish I could do something, but I know I'm in good hands with you, Takuya, Micott, and Haro.\" The princess answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for having faith in us, just leave everything to us.\" Truth be told, Banagher didn't have as much faith in himself as Audrey did, but there was no harm done in her not knowing that. At least, he thought so at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea for how you could stop me.\" Here, the blonde's blushing returned, along with a small, pervy smirk she was obviously trying to force away. \"You could s-sleep on top of me, belly to belly, chest to chest. Your weight should keep me pinned down.\" Most people would've realized they should add a \"no offense\" at the end there. But not Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher matched her blushing. \"You mean... snuggle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, that's one way to put it. It's not like we're strangers to that.\" Her own blushing and Banagher's intensified even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that blushing got even redder when Haro decided to start hopping up and down, ears flapping as he chanted \"Love! Love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott felt herself grow more jealous with every word of that whole scene, and Takuya felt himself growing more amused at all of them. \"Man, it's like they're trying to make Micott jealous.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the blonde laying down first, her chunky friend then slowly and nervously laid down on top of her, just as she suggested, they were belly to belly, and chest to chest, both parts of their bodies squishing together. It felt more then a little embarrassing for Banagher to rub his man boobs up against Audrey's tits, but oddly nice at the same time for both of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, is-is this good?\" The brunette asked the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, this'll do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all five members of the group exchanged their goodbyes, they found themselves soon drifting off to sleep. In the case of the Zabi and the Vist, much sooner then they thought they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot of the Unicorn Gundam was awake, and judging from the sleeping form of his soulmate, it wasn't morning yet. No way would she wake up before him, not counting sleepwalking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was still dark, two night lights being the only thing keeping it from being pitch black. He felt really tired, more then he usually was when he woke up in the morning. \"Looks like I'm awake.\" He thought. \"Feels like it hasn't been too long since I went to sleep. Maybe an hour or two. So why did I wake up? It feels like I had a bad dream, but I can't remember what it was. Guess that's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up at this point wasn't completely a bad thing though, he did learn something new about his soulmate because of it. \"Didn't know Audrey snores. It's kinda cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get back to his own snoring action,  he tried to drift back to sleep, and for a few more minutes, the only sounds were Audrey's snoring, and Micott or Takuya occasionally shifting around in their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that changed when he heard Audrey let out a moan. \"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why's she's moaning?\" A surprised Banagher thought. \"Am I doing something wrong? Is she uncomfortable? Am I touching something I shouldn't?\" Unfortunately, this wave of panic that splashed him made him lose focus on everything that wasn't the Zabi, and he found himself rolling off the princess as she started getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He said when he hit the ground, the impact making his gut and butt jiggle. As luck would have it, he landed on his back, making his tummy an obstacle in the way of getting back up. \"Audrey, wait!\" He shouted in the vain hope of snapping her out of it, feebly reaching out to her as she left the room at a surprisingly quick speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Links tried to force himself, grunting as his belly squished against his thick legs. It took ten seconds of grunt-filled effort to get up on his two feet. \"Look like all that exercise with Marida really paid off.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Haro already woken by Banagher's tumble to the ground, the brunette and rushed off to wake up his two other friends, with the robotic ball assisting him. Banagher went over to Micott while Haro went to Takuya. \"Guys, wake up!\" The pilot shook Micott awake by the shoulder, as firmly yet softly as humanly possible. \"C'mon, wake up! Audrey's sleepwalking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Micott groaned as she opened her eyes and brushed some of her hair out of them. \"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Micott got to be gently woken up by her crush, Takuya got something much less pleasant. Namely Haro jumping up and down on his gut like a dog, sending the orb into a jiggling fit. \"I'm Awake! I'm awake!\" Takuya shouted after the first jump, but Haro was so caught up in it that he kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left ten seconds ago.\" Grabbing Haro, Banagher ran outside his door, unknowingly treating Micott to the sight of his jiggly ass, and impatiently waited there for his friends. \"We can catch up easily.\" As soon as he saw his friends on their feet, he started running after Audrey, who had evidently turned around the corner, as he couldn't see her or her massive butt jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Takuya and Micott ran to the door, but suddenly found their momentum coming to a sudden and unexpected stop, as each well-fed teen felt the other's flabby flesh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Micott said in frustration. Yes, they had gotten stuck together in the door frame, like a cartoon comedy duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, not now!\" Takuya said as they both futilely tried to squeeze out of there. \"Banagher, help! We're stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his pleas, the Vist ran back to his chubby companions, his gut swaying form one to the next when he turned around. \"I've gotcha!\" Getting as close as he could, he grasped one hand from each of them. Micott was delighted to feel his big stomach touch her own, considering getting stuck in the door totally worth it. Takuya, not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was already feeling a little tired. After all, he had woken up way too early, had to battle his sphere of a middle to get up, run out and away of his room, and finally run back to his room. For a chunky guy like him, that was a decently large amount of exercise. So it was impressive he didn't even take a second of rest before he started pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for the three of them, Takuya and Micott were wedged in there tight. Banagher was putting in a good show, but his grunting and the slight redness of his face showed how much he was struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Banagher!\" Takuya cheered his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost out!\" Micott praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it! You can do it!\" Haro chanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot kept it up for a total of 14 seconds, needing to take a break to catch his breath. \"-pant- Just gimme -pant- a sec.\" Hunching forward and placing his hands on his meaty thighs, Banagher looked exhausted. \"Can't believe I let them down after all that.\" He mused with guilt. \"I can't do anything right, I'm just some useless, fat, blob... No, even if that's true, I can't fail them. I've gotta do this.\" With a determined look to make things right, Banagher grabbed his friends' hands again. \"Okay, here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled with all his might, and he found himself having more then thought. Just six seconds later, he freed his friends from their self-make prison, but immediately he almost regretted it, as the momentum none of them were thinking about sent them flying right into Banagher. The three of them crashed down hard to the ground, the poor brunette felt like he was being buried by his friends' fat, not that they were having fun either. At least their chubby friend's gigantic belly served as the best cushion they could ask for, but that still hurt like hell. Haro was the only one to get away from this unscathed due to his small size, giving him a front row seat to the intense jostling their entire bodies were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're... not off to a good start.\" Takuya might as well have been telepathic, as he said what everyone there was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two rolled off the poor brunette, the three of them (with some difficulty) got up and ran off to the cafeteria as fast as group of chubby high schoolers possibly could, their bodies jiggling like a huge orb of gelatin during an earthquake. The jiggling movements her two fat friends made was something she found to be a nice show, and they thought the same of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they DIDN'T like though, was all this running. Banagher's room wasn't as close tot he cafeteria as his tummy would like, so this meant a decent amount of running and jiggling. Banagher was handling this better then his friends, thanks to all the working he had been doing lately, even holding Haro the whole time didn't make thus more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the cafeteria, they were greeted by the sounds of loud belching from Zeon's princess, and the sight of her large bod obscuring some of the fridge light as she munched away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, look at her go.\" Having just entered the cafeteria, Micott couldn't get that good a look at the blonde, but she could tell from how the silhouette of her body was moving that she was pigging out fast and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw her eat like that before.\" Banagher knew this was a bad thing, but he couldn't help but think a girl eating like that was pretty damn cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you guys ready?\" Takuya asked. \"We grab her and drag her back to Banagher's room, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher knew the answer was probably yes, but he also knew he had to stick to his nice, huggable way. \"Let's just see if we can get through to her first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro voiced his approval by saying \"With friendship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching her normally, Banagher took the lead, with the other two humans following closely behind him. \"Hey, Audrey?\" When he called, Audrey turned around, her tummy swaying in a jiggly way. With a huge chicken nugget in her mouth, and a hamburger in each hand, she looked adorably goofy. \"It's us, Banagher, Micott, Takuya, and Haro. You're sleepwalking right now, we're here to help you get back-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were about to enter the kitchen, Audrey ran right up to Banagher, and with a fierce slam from her gut to his, sending both jiggling, she knocked him backwards, onto Takuya and Micott, once again, all three bodies shook with adipose. The princess slammed the kitchen doors shut before the others had a chance to even start getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, she's so cute during the day but at night she turns into a real monster.\" Takuya commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If someone needs to kick her fat ass to wake her up, I volunteer.\" A very annoyed Micott vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think any of us can, now that she's some kinda sumo wrestler.\" Banagher said, but what he was thinking was \"If Audrey did that to anyone besides us, I'd tell her that was awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around fifteen seconds for them all to get up, which is to say Audrey had fifteen extra seconds of gorging, and given the speed at which was shoveling food down her greedy moth, that meant she was eating a lot more during those fifteen seconds then you'd think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher tired to open the kitchen doors but found the handle barely moving. \"Huh?\" He tried again a few times and found the same result each time.\"She locked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole night has just been one problem after another.\" Micott groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How the hell did she get the key? Let me try.\" Banagher stepped aside and let Takuya try. While he had the same difficulty the brunette had, it wasn't a fruitless attempt, as he did notice something crucial. \"Hey, look! There's no keyhole!\" The others looked to see that the young man was right, there was no keyhole. \"She didn't lock it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why won't the door open?\" Banagher questioned. Come to think of it, the handle did feel a little more loose then a locked one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she blocked it or something.\" The big bottomed brunette suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a chair.\" Haro added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just kick the door until the chair is knocked away, grab Audrey, drag her to your room, and get some well-earned sleep.\" Takuya then attempted step one, his leg flab jostling with each kick. Unfortunately, nearly ten kicks later, and the doors still weren't budging. \"Okay, let's all try kicking it at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a simultaneous, perfectly timed kick from the three of them didn't accomplish anything other then making three flabby legs wobble instead of just one. Haro even jumped out of Banagher's grasp to hit the door, which didn't work either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta hit it with something stronger.\" Micott said as they heard Audrey rip another humongous burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Takuya asked. \"The benches here are part of the floor.\" As he said that, Banagher looked down at his belly with a quizzical look, inspecting it with a poke, and grab of his blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me we don't have to do more walking.\" Micott groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't, I've got an idea.\" For the first time in a while, Banagher sounded confident, it was a little surprising to the others actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo answer Micott's quesiton, Banagher gabbed his stomach and held it up to them, almost proudly. \"We hit it with our stomachs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, nice one, Banagher.\" Takuya chuckled. \"You always know how to keep our spirits up with a good joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious.\" Banagher clarified. \"Think about it, we've got over two weeks of gluttony in these things, and we can throw way more weight behind them. Audrey just knocked us down with her gut. If she can do it, why can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that actually makes sense.\" As a show of support, Takuya lifted his huge belly up in the same manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really stupid, but,\" Here, Micott too grabbed the sides of her tum and lifted it, presenting it to her cute friends. \"This whole situation is stupid, so it should work.\"</span></div></div>",

It took them a few seconds to actually stop jiggling, Banagher's being the last to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Audrey was still there, gorging like nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, Banagher, I never would've thought of that.\" Takuya thanked, giving his gut a slap, which of course sent it right back into jiggling mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As cheesy as this sounds, you really saved the day.\" Micott was VERY tempted to give him some congratulatory belly rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher's a hero!\" Haro said as he rolled up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher (unsuccessfully) tried to hide a smile, sheepishly rubbing the back of his head. \"Thanks, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you blushing?\" Micott grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. Let's go wake up Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speed waddled over to the blonde, the others followed him but made sure to stay back far enough the brunette getting knocked down again wouldn't cause him to fall onto them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Audrey?\" Before he could say anymore, the Unicorn Gundam's pilot slipped on an empty bag of chips, one Audrey has uncharacteristically thrown aside when she finished it. While he didn't fall over, he did lose his balance and bump into the blonde. \"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see it from his perspective, but he had knocked poor Audrey's swollen tummy into one of the fridge's shelves, her eyes widened the microsecond contact was made. \"BOOOOOOOOOOORP! Ow!\" She stumbled back, wincing in pain with her hands on her orb of a middle, and soon crashed down onto the floor, neither she nor her gurgling stomach appreciated the extra jostling. \"Please rub my belly, Banagher.\" She reflexively said, still half-asleep and not entirely aware of her bearings. \"It hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs filled with guilt as his soulmate was with food and soda, Banagher rushed to her side, thier stomachs touching, and began apologizing with a nice belly massage. \"Of course. Sorry about that.\" He placed both hands on the top of the Zabi's very stuffed tummy and started gently moving them in soothing circles, the lucky girl emitting a sigh that proved she was enjoying this. \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-Yeah, I -BURRORRRP- do. Your belly rubs always make everything better.\" Her eyelids rose, a sign to everyone that was regaining her full awareness. \"BWAAAARRP! Ooohh, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down, unintentionally getting an eyeful of his and her middles. \"I screwed up, I couldn't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, WE screwed up. WE couldn't stop her.\" Sitting down next to Banagher and placing a hand on his shoulder, Takuya said that like it was something to be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did I even get up?\" As the blonde said that, Micott sat next to Banagher's other side, with Haro. \"You were on top of me.\" Audrey had zero idea how sexual that sounded out of context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh,\" The Links tried to come up with a way to say this that didn't make him sound like a ball of fat, but he ultimately had to bite the bullet. \"Rolled off you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey tried to stifle a giggle and a smirk, both unsuccessfully. \"Literally -UURRP- rolled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they all heard the sound of a giggle trying to escape. \"I'm sorry. It's just such a cu-Er, funny. Such a funny idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty funny.\" Micott used her agreement as an excuse to gave Banagher's gut some loving pats, jostling the puffy orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back on topic, why weren't you able to restrain me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were surprisingly badass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess raised an eyebrow quizzically. \"What's wrong with my butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher opened his mouth to say something, but an amused Takuya caught him in time. \"Don't, I love that she doesn't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that made Audrey even more confused, she decided to just drop the topic. \"Anyways, I'm sorry I gave you all a hard time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault.\" Banagher assured, he felt a gurgle beneath Audrey's blubber right before she belched again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't blame you for sleepwalking.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your stomach feeling now? Does it still hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess then placed her own hand on her massive tummy. \"BUUUuRRRP! Aside from the normal aching when I'm bloated, and the indigestion, no, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked relieved. \"That's good. Which means it's time for me to eat.\" With a grunt, the chubby brunette got up and walked to the fridge, his confused friends watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" The blonde of the group asked as she saw his butt bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me,\" Casually, he grabbed a huge assortment of various foods, from cookies to chicken and everything in between, and walked back to his friends. \"I'm not one to leave you alone with a problem.\" He sat down and placed the huge pile in the middle of the circle they had unknowingly formed. The big-bellied pilot decided to start with a classic, a big hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I getcha now.\"Takuya and Micott enthusiastically joined him. The former started eating some potato chips, while the latter helped herself to some chicken nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't.\" A guilty Audrey said, Haro by her side. \"Just because I ruined my diet, doesn't mean you all should too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing this for your sake.\" Micott said. \"And because this is some good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess shamefully looked down, seeing her tummy, and knowing the others would soon be sporting similarly bloated middles. \"I'm just -URP- dragging you all down with me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Hey, don't think of it -munch- like that.\" Takuya, getting some crumbs on his tummy. \"Think of it like we're supporting you in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya's right.\" Banagher said after taking another bite out of his burger. \"Would you really feel better if we out-paced you during exercise? If we were all watching on the sidelines while you were alone on the mat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey scoured the deepest regions of her mind for a counterargument, but every time she envisioned that scenario, she found that no, she didn't want to be the only jiggly one. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why we're doing this, because we wanna be in this together. Friends share their problems, and they don't mind doing it, just like they share their food. You see what I'm getting at? Or am I doing a crappy job at this?\" Fittingly, he punctuated that sentence by taking another bite out of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding?\" Micott rhetorically asked through a mouth of chicken, her words garbled. \"Audrey wasn't kidding when you said you're the heart of this group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's always been like this, Audrey.\" Haro informed, though the blonde could always tell that was the case. Something about Banagher just tells you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... In that case,\" Audrey's guilty look was washed away by a small smile. \"Eat up, everyone.\"</span></div></div>",

Though due to the princess' belly still being as stuffed as can be, it was awkwardly done on her part, and all the sudden motion wasn't exactly doing at a good job at keeping the aching from starting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two men from the Garencieres with Marida quickly followed them. The smaller one got up first, but was knocked right back down with a kick from an at the time still thin Banagher. This left the brunette open to an attack from the larger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs filled with a desire to protect her new friends as she was with hot dogs, Audrey belly bumped the man off the platform, her belly jiggling as furiously as she was blushing. She placed a hand on it, as if in disbelief that this was her now, unaware this was just a (comparatively) small start to a big, BIG thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good job!\" An impressed Banagher complimented as he caught Haro, right before<br>\r\n he started running with the princess again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really -BWAARRP- wish you didn't remember that detail.\" A bloated and blushing Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it was really -BUUURP- cool!\" A now bloated Banagher fondly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you -BWAARP- kicked a guy's ass with only your gut!\" Takuya concurred in his own special way, he too was bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't cool, it was undignified. BUUUUURRP!\" A pudgy princess pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that guy care -BUuUuURRP- cared about that.\" Micott pointed out, as stuffed to the gills as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of them in a circle in a very dimly lit room, with the fridge light being the only source of bright light, and trading stories, the atmosphere of the night had changed from that of a mission to keep Audrey's personal demons from controlling her body, to that of a campfire. A normal life was funny like that, Audrey had learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ends don't justify the means.\" Audrey said without a hint of irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you seriously using -BUUOORRRP- that phrase to talk about your stomach?\" Micott was wearing a face that screamed \"Get a load of this guy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a true phrase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's not about bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Banagher resumed. \"It's a good thing you did that,. Like I said, not only did you save both of us then, but -OOOORRRP- it's gave me the idea for how we could break down the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the way you were eating,\" Takuya spoke through another mouthful of chips.  \"You would've -OOOOUURRRRP- exploded if we didn't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate -BUUUURRRARP- you all stopping that.\" The blonde played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped yourself too.\" The friendly as always Banagher pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you're all helping yourselves now?\" Audrey poked fun at them as she literally poked her pal's gut, wearing traditional smirk one wore while engaging in a little friendly teasing, the chubbiness of her cheeks (and her double chin) making it look even cuter on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" With a goofy grin, Banagher then shoved some more hamburger into his mouth, alternating between that in one hand, and a hot dog in the other, a true display of fast food gluttony on par with Audrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the three gluttons currently stuffing themselves were all in a mood for a separate category of food. Banagher was stuffing his big gut mainly with fast food, like corn dogs, burgers, pizza, and of course, hot dogs. Takuya was filling himself mostly with snacks, like chips, crackers, and pretzels. Lastly, Micott was pigging out on a nice selection of sweats. Cake, ice cream, chocolate, it was all going into her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking -UUUURAAARP- of help, what are we gonna do tomorrow?\" Micott was the one to bring up the elephant-sized belly in the room, in between slices of cake. \"We're still gonna run -BURARP- into the same problems. Maybe you could teach us some of that sumo stuff you picked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably enough, Audrey's face flushed red as she complained with an angry look that her pudge rendered cute(r). \"It's not sumo! And I'm not going to teach it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on. We could really use it.\" Takuya lazily scratched his belly, giving another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else are we gonna st -OOOORRORP- op you?\" Micott pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got a point.\" Banagher remarked, much to Audrey's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you -UUURRARP- too...\" She pouted. \"Oh, all right. But you're better off asking Marida about this sort of stuff anyways.\" And with those complaints out of the way, it was time for the lesson.  Placing her hands on the huge orb that filled up her lap as she sat with her legs, hearing and feeling  it gurgle and bubble as she struggled to digest her raid, she unleashed a giant burp as she tried to think of the most dignified way she could word this. \"You... -BWAAARRP- think of your body as a battery ram, with your stomach being the front of it, and throw all your weight into your enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a Snorlax?\" Haro innocently ruined her attempt at dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping we were closer in weight to a Munchlax, but yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound hard.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she did literally do it in her sleep.\" Takuya couldn't resist making that pun, and he had no desire to resist the urge either. \"So whose-\" For once eager to learn something that didn't have anything to do with mobile suits, robotics, gaming, models, or anime, tried to stand up, but found his overstuffed stomach weighed more then he thought. \"Ready for to try it out?\" He soon realized that unfortunately, he wasn't ready himself, and gave up trying to stand up. He was barely able to lift himself off the ground. \"Whew, didn't think -BURRAARP- I was that stuf -URRP- fed yet.\" His tummy gurgled in response to a poke, it's owner finding that as full as he was, he still had a pretty soft gut. \"Can any of us move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of an answer, all he got was some awkward silence, aside from more munching gluttony, gurgling tums, and gassy eruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro ended up being the first one to say anything. \"Do I count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott, -OORRRAARP- you know that trick I taught you to wake up a lazy friend?\" As she said the last half of that sentence, she looked at Banagher to her side with a mischievous smirk which he noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAP! It never gets old.\" Micott said, and her smirk added \"I like where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept munching on a burger, Banagher looked back at Audrey, just a tad nervously, his gaze saying \"You're gonna make me the guinea pig, aren't ya?\" and Audrey's continued gazing at him replied with \"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll like this one I forgot to tell you about. UUUURRRRRP! It helps expel the gas from a turbulent stomach.\" Having hyped the moment up well enough (even Takuya was curious, if not in the same way the girls were), the Zabi heir expelled some gas of her from her turbulent tummy, raised her hand up playfully menacingly, placed it on the top of the pilot's swollen belly, and pressed down, eliciting a \"BWOOOOOOOORP!\" from his lips, which had some ketchup on them. The blonde giggled and then so did the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's -UURRP- fun.\" Micott remarked, pleased in more then just one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move, but you left yourself open!\" With a playful look, and an equally playful raise of his hand, Banagher got his \"revenge\" by  doing the same to her, the pressure of his hand forcing a belch of equal magnitude out of the blonde. \"OOOOOUUURRRRRRP!\" She belched, and then laughed with her chunky, bloated soulmate. \"Pardon us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the display, Micott unexpectedly felt a plush hand push down on the top of her gut, resulting in the brunette burping too. \"UUuUUUUUUURP! Hey!\" She said at Takuya, but she couldn't stop herself from having a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to get you before you got me!\" Takuya joked, his belly wide and wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna get you anyways!\" True to her words, Micott pushed down on Takuya's gut, making him burp just as loudly as everyone else. \"UURRRURAARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it really does help -URP- with the bloating.\" Banagher rubbed his tummy. \"I know another a cool trick for that.\" The pilot then looked down at his orb of a middle, being not completely overstuffed yet, it was around equal to the size of Audrey's belly. He could see his stomach perfectly fine, but he couldn't see his exact target. \"You just give yourself a poke here,\" he placed his index finger right next to his cavernous navel, then poked it, his entire finger fitting without difficulty. \"And -BUUUUUUUUUURP-! Ahh...\" He noticed the huge blushes Audrey and Micott were sporting, but had no idea of their nature nor that he was the cause behind it, something even Haro knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak -URAAAURP- of buttons,\" Takuya was giving himself a belly rub with one hand, and a big pretzel with the other. \"I think you lost yours again, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Blushing before she even looked down, Audrey held up the flaps of her pajama top and saw that yes, she had popped them off during her eating frenzy. \"Oh, come on! BUUUUUUURRRP!\" She belched in frustration.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey and Banagher versus Marida, a team of two big bellies up against one giant gut, an eating contest for the ages.  This was a match that could go either way. While Marida was mush fatter then both of them, and could definitely defeat one of them alone, the amount of food the fat princess and her obese knight could pack away together was truly impressive, plus they could also give each other belly rubs. But even with that in mind, Marida was still an eating machine who had won Best Eater twice. So the question was which was more powerful, blubber from months of pigging out, or blubber from pigging out with a dear friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size their bellies reached amazed the other party members, Audrey and Banagher already had some impressive bellies, each one being a huge ball of dough, with Banagher's being even bigger then Audrey's, and Marida's was even bigger then Banagher's gut. While the brunette and blonde's tummies were already hanging out for all to see even before the party, the redhead's actually forced the lower part of her top to spread, like someone opening a door and revealing themselves. Already each of the remaining contenders had eaten enough to make their stomachs swell to greatly. And as their bellies grew bigger, so did their belches, some of them reaching a level of sound that was able to send vibrations through the air. They also became more common as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone was still chatting like normal, and Audrey wasn't done with Pokemon yet, the eating contest was starting to become as entertaining as a good show or video game. So it was natural that they would discuss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who -URP- do you guys think is gonna win?\" Takuya asked, he and Micott were still massaging their gurgling stomachs. \"My money's on Banagher and Audrey. I mean, just look at them -BUURRRRP- eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Marida is way bigger. BUUURP! Err, no offense.\" Riddhe said, he and Mihiro tending to their own bellies. Out of all of them, Mihiro seemed to be handling her stomachache the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None -BWAAAP- taken. it's not like you said was untrue.\" Marida finished another bowl of ice cream, then immediately began scooping chocolate ice cream out of it's cartoon and placed the scoops into the large bowl. Belching, she rubbed her now completely exposed stomach with one hand as she did the scooping with the other. \"if anything, it's a compliment in this context, since having the bigger belly is my key to -UUUURRAARP- victory.\" Showing a rare, small competitive smirk, she gave her gut a proud slap, she belched again as it jiggled, the jiggling emphasizing her point further. Even as packed full as she was, the Puru's stomach still had plenty of jiggle to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen you this pumped up -UUUURRRP- since we won Best Eater at the parlor.\" Banagher commented, looking at the way her tummy jostled and swayed from the impact of her pudgy palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you even get like this -BEEEELLCH- when you're in a battle.\" Audrey said, also looking at Marida's jiggles as she chowed down on a hamburger. Saying theta reminded her of how much trouble Marida has when she tires to zip up her normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, BURARARP! But you're both pretty pumped too.\" Micott commented, rubbing her underbelly. \"And it's two on one. ORARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm actually engaging in this discussion, but that's a moot point. UURRRAARR!\" Mihiro said as she tenderly rubbed the middle of her gut with both hands. \"Marida is as big as the two of them combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida gulped down another spoonful of ice cream. \"Actually, that's not true. I'm not THAT big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya casually burped. \"So that just leaves Haro and Shin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have faith in the princess and Banagher.\" Shin answered as he fondly looked on at them as they kept pigging out and gaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! Me too!\" Haro said as he excitedly started bouncing on Banagher's big belly, each bounce forcing a burp out of the poor guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! BURP! Haro, -URRRRRP- watch the -BOOORRP- belly! UUURRRRP!\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled at this, though said giggling was quickly interrupted by a startled belch she let out once Haro decided to start bouncing on her huge belly instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were already so full, it took way longer then one would think for them to start slowing down. Whether it was ice cream, cake, chips, pretzels, cookies, hot dogs, burgers, or whatever, they just keep on shoveling more of it into their mouths, their bellies growing with every gulp. While Marida and Banagher were sitting normally, with their massive bellies past their laps, Audrey was sitting with her legs crossed, which meant the sides of her gut were touching her legs. Banagher thought she looked pretty cute like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Banagher grunted and ten burped loudly as he rubbed his stomach, his round face showing some exhaustion. \"Oof. BBBUURRRP! Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" A concerned Audrey asked, taking a quick break from her gorging to check up on him. She saw that his belly was nearly as large as it was when they finished their \"reunion binge\" (as they liked to call it), which is to say it was nearly the most bloated Audrey have ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm -URP- fine.\" Banagher said before he resumed eating a bag of chips. \"How about you?\" He said through a mouthful, Audrey barely able to understand what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk with your mouthful.\" Audrey then burped into her fist. \"And I'm fine too, thank you for asking.\" She looked down at her gut, seeing that it too was starting to reach the size it had at the end of the reunion binge. \"Though I think I'm going to need some belly rubs to get through this.\" Smirking, she grabbed Banagher's pudgy hand, she nearly dropped it out of surprise (having never touched a salt covered hand before), and led it over to the top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll be happy to oblige. Though I'm gonna need some too.\" Smirking as well, his had more emphasis from his chubby cheeks, Banagher did the same with Audrey's hand, a hand which still wasn't used to the feeling of a salt covered one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies. Still smirking, they looked each other in the eyes before they closed them and simultaneously unleashed a massive belch, one big enough to make their bellies jiggle. \"BUUUUUUUURRRRP!\" When their five seconds long gaseous eruption ended and Banagher saw Audrey's emerald green eyes as she saw his chocolate brown eyes, they let out a bellyful (no pun intended) laugh, Banagher's cheeks and Audrey's boobs jiggling along with their tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while the expansion of three contenders' respective bellies was the only reminder they weren't black holes. That night they ate more then any of the other partygoers had seen, it was only matched by the amount Audrey and Banagher ate during their reunion binge. For Takuya, Micott, Riddhe, Mihiro, and Haro, they saw the huge (no pun intended) improvement from how they performed in the last eating contest. Already they had eaten twice of what they could put away back then. Of course, that was over 50 pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's strategy was different, as weird as she felt coming up with a strategy for something as mundane as an eating contest. She started out by eating relatively slowly, keeping her stomach from getting too full too quickly. then  when her opponents, Audrey and Banagher in this case, started to slow down, she would proportionality increase her speed, allowing her to easily catch up and surpass them in theory. This was a strategy competitive eaters often used but she didn't get the idea from that, instead she got it by applying a military strategy she knew to an eating contest. Which she was pretty sure was the strangest thing she had ever done and that it was 100% because of Banagher's influence. She actually felt a little giddy about this, though she kept a stoic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the success of Marida's plan depended on how much Audrey and Banagher could eat, which was a lot. Seeing how much the princess could pack away still was a little surprising to Marida. Just a week ago she used to have such a petite figure and a small appetite to go with it, now she was obese with a big belly and a big appetite. Her and Banagher's eating skills were so good that when they started to reach their limits, the fatter Marida was starting to reach her own. All three's eating speed seemed to get a little slower every minute. It was like a song that slows down towards the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Banagher, Audrey, and Marida all dropped what they currently eating and flopped into their respective couches, each letting out a giant belch unison. Audrey and Banagher groaned as they massaged each other's tummies, Marida groaned too as she massaged her full gut. Their stomachs were massive, filling up their laps and then some. It almost looked like they had giant Haros in their laps, Haros they had earned with their amazing eating skills. Audrey and Banagher's were as massive as they were by the end of their reunion binge, while Marida's was nearly twice it's size when it wasn't full of food. All three champions of eating continued to groan and burp in both pain and pleasure, their stomachs gurgling and bubbling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys done now?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey belched, then Banagher, and then Marida, all three looking exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take that as a yes.\" An amused Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's another tie then, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

Eating yourself sick, breaking belts, popping buttons, belching, seeing your stomach swell to an incredible size, gaining weight, getting fat, she couldn't comprehend why anyone would want to do any of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might still be hungry.\" Banagher clarified. \"You could eat as much as you'd want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, I just had five hotdogs and a large soda, I'm full.\" Mineva said. She didn't know why Banagher would think she was still hungry, but then again she did just have a rather large meal, maybe he assumed she had a big appetite. She couldn't really blame him if that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving her answer, Mineva's stomach let out a loud growl. She put a hand on her hungry tummy, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll enter.\" Mineva said, turning her head away from Banagher, trying to hide her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It starts in ten minutes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't believe we're doing this.\" Audrey said as she and Banagher walked up to a table where they would sign up for the eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like we're going to eat that much. We'll quit as soon as we're full.\" Banagher said, holding Haro in his arms. \"Besides, this could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't see how it could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then walked to the table and registered (after paying their entry fees, of course) for the contest as a team. Including them, there were four teams of two and the first place prize was a regular looking trophy that had a hot dog at the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher took their spots at their team's table, Haro sat in Banagher's lap. The chairs were comfortable enough but they were nothing like the ones Audrey had at home. As the princess of Zeon, Audrey lived in a luxurious mansion and the furniture there was some of the best there is. Much of it was personally crafted by Zeon loyalists. Audrey knew she was very spoiled and pampered (and she would be the first to admit it) and that she just needed time to adjust to a normal life but she honestly couldn't imagine how someone could be satisfied with furniture like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the brunette and blonde were just waiting for the contest to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Audrey?\" Banagher had noticed Audrey's discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just the fact that we're doing this.\" The blonde explained. \"That and my chair isn't too good but that's probably just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this won't take too long.\" Banagher said. \"But if we somehow do win, what do you want to do with the trophy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd want you to keep it.\" Audrey stated. \"I really wouldn't want anyone but you to see me with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want.\" Banagher then noticed something about what his new friend just said. \"Wait, what did you mean when you said you didn't want anyone but me to see you with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush appeared on Audrey's surprised face. She opened her mouth to stutter out an explanation but she was cut off before she could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to the 7 Hogs, Meet Your Dogs contest!\" The announcer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the announcer continued his opening speech, Audrey looked at the other contestants, there was six others. She was surprised to see that most of them were slim like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were expecting everyone to be fat, weren't you?\" Banagher teased with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Audrey replied, a bit embarrassed. continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a friendly giggle and Audrey soon started smiling herself and joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that we've got the introductions out of the way, let's begin!\" The announcer proclaimed at the end of the opening, the audience cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few young men then began placing plates of hot dogs on the contestants' tables, as well as a cup, a bottle of water, and a bottle of soda. The contest was three rounds in total, so the contestants were given some drinks from the start and were allowed to have more whenever they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Audrey?\" Banagher asked, an eager grin on his face as he prepared to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" Audrey answered, a similar look on her face. She figured she might as well enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, Banagher! Go, Audrey!\" Haro contributed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Haro.\" Audrey said as Banagher gave their robotic friend a few affectionate pats. Audrey found the little guy adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark!\" The announcer shouted. \"Ready\u2026Set\u2026Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher began digging into their hot dogs, as did the other contestants. Audrey's face lit up when she bit into her hot dog, it was made by the same cook who made the hot dogs she and Banagher ate. It had the same toppings and tasted just as good. A big smile appeared on Audrey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey ate at the same pace she always did and with the excellent manners she always displayed. It was pretty unusual to see someone like her in an eating contest. Banagher ate at a casual pace and while his manners were good they weren't quite as good as his blonde friend's. Occasionally crumbs or some sauce would end on his mouth and he would just lick it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the first round would come to an end and everyone was still in. Banagher and Audrey engaged in small talk as they waited for the next round to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was good.\" Banagher said, giving his stomach a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly was.\" Audrey replied. \"Though we might've eaten a bit too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you wanna call it quits?\" Banagher asked. \"I'm fine with that if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey thought about it, while it was true that they needed to hurry to the mansion, the meeting between the Vist Foundation and the Garencieres wasn't going to happen for hours, so she could afford to spend some more time with Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose spending a bit more time here wouldn\u2019t be all that bad,\" Audrey said contemplatively. \"I mean, if it\u2019s alright with you, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don\u2019t worry, my schedule\u2019s not the busiest,\" Banagher said with a grin. \"This is the perfect way to pass the time, if you ask me. And hey, we could get a trophy by the end of all this, so win-win, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends then ate their way thorough the second round. While they had only intended to eat just a few more hot dogs before leaving, they ended up eating over a dozen of them. Their bellies had become much bigger from their goring, Banagher's belly had caused his shirt to rise above his bellybutton and strained his belt and pants' button, while Audrey's was pressing against her coat, straining the buttons on it almost to the point of popping. Their bellies were desperately trying to to pop off the button on their pants and be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro was now sitting in between Audrey's and Banagher's chair as the two rubbed their stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we ate so much.\" Audrey moaned as she rubbed her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Banagher said, giving his tummy a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so full. UUUURRRP!\" Audrey immediately slapped her hands over her mouth, blushing very heavily. The blonde was perhaps the most embarrassed she had ever been in her life. She had always displayed perfect manners at every meal yet here she had just unleashed a huge belch. \"E-E-Excuse me.\" She muttered as she removed her hands from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Banagher said, a warm smile on his face.  \"You're excused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Audrey said, a small smile on her face. It was clear that she was still embarrassed but she felt better now that she knew Banagher wasn't bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Au \u2013UUURRRP-!\" Banagher began blushing himself, just like Audrey did. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled, Banagher was being too cute. \"Don't worry about it. You're excused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks.\" Banagher said, a dorky smile on his face. \"Hey, when this whole stuff with the Vist Foundation is over, do you wanna hang out or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Banagher.\" Audrey answered, smiling sweetly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So do you play any-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large SNAP cut off Banagher, catching both his and Audrey's attention. Banagher's gut had snapped his belt in half. Their faces both turned red as they looked down at their clothes. A few seconds of silence passed, with neither of them knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, guess that means I'm good at this, right?\" Banagher said, a sheepish smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's one way to look at it.\" Audrey stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna call it quits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey thought about it. It was obvious that they had eaten too much, and they were sure to gain some weight from it. Any further gorging would cause them to gain even more weight. Banagher's tummy had just snapped his belt in half, if they continued stuffing themselves, Audrey would damage her clothes and Banagher would damage his even more. Not to mention that their stuffed bellies would make it harder for them to walk to the mansion. Could they even eat any more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Audrey still wanted to stay. This contest had turned out to be a surprisingly fun experience and she could tell that Banagher was enjoying it as much as she was. It felt so amazing to enjoy herself and be an ordinary girl. Banagher was the first person her age who viewed her as a person, as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I want to win this.\" Audrey said. \"If you're up for it, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this would be fun.\" Banagher playfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of,\" Audrey said, looking down at her straining coat with a smirk. \"It\u2019s certainly a chance to try out something that no one thought I\u2019d come across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and final round was soon about to begin. Once again, a few young men placed hot dogs and drinks on the contestants' tables. Despite how full they were feeling, Audrey and Banagher were up to the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Audrey?\" Banagher asked his friend, determined grins on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark!\" The announcer shouted once again. \"Ready\u2026Set\u2026Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey began digging into their meal, shoveling hot dogs into their mouths as fast as possible. Unlike the first two rounds, which were a matter of endurance, the winner of the final round would be whoever finished eating first. As such, they needed speed up their eating in order to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally Banagher and Audrey would release a loud belch. This removed some of the pressure in their stomachs, allowing them to eat more. It was a bit embarrassing to to burp in public like that but it was needed if they were going to win.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several more minutes of forcing food down, Audrey was nearly red in the face from the effort. She had no idea anyone could get tired from eating, but then again, she was hardly omniscient. The pain in her gut and the sweat pouring down her face made her legitimately worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on, but she knew she had to. Banagher seemed to be faring much better than her, still happily munching on the latest hot dog that was unveiled after he got done eating the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the current dog she was on, Audrey suppressed a sigh of relief as she looked down at the damage the meal had done so far. What she saw made her nearly fall out of her chair. Her stomach had practically become spherical as her meal was crammed tight into it, the blonde\u2019s abdomen pushing against her coat with all its might. The princess knew the fabric was obscuring everything that wasn\u2019t the front, and frankly, she didn\u2019t mind one bit. Considering the straining buttons that were only holding on through what seemed like a miracle from God, the threads were so short, contemplating the damages all those calories would do to her was not something Audrey particularly felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked back down at the hot dogs, her stomach almost dropping at the prospect of eating more. Yes, it was for Banagher. Yes, there was a part of her that was genuinely pushing her to indulge in more and more of this strange aspect of the world. However, even knowing all of that, the blonde princess still felt it was necessary to psyche herself up for the near-Herculean task she was meant to overcome. She steeled herself, inhaled deeply\u2026and a loud *ping* greeted her ears, accompanied by a sudden sense of freedom in her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Audrey craned her head down to look at what she knew was the cause. Pale flesh was just finishing seeping through the newly-exposed gap that her coat\u2019s middle button had kept sealed this whole time. Audrey gasped, and immediately regretted it, for the other button just below the previous also ended up biting the bullet as it flew off and pinged against the metal of the table. And as if to add salt to the wound, her pants\u2019 zipper was also undone, lowering down enough that part of her panties was actually visible. The sight was enough to make the Zabi\u2019s face turn scarlet instantaneously, yet another bout in this eventful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercoming her mortification by just the tiniest amount, Audrey was able to tentatively look over to the side at her new friend, feeling a pair of eyes on her. What she saw confirmed her fears: Banagher had definitely noticed what happened. After all, two pings in quick succession couldn\u2019t be written off as just a trick of the ears, much as she wanted that to be the case. As expected, his eyes were drawn straight to the young woman\u2019s unceremoniously-exposed paunch, bloated beyond recognition. Audrey couldn\u2019t actually make out what Banagher\u2019s expression was, his face possessing a strangely stoic look, but upon seeing him raise his head to look into her eyes, she promptly turned her head to the side to avoid any answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Everything was ruined. Banagher would think she was disgusting, that was the only logical path. She knew there were greater things at stake (the whole reason she was visiting this colony being the biggest), but at the moment, none of her thoughts allowed that to appear at the forefront. Instead, all of the blonde\u2019s brain power was dedicated to figuring out how to get out of this situation with as much dignity as possible. How exactly could she get out of this? What would Banagher say? And even if he was polite, Audrey knew-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Audrey?\u201d A voice cut her out of her own frantic ideas. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026That was surprising. Audrey looked over at Banagher, taken off-guard for a moment by the question. What did he mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d That was the only thing she could think of on a short notice. Banagher donned a look of understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I get it. You\u2019re pretty embarrassed, huh? Guess I can\u2019t really blame you,\u201d Banagher said, before getting a bit quiet himself. Audrey could tell there was a contemplative look in his eyes. Suddenly, though, they lit up as a smile donned on the brunette\u2019s face. \u201cActually, as I think you can probably tell, my clothes aren\u2019t exactly loose, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his own stomach a pat, allowing Audrey to take notice of just how bloated it was compared to her own. Honestly, the princess hadn\u2019t been paying too much attention for a while there, but it was obvious that Banagher\u2019s own abdomen hadn\u2019t escaped the effects of this competition, either. In fact, even upon giving it a quick glance, it was apparent that it was actually bigger than Audrey\u2019s by about an inch or so. Audrey couldn\u2019t help but smile; it was cute that Banagher was willing to show how much he\u2019d gotten carried away in order to make her feel better. However, nothing could\u2019ve prepared her for what he did next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend inhaled his own none-too-small amount of air, cheeks bulging out considerably. Accompanying this was his stomach expanding as well, an act that was causing an obvious amount of discomfort for Banagher. However, he only had to continue for a couple seconds, since the button keeping his pants quickly yielded to the overwhelming force of flesh pushing against it, adding yet another *ping* to the scene. And just like Audrey\u2019s own wardrobe malfunction, the brunette\u2019s zipper was quick to follow suit, accommodating the too-large-to-handle dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was practically stunned. What was that? Had Banagher just intentionally embarrassed himself? For what reason? She looked back up at the young man, once again lost for words as she saw a smile on his face as opposed to the ashamed expression she was helping (although his face was steadily taking on the coloration of a tomato).<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh, I guess you could say\u2026it\u2019s kind of in my nature not to leave someone alone with a problem,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026that was the reason?\u201d Audrey got out, reflexively looking down at Banagher\u2019s stomach again. \u201cBut, why\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you? Do I need a reason?\u201d Banagher cocked his head to the side. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, sometimes actions speak louder than words. You were embarrassed, pretty understandable from a button pop, and I sort of realized just trying to comfort you with stock stuff like \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 and all that would probably just ring hollow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to admit, that was spot-on. That was exactly the route she had feared, and he was able to see it from a mile away, even coming up with a solution! For the life of her, Audrey was sure she wouldn\u2019t have been able to come up with the alternative Banagher had in only ten or so seconds! After this revelation was digested, Audrey couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, a massive weight feeling as though it was lifted off her shoulders. She looked at Banagher again, a mischevious look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you think you\u2019re pretty smart,\u201d she said, letting out another small chuckle. \u201cLike a knight in shining armor, dashing forward to save his friends from even the smallest of problems!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess. I mean, anyone who\u2019s in trouble deserves to get helped, right?\u201d Banagher gave his gut a small rub. \u201cAnd I just did it here the best way I knew how!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In spite of the increased speed of her eating, Audrey's manners were just as good, aside from some burping. Most people wouldn't be able to compete in an eating contest and still keep up their manners but Audrey was just that good. Though, the same couldn't be said for Banagher. Crumbs and sauce coated his mouth, as he was focusing on winning the contest. Audrey saw this and being the considerate girl she was, decided to help him tidy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some foodstuff on your face, Banagher.\" Audrey said, a wet napkin in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Banagher was soon muffled as his new friend wiped his face and with a napkin. She even wiped some crumbs off of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess pulled the cloth away from her new friend's face, a small smile tugging at her lips. Banagher stared at her for a couple seconds, seemingly off-guard from the sudden act, but was able to recover quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, thanks!\" Banagher said, grateful for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately went back to eating, realizing talking anymore would endanger their chances of winning. However, he gave a thumbs-up to her to give some extra confirmation of his thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey chuckled a bit, but gasped when she realized she was starting to lag behind. Looking over Banagher for a moment, she was amazed by just how fast the competition was plowing through the other hot dogs. She swore some of them just swallowed the food down without even bothering to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the blonde got herself as comfortable as she could to continue with her own display of gluttony. As she did so, she had to wonder: why had she been so forward there? Sure, she knew she couldn't stand it when someone was in the midst of a problem, but she tended to take subtler approaches with strangers. Sure, it wasn't exactly forward to any degree, but a blush rose to her face, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Banagher and Audrey would finish eating their hot dogs. Their large, orb shaped bellies nearly took up the entirety of their laps. The two leaned back into their chairs as they rubbed their engorged guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm \u2013UUURRRP- stuffed.\" Banagher moaned as he rubbed his tummy. He and Audrey were truly shocked by how large their stomachs had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Audrey uttered as she gently massaged her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winners are Banagher Links and Audrey Burne!\" The announcer bellowed out to the audience's cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words snapped them out of their daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-We\" Banagher stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won?\" Audrey and Banagher uttered in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winners! Winners!\" Haro congratulated as he bounced about in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher glanced over to the other tables to confirm that yes, they were the only ones who manged to finish eating. Big smiles soon appeared on their faces and they hi-fived each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the trophy?\" Banagher asked his blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, though standing up is going to be difficult with these big bellies.\" Audrey placed a hand on her stomach for emphasis. \"That's the real challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" Banagher looked down at his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of huffing and puffing they managed to stand up, their faces a bit red from the exhaustion. They then waddled over to claim their trophy, leaning on each other for support. The audience cheered once more as the winners held it together. Confetti rained around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel?\" Banagher asked his blonde friend, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really full, believe it or not.\" Audrey giggled. \"But also really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small while later, the two resumed their journey to the Vist Foundation mansion. Banagher told the organizers of the contest to deliver the trophy to his school dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Banagher and Audrey wanted to hurry to the mansion, their packed full tummies forced to waddle slowly as they leaned on each other for support, their guts jiggling and bouncing with every step. Haro was rolling alongside them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest was a fun yet exhausting experience. Really, they just wanted to sit down, tend to their aching stomachs, and enjoy a well-earned rest. Fortunately, they soon came across a bench, the perfect spot to rest. It even gave them a nice view of a fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we sit down for a bit?\" Banagher asked his blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then waddled over to the bench as fast as they stomachs would allow them. Letting out a sigh of relief as soon as they sat down, the two began tending to their swollen stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really fun but I don't think I'll ever \u2013UUURRRRP- excuse me. I don't think I'll ever be able to eat again.\u2026 uuuggh\u2026\" Audrey moaned as she gave her stomach a few rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me \u2013UUUURRRP- neither.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey sighed as she looked down at her big belly, placing a hand on the soft orb. She had just gotten dressed for the day and was now standing on a scale that read she was now 200 pounds. Truthfully, Audrey wasn't surprised by this, she knew that she been getting fat for a while now. It was the expected result of all the gorging she had been doing lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde walked off the scale and cringed as she saw her belly jiggle with every footfall, a blush appearing on her chubby face. She stopped in her tracks and looked down at her body once again. She was 200 pounds and had the body one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's belly was incredibly soft and jiggly. It was an almost completely spherical ball of fat, a far cry from the nearly flat board it used to be. The only feature that broke up its expanse were her newly-acquired love handles, which was hardly a comfort. Every step, every little movement she made would cause it to bounce and jiggle in perfect rhythm, which never ceased to bring a blush to the blonde\u2019s face. And worst of all, it was already starting to succumb to gravity. A noticeable dip was always there, stretching further and further down with every added pound, causing Audrey to never wear any shirts that weren\u2019t roomy or billowy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, there was one small plus to it, much to the blonde\u2019s secret enjoyment; Banagher liked using it as a makeshift pillow whenever he got really drowsy. Audrey sometimes liked to make a show of embarrassment when he asked her if he could sleep on it, but she never refused. It was actually surprisingly comfortable to have Banagher sleep on her. It helped to make him even cuter in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest was noticeably fuller now. Audrey's breasts were always a decent size but they were now big enough that they jutted out almost as much as her dome of a stomach. They hadn\u2019t started sagging, likely due to a mixture of good genetics and her young age, but they did take up a large percentage of her bras\u2019 real estate. The two melons practically oozed out of every piece of underwear she tried to get around them, especially between the straps. They too were quite a bit jigglier than they once were, but at least it was an area of the body where that was considered a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey\u2019s legs hadn\u2019t been spared, either. They chafed together whenever she walked, which only served as an excuse to do less of it nowadays. The areas below the knee were just as big as a thin person\u2019s upper areas. Some might say that, combined with her thunder thighs, she had a motherly figure of sorts. Granted, Audrey\u2019d never actually heard that, and if she did, it\u2019d probably just make her run out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was now a huge bubblebutt that jiggled with every step she made, almost as much as her gut, which was quite embarrassing. It jutted out three quarters of a foot behind her, which had led to many awkward moments trying to navigate her way around delicate furniture. The fact her butt filled up pretty much every normal chair she came across, to the point of making them all feel constricting, scared her. If she didn\u2019t get her weight under control, what might happen with doors?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Audrey's face. The princess' face was always a bit soft, which all the pounds she packed on made more prominent. Her cheeks had become quite cherubic and always showed dimples whenever she smiled. Audrey\u2019s chin was now double-tiered, which was especially noticeable any time she looked down. Usually, this would've made Audrey a bit hard to take seriously but her words and demeanor more then made up for it, whenever she wasn't being a gigantic dork, that is. This change actually suit the blonde's kind and gentle personality rather well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Audrey's weight had spread out mostly evenly. The reason she had gained so much weight was that she had taken a liking to the food served in Industrial 7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Laplace Conflict ended, Audrey moved in with Banagher at his school dorm, along with Micott and Takuya. Banagher and Audrey would often go out and eat together, like they did when they first met. Audrey was quite fond of the food being served, it didn't help that she had spent most of her life never tasting them as she wasn't privy to the type of things normal people enjoyed, stuff like hot dogs and pizza. So she tended to order more food then Banagher did and ended up losing herself in her gluttony. Needless to say, this resulted in her gaining quite a lot of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey both knew she was fat but neither of them knew what to actually say about it, so they avoid the subject entirely. That said, Audrey knew that she would eventually have to bring it up with Banagher,s he just had to figure out how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, the princess pushed those thoughts aside. \"Right now, I'm just going to focus on spending my day.\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her room and walked towards the start of the stairs leading down to the main floor. The chubby blonde walked down a few steps and noticed that none of her dormmates were downstairs. Since that was where they all went to eat breakfast, they were definitely still asleep in their rooms. Audrey really wasn't surprised by this, her friends really knew how to sleep in. Sometimes she wondered how they ever got up in time for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back up and headed to Banagher's room. She opened the door, the sound not even waking up Banagher, and sure enough, she saw the brunette sound asleep. Shaking her head, Audrey gave a little smile, she expected no less from her friend.</span></div></div>",

A blush appearing on her chubby face after belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're excused.\" Banagher said with a comforting smile as he tenderly rubbed his close friend's swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were walking back to their school dorm after a nice dinner date, Audrey's arm was wrapped around Banagher she was too full to walk without help. They both said it was just hanging out, as they're too shy to admit they're dating. Their idea of a dinner date wasn't exactly what one would call normal or traditional. Rather then go to a restaurant, they got a bunch of fast food like hot dogs, hamburgers, and french fires, and ate them at a bench in the park. Since the first thing they did when they met was get some hot dogs, eating fast food together had become a regular thing for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher would always get lots of food for Audrey. He had asked Takuya for advice on what to do when eating with girls, and informed him that this was not a date or anything like that. Takuya told him that girls like guys who pay for the whole thing (even if the girl doesn't mind paying for it herself) and are extra generous about it. And since Audrey really loves fast food and never complained about Banagher getting her so much tasty food she hadn't eaten for most of her life, it was the perfect recipe for Audrey to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's belly was a large orb of fat. It was incredibly soft and malleable, Audrey and Banagher loved to feel it in their hands, it was like feeling a pillow. The Zabi's belly was very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every step she made like it was made of pure jello, emphasizing how overweight the blonde had become. The princess's dome of a middle made a very nice pillow, Banagher had used it as one  few times. They'd both blush and stammer when he asked for permission but Audrey never said no. She found he looked even more adorable when he was fast asleep resting his head on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts nearly the size of cantaloupes, yet as plush as a bag of marshmallows. They made bras struggle to contain them, much to the blonde's annoyance, and sat atop her tummy, jutting out almost as much it. Her boobs could often be seen bouncing in sync with her middle, which never failed to bring a blush to Audrey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess had a huge butt. Like the rest of her, it was very jiggly, and while she couldn't see it jiggle, which she was grateful for, she could sure feel it. It made most normal sized chairs feel quite snug, only larger ones being able to comfortably contain it. She had once even broken a chair with her butt after eating too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were chubby and wide, to the point of always rubbing together when she walked. Which only served as an excuse to do less of it nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess' face was always a bit soft, which all the pounds she packed on made more prominent. Audrey's face had pretty much no angles now, being round and pie-like. Her cheeks had become quite cherubic and she now had a double chin. Banagher really loved how chubby Audrey's face was now, it made her visage even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were the normal symptoms that came after their now-customary large meals: some belches here, some groans there. At one point, Audrey became seriously worried that a button on her dress might pop off, forcing Banagher to (somewhat disingenuously) assure her everything would be fine. It\u2019d be one thing if something like that were to happen in private; the two had gotten used to her clothes malfunctioning from her ballooning weights. But Audrey was a princess at heart, and the thought of showing that sort of indecency in public would be one she\u2019d rather avoid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the walk to their dorm wasn't long, Audrey wasn't sure how much more jiggling her poor stomach could take. Banagher gently laid Audrey down on the couch and then took a spot next to her, her huge belly now bulging straight up into the air like a proud monument to her gluttony. The princess let out a giant burp. Banagher could hardly take his eyes off the blonde's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You want me to unbutton your clothes?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y -URP- Yes please.\" The first time these two did this, it made them blush the hardest they had in a while and it took them both some time to work up the courage for it. Banagher to suggest, and Audrey to tell him she was ready now. Even now long after this had become a common thing, they still got goosebumps when they did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gently undid the two lower buttons on Audrey's coat. As soon as he did, the Zabi's gut came bulging out, the princess letting out a sigh of relief. The pilot then undid the button and zipper on her pants, giving Banagher a sight of some of Audrey's pink underwear. Audrey sighed in relief again as her tummy bugled out even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot of the Unicorn Gundam then placed his hand on the princess' belly and started rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Thank -URAP- you, Banagher.\" Audrey said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Banagher said with a similar smile, giving his friend's belly a pat before continuing with rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows what I'd be doing -UURRAP- without you.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heir to Zeon always found herself looking forward to having her stomach rubbed after her dinner dates with Banagher. The brunette had a real talent with rubbing bellies, within a minute all the pains and aches inside Audrey's gurgling middle was replaced with a soothing warmth that made her feel like everything was not only going to be okay, but that everything was already okay. She could lay back and let all her worries about how the opening of Laplace's Box was affecting the world and the colonies just fade away for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh yeah, that's the stuff.\" Audrey moaned as Banagher hit a really sweet spot. She then let out a big burp of ecstasy, which was followed up by a cute moan. \"UUURRRAAP! Ahhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher chuckled. He wondered how Mineva would get along with Audrey. The thought made him reflect on a conversation Marida had with Audrey a week ago. Audrey was about as big then, maybe a few pounds lighter. Marida was worried about that and bluntly told Audrey she was fat and out of shape. The redhead wasn't trying to be mean, her upbringing just meant she wasn't the best at delicate topics like this. Audry eknew she meant well and wouldn't have minded had Marida not decided to bring this up while all four dorm mates and Marida were watching a movie together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need me to get you bigger clothes?\" Marida said at one point while she was professionally embarrassing Audrey. \"I can see your coat is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, PLEASE!\" Audrey said louder then she meant to. \"These are my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of that, you told me that when you invited me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was blushing beet red. Micott and Takuya couldn't help but giggle at how amazingly embarrassing Marida was being. Banagher felt immense guilt the whole time and was thankfully able to steer the conversation back to the movie. It felt less like steering a conversation away from an embarrassing topic, and more like steering a ship away from an iceberg it was seconds away from hitting. Movie night wasn't ruined by any means, but Banagher had found himself thinking more about Audrey's health since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher?\" Audrey snapped Banagher out of his thoughts. \"Is something wrong? You seemed distracted for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, nothing. I was just thinking about... you know, how much fun tonight was.\" Banagher said, nervously scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt like something was off but she decided to let it slide. If it was something serious, she knew Banagher would let her know. \"It really was. I'm a bit surprised you haven't gotten -UUURRP- fat yourself, Banagher.\" She joked. \"Seeing how you've had all this good food available your whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell you I used to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey burped in surprise. \"Huh? You were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a little laugh. \"Nah, I'm just messing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a small laugh of her own. \"Alright, you got me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher kept rubbing Audrey's tummy, he also did some belly play too. Doing things like patting and jiggling his blonde friend's tummy, which was a very pleasurable experience for both for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAP! Banagher, I know this sounds stupid, but your belly rubs are so amazing they feel like... like... UUUURRRP! Like the Psychoframe resonance the Uni -UUURRRP- corn made. Just like back then, whenever you're rubbing my belly I feel like like everything is going to be okay.\" Audrey with a goofy smile. \"Sorry, like I said, I know that was really stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound stupid at all. I feel the same way.\" Banagher assured with a warm smile, the smile of a perfect boyfriend. \"In fact, it sounds like we're putting our Newtype abilities to good use!\" He joked as he gave the princess's gut a few friendly pats before continuing to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled, Banagher was being too cute. \"Somehow being so dorky is part of your charm. UUUURRRRP!\" Audrey starts giving Banagher tons of food, Feeling it isn't fair that only she gets so much good food.</span></div></div>",

I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey Burne and Banagher Links reclined further back into their chairs, hands on their bloated bellies, completely stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Laplace Conflict ended, Banagher Links returned to Industrial 7 with Audrey Burne at his side. Banagher was finally a normal high school student again and now so was Audrey. As the princess of Zeon, Audrey received her education in the form of private tutors. While said education was excellent, Audrey always desired to be an ordinary girl, and now she finally became one by enrolling in a normal school, the same one Banagher went to. Banagher had helped her wish come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey now lived in the same dorm with Banagher, Micott, and Takuya. Living with four friends her own age was still a new and alien thing to her but Audrey was enjoying her new life immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher had just finished eating a massive and delicious dinner Marida had prepared for them and they were absolutely stuffed to the brim. The two were rubbing their large orb-shaped bellies, feeling like they would explode if they ate any more. Their bloated guts were pressing against the waistbands of their pants, straining the button on their pants nearly to the point of popping, as well as Banagher's belt and the buttons on Audrey's coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I'm glad you two enjoyed dinner so much.\" Marida said as she looked with joy at the results of Audrey and Banagher eating the dinner she cooked. The redhead had taken to cooking as a way to continue serving and caring for Audrey now that they were no longer involved in fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for dinner.\" Banagher said and then attempted to get up, but found that his overstuffed stomach was making that difficult. He grunted as he struggled for a few seconds to stand up but soon had to give up and sit back down. \"I think I'm stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help.\" Audrey said and then tried to get up, only to meet the same struggle Banagher did and soon sat back down. \"I should've seen that coming.\" She said, annoyed. She was dressed in the same clothes she wored when she first met Banagher, except her pink coat was replaced by her light blue school jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida helped them both. Audrey and Banagher then waddled over to the couch, where Haro was waiting for them. They cradled their bellies and sat down. They then undid their pants' button and zipper, Banagher also undid his belt and Audrey undid her coat, and sighed in relief as their bellies bugled out further, completely free. Their stuffed middles caused their tops to ride above their bellybuttons. Both were blushing at their bloated states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher started rubbing each other's bellies, feeling the pains and aches in them vanish, and a soothing warmth filling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both felt a rumbling deep in their guts. It started out as just a small thing at first, but then built up quickly. Before either of them knew it, a large expulsion of gas exited their mouths, filling the air with evidence of their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher simultaneously belted out a massive belch. They immediately started blushing. They were glad that Micott and Takuya weren't here to hear that one, being oat the movies and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us.\" Audrey said, covering her mouth in a gesture of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know we could burp like that, heh heh!\" Banagher chuckled, showing Audrey a dorky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's impressive in it's own way, but let's not improve our belching talents.\" Audrey said, her smile was a little smaller then Banagher's but just as dorky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to cook dinner again tomorrow?\" Marida asked as she walked over to the couch, eying her little siblings' stuffed bellies. She found it them to look rather with them, as it highlighted how much they enjoyed her food. She was very tempted to help them out and rub their bellies for them but she found them rubbing each other's middle to be too sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great. UUURRRP!\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like -URP- that. UURRP!\" Audrey said. \"Oh, I just remembered, we have some studying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we digest a little first?\" Banagher groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think we're going to be able to digest of all this tonight?\" Audrey gave her belly a little shake to drive her point home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Banagher conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Marida had to help them get up, and after that, they slowly lumbered up the stairs to Banagher's room as if they were drunk, their overfed stomachs bobbing and bouncing with every slow step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As described above, the One Year -UUUURRAP- War ended at the Battle of A Baoa Qu. After that, the Principality of Zeon transferred control over to the new republic and signed a peace treaty, and where is the lunar city where the peace treaty was signed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURP! Von Braun?\" Banagher lazily asked. He was laying flat on his back on his bed, his stomach sticking straight up into the air. Audrey was also on his bed but she was sitting in a far more dignified fashion, namely by having her legs crossed as she read the textbook they were studying from. Haro was sitting besides them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong.\" Audrey give Banagher's gut a big slap both to punish him and to get his attention, the slap made the orb jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Banagher groaned and then burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Granada.\" Audrey corrected him. \"You've been distracted this whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, I'm too stuffed.\" He placed a hand on his bubbling stomach and gave it a lazy rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked down at her belly and poked it, eliciting a gurgle in response. \"My stomach's been distracting me too.\" She paused to burp. \"Let's call it a night. Sorry for being so harsh.\" She then placed the textbook on the floor and laid down next to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You know, I heard belly rubs work even better at getting rid of stomach aches if you, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you what?\" Audrey was already dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you burp a lot?\" Banagher showed her a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey groaned. \"Well, time to do this, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Audrey and Banagher rubbed each other's big bellies with the goal of getting out as much gas as they could. It didn't take long for the belching to start, Audrey was visibly hesitant to let out her first one but she was able to belt it out with some encouragement form Banagher. Their belches were loud, some even loud enough to send vibrations through the air. As odd of a way as it way to deal with a stomachache, it was working, the, their stomachs were feeling much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRP!\" Audrey belted out one of the loudest belches of her life, it was so big it surmised Audrey herself, Banagher, AND Haro. Blushing beat red, the princess slapped a hand over her mouth in shock. She slowly lowered it once the shock had worn off. \"That was... huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Banagher showed her a little smile and then breathe din deeply. Before Aurey could ask him what he was doing, he belted out a deep belch just as massive as her own. \"URRRRRRRRP!\" He followed his belch up with a goofy smile. \"There, now you're not the only one letting out huge belches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Audrey a bit to process why he intentionally embarrassed himself, but when she did, she started giggling, giggling Banagher soon joined her in. Their giggling turned into laughter, and that turned into big, bellyful laughing fits from both of them for the next minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Banagher\" Audrey said, still not entirely done laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Yours was pretty good too!\" Banagher gave her a friendly punch tot he shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later saw them in a similar scenario, laying down together on Banagher's bed, stuffed to the brim from Marida's cooking, and rubbing each other's belly in soothing circles as belches flew out of their mouths. Except this time they were a lot bigger, Audrey at 203 pounds and Banagher at 206 pounds, making them truly obese.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a mansion in Industrial 7, two chubby women were completely stuffed and sporting bellies packed tight enough to prove it. They both completely filled up the laps of the two women (and then some) as they leaned back in their couch in a satisfied manner. Their pants and tops were completly unable to contain their massive tummies, leaving them bulging out and exposed to the world. The two women displayed their satisfaction by belching loudly at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us.\" The younger one, Audrey Burne, held a hand up her mouth but one could still see a smirk on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're excused, belching loudly after a meal was a compliment in France, after all.\" The older one, Haman Karn, stated, it was a little fun fact Audrey had told her. She punctuated that fact with a slap to her jiggly middle, eliciting another burp out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing here and enjoying each other's company without caring about how \"undignified\" it was, tons of now empty plates and bags of junk food covering their coffee table, as the two watched TV, things had certainly changed for Audrey and Haman. They had certainly changed, both inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was a round girl, with a round belly. It was a large ball of adipose that was as soft as a pillow, and just as malleable. Audrey herself liked playing with it, though she would start blushing if anyone besides Banagher, Haman, or Marida saw her doing that, and would probably run out of the room. Her belly would press against the hem of her pants when even when she wasn't full, and would often pop the button right off it when she was stuffed. Audrey's tummy was just as jiggly as it was soft, which is to say it was very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every step she made. This would especially notable when she was in the Unicorn with Banagher. She plentiful love handles and rolls on the sides of her gut, deep enough to fit small objects in those dark folds of flesh. Her bellybutton ran deep, able to fit one of Audrey's fingers without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the weight Audrey gained had caused her chest to blossom to the point that they were straining her bra. They were as soft as marshmallows and almost as large as cantaloupes. Her boobs had to use her tummy as a makeshift shelf, pooling over it. Her breasts would bounce with her fat middle, something that never failed to bring a blush to the blonde's chubby face, especially if Banagher was there to see it. It wasn't uncommon to see Haman pinching one of Banagher's ears to punish him for looking, Audrey would always have to tell Haman to stop and that Banagher couldn't help looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt was much bigger now. It had more then doubled in size, and jiggled almost as much as her gut and boobs. Her ass was big enough that it pressed against her outdated pants, and it made the assistance chair she used in the Unicorn a tight squeeze. In fact, it would fill up pretty much any normal sized chair she sat down on. The creaking she would hear when she sat down on it, made her embarrassed and worried she would break the chair. Her legs were very chunky and thick, jostling with every step and always rubbing together with no separation when she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face had softened from the weight she gained, giving her a more warm and inviting appearance. Her cheeks were round and soft, very nice to pinch and cup in your hands. They went well with her double chin in showing that Audrey was a sweet girl who loves food. Her smiles had become far more common lately, and how chubby her face was made them even more heartwarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaman's belly was very big, soft, and very jiggly. Audrey had even played with it on occasion, seeing her happy to do so put a smile on Haman's pudgy face. Seeing Haman's big belly bob and bounce with every step normally made her look much less intimidating. Her navel was incredibly deep, it created an indent on her black top. Yet despite these cuddly features, the pilot was still somehow able to make it look intimidating when she felt the need to. To see this obese women tower over you, her stomach seeming like a wrecking ball, as she glared daggers at whoever had earned her wrath was something else. Were Audrey not there to protest, she would've belly bumped quite a few people (including Banagher) for supposedly disrespecting the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts hadn't grown as much as Audrey's but they had still seen some growth. They now pressed against her bra and formally baggy top, something Haman took some secret pride in. Speaking of tops, because of how bigger her tits were, Haman now had to lower the zipper of the top part of her regal Neo-Zeon wear even further down to her chest would feel comfortable, exposing her cleaege and the sides of her boobs. It felt weird to Haman to now have a smaller chest compared to the much younger Audrey, but she supposed it was just another sign that Audrey was growing up. And out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Haman truly had Audrey beat was in her ass. Each cheek was massive, the size of bowling balls, and incredibly soft. With the way it strained her out-of-date pants, Haman's behind had truly earned the title of bubblebutt. While Audrey's ass \"merely\" filled up normal-sized chair, Haman's would fill it up and then some, her fat spilling off the sides. The chair in the cockpit of the Quebely was no exception, the discomfort from how tight a squeeze it was was a big distraction. This wasn't even getting into the chairs her massive butt had destroyed. Her legs were very meaty and wide, which didn't help with the situation with the Quebely's chair. They always pressed together, and jostled and wobbled every time Haman made a step. Because her chunky legs rubbed together, her walk now had a bit of a waddle to it. Her humongous ass and wide legs once led Banagher to comment once that Haman had a very motherly figure. Don't worry, he only said that to Audrey when Haman was out, he knew better then to say that when Haman had even a slight possibility of hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaman's face was much rounder and soft now. With friendly, chubby cheeks, complete with a double chin. While one would initially think it made Haman look less tough, that line of thinking would be instantly vaporized by the truly intimidating glares she would show, especially when Audrey was concerned. Still, when Haman showed her softer (no pun intended) side around Audrey, Marida, and (sometimes) Banagher, her chubby face made her look like a very nice person to cuddle with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Audrey got older, her relationship with Haman as her guardian got more complicated. While there was never any bad blood between them, the Zabi's growing disgust toward Zeon as a whole made it harder for her to look at Haman the same way she used to. For her part, Haman tried to view it as just Audrey going through that rebellious teenager thing she had heard about, though ten years old was a really early time to go through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaman had chosen to leave politics and be with Audrey after the First Neo-Zeon War ended in her side's defeat, at first she choose not to join either of the two Neo-Zeon groups that followed it, despite supporting the beliefs behind them, but when Audrey went against Haman's wishes and became involved in the Laplace Conflict, Haman felt like she had been forced to join the Sleeves to save Audrey from her own \"foolishness\". Ironically, Haman ended up being saved by Audrey, Marida, and Banagher, though she would NEVER admit that the boy had helped convince her to stand with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Laplace Conflict having come to an end, Audrey choose to go Industrial 7 with Banagher, now living in a mansion with Haman. Now finally an ordinary girl with an ordinary life, Audrey, at Banagher's suggestion, relaxed and enjoyed herself with Haman. The princess had discovered that she loved normal food, and since she was enjoying herself, she found herself pigging out almost every day, with Haman eating just as much besides her. It didn't help her waistline how much Haman was spoiling her, constantly cooking massive meals for her and practically showering her with with fast food and junk food. She would always give Audrey a relaxing belly rub when the princess had finished eating and was left bloated and burping up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be unreasonable to say that Haman was the main reason Audrey got fat, as the Zabi couldn't bring herself to turn down anything her guardian brought her. Haman wasn't worried about how much Audrey was ballooning up, she viewed a big belly as just a sign that the princess was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt a gurgle in her belly, along with a sharp pain in her chest. \"Oooh,\" Audrey moaned, giving her belly a bit of a rub. \"I don't think my stomach is agreeing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I give you a belly rub, Minev-Uh, Audrey?\" Haman asked, her voice a little more husky from the weight her neck had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, -UUUURP- please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a mother would, Haman placed her hands on the giant orb that was Audrey belly and started rhythmically moving her hands on it's blubbery surface. As she felt her aching in her middle be replaced with this soothing warmth that felt similar to the light from a Psyco-Frame, Audrey began letting out many belches. Some of them were loud enough to send vibrations through the air, some of them actually impressed Haman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my massage skills as good as -UUUURRP- as Banagher's?\" Haman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to burp before she could answer \"UUURAAAP! It's not a contest, Haman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is to me.\" She childishly pouted, Audrey kinda wished Haman was wearing her regal wear, it would've made the sight of a former dictator acting like a child even funnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey playfully rolled her eyes and then looked at Haman's belly. Like Audrey's own, it was swollen, bare, and in need of a good rub. \"Do you want me to rub your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that, my stomach doesn't hurt.\" Like it wanted to protest that statement, Haman's belly gurgled loudly. \"UUUURRRP! okay, it does hurt but I can handle -URAP- it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to act tough around me. \"Audrey giggled as she reached out and placed a hand on her guardian's giant gut and started rubbing it, leading to a sigh of pleasure from Haman. \"Thanks. UUUUUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to stop moving as each women massaged the other's tummy. Both of them let out many belches, Audrey's were longer while Haman's were deeper. Haman would feel a sense of pride whenever Audrey complimented her on her belching skills. While Haman stuck to mostly rubbing, Audrey did some playing. She did things like patting, slapping, poking, and jiggling Haman's gut, sometimes forcing another burp out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you guys started eating without me again.\" Banagher said as he walked into the room, surprising his two friends who had forgotten sometime in the middle of their binging that they invited him over.</span></div></div>",

It was so nice to just sit down and enjoy themselves after fighting for so long. Marida and Audrey had moved to Industrial 7 after the Laplace Conflict ended, Audrey also enrolled at Banagher's school and was dorming with him. Banagher, along with Micott and Takuya, introduced them to their new lives. The Gundam pilot also introduced them to things he and his friends enjoyed, like video games, which Audrey proved to be surprisingly fond of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Banagher and Marida were happily chatting about a variety of things as they enjoyed ice cream. Before long, they both finished their first bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious.\" Marida happily said she cleaned her mouth with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was good.\" Banagher said, giving his stomach a few pats. \"I think I'll have another bowl. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that.\" Marida answered. \"But I'm a little worried about the calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with treating yourself.\" Banagher assured, smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Marida said, smiling. \"Now, what flavor are you going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher continued to happily chat as they enjoyed their third bowls of ice cream. It didn't take Marida long to finish hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure love ice cream, don't ya?\" Banagher noted in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how I couldn't.\" Marida replied. \"I'm going to have another bowl. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just gotta finish my bowl first.\" Banagher answered. \"Man, we should enter an eating contest. I mean, we're already eating a lot of ice cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'An eating contest?' What's that?\" Marida asked. The redhead had spent most of her life as a soldier for Neo-Zeon, as such, she knew little about things a normal person would enjoy doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?\" Banagher asked, surprised. \"Well, it's where you get a bunch of food and see who can eat the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of fun.\" Marida said. \"When does this contest start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking when I said we should enter one.\" Banagher didn't expect Marida to show such enthusiasm for the idea. \"But we could have one right now, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great.\" Marida said, smiling as Banagher finished his bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get started!\" Banagher enthusiastically said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pilots then got their fourth bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, they really give you a lot here, huh?\u201d Banagher said, bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would think we\u2019ve earned it! After all we\u2019ve been through, we deserve to be spoiled a bit,\u201d Mardia declared confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" the brunette said, chuckling. \"I'm just glad I can spend it with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's air of confidence immediately dissipated as a confused blush came over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Banagher, w-what do you mean?\" she stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we used to be enemies, and that meant that at any time, you or I could've killed each other. The fights just got so intense at times...I really did think I'd have to kill you during a few of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead felt her heart drop down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to bring up an old memory like that,\" Banagher looked down bashfully. \"But I just wanted to say that w're lucky that we could be together, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida stared at Banagher's face a moment. The young man had one that screamed hardship and responsibility, having gone through far too much for his age. Then again, she supposed she had seen her own fair share of tragedies that went above and beyond most other people she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she sat there, she realized that Banagher was perfectly right. There was a time when she did take him captive and viewed him as an obstacle to \"save\" Audrey. Marida was ashamed of that, to say the least, and she also realized just how fortunate she was that her friend was a forgiving soul. If he wasn't...well, she didn't know how she'd handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Banagher,\" she said with a smile. \"I'm honored to know you think that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! You're making me blush!\" Banagher gave another small chuckle. \"Anyways, I think we should get back to that ice cream now, right?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two pilots devoured their ice cream as quickly as they could, enjoying it's wonderful taste. Despite how much they were eating, they still enjoyed chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you and Audrey ever done this?\" Marida asked before taking a large bite of her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, this is the first time I've ever done an eating contest. So we're both doing something new.\" Banagher said, after licking some bits of ice cream off his lips. \"Maybe I should have an eating contest with Audrey, that'd be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow, I can see her enjoying that.\" Marida replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette and redhead soon finished their fourth bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" They proclaimed at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher both unleashed a massive belch, easing the pressure in their guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Marida uttered, her face red. \"I'm sorry, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize, I'm not exactly being too polite myself.\" Banagher comforted, grinning sheepishly. \"How about we just forget about this sorta stuff and enjoy ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida thought it over for a few brief seconds before giving her answer. \"I'm not sure if I can, but I'll try.\" A small smile graced her face and Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots grabbed another bowl and continued eating. As they continued their feast, Marida's and Banagher's bellies grew ever larger with each bowl of ice cream they ate. However, they were having too much fun talking and eating to notice. Until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2013Ping!-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA popping sound caught their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear \u2013URP- something?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" Marida said, stifling a burp. Oddly, her stomach felt more comfortable. The gluttonous redhead looked towards the source of the sound and was shocked by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Marida exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida saw that her gut was very bloated and large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what the hell?!\u201d Marida stuttered out. \u201cMy stomach, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead gave it a poke, and while her finger was stopped immediately due to it just being a bloated instead of flabby belly, it honestly scared the pilot. She honestly couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. How could her flat, toned belly have gotten so large? She looked up at Banagher, a helplessness in her eyes that was rare to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBanagher what should I do?!\u201d she cried, desperate for an answer. \u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked down at his own stomach, and realized the same thing applied to him. His stomach was pressing against his button and belt with all its might, as if it was trying to break free of his constricting pants. The brunette really didn\u2019t know what to say about this, but knew he needed to placate his friend at least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette took a deep breath to prep himself for the talk, but another *ping* sound resounded through the restaurant. Looking down, he realized that his own button had popped off, and his belt seemed to have broken. A blush crept up to his cheeks; that was a bit embarrassing, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, well, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d he said lamely, still looking at his own engorged gut. \u201cI guess we\u2019ve kinda overdone it, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s obvious,\u201d Marida said, getting a little calmer at seeing she wasn\u2019t the only one in this predicament. \u201cGetting involved in an eating contest wasn\u2019t exactly one of our brighter ideas, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to have a bit of fun, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course, but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d end up like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was quiet for a moment, seeming to ponder something over in his head as he rested his chin on his hand, ignoring the gurgling emanating from his gut. He looked up at his friend with a keen gaze. \u201cSo, wanna call it quits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida placed a finger on her own chin. Did she really want to? Looking down at her belly, it was obvious she pigged out far more here than she\u2019d ever been used to before. She was also starting to feel some stomach pains begin to set in, her body trying its damndest to digest as much of the ice cream shoveled into it as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the redhead remembered: this was quality time she was spending with Banagher. A very unorthodox way to do it, to say the least, but still a method nonetheless. Marida wondered, if she gave up now, would that be forfeighting part of her desire to become closer to this person? Even though she wasn\u2019t too cruel to him while they were enemies, she still felt a bit guilty for some of the stuff she did. Was she willing to waste any potential bonding she could get with the brunette, even if it involved overeating like this? After some reflection, the answer was obvious: no. Certainly, she\u2019d overeaten, but so what? This definitely wasn\u2019t going to become a habit, she could just work all the calories off, and the redhead just wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea of quitting such an activity this early on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she\u2019d indulge a bit more in this new experience, Marida looked back up at her friend, a clear determination in her eyes. \u201cHeh, better get back to eating that ice cream, it\u2019s starting to melt.\u201d Marida undid the sash around her waist so that it wouldn't meet the same fate as Banagher's belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher quirked his eyes, a bemused expression falling over his face. \u201cSo, you\u2019re still going to truck on, even with how bloated we are?\u201d The brunette placed a hand on his somewhat-exposed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow else am I supposed to better myself if not through overcoming obstacles? And really, compared to the average Mobile Suit pilot, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m exactly fearing for my life here,\u201d the redhead said with a smirk. \u201cSo then, get ready, Banagher! I want you to show me everything you\u2019ve got! Unless, of course, you\u2019re scared~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not! I\u2019ll take you on, easy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! That\u2019s exactly what I like to hear from you! You never fail to impress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends then resumed their contest, filling their bellies with more and more ice cream. While they would normally be embarrassed about their bloated guts, they were having way too much fun to care. There was just something so fun about completely stuffing themselves whilst happily chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's and Banagher's guts swelled even bigger as they filled themselves up with ice cream, patches of ice cream would appear on their face and occasionally, even land on their clothes. It certainly wasn\u2019t the most refined way of eating, but neither friend cared. Right now, their minds were revolving around the ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir rapid pace threatened to bring on brain freezes, and a couple times, one would stop while the other kept going when it felt they were about to surpass that limit, but they still persevered. The tastes were enough to overpower the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, Banagher and Marida had just finished their fourteenth bowl and they both felt like they would explode. Their stomachs had become incredibly large and round, they forced their shirts quite a bit, completely exposing the orbs of fat. Marida and Banagher leaned back in their chairs, rubbing their stomachs as belches and groans escaped their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... UUURRRP! Stuffed...\" Banagher groaned as he rubbed his tummy, hoping to ease the pain. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could eat another bite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Marida said, rubbing her aching stomach. \u201cThat was the most ice cream I\u2019ve ever eaten in my entire life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Banagher drummed his fingers against his own stomach, seeming to contemplate things in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019d you say to having another?\u201d he asked out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Banagher, you want to eat more?\u201d Marida asked, not doing a very good job of hiding her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, kinda. I just realized we ended this off with just eating 12 bowls\u2026but don\u2019t you think an extra one would be a lot better? I mean, we\u2019ve tied now, so a tie breaker wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Marida clucked her tongue, thinking it over. It did make sense. \u201cAlright, one more, but that\u2019s it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting their last bowl, Marida and Banagher took a moment to say something before digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready, Marida?\u201d Banagher asked confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Within the next minute, all of this ice cream will find a new home right in here!\u201d she proclaimed, resting a hand on her stuffed belly. \u201cJust you watch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher then dug into their bowls, shoveling ice cream into their mouths as fast as they could. In spite of how incredibly full they were, the two gluttonous pilots enjoyed their contest (and the ice cream) immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" They proclaimed at the same time, they then dropped their spoons which landed with a *clink*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher let out an incredibly large belch as they leaned back in their chairs, rubbing their swollen tummies, feeling how hard and full they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great. UURRRP!\" Marida moaned, letting out a powerful burp as she rubbed her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You \u2013UUURRRP-! You said it!\" Banagher said with a smile as he gave his overfed stomach a few pats. \"Man, Marida, you were awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As were you, Bana \u2013UUUURRRP- Banagher.\" Marida said, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!' The brunette replied. He then looked down at his bloated stomach. \"I've gotta say, I'm pretty impressed with how big our stomachs are.\" He said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are pretty big.\" Marida said with a chuckle as she idly drummed her big belly. She was impressed herself. \"Guess we'll have to roll ourselves home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two overstuffed pilots laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing we're mobile suit pilots, we could roll ourselves home no problem!\" Banagher then gave his gut a good slap for emphasis, causing him to belt out a giant burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that we're putting our skills as the pilot of the Ksha -UUURRRAAAP- Kshatriya and the Unicorn -URRAP!- Gundam to good use.\" Marida joked with a chuckle, placing a hand on her belly in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure are. Hey, since the Unicorn has a Full \u2013UUURRAAAP- Armor Mode, maybe we should call this our -URAP!- Full Belly Mode?\" Banagher joked, giving his gut a soothing rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Marida laughed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would certainly be an appropriate name, ha ha!\" The redhead uttered, happily patting her belly. A burp soon escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could even give the Unicorn and Kshatriya a Full Belly Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Marida then burst into laughter, the image of the Kshatriya and the Unicorn, a beautiful mobile suit and symbol of hope that brought peace to the Universal Century, with a big belly to match their pilots' was hilarious to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette and redhead spent a while more happily talking before deciding that it was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to leave?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though standing up is going to be difficult.\" Marida noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the count of three, we'll try to stand up, ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Marida said with the amount of seriousness she would display during a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher attempted to stand up, the large amounts of ice cream in their guts weighing them down. After a few seconds of grunting and what felt like exercise, Marida and Banagher managed to stand up. They took a moment to catch their breath, their faces red with exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just *huff* realized that we're going to have to pay *huff* for all that ice cream.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I can help *huff* you *huff* pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began to walk over to the cashier to pay. However, because she was not used to new weight in her tummy, she lost her balance and fell. Banagher managed to catch her before she hit the ground, though he didn't mean to do so by grabbing her gut. There was a few seconds of awkward silence as Banagher helped Marida get back on her feet, they leaned on each other for support. The stuffed pilots both sported blushes on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about her that, Marida.\" Banagher apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to apologize, Banagher.\" Marida assured. \"Thank you for catching me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated pilots then waddled over to pay for their feast. They only managed to pay by emptying both of their wallets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really ate a lot.\" The cashier said as he put the (rather large) amount of cash into the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really -URP!- don't know how we even did it.\" Banagher replied, giving his belly a bit of a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida held a hand over her mouth, her eyes wincing in pain, she was certain that she about to throw up. Fortunately, it just turned out to be a bit of gas rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there's an eating contest coming up in a little while.\" The cashier stated. \"The first place prize more then makes up for how much you just paid. You should enter, I'm positive you two would win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer sounded good to the bloated friends, it would make up for the money they just spent and it would be pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling us.\" Banagher then released another burp. \"You alright, Marida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-Yes, I'm fine. I'm ready to leave if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida and Banagher waddled home, rubbing their big tummies and unleashing powerful belches. Their bellies were touching, which actually felt nice to them for reasons they couldn't explain. Their guts jiggled and wobbled with every step the overfed duo made. Banagher and Marida decided to bring up some small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna play some video games once we digest?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida belched before giving her answer. \"Sure, that'd be nice. I've been interested in seeing more of the one that's about those -URRRAAAP!-  students trapped in a high school What was it called again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's -UUURRRAAAP- Dangan Ronpa!\" Banagher enthusiastically stated. \"That's one of my favorites, you won't be disappointed. Do you have any favorite characters yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida thought about it for a bit before giving her answer. \"Hmm, we haven't gotten too far into it yet but Toko seems interesting. And Hifumi seems entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like them a lot too. I'm not sure who I would I pick as my absolute favorite is because their all great, but I think I would go with either Kyoko, Makoto, or Byakuya. Oh! That reminds me, who do you want to spend the next Free Time Event with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher capped off his sentence with an incredibly loud belch. Marida let out a friendly giggle, Banagher was such an adorable dork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to geek out for a while more as they waddled home. Eventually Marida's gut let out a loud grumble. The redhead moaned as she placed one hand on her stomach and burped softly into her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Banagher asked, concern obvious in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah. My stomach just hurts a little. Oof.\" Marida answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher remembered hearing that rubbing someone's belly was a good way to ease a stomachache. Seeing Marida in pain, the brunette knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, think I might know way to help your stomach feel better.\" Banagher nervously said, his cheeks red. Asking someone for permission to rub their belly was pretty awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, umm, I was thinking that I could rub your stomach for you.\" Banagher's blush only intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Marida's face grew just as red as Banagher's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I heard that h-having someone else rub your stomach feels better then r-rubbing it yourself.\" Banagher stated, growing more and more embarrassed by the second. \"I think it h-helps y-you digest q-quicker and helps get t-the gas out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Banagher. Go ahead.\" Marida answered, a comforting smile on her blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-You're alright with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. You're my friend, Banagher.\" The redhead then grabbed Banagher's hand and brought it over to her bare stomach. \"Start whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher nodded and after a few seconds of hesitation began tenderly rubbing Marida's belly. Marida moaned as she felt Banagher's hand make circling movement on her big belly, causing all her discomforts to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That feels really \u2013UUURRRP- really good, Banagher.\" Marida moaned, smiling as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm glad you're felling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher's continued to give Marida's stomach a soothing massage, Marida noticed that the Gundam pilot's own gut could use a rub. She reached a hand over and began rubbing his big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a moan as he felt the pain in his tummy go away and as a warm feeling overcame him.  \"That feels amazing, Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it does, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to rub each other's bellies, letting out mighty belches all the while. Eventually, they manged to reach Banagher's dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Banagher said in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally we can rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then waddled inside, leaning on each other for support, and planted their asses on the couch. They both sighed in relief.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May 4th, UC 0096<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Laplace Conflict had come to an end. With the ghost of Char having been vanquished and the contents of Laplace's Box shown to the world, turning the century long curse of the Universal Century into a prayer, the future was brighter then it had ever been before, bright with infinite possibilities. Although it would take time for things to fully change for the better, there was no need for impatience. Just having the possibility was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready change had shown itself for the people for helped bring to light those possibilities. For Marida Cruz, that change was that after a life time of fighting, she could finally rest as normal person with the new family she had found and truly enjoy life with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune 6th, UC0096<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida sighed as she looked down at her body. She was standing in her room as she examined her body, on her face was a look that was mixture of cringe, disgust, and embarrassment. In just a little over one month she had already eaten herself into obesity. It was shocking to everyone that the once fit redhead had let herself go, including herself. All that ice cream, fast food, and relaxing had quite the effect on her figure. All her toned muscles were completely gone, replaced with soft fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce completely flat and toned, Marida's stomach had ballooned into a giant orb of adipose. So massive that it went beyond the hem of her pants, her sash barley able to contain it. It didn't have any front rolls that turned it into a double belly, instead it was a large and almost perfectly round mass. Marida's belly was very soft, pretty much as soft as a pillow, making it a very nice plaything. Marida would even let Audrey and Banagher use her huge belly as a pillow, though with no small amount of embarrassment, even if it did feel nice. The jiggly ball had deep love handles on the sides of it, which would get even deeper if she bent over to the side. The redhead's belly would jiggle and bounce with every step she made, and the laws of gravity caused it to hang down. Her bellybutton was very deep, able to fit a whole finger without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest was much bigger now, each boob being so filled with fat that they were straining her bra to it's very limits. Marida's cleavage was just as perky as ever thanks to her youth and jutted out from her chest almost as much as her belly did from her middle. Speaking of her tummy, her breasts now rested on it because of it's large size and bounced in sync with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce relatively small and toned, Marida's butt was now big and blubbery, with zero trace of muscles. Each cheek was a large orb of soft flab, they would jiggle and wobbled with every step the poor women made, especially when she ran, reminding her of how fat and out of shape she had gotten. Marida's prodigious behind strained her out of date pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormally toned and perfectly suited to a soldier, the Kshatriya's pilot's arms and legs had lost all trace of visible muscles. Marida's limbs were now soft and flabby, making them a lot weaker. Her arms were wider and softer, and her legs were flabby and chubby, pressing together whenever she walked. All the flab and loss of muscles made her arms and legs much weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida's was much fuller now. She had soft, chubby cheeks that went along well with her double chin. Most people with such a chubby face would find it impossible to intimidate anyone, only succeeding at looking cute, but Marida's soul piercing glare was just as effective as it had been when she was slim, though she rarely ever used it these days. When she was relaxed and spending time with Banagher and Audrey, she certainly looked like quite the nice person to cuddle with, especially whenever she smiled, which she was doing a lot more often these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful of her creamy belly fat, feeling how incredibly malleable it was, Marida looked down at the massive orb in disapproval, noting that she can't even see her feet anymore. \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at how out of shape I've gotten.\" The redhead thought. \"After all, I've been completely gorging for an entire month.\" Memories of all the signing she had been doing filled Marida's mind in the order they occurred, like a montage. At first it was just enjoying herself at Audrey and Banagher's insistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRAP!\" Marida belched loudly, hands on her swollen tummy, a huge blush on her face. \"Goodness, excuse me! I didn't even know it was possible to belch that loudly. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, that was a good one.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher is just being a boy, but that is a pretty fitting way to announce you completed the challenge.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were at an ice cream parlor, it was the first time Marida had ever overeaten. As promised, Banagher took Marida to his favorite ice cream parlor at his hometown, he also invited Audrey. The brunette and the blonde both knew Marida has a real sweet tooth for ice cream, but they were still blown away by how she had eaten three large bowls of ice cream like that was just a small snack. Impressed, this gave Banagher the idea of suggesting she take a little challenge the parlor was holding. The challenge was to eat seven extra large bowls of ice cream in one sitting, the reward being a model in the shape of a filled ice cream bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Audrey finding the contest to be idiotic, it only took some further encouraging from Banagher to get Marida to do it, plus she viewed it as a way to impress her younger siblings. The redhead managed to complete the challenge. She was bloated and stuffed to the brim, her belly a large orb that filled up her lap, she had to undo her sash as well as the button and zipper on her pants halfway through the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said this challenge was idiotic, but I must admit, it is impressive you ate all that.\" Audrey complimented, eyeing her friend's large stomach. \"Just look at the size of your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Marida then burped loudly into her fist. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna give it a try, Audrey?\" Banagher suggested with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass. You can go eat yourself sick on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two would later have to help Marida stand up wobble back home with them. When the trip got home, Banagher and Audrey gave Marida rhythmic belly rubs, the redhead letting out mighty belches all the while, which went well with the massages in easing her full tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, she found herself eating more and more, her once strict diet and exercise regime completely escaping her mind, as her body grew softer and softer. And now here she was, obese at 216 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've gotta start the day no matter how fat I am. I need to put all this aside for now.\" Marida thought, she let go of her belly and zipped her shirt. She walked out of her room, her belly jiggling with every step.</span></div></div>",

It was so comfy, a whole lot better than the desks she\u2019d have to sit in all day during school. However, there was a major silver lining, and she was lucky enough to be in the same dorm as him. Honestly, the brunette young man was a major motivation for her going to school, and she was eager to greet him now as he was going to wake up in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it was a little early, and that Banagher and Takuya wouldn\u2019t be up quite yet, Micott got dressed and left her room. As she was about to descend the stairs, she saw that neither Banagher or Takuya were in the living room. Obviously, she was the only bird walking around this morning, exactly as she expected. Those two could sleep like logs sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott had been dorming with Banagher and Takuya for over a year. They had known each other since they were kids and have been best friends ever since. The three of them had always gotten along well, Micott even had a crush on Banagher. She wouldn't admit it, but she always found the brunette cute. It was his shy and gentle nature, along with how much of a dork he was, that made him completely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott entered Banagher's room to wake him up. She couldn't help but take a moment to look at him as he slept, he looked even cuter then he usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was easily the biggest part of the brunette's well-fed body. The sphere of adipose was incredibly soft, making it almost feel like a beanbag chair. This made it a very nice thing to feel and rub. Banagher's belly was also incredibly jiggly, to the point that it would bob and bounce with nearly every step he took. It was quite a sight to see it jiggle wildly whenever he ran. The brunette's big gut helped to give him a very huggable appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had a noticeable pair of moobs. They were plush orbs of fat that sat atop his tummy. They were quite jiggly and soft, which actually made feeling them enjoyable. The flabby sacks of fat were so big that it almost looked like Banagher could use a bra. Micott, Takuya, and even Banagher himself all jokingly refereed to his chest as his boobs. In fact, Banagher was the one who had come up with the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette had a pretty big ass. His cheeks were completely lacking in tone, they were two huge spheres that were very soft and malleable and they jiggled and wobbled with nearly every step he made. His butt was big enough that it would leave an imprint on the dorm's couch when he sat down on it. Banagher's ass had well-earned the right to be called a bubble butt. It was complimented by a pair of chunky legs that rubbed together when he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had an absolutely adorable face. He had a double chin and a pair of very chubby cheeks that were soft and round, lacking pretty much any angles to them. Dimples would even show up whenever he smiled, which made his smiles and grins even more sweet and cute. Banagher's soft and pie-like face truly went along perfectly with his kind personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott couldn't get over how cute Banagher looked as he slept, all tucked in his bed with Haro by him. But today was school so she had to wake him up.</span></div></div>",

But one thing that caught her interest was Banagher's computer. The sight reminded her that she forgot to look up something last night. And it made her a little innocently curious as to what Banagher was looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette walked up to the computer and clicked the mouse to wake it up. Unsurprisingly, what came up was a website for some video game Banagher was looking forward to. Micott moved her cursor over to the new tab button when she noticed that one of the unopened tabs was titled \"BBW Sakura\", of course she knew that Sakura was a name but she had no idea what \"BBW\" meant. Curious, she clicked on the tap and what showed up surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fan art of a character from an anime she, Banagher, and Takuya watched, except she was obese, a huge contrast to the slim body she had in the show. Micott was confused, it wasn't drawn in a way that portrayed the character's weight negativity. In fact, it portrayed her obesity a sexy. Micott was well-aware that some people were attracted to fat girls but did this mean that Banagher was one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott clicked back to the previous tab, deciding to ignore it. She walked over to Banagher and gave him a little shake on his shoulder to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Banagher, it's time to get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's eyes opened and he slowly got up. The fat brunette yawned and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Micott.\" He said, still a bit sleepy. \"Morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. Ready to get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just give me a sec to get dressed.\" He then noticed that his computer's monitor was on. \"Did you use my computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" Micott answered. \"I wnated to look something up. You don't mind, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyways, I'll see you downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a sec. Don't worry, I won't go back to sleep.\" Banagher playfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Micott teased with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleepyhead! Sleepyhead!\" Haro added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott then left Banagher's room so he could get dressed. Her mind went back to the picture she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could Banagher really be into fat chicks?\" She thought to herself. \"If he is then maybe I need to put on a few pounds myself. I could definitely make being fat work. Wait, what am I thinking? We're just friends. I just need some breakfast, that's all.\"</span></div></div>",

The century long curse of the Universal Century was now a prayer, as it was when the people of the old world started the Universal Century. The future was brighter then ever, bright with infinite possibilities. It would take time for things to change and reach their full potential, like how it would take thousands of years for humanity to go beyond solar system. But in both cases, there is no need for patience. For now, just having the possibility was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mineva Lao Zabi, now Audrey Burne, she hadn't reached the end of the road yet, there was still work to be done, but she had found a soulmate to travel down it with her, Banagher Links.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune 15, UC 0096<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed as she reclined in her chair. Another stressful negotiation with the Federation had just ended. It still felt she hadn't made any progress in getting through their thick heads, but the fact that the Federation wasn't sending any soldiers after them meant that she was doing something right. Her new life as the leader of the Vist Foundation was one spent living in the Vist Foundation mansion on the Magallanica, along with the other new members of the organization. She hadn't reached the normal life Banagher had promised her yet, a life of \"watching TV, snacking, and playing video games without care in the world\" in Banagher's own words, but neither of them had lost faith in that dream. It was going to take longer then they initially thought to reach it, but they were going to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding something to take her mind off things, and glad she most likely wouldn't be in the communications room until tomorrow, the Zabi stood up and walked out of the room, heading towards the dinning room. She had to skip lunch for today's meeting. Banagher was worried by that that his soulmate was falling back into neglecting herself herself in favor of her work, to the point he was seriously considering force feeding Audrey her lunch, but it was more that the Zabi wasn't feeling that hungry then. She was a bit peckish, but she was by no means starving herself. At any rate, she was going to have lunch now, which should please Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the dinning room, she was greeted by a sight she hadn't expected. The sight of the dinning table as an absolute mess, tons of empty plates, soda bottles, wrappers, and pizza boxes. The culprits of this crime against manners were three of her her best friends and new family, Banagher, Micott, and Takuya. The full teens were sporting huge stuffed bellies, the size of Haro and just as round. The large orbs filled up their laps and made their tops rise above their bellybuttons, leaving their full tummies completely exposed. Banagher and Takuya's belts had been snapped in half by their bellies, and the button on each bloated teen's pants (short shorts in Micott's case) had been popped off by their bellies. Their stomachs had forced the zippers on their pants (again, short shorts in Micott's case) all the way, leaving a bit of their underwear exposed. They were all relined in their chairs, pleased grins on their faces as they lazed about and rubbed their big tummies and burped. Haro was on the ground next to Banagher's chair, normally he would've sat in Banagher's lap but the brunette's belly left no room for the robotic orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, UUUURRRP! That was good.\" Banagher gave his stomach a hearty slap for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. UUUUURP!\" Takuya said, patting his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRRP! Never ate food that good before.\" Micott said as she rubbed her swollen tummy, and admired Banagher and Takuya's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Audrey!\" Banagher greeted his soulmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ate all this?\" Audrey said, clearly shocked. She had never seen such gluttony and disregard for manners before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did.\" Takuya cheerfully said, patting his tummy as Banagher burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all such pigs.\" The blonde primness said, playfully shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've earned the right to pig out now and then. UUUURRRP!\" Banagher said, drumming his fingers on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse you!\" Audrey playfully chided. \"You should mind your manners. All this belching is incredibly gross.\" The blonde was playfully yet seriously chiding her friends at the same time. She never thought it would be possible for someone to be both very endearing, and very disgusting at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAP! Not like we can help it when were this stuffed.\" Micott said, a tad amused at how belching was messing with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you got a belly as stuffed as this-\" here Banagher gave a slap to his stomach for emphasis- \"it's okay to bend social norms a bit, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but it's your fault for eating so much in the first place.\" Audrey started inspecting the graveyard of their feast in morbid curiosity. She noticed a few plates were completely clean. \"You even licked the plates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told -URP- us that high class food was this good.\" Takuya said. \"It's a wonder you're not fat!\" His words made all five of them imagine how Audrey would look if she was fat. Banagher, Takuya, Micott, and Haro thought she would look cute, in a cuddly way, while Audrey pushed the image out of her head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i-I'm not fat because I have restraint.\" Audrey was blushing with an embarrassed look on her face. \"High class food isn't even that good.\" She then lifted up a the lid of a pizza box \"How is pizza even high class food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's made with five star -UUURAP- ingredients. This stuff is really good, our stomachs wouldn't be so big if it wasn't.\" Micott said, giving her middle a light slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are any of you going to beat me at the Smash Bros tournament tonight when you're all so bloated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always come in last place.\" Takuya pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-Well, this time I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was cut off as the dinning room doors opened again.</span></div></div>",

You're acting -URAP- like your old self.\" Micott pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sat down in a chair next to Banagher, Haro rolled to a spot in between their chairs. \"Just don't expect me to pig out like you all did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat all you want.\" Banagher gave the blonde a friendly pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for getting me lunch, Banagher.\" Audrey said as she picked up a slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, Marida, thanks for cooking all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're welcome. I'll rub your belly if you get a stomachache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey took a bit out of her first slice. As soon as she finished her first bite, a huge smile appeared on the princess' face. She started gobbling up her slice and finished it in less then a minute. \"Marida, this is really good.\" She complimented, making Marida's heart warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Audrey was an eating machine, slice after slice of pizza was shoveled into her greedy mouth, her belly getting bigger and bigger, which she paid no mind, all she was focused on was eating. The others were surprised by the Zabi's eating powers, and impressed. In Banagher and Marida's case, they even felt a bit of pride. After half an hour of eating, Audrey had finished eating both pizzas, her belly a huge orb just as big as her friends' bellies. Stuffed to the brim, Audrey leaned back in her chair, her belly snapped the belt of her Zeon uniform in half, which was followed by the huge orb bulging out further, forcing her uniform top to unzip, which her swollen gut completely exposed, and popping off the button on her pants and forcing the zipper all the way down, exposing some of her pink underwear. This domino effect of wardrobe malfunctions left her belly bugling out a few inches further. Audrey was a bit embarrassed by all this but for the most part, she didn't mind. She had a satisfied grin on her face, hands on her full belly. She unleashed a loud, unladylike belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRP! Excuse me!\" Audrey chuckled, blushing but enjoying the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Audrey!\" Banagher complimented with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ah ha ha!\" Audrey took a good look at her round belly, seeing how round and big it was, and then looked at Banagher's to compare. \"Our -UUURRRP- bellies are so big and round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are. I wonder who has the bigg -URAP- est.\" Banagher said as he looked down at his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably you -UUURAP- or Audrey.\" Takuya chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say it's -UUUURP- Banagher. Just look at that gut.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey's belly looks bigger.\" Marida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are so biased.\" Takuya chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All your big bellies look like me.\" Haro said. \"Audrey and Banagher's are the biggest! They're bigger then me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin on her face, Audrey looked Banagher in the eyes. \"Care to compare who's gut is the largest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher mirrored Audrey's grin as he looked back at her. \"Sure, Audrey. But don't think I'll suck it in to let you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher happily bumped their big bellies together, the impact forcing a huge burp to be unleashed from their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAAP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina Mackenzie found that vacation could prove to be surprisingly boring. The One Year War had ended and she took a vacation to relax for a long time but she was now having trouble deciding what to do. She did want to go to the beach but it was raining. She could spend some time at the arcade but she had already spent most of her vacation there. As much as she enjoyed arcade games, Christina wanted to do something different for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of lazing about on her couch and watching TV, Chris decided to go on a walk. Taking an umbrella with her, the redhead began her walk, happy to be out of her house for once. Though it wasn't long before her stomach growled loudly. Chris came to a stop and placed a hand on her stomach. She really was hungry and she was going to need a big meal to fill her belly up. The redhead licked her lips and rubbed her hungry tummy as she thought of all the tasty food she could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quick bite wouldn't hurt.\" Chris said. Looking for a place she could eat, she soon saw a restaurant that caught her interest. She entered it and took a look at their menu. Pizza, chicken, hamburgers, and ice cream among others. It all sounded so delicious to Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris took a seat and placed her large order. Only after she listed her order did Chris realize how big it was. She knew that she was going to put on a few pounds from this meal but she could easily work those off. One little binge couldn't hurt too much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her meal arrived, Chris happily dug in. She started with the hamburgers but she soon started alternating between what she was eating. She would also occasionally take a sip from one of her bottles of soda causing to belt out some loud belches. One noticeable display of Chris' gluttony was taking a slice of pizza in each of her hands and taking a bite from each until both slices were completely in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' belly expanded as she filled herself up with more and more food. Her sweater had ridden up past her big belly, showing off her bare belly. Embarrassed, Chris tried to pull it back down but was unsuccessful. A blush appeared on Chris' face. Still she continued on with her gigantic meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a a couple minutes, Chris' heard a loud \u2013ping!- sound. She looked down and discouraged that the button on her jeans had popped off. Her belly has poured further onto her lap. A blush speared on Chris' face. She was more then a little embarrassed at how big her belly had gotten. At the same time, her bloated tummy did feel better without her pants pressing into it as much. Despite this, Chris wasn't going to stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I underestimated my appetite.\" Chris said aloud to herself, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was thoroughly enjoying her meal. While she did dread seeing how fat she was going to get after she digested her meal, the food was just too good. She had earned herself a break. Besides, it wouldn't be that hard to work off the pounds this binge was  Right now she wasn't going to worry about anything at all. She was just going to enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUUUURRRP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Christina finished her massive meal. She leaned back in her seat and let out a massive belch, a happy and lazy expression on her face. The redhead rubbed her big belly and occasionally burped. Chris was stuffed and she loved it. There was something about being so stuffed that was so awesome. She didn't have any regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that hit the spot.\" Chris said in joy as rubbed her stuffed tummy. She was pretty impressed with how big her gut had gotten and with how much she had eaten. The redhead slapped her big belly, causing her to belt out another powerful burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, I'm stuffed. UUUURRRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doris released a large belch as she gave her big belly a few rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh~, that hit the \u2013UUURRRP- spot.\" The redhead said, giving her gut a hearty slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris had completely stuffed herself to the brim with all sorts of food, such as pizza, chocolates, hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cream among others. She was so full that she to completely unzip her pilot suit's zipper and undo it's belt. The well-fed redhead had been treating herself to a lot of food lately and her gluttony was having the expected effect on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had lost all of it's former flatness and was now a giant sphere of adipose. It was a big ball of fat that was so large that her pilot suit's belt was barely able to contain it. Doris' belly had several layers of fat and was very soft and plush. The ball of fat was also increabdly jiggly, bouncing and jiggling with every step she made. The laws of gravity caused the soldier's tummy to hang down a little, emphasizing how big it was. Doris also had some prodigious love handles that accompanied the sides of her dome of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead's tits were even bigger now. They jutted out from her chest almost as much as her belly did from her torso. Thanks to the redhead's youth, her breasts were still just as perky as they always were. They were very large orbs of fat that were very soft and plush. The soldier's boobs had grown so much that she had to get a bra that was a whole cup size bigger. Much like her middle, Doris' breasts would jiggle and wobble with very step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris' butt had seen a good amount of growth as well. While it used to be fairly small and perky, it was now a huge bubblebutt. The solder's ass now had no problem completely filling up most chairs she sat down in. Each cheek was huge and they didn't need much provocation to start jiggling. Doris' ass was even responsible for a tear in one of her old casual jeans. This large ass met up with a pair of chunky legs. Doris' legs were very meaty and wide, they slightly with every footfall and rubbed together when she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had chubbed up as well. Her cheeks were very round and her chin had become double tiered. Because of these changes, Doris' face had completely lost it's ability to appear intermediating when need be and now look much more inviting, especially when she grinned or smiled. Doris' face was still very beautiful, just in a chubby way now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Slave Wraith being a small unit composing of merely five members, it was still very well-supplied, as it was Grave's personal team. Said supplies didn't just consist of item for the mobile suits and the Medea, it also consisted of stuff that was to ensure the Wraiths were comfortable, in order to help ensure their loyalty. Or at least their complacency. Said stuff included plenty of delicious food of all kinds. Doris was all too happy to help herself to plenty of it. Since she and the other Wraiths weren't allowed to visit any towns for a break (even letting other Federation soldiers see them was discouraged) she spent most of her free time lazing around, browsing the internet while enjoying a snack. Her snacks were initially average sized but her appetite and gluttony grew as she gobbled up more and more delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a member of Slave Wraith, most would expect Doris to stay in-shape. However, her role as a member of Slave Wraith was that of a hacker and navigator, stationary roles. So she wasn't getting any exercise that would help her slim down or at least lessen the effects of her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man \u2013UURRRP-, as good as this food is, it's really making me fat. UUUURRRP! I should probably get some exercise in tonight.\" Doris said, causally drumming her fingers on her belly. \"URRRP! Eh, on second thought, I'll do it tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

The brunette had just been fed a massive meal by Lacus and was now bloated beyond belief. With a sweet smile, Lacus placed her hands on Kira's giant gut and began rubbing it with great care. Kira sighed in pleasure as he felt a soothing warmth overcome him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus giggled. \"You and your belly certainty love my cooking, don't you?\" The pinkette give Kira's tummy a few affectionate pats for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. UUURRRP!\" Kira replied. \"You're an amazing cook, Lacus. I guess how fat I've gotten is proof of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira wasn't exaggerating when he said he was fat. Because of the wonderful meals Lacus would stuff him with on a near-daily basis, he had gained enough weight to weigh 223 pounds, with most of his weight concentrating on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's belly was a giant ball of fat that was very soft and malleable. The sphere of adipose was so incredibly soft that it had been used as a very comfortable pillow many times by Lacus, which she and Kira enjoyed greatly. The Gundam pilot's tummy was very jiggly, something that was shown with every step the well-fed young man made. Kira's gut being so jiggly and soft made it a very nice play thing, so it wasn't uncommon to see Lacus and Kira enjoying some belly play. A few belts had been snapped in half by his gut. Even when he wasn't stuffed to the brim by Lacus, Kira's big belly would force his shirt to ride up to juuuusst below his very deep bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette also had a pair of flabby man boobs. They were big, squishy, sacks of fat that rested on his tummy. The orbs were so big that Kira almost needed a bra. If one were to just look at only Kira's moobs, it wouldn't be unexpected for one to mistake them for actual women's breasts. Just like his middle, his man boobs bounced with every step he took. Lacus loved teasing Kira about his man boobs and would sometimes give them a playful shake. In fact, Kira's moobs were even around the size of Lacus' breasts. Something they both found out when Lacus playfully shoved his chest into Kira's after gushing about how cute his moobs were. Needless to say, they both started blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ass was truly worthy of being called a bubblebutt. Each cheek was a large, jiggly sphere nearly the size of a bowling ball. The pilot's butt would completely take up nearly any chair he sat down in. Kira's huge ass had even broken a few chairs, usually after Lacus was done stuffing him for the night. Kira would blush up a storm whenever that happened, which Lacus found made it even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's butt went along well with his chunky legs. They were wide and would rub together whenever he sat down. Because of how chubby his legs were now, they weren't nearly as suited to running as they used to be. Luckily, because Kira was a Coordinator, it didn't affect him that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's face wasn't spared from the effects of his countless binges. He had a double chin and his cheeks were practically puffed up, making him look like he was holding his breath. Whenever Kira smiled, dimples would show up, making his smiles even cuter. These features suited Kira's sweet and gentle personality very well and made him very cute in a chubby way. Lacus couldn't get over how absolutely adorable Kira's face was. She never failed to say just how pinchable his cheeks were, or how much Kira's face could resemble a puppy's whenever he pouted now, much to the young man's chagrin and secret delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kira!\" Lacus then sweetly kissed Kira's belly. She then rubbed her head against Kira's belly. \"Your big belly is so cuddly, Kira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all thanks to your great \u2013UUURRAAP-! Excuse me. It's all thanks to your great cooking that my gut got so big and cuddly.\" Kira said. \"UURRAAP! Sorry about all the burping.\" Kira started blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, burp all you want,\" Lacus said, smiling as she continued to rub her boyfriend's gut. \"it'll help your tummy feel better. Your burps are really cute.\" Lacus then pressed down slightly on Kira's belly, causing him to unleash a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus started giggling. Kira's face turned practically scarlet but he laughed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while Lacus soothingly rubbed the Freedom Gundam's pilot's belly which felt heavenly to Kira. The two also had some nice some belly play, Lacus would jiggle, pat, kiss, knead, and sometimes even shake the brunette's taught tummy, which was a very pleasurable experience for both of them. Occasionally, the pinkette would play just a little amount of force to the brunette's giant belly, forcing Kira to let out another burp, which were often quite big. Lacus found it absolutely adorable how Kira was such a gentle guy yet he was capable of belching out some truly powerful belches. How red this would cause his chubby cheeks to become, and how they jiggled and bounced whenever he laughed with her after burping made it even more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this, Kira brought up a topic he'd been meaning to for the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I should probably cut back on the eating. I've really gotten \u2013UURRAAAP- fat.\" Kira stated, looking at his giant gut as it loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Kira, you still look great.\" Lacus said in a sweet tone as she lovingly rubbed Kira's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You look really cute with all that chub and your huge tummy is a ton of fun to play with.\" Lacus gave the orb of fat a loving hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira tried to stifle a burp but failed. \"UURRRAP! I guess it is. Heh heh!\" The brunette gave his belly a few pats. \"Though I still want to lose some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help. Just don't skip any meals or I'll make you eat the biggest cake known to man!\" Lacus half-jokingly said with her usual sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, \u2013UUURRAP- I won't.\" Kira assured. He couldn't help but wonder how big such a cake would actually be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kira entered his room aboard the Archangel, hands on his stuffed gut as he flopped down on his bed. He groaned in both pain and pleasure as his stomach continued to gurgle and bubble as it digested the massive meal he had just consumed. He belted out a massive belch, alleviating some of the pressure within his big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now,the brunette was a lot bigger than previously. Whereas during his life in Heliopolis, he used to weigh only in his early-100's, now he was 214 lbs. as a Gundam pilot, which made him truly obese. And none of that was in muscle; on the contrary, the new weight manifested itself as pure lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was Kira's stomach. It was spherical nowadays, in great contrast to its flatness of old. The giant gut had several layers of fat upon it, and was incredibly soft and malleable whenever it wasn't full of food. There were plentiful love handles and rolls on Kira's sides, especially evident if he sat down. There was also a spare tire that formed, which was mainly visible if he needed to bend down for any reason. It was forcing his shirt to ride up past his incredibly deep navel, and was also preventing his pants from getting zipped and buttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gut full of adipose was easily the biggest part of the young man's body, and didn't require that much provocation to start jiggling and bouncing.It was very pronounced whenever the brunette walked through the halls or was in the middle of a tough battle in his Gundam. Thankfully, his gut wasn't big enough to actually get in the way of Kira's piloting skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were his legs and ass, which were all a bit bigger nowadays.His ass lost all its own tone, now becoming a bubble butt that jiggled nearly as much as Kira's belly did. His legs were a lot meatier and soft as well, leading to them becoming a bit weaker than before. Granted, he was a coordinator, so he was still quite fit by normal standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was also quite a bit plumper, leading to his cheeks to be more cherubic, and Kira was starting to get a bit of (slight) double-chin action going on. It wasnt' too noticeable yet, although his face was rounding out compared to his sharper visage of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... Flay -URP- really is good at cooking... Kira muttered, giving his belly a light slap. \"Although I might need to -UURRRP- lay off on the food for a while. I'm starting to get fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts in mind, he ended up drifting off to sleep, thoughts of meals to come dancing about in his mind's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Flay was partaking in her own little feast. She just finished making a very nice and filling meal for Kira earlier, so she figured she should probably reward herself now, Granted, she may have been rewarding herself a bit too often as of late, as her new physique could attest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weighed nearly as much as Kira, tipping the scales at 212 lbs., and this weight certainly didn't go unnoticed. Quite a few people tended to comment on her recent weight gain, ostensibly behind her back, but definitely loud enough for the redhead to hear them. She didn't pay it any mind, though: she knew that gaining weight herself was helping to keep Kira's mind off his own, since he wasn't facing all of it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, Flay was currently manipulating the Gundam pilot to try and drive him to be more competent in his battles to try and kill his fellow Coordinators that were part of the ZAFT military, which included a former friend of his, Arthrun Zala. To try and erase his doubts, she was trying to seduce the brunette and allow her romance with him to give him enough motivation to kill his opponents with ease on the battlefield. The daughter of the recently-deceased Prime Minister of the Atlantic Federation heard a good way to get to a man's heart was through food, and thus she decided that that would be the best way to help win Kira's affections. And so far, things were looking pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral areas of Flay had changed due to her weight gain. The major areas hit so far were her belly, chest, and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was quite a bit plumper nowadays, not as big as Kira's, but still no longer flat. It was pushing out against her now-slightly-small-dress, and it was developing a fair amount of rolls. Its curves were also much more pronounced, meeting up with her flabbier hips that flared out more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn regards to her ass, it bulged out a fair amount, gaining padding and softness that wasn't previous in the older, petite form. It also pushed against her dress, and tended to leave an imprint on any cushioned seat she sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay's chest was certainly bustier, the extra fat and calories doing well in making her boobs plusher while still keeping their old perkiness. It wasn't enough that the redhead had to get several new bras, but it was enough that she had to get one new one, lest her cleavage bust out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were flabbier, the appendages having a loose quality to them and wobbling ever-so-subtly with every footfall made from her steps. While she had never been athletic in the past, that possibilty was completely eliminated now that her legs pretty much possessed no muscle to them whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be mentioned that since she was a Natural, she didn't have the advanced physical fitness Kira did that kept his weight gain from impacting him too much, so it wasn't exactly an uncommon sight to see Flay pant and get red in the face from the physical strain of exerting her body.Granted, the low-gravity environments that sometimes came whenever she went into space helped to alleviate this, but the redhead was definitely out-of-shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, that didn't matter anyways to Flay. Her relationship with Kira was having the desired effect: he was definitely more willing to take on ZAFT and its forces with her encouragement. Just the thought made her giggle. She turned to the spread she made for herself, savoring all the delectable aromas that reached her nostrils as she took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, there was a lot of variety to be had. There were hot dogs, pizza, burgers, potato chips, soda, cake, ice cream, and tons of donuts. Just looking at all of it made Flay's mouth water, She couldn't wait to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flay had been raised throughout her entire life to be a prim and proper lady, something she tended to pride herself on. She tried to be at least a little humble about it, but she certainly enjoyed the fact that she was much more refined than some of the slobs she knew in her life (and that number had only seemed to increase as time went by). However, there were times when Flay didn\u2019t always adhere to the strict upbringing she had known for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood had essentially become an opportunity for all her training to be thrown out the window nowadays, which the redhead didn\u2019t mind one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the morsels lined in front of her, the rich young woman couldn\u2019t help but give her lips a small lick in anticipation. There was just so much to devour\u2026 so much to bring into her ever-expanding stomach. Thinking it over, the redhead decided she\u2019d start off with the pizza, since really, when was that ever a bad choice? And thus, she brought  a slice right up to her lips, marveling at how the grease was pooling in every indent available, how the sauce and cheese were nearly dripping off the crust\u2026 but wait! There was something she could do to make this even <i>better</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a girlish giggle, Flay picked up another slice, and put used it to fold up the other within, leading to one giant slice that was really two in one! A classic trick, to be sure, but definitely a godsend when it came to helping the young woman pack on as many pounds as she had by this point. There was a reason she was popping out of all her clothes every day, why there were so many seams being torn in all the luxurious fabrics, all the loud belches escaping from her refined lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her round gut a soothing rub underneath her dress, Flay began to chow down as if there was no tomorrow. She scarfed down so many slices of pizza she finished the whole pie, causing a brief moment of respite as she admired her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURRAAP! Wow, I\u2019ve certainly gotten better now!\u201d she said with a lazy grin. \u201cI think I may even be giving \u2013URP- Kira a run for his money\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she proceeded to scarf down two hot dogs, making sure to load them up with a very generous helping of mustard and ketchup, following that up with four of the double-decked bacon cheeseburgers she was also keeping on standby. Her gut wasn\u2019t even stuffed yet! Oh sure, she was very full, but through all the constant binging the redhead had been doing lately, even this much didn\u2019t make her feel like she was about to pop. Truly, a testament to just how gluttonous she\u2019d been as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after finishing all that, Flay reclined back into her chair, the furniture letting out a somewhat ominous creak as she began to drum her digits upon the still somewhat-soft collection of adipose that served as her stomach. Looking down, she saw a bit of bacon and mustard had fallen down onto her cleavage, but no matter. She just picked up the piece of meat and, plunging it into the mustard, just essentially used her own chest as a condiment stand to help fuel her ever-expanding desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has to be \u2013UURAAP- the best decision I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Flay chuckled. \u201cAt this rate, Kira and I will be the fattest and heaviest couple on this entire ship! All the while, he\u2019ll become the <i>perfect</i> warrior to deal with all those pathetic Coordinators flying around in their damn Mobile Suits.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was it Kira?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" she called out, deciding not to use a seductive voice in case it wasn't her beau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Ms. Allster?\u201d Murrue Ramius asked from the other side of the door.  \u201cMay I enter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she here? Flay had no idea why the Captain would be visiting her, but she supposed it had to be something important. And if it was, the last thing she\u2019d want to do would be to annoy one of the most powerful people on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you can come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue didn\u2019t waste any time, promptly entering the room and closing the door quickly behind her, occasionally glancing over at Flay as she did so. Truthfully, it made the redhead a bit uncomfortable. She felt like she was being analyzed, or something, and that was definitely not the type of treatment she was used to or would be willing to tolerate from anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I interrupt anything?\u201d the brunette asked, seeing the vast spread of dishes before Flay. \u201cIt seems as though you\u2019ve had quite a feast, hm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I guess I did,\u201d Flay muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I guess Kira\u2019s been having some of these calorie-packed dishes with you?\u201d Murrue walked over and planted a finger into a half-eaten slice of pizza to illustrate her point. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s been spending a lot of time with you recently\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlay, I\u2019m not going to mince words here. I\u2019ve noticed you and Kira have been gaining weight, and both at around the same time. Kira\u2019s one of our best pilots, and I\u2019m afraid his weight will impact his performance. Why is it that his unhealthy habits began when he started seeing you more often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Flay, I\u2019m not going to punish you or Kira. You can continue seeing each other as much as you\u2019d like, but I\u2019m going to have to request that both of you cut down on the amount of junk food you\u2019re eating. Kira\u2019s going to be put on a strict exercise regime to help him, and I don\u2019t want him being around someone who\u2019ll only serve as a bad influence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...okay, but how're you going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be assigning members of the crew to monitor you two when you eat. Nothing invasive, don't worry, they'll just make sure there's nothing in the room that goes over the calorie limits we'll be setting for you two, and...alright, this does make it sound like I distrust you, but they're also going to stand guard outside the doors to make sure neither of you sneak out or get someone to come int to give you anything contraband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue looked at the teen and gave a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you realize this is only for your health. I know most people don\u2019t want to have their weights pointed out to them, but I\u2019m afraid the situation\u2019ll run out of control if we don\u2019t do something to stop it now. Please understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left in just as quick and efficient a manner as she entered, leaving a slack-jawed Flay in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell was that?</i> Flay almost screamed. <i>Who does she think she is?! Does she think of Kira and I as just some damn slaves to this whole operation, are we supposed to cow-tow to her desires just because she says so?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Kira\u2019s performance even impacted by his weight at all? Flay had some serious doubts: she had seen him fighting, and he didn\u2019t look like he was having any sort of extra problems doing it to her. So where was this coming from? Was Murrue just starting to get paranoid? That was seriously the only option the deceased Prime Minister\u2019s daughter could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she knew how to deal with that. As Flay began drumming her fingers upon her stuffed gut even faster, a plan started to formulate in her mind. She\u2019d\u2026</span></div></div>",

There was no other way to put it, he was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was a big, spherical ball of fat that would jiggle and bob whenever he took a step. Or really, whenever it registered any physical impact. It was incredibly soft and was easily the biggest part of the Gundam pilot's body. He now had a pair of flabby moobs that rested slightly on his gut. They weren't too big yet but it didn't take long to notice them, much to the chubby brunette's embarrassment. Kira's ass had not been spared by his growth, it was now a big bubblebutt that was just as jiggly as his tummy. Finally, there was Kira's face. His cheeks had puffed up and he now had a double chin. This actually made his face appear rather cute (though it always was cute) and it suit his sweet and gentle personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese pilot rested a hand on his sizable tummy, feeling how incredibly soft it was. Kira gave his gut a good shake and cringed as he watched how much it jiggled and wobble, his face turning as bright as a tomato. This was all the convincing he needed to hit the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started a month ago, a little bit after the end of the Bloody Valentine War. Kira had returned to his civilian life along with his sister, Cagalli, who would only be sworn in to office once she became eighteen. After spending so many long months fighting for the Earth Alliance and later Orb, it was hard for Kira to readjust to his old life, the fact that he was living in a completely new house didn't help. Cagalli noticed this pretty quickly so she figured that she'd help him loosen up and what better way to do that then by going to an all-you-can-eat buffet with him and just stuffing yourselves silly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kira.\" Cagalli uttered, grinning as she offered a slice of pizza to Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Cagalli.\" Kira responded. \"I told you, I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not. You could eat a few more slices.\" Cagalli pushed the pizza slice even closer to Kira. \"I know I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about getting fat?\" Kira asked. He was never someone who was too worried about his diet but his weight was part of the reason he didn't want to overeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. We're here to relax and enjoy ourselves.\" Cagalli reminded her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Kira noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now will you take a bite already?\" Cagalli nearly shoved the entire slice into Kira's mouth. \"Jeez, you really gotta learn to loosen up, Kira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a point there, heh heh!\" Kira chuckled before he began eating the slice. Cagalli grinned at the sight of her brother finally relaxing. She soon started digging into her won slice. It didn't take them long to finish their slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this place has good pizza.\" Cagalli said as he placed a hand on her stomach in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. I'm going to get another slice. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to get some more donar kebabs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Kira ended up eating far more then Cagalli did. By the time he was done eating, his once flat stomach had ballooned out into a huge ball stuffed to the brim with all sorts of food. The button on his pants had been popped off by his by his big tummy and it forced the zipper on his pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed. UUURRRRP!\" Kira burped out as he rubbed his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I see you enjoyed yourself.\" Cagalli said, a pleased smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This was \u2013UURRRAAP- great.\" Kira was smiling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, I wasn't expecting you to eat that much.\" Cagalli stated. \"I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T \u2013UURRAAP- Thanks. I'm pretty surprised myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent a little more time chatting (and in Kira's case, belching) before deciding to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to leave?\" Cagalli asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Wait, who's paying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.\" Cagalli realized that she had completely forgotten that someone would have to pay for all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two done eating? As if on cue, a waitress arrived to deliver the bill. She was eying the sheer amount of empty dishes on the siblings' table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We'll take the bill now.\" Kira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we had more customers like you, Mr...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kira \u2013UUUURRRRP-! Sorry about that. I'm Kira Yamato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Kira Loud Belch Yamato, I hope you and your friend come here again soon.\" The waitress said, a bemused expression on her face as she placed the bill on the table. \"I know my boss does.\" She said before she began walking over to another customer's table. Kira picked up the bill and a nervous expression appeared on his face as soon as he read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how bad is it?\" Cagalli asked, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. A little over $215.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Kira uttered. He then looked down at his dome of a stomach in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I was the one who told you to eat so much in the first place.\" Cagalli said as she began taking the money out of her wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cagalli left the money, Kira attempted to get up but his gut was making that rather difficult. He gave up after a few seconds of huffing and puffing. His face was now red from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess you ate a little too much.\" Cagalli chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help me up already.\" Kira said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Cagalli then stood up and walked over to Kira. \"Up you go, big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended her hand to Kira, who grasped it and after a bit of grunting from both of them, was lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Now I just have to walk home like this.\" Kira said, still huffing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're definitely gonna need some help with that.\" Cagalli threw Kira's arm over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira and Cagalli began walking home, the brunette leaning on the blonde for support the whole time. The both couldn't help but notice how Kira's belly jiggled with every step they made. Fortunately, the walk wasn't too long and they soon reached their home. As soon as they entered, Cagalli helped Kira over to the couch and gently laid him down, with the blonde taking her spot at the opposite end of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can't call you scrawny anymore, huh?\" Cagalli noted as she watched Kira's tummy go up and down slightly with every one of his breaths. \"Well, at least until you digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not scrawny. And thanks, this was really fun.\" Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. You know, I think you could still use a little help with relaxing.\" Cagalli said. \"How about we go see a movie tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great.\" Kira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while more of small talk, a loud gurgle came from Kira's gut. he placed a hand on it and burped loudly, groaning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stomachache?\" Cagalli asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. I feel perfectly \u2013URRAP- fine\" A sickly gurgle escaped Kira's belly and discomfort was obvious on his face.  \"Well, it does actually hurt a little but it's not much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to rub your belly?\" Cagalli suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that.\" Kira answered. \"It really doesn't hurt that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how much Kira's gut was gurgling and rumbling, Cagalli doubted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mouth says one thing, but I'm hearing something else from your little friend here,\" the blonde said, pointing to Kira's paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli placed her hands and Kira's belly and began rubbing the taut orb. Kira let out a moan of satisfaction as he felt the pain be replaced with soothing sensation as Cagalli's hands made rhythmic motions on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels really good, Cagalli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this won't become a habit, or anything,\" Cagalli said, blushing. \"It's just not really good to let indigestion get out of hand, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't think it would! I-URRRRAAAP!\" Kira's face went bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse you!\" Cagalli said playfully. They both burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli rubbed Kira's gut until he fell asleep. Since that day, Kira was much livelier then he was before. He had also gotten much fatter too, as he would often stuff himself as a way to relax and enjoy himself, as per Cagalli's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Kira wanted to lose weight, he really was having fun with Cagalli and it hard to resist all the delicious food that was available. Kira wondered if maybe the reason he's been eating so much is just his way to cope with the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to put those thoughts away for now, it was the start of a new day and he shouldn't start it out with negative thoughts like this. It was time to watch TV and enjoy a healthy breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well-fed Gundam pilot left and descended down the stairs, his tummy, butt, and moobs bouncing as he did so. As he reached the end, he saw Cagalli watching TV and eating a bowl of cereal, as he usually found her at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Cagalli.\" He said as he began approaching the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" Cagalli replied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kira rested a hand on his big belly as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. He let out a sigh, it was official now: he was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira weighed 216 pounds, with most of his weight concentrating on his stomach. His stomach was a huge orb of adipose with several layers of lard, making it incredibly soft and malleable. This huge ball of fat was also very jiggly, bouncing and jiggling like jello with very step Kira made. Were Kira piloting a Gundam, his belly would be almost constantly jiggling from the mobile suit's motions. Plentiful love handles and rolls had formed on the sides of the brunette's tummy, which gave Kira and Cagalli more areas to feel and rub. Kira's belly was so big that the laws of gravity had taken hold of it, causing the balloon of adipose to hang down, emphasizing how big it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette had a pair of flabby man boobs. The pale sacks of fat rested on top of his soft belly, and were just as jiggly as the ball of adipose. They were very plush and squishy, making them quite nice play things. Kira's chest had gotten so big and jiggly, that they could actually fill up some bras. Cagalli liked to tease Kira about his chest, sometimes even giving them a squeeze or shake. She had also taken to just calling them Kira's boobs, a habit which Kira was starting to catch himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man's ass had lost all it's tone and was now a huge bubblebutt. Each cheek was a big sphere that was very soft and flabby, completely lacking any visible hint of muscle. The brunette's ass would jiggle and jostle with every step he took, almost as much as his belly did. Many of the chairs that Kira would sit down in would be completely filled in by his butt. If Kira ever needed to pilot the Freedom Gundam again, he would have to have the chair resized for his butt to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam pilot was also sporting some rather flabby legs. They were meaty and wide, to the point that they rubbed together when he sat down. Just like the rest of Kira's chubby body, they were very soft and completely lacking in tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's face was now very chubby. His chin was now double-tiered and while his cheeks always had some softness to them, they were now puffed up, making the brunette look like he was always holding his breath. The Gundam pilot's cheeks were so chubby they would fold and bounce whenever he let out a bellyful laugh. Dimples would even show up when he smiled. His new chubby features actually made Kira's face rather cute in a chubby sense, as they empathized how soft it was. The puffy cheeks he sported when along well with his smiles and his gentle and kind personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Kira had gotten so fat was his twin sister, though they both considered her the big sister, Cagalli. The blonde young women had noticed that her brother was still a bit glum since the war had ended and was having trouble readjusting to life as a regular person. As such, Cagalli figured she'd help him enjoy himself by doing fun stuff with him, like playing video games and watching TV until two in the morning while eating tons of junk food, going to the arcade while treating themselves to some tasty fast food, having burping contests, having eating contests, and even stuffing themselves silly at all-you-can-eat buffets. Needless to say, this resulted in Kira and Cagalli fattening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira left his room and headed downstairs. As he descended the stairs, the obese brunette felt his belly, ass, and moobs jiggle and bounce with every step, causing him to blush. When he got to the end he stopped in place and looked down at his big tummy disapprovingly as the large orb of fat jiggled a bit more before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to lose all this.\" Kira said as he gave his belly a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Kira.\" Cagalli said from the couch. The blonde was enjoying a big breakfast as she watched TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, morning, Cagalli.\" Kira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing 214 pounds, Cagalli was just as fat as Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli's belly was a giant mass of adipose that was always pressing against the waistband of her pants. Cagalli's giant gut was so enormous that it had broken some of her belts, usually after a big meal. The blonde's belly was also very jiggly. Whenever Cagalli made any sudden moments her stomach would react by jiggling violently. The blonde's belly was also very soft and squishy, making it a nice thing for Cagalli to feel and play with. Plentiful love handles on the sides of the blondes tummy cushioned the fat and gave Cagalli more areas to feel up. Cagalli's bellybutton was now incredibly deep, it almost looked like a black hole in the center of the blonde's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli's boobs were also bigger. They were big, plush orbs that jutted out nearly as much as her tummy, which was saying a lot. Cagalli was happy to note that her tits had gotten so big that they were now comfortably contained in a bra they would've previously been far too small to fit in. The blonde's breasts rested comfortably atop her orb-shaped belly. And just like her soft belly, Cagalli's boobs were very jiggly. They could often be seen bouncing and jiggling in near perfect sync with her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's ass was now truly worthy of being called a bubble butt. Each cheek had swollen with fat and were now huge and soft, with absolutely no tone in sight. The blonde's butt was also very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every step. Cagalli's butt would completely fill up up any normal-sized chair she sat down in, with some of her fat even spilling off the sides of it. Only large chairs being capable of containing the entirety of her butt's flabby glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli was sporting some very chubby and soft legs. The blonde's legs had lost all of their tone and were now so chunky and wide that the upper parts rubbed together.. Cagalli's chunky legs would wobble slightly with every step the well-fed Gundam pilot made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli's face had also packed on some fat from her countless binges. The blonde's cheeks were rather chubby and soft now and she was sporting a double chin. Her face becoming so much more soft and chubby helped to make her look more cute and friendly. Cagalli's chubby face made her moments of childish anger or blushing even cuter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"UUUUURRRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, Cagalli, Lacus, and Athrun all unleashed a massive belch in unison as they waddled out of the buffet, hands on their full bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, my belly's nice and -UUURRAAP- full!\" Lacus cheerfully said as she used her tummy as a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! Oof, mine too.\"  Kira said, giving his gurgling belly a nice rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine feels like it's going to explode. UUUURP!\" Athrun groaned, desperately rubbing his middle in hopes of soothing the aching beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAP! Mine's more then full, it's flat out stuffed.\" Cagalli said, also rubbing her orb-shaped belly. \"I'd say all our guts are pretty stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Bloody Valentine War had ended, the four of them had moved into a big house in Orb, finally free from all the hell they had all been put through. It was only natural the one they all wanted to do most was just kick back and relax. And since Lacus was incredibly wealthy from her successful singing career, there was no need for any of them to get a job. Cagalli would only take the position of Chief Representative of Orb after she had turned eighteen, so she didn't have any political responsibilities keeping her from having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peaceful life of just enjoying themselves without a care in the world proved to be good for their bellies. All four war heroes spent pretty much all their time snacking while they enjoyed some TV or video games. Kira and Athrun were initially a bit too timid to really pig out until Lacus and Cagalli started encouraging them. Really, all it took were some words from their respective girlfriend, and Kira and Athrun were sporting huge stuffed bellies before either of them could go \"UUUURRAP!\". These days they didn't even need any encouragement to binge on yummy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple causal snacking and laziness wasn't the only reason they all got so fat. Lacus was a huge contributor. She was often baking massive and yummy feasts for them all of them to eat. no matter how full they got, none of them could bring themselves to leave anything Lacus made uneaten. It just tasted so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Kira's weight had concentrated on his stomach, which was the biggest of the four. It was completely spherical, and so big it was a giant beanbag chair. It jiggled and wobbled with every step he took and had broken many belts and popped off many buttons. It's incredible softness made it a very nice place to rest one's head, which Lacus could attest to. Lacus loved rubbing and playing with her lover's big belly. The Freedom Gundam's pilot had a pair of big man boobs that rested on top of his tummy and were just as jiggly as it. Were one to only look at Kira's moobs, it wouldn't be unreasonable to mistake them for actual breasts. He had a big soft butt that filled most chairs he sat down in and bounced with every footfall. The brunette's butt strained his outdated pants. The Ultimate Coordinator had chubby legs, with thighs that barely had any separation when he was standing. They were much weaker now, but Kira's status as a Coordinator meant he was still fit by normal standards. Kira had an adorably round and chubby face, with puffed up cheeks and a double chin. Dimples would even show up whenever he smiled, making his smiles even more precious. The extra chub Kira's face had actually made him rather cute. Sure, he was always cute but now he was chubby cute\u2122.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus had a big, soft tummy that she absolutely loved feeling and playing with it. It wasn't an uncommon sight to her shaking it, or slapping it to see all the jiggles. The singer often grabbed handholds of her own belly fat, which she compared to cookie dough. Her tummy had a very deep navel, and plentiful love handles and side rolls one could fit small objects in. The pinkette had the largest chest out of the four, easily able to destroy some bras. It jutted out from her chest about as much as her belly did from her abdomen. They were very jiggly, bouncing in rhythm with Lacus' movements and dancing during her concerts. Her bubblebutt was also very impressive, nearly as bouncing as her chest. It was an amalgamation of two chunky orbs of soft fat, it filled up any normal sized chair she sat down in. It went along well with her chunky legs. The tree trunks of fat always rubbed together at the thighs, and jostled with every step. They met up with very curvy hips. Lacus' face was quite pudgy, so round it had pretty much no angles to it. She soft chubby cheeks and her chin was double-tiered. Her cheeks could even be seen bouncing when laughed. That or belted out a really big burp. All this helped to make pink-haired singer look like the cute, sweet person to cuddle with that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun's tummy was no longer flat and toned, it had ballooned up into a soft and jiggly sphere with a spare tire. Seeing it jiggle could sometimes bring a blush to the bluenette's face. Whenever he was full and bloated, which was often these days, it would keep him from zipping and buttoning his pants no matter how hard he tried. The Justice Gundam's pilot's man boobs weren't as big as his brown-haired friend's, but they were still big enough to rest on his belly. Bringing them up was a sure fire way to make Athrun blush, especially if you referred to them as boobs.The Zaft soldier had the biggest butt of the four of them, even bigger then Lacus'. Each half of his bubble butt was the size of a basketball and jiggled with every step. No normal size chair could contain it's flabby glory, not even the Justice Gundam's cockpit would be able to. Athrun had even broken a chair with his fat ass after a stuffing. Along with his meaty and wide legs, Athrun almost had a motherly figure to him. Cagalli said it suit him, as he is the mom of the group. Athrun had an even softer face then before, with round cheeks and a small, but notable double chin. This made Athrun's face very adorable in a chubby way, not intimidating in the slightest. Cagalli liked the new look, it was a sign of how he had loosened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli's weight had spread evenly. Fittingly, she had a huge orb-shaped belly, something even she found funny. The ball of fat jiggled and bobbed with every step the overfed blonde made, reminding her with every bounce of how fat she was. The Fat Lioness of Orb loved to playfully bump her friends with her big belly, especially if they bumped back. The Strike Rouge Gundam pilot's boobs had gotten much bigger, she was happy to see how they comfortably fit in a bra her boobs would've been too small for when she was slim, and that they were partly why her shirt was tight. Seeing them bounce more was something she took some secret pride in despite being a tomboy. Her ass was pretty big, it left an imprint on the couch when she sat down on it, which was often these day. Like her boobs and belly, it was very jiggly. Her legs were meaty and wide with fat, the thighs rubbing together when she walked. Since Cagalli was the only Natural of the group, she was also the most out-of-shape, which she hated being. Cagalli now had cute chubby cheeks that were very round and soft, making her look like she always holding her breath. She had a slight double chin that would go from small to big whenever she looked down. Cagalli's face was just as beautiful as ever, just in a chubby fashion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so bloated and full naturally gave the chubby four some wardrobe difficulties. Lacus had it the easiest, all she had to do was lower her skirt so her belly could bugle out, which she did with zero embarrassment, but the others weren't so fortunate. The buttons on Kira and Athrun' pants had been popped off, sent flying by their distended guts, allowing the tummies to surge forward. The resulting mass of flab force their zippers down completely, not did their guts bulge out completely free in public, but some of their underwear was now visible too. Granted it was covered by their stomachs, but that didn't make it any less embarrassing. Cagalli had it the worst though, not only did she have to go through that, but she was she only of the four who wore a belt that day, so she had to feel the embarrassment of having her huge belly snap her belt in half in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith belches and moans of both pain and pleasure leaving their mouths here and there, Kira, Cagalli, Lacus, and Athrun wobbled home, their huge middles bobbing and bouncing all the while, which didn't help with the digestion. When they finally got home, they all planted their fat asses down on a couch in pairs. Lacus and Kira sat together on one, while Cagalli and Athrun sat together on the other one. Each pair started rubbing each other's stuffed middles, which they always did after a big, filling meal. They also did some belly play, patting, jiggling, poking, shaking, and bumping each other's big, soft bellies. This was something they also always did when they had all stuffed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it great being this fat -UUUURAAP- and full?\" Lacus cheerfully said, giving Kira's tummy a few affectionate pats before resuming massaging the large orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun burped. \"W-Well, all the food is really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still the only one who likes being fat, Lacus. UUURRRP!\" Cagalli said. \"I'm not enjoying buttoning my pants being a total -UUUURRP- chore now because of my gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being fat isn't so bad.\" Kira commented. \"I'm kinda starting to like being so big and soft. UUURRRP!\" Here, Kira starting giving his tummy some pats. \"It's nice having a big -UUUURRRP- belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quit being so Lacus-whipped.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lacus Clyne almost always kept her happy demeanor, not even being a prisoner on board the Archangel had down in the dumps. Of course calling her a prisoner was a bit of a stretch, as she was given her own room and allowed free roam around the ship. Even the personal treatment she got from the members of the crew wasn't what a prisoner would expect. She was being treated especially well by one member called Kira Yamato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPracticing her singing to Mr. Pink within the confines of her room, Lacus was in her own little world. Until she heard a voice from right outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Lacus, can I come in?\" Lacus recognized the voice as Kira's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, come on in.\" She cheerfully replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kira did, he was carrying two tubs of strawberry ice cream with him. \"I got you some ice cream. S-Strawberry is your favorite, right?\" He said as she sat down with them next to Lacus in the center of her room. Lacus had mentioned that strawberry was her favorite flavor to Kira three times in by now, but Kira was still paranoid he got the flavor wrong and his attempted to impress Lacus would go up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, thanks!\" Lacus' words took a huge weight off Kira's back, though that weight soon returned when Kira remembered he forgot something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, I forgot the spoon! I'll be right back!\" Kira said as he bolted out of the room, leaving an amused Lacus behind, she returned to practicing her singing to Mr. Pink as soon as Kira left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later, Kira returned with the spoon, carrying it as if his friendship with Lacus depended on it. \"*Huff* *Huff* Here you go.\" He handed the spoon to Lacus and then sat down next to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Lacus said before she started digging into her ice cream. Kira was surprised by how much she was eating, he assumed from Lacus' personality and profession that she would have a small appetite, the two tubs of ice creams he bought her were meant for her to eat over the course of a few days, instead she finished both within an hour. \"Ahhh, that was good. Thanks again, Kira! UUUURRRP! Excuse me, hee hee!\" Lacus giggled, drumming her tummy. Her belly had swollen into a huge ball from all the ice cream the pink-haired singer had eaten. It made her top rise above it, and she had lowered her skirt under it, leaving her swollen tummy bulging out and completely exposed, which Lacus didn't mind at all. If anything, she thought it actually looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. I'm really glad you enjoyed it.\" Kira said as he pried his eyes away from Lacus' stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't want to sound ungrateful but can you -URRP- do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure! What do you want me to do?\" Kira eagerly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me a belly rubs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:Um, hwy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll help my tummy feel better. But I can do it myself if -UUURP- you don't want to, you've already been so nice to me -UUURRRP!-, I can't think poorly of you for not doing this one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem, I'll do it.\" Blushing, Kira slowly reached out his hand and placed it on his friend's huge middle, giving him goosebumps. The two just sat there in awkward silence for a bit, the pilot's hand not moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much time as you need to get ready.\" Lacus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" After a few more seconds, Kira started moving his hand in soothing circles on Lacus' tummy, making the singer sigh in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, UUUURRRP! That feels really good, Kira! UUURRRAP!\" Lacus said, patting her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the start of a regular thing Kira and Lacus would do. Every day Kira would bring tons of food to Lacus, who would happily gobble it all up, giving her a big, stuffed belly that Kira would rub. As the weight pilled on and stomach capacity increased as her appetite did, Kira would keep on bringing her a larger amount of food each time. In a month's time, Lacus had completely fattened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus happily gulped down more and more strawberry ice cream straight from the tub, her fifth tub in fact. Once the last of the ice cream was firmly in her belly, Lacus pulled the container away from her mouth and released a loud and unladylike belch, a huge smile on her round face. Like before, her stuffed belly was freely bulging out. Kira placed a hand on her full tummy and started rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a belly rub -UUUURP- from you is always the best part, Kira. UUUURRRP!\" Lacus complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't think I was that good at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you are. UUURAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was an almost perfectly round orb of soft fat, fittingly shaped like a big scoop of ice cream. It was just as soft as ice cream, which Lacus loved, it wasn't uncommon to see the pinkette feeling up and rubbing her belly. She loved playing with her belly, doing things like jiggling it and shaking it. The orb was also very jiggly and bouncing, as shown whenever Lacus made any movements. The singer loved how jiggly her tummy is, and would sometimes give it a good shake or slap to watch it jiggle like jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus' breasts jutted out almost as much as her belly did, and rested on that orb of fat. Whenever her boobs bounced, they did so in perfect sync with her big belly. The singer's chest would swish and bounce when she danced during her performances. Something like that would embarrass most people in her situation but Lacus paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was made up of two large, squishy spheres of flab, each the size of a basketball. Like her belly and breasts, it bobbed and bounced whenever the singer exerted herself. Her bubblebutt completely filled up any chair she sat down in, to the point that it was practically spilling off the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer impressive butt went along well with her thighs, which were very large and constantly rubbed against each other. They jostled with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus' face was completely round and pie-like, all it's angular features having be replaced with soft fat. Her cheeks were pretty much puffed up, being so round and soft they would fold and bounce whenever the singer let out a bellyful laugh, or a really big burp for that matter. These features, along with her double chin, emphasized how soft Lacus' face was now. Her chubby looks suited Lacus' kind personality, and made her smiles even more heartwarming to Kira and others.</span></div></div>",

Both of your meals shall be out shortly,\u201d the waiter said, giving a bow as he headed back inside the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the blonde and brunette teenagers all alone, which resulted in a bit of an awkward silence between the two. Kira twiddled his thumbs a bit as he looked Cagalli over (discreetly, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he got a good luck at her, he had to say, she looked quite attractive. She wasn\u2019t very tall, but was well-built, with some nice muscle definition and impeccable curves. She had deep brown eyes, shiny blonde hair, and a very flat stomach. While he couldn\u2019t see much else from his position, he could tell that she was quite a knockout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cagalli was looking over Kira, as well. He had a very angular face, messy brown hair, and purple eyes. His stomach was flat, and Cagalli could tell from his physique alone that he was fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kira was getting pretty uncomfortable from just sitting around and doing nothing, and decided to restart a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019re you enjoying things here so far, Cagalli?\u201d he asked, breaking out a charming smile full of white teeth. \u201cAs you can probably tell, the temperature on this colony is always really nice, due to the efficient air control mechanisms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I noticed. It\u2019s really different than where I come from,\u201d Cagalli said. \u201cYou guys have it pretty nice here, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess we do,\u201d Kira said, scratching the back of his head. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve heard there are some pretty amazing places down on Earth. I\u2019ve never spent any major time down there, unfortunately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it really depends on where you go. There are plenty of boring places down there, I can tell you right now,\u201d Cagalli said with a wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then under her breath, she muttered, \u201cAnd who knows how long all those places will last, if the fighting doesn\u2019t stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, however, didn\u2019t catch on to this; he was too busy watching the waiter bring out all their food. He placed the large dishes in front of the two teenagers, and they both looked at their food with hungry eyes. Cagalli, ever-eager to eat, picked up her fork and knife immediately, inhaling the aroma with a greedy glean in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Cagalli, look at all that food you have!\u201d Kira said, pointing his fork at the huge dish. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be able to finish ALL of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis broke Cagalli out of her focus, and she looked to see Kira with a bit of a smirk on his face. This prompted her to put on her own smirk, jabbing her fork in the direction of his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I\u2019m hardly the only one getting my fair share,\u201d she said, an air of superiority about her. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re the one who needs to cut back a bit, Kira!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that lasagna is overlapping with the dumplings! I don\u2019t even know if those two types of food\u2019ll go together in your stomach without making you sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about this? We both eat these meals, and if whoever is able to finish, then that means they haven\u2019t ordered too much,\u201d Kira said, getting his fork and knife ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Well, I know it\u2019ll definitely be me, since I get the feeling your eyes are bigger than your stomach,\u201d Cagalli said defiantly as she prepared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a moment, the two of them got right to eating, at breakneck speeds.  Kira tackled the lasagna like it kicked him in the gut, while Cagalli at attacked her chicken like it was about to destroy her home. Sauce and grease respectively went flying all over the place, coating their mouths and chins with the substances. The two teenagers actually displayed a shocking disregard for manners, so engrossed were they in beating each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about three minutes, the lasagna and chicken were done, leaving the dumplings and bacon-cheese fries. However, before they tackled those, Kira and Cagalli each let out a massive belch to relieve the pressure building up in their guts. Placing a hand on her belly, Cagalli winced as she felt her flat stomach start bloat up a bit with all the food stuffed into the small space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ready to \u2013UUURRP- give up yet, Cagalli?\u201d Kira asked with a confident smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, not on your \u2013UUUURRRRP- life, Kira!\u201d Cagalli said as she picked up her fork and knife to once again dig into her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira wasn\u2019t about to let himself lose, either, and began eating his dumplings with gusto. Cagalli ate her fries, and again, manners were cast to the wind as the two bloated teens continued to stuff their faces with their fattening meals. Eventually, though, they felt the hems of their pants start to strain against their middles, leading them to make a decision\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were raring to show the other just how much they could take, and quitting now wouldn\u2019t contribute to any win for either party. Thus, they proceeded to unbutton both their pants, letting their stomachs surge forward as they began to enter Round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira went for the dumplings, while Cagalli tackled the bacon cheese fries. There were about two dozen dumplings on the brunette\u2019s massive plate, while there were four dozen fries with layers of creamy cheddar cheese and crispy bacon on top, all plunging down their throats. They hardly even chewed, just trying to swallow as much as possible as they shoved as much as they could into their mouths at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to their stuffed states, they were starting to slow down the pace as the dishes started getting emptier and emptier. By the time Kira got down to ten dumplings, and Cagalli was at twenty fries, they were fighting to get the food to their mouths, loud gurgles and rumbles coming from their upset stomachs. They were both beginning to regret this challenge, immensely so, but they continued to persevere, pride egging them on. In the meantime, Cagalli came up with the idea to partake in some smack talk in order to distract herself from her busy stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Kira, looks like you\u2019re \u2013UURRRAAP- slowing down a bit, huh?\u201d she said, swallowing down another few fries. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to just admit defeat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t y-UURRAAP-you?\u201d her opponent said, a cocky grin adorning his visage as he swallowed two dumplings in succession. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve come too far now to just stop. I\u2019m going to show you that Kira Yamato never backs down from a challenge!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, well I\u2019ll believe you once we get to the end of this. If you don\u2019t back down, you\u2019ll get a lot of respect points from me, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the two teens scarfed down their dishes for several more minutes, belabored breathing punctuating their chews and swallows. Finally, there was only dumpling left on Kira's plate and a few fries left on Cagalli\u2019s. At the moment, both Kira and Cagalli were cradling their engorged spheres of stomachs, rubbing and trying to soothe the battles raging within, with minimal success. It was making the idea of eating anymore honestly torturous, and they both had to actively fight the urge to go to the bathroom and losing the entire meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this is *pant* insane,\u201d Cagalli said, continuing to rub her taut gut. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so *pant* full in my \u2013URRP- life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you got that right,\u201d Kira said, putting his hands on the chair to help support himself. \u201cI\u2019m getting really sick\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both knew that this was the final time to make a decision. Would either of them be able to polish off their dishes, or would they both concede defeat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With every little movement, the blonde teen could practically feel all the dishes sloshing around in her tightly-packed dome of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, considering how much you stuffed in there, I\u2019m not too \u2013UURRAAP- surprised,\u201d Kira said, a slight smirk on his face as his own loud belch escaped his lips. \u201cAlthough you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the brunette and blonde looked down at the remaining food in front of each of them, debating what to do next. Was it really a good idea to continue eating, when their stomachs were pretty much full-to-bursting at this point? Were either of their prides worth that much? After looking back up at each other for a moment, both came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, wanna call it \u2013URP-a draw?\u201d Kira asked, a smile creeping onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that sounds good right about now,\u201d Cagalli said, sighing as she leaned back in her chair. She couldn\u2019t help but wince at the creaking sound accompanying the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs were absolutely huge now, perfectly spherical in shape that made them feel as if they each swallowed a giant watermelon apiece. Their buttons were unbuttoned, having to make room for the taut flesh as their guts continued to expand throughout the meal, and their zippers were forced down most of the way due to their feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat around for a minute, trying to let their stomachs digest their meals as well as expel the excess gas from their stomachs, neither of them having the energy to get up and leave. Realizing this meant they\u2019d be with each other a bit longer, Cagalli decided to strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you said your name was Kira? I gotta \u2013URRAAP- say, you can really pack it down!\u201d she complimented, giving a little giggle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve expected it, considering how scrawny you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not scrawny! But\u2026 thanks, you were pretty impressive yourself,\u201d Kira said, blushing a bit. \u201cHonestly, I was kind of afraid you\u2019d beat me by the end there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were \u2018kind of\u2019 afraid?\u201d Cagalli said, giving her belly a light rub. \u201cI think my skills deserved to make you a bit more worried, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, let\u2019s not get carried away there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, excuse me? Ma\u2019am and Mister?\u201d their waiter said as he arrived at their table, an amazed look on his face as he looked at the decimation of all the dishes in front of him, \u201cWould either of you two like the bill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe may not like it, but we\u2019ll have to pay anyways,\u201d Cagalli said, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter took that as his cue to put the bill done and get out of there as humanly possible. He had seen the value that the total charge came out to, and something told him he didn\u2019t want to see that blonde girl angry. Ever, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the waiter jog away, Kira belched before picking up the piece of paper and reading it over. His eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets when he read the total outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is it?\u201d Cagalli asked, trepidation leaking into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kira could finish, both he and Cagalli felt a strange rumbling through the ground. Looking around, they had no idea what it could\u2019ve been. Cagalli\u2019s first thought was that it was a tremor preceding an earthquake, but then she remembered that there was no way a space colony could have one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Kira, but what he said confused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a \u2013UURRRAAP- minute,\u201d he said, swallowing down yet another belch. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me... are they here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s \u2013URAAP- here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked over at her, almost as if he just remembered she was there, before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re-\u201c</span></div></div>",

The table was filled with hamburgers, pizza, and Doner Kebabs among others. Yet despite the sheer amount of food before her, Cagalli had no problem devouring it all, it shocked Athrun a bit even though this was far from the first time Cagalli showed him how good she was at packing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you always have to be so humble?\" Cagalli stated, a tad bit annoyed by her friend's modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I guess it's just the way I am.\" Athrun said with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli sighed. She supposed she should expect this from the bluenette by this point, but she supposed there was another time she could continue to try and beat some changes into his head. In the meantime, there were much more pressing (and painful) things to think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore pressing issues, such as the amount of waistbands the young woman had been blazing through. Cagalli massaged her stomach, the great beast that it was gurgling up a storm after her latest meal. It was a spherical thing, looking as if she had bloated herself with gallons of water. It had folds and rolls clinging onto its sides, forming love handles that served to emphasize just how huge her once toned stomach had truly become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, each swollen with their own deposits of fat, rested atop her stomach. They had grown substantially over time, almost spilling out of any article of clothing the blonde used to try and keep them contained. They hadn\u2019t broken anything yet, but that was only because Cagalli was always dutiful in keeping her wardrobe updated. If she hadn\u2019t been, well\u2026 she would\u2019ve hated to see what people would\u2019ve thought if her tits had visibly been able to spill out of their containment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese large melons were only emphasized by her huge legs and arms, which had all undergone huge increases in circumference as time had gone on. The creamy flesh that covered them had plenty of stretch marks on display, all symbols of her body\u2019s undying fight to keep her expanding figure under control. Cagalli\u2019s appendages completely lacked definition, as was to be expected when junk food ruled one\u2019s diet. They jiggled and jostled with practically any movement the poor soldier made, to the point where Cagalli intentionally tried to limit how much she walked or extended her arms amidst company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier\u2019s ass was also steadily on the rise, accumulating more and more mass seemingly by the day. There was a time when it was quite pert, when one would be hard-pressed to find even a single bit of jiggle present. Nowadays, however, its expanse was so vast and soft, it was hard for Cagalli to even sit down properly in most chairs, let alone keep any sort of rear honed from athleticism. By this point, it was already starting to tear seams into her size XXL jeans, which almost made the blonde retch in disgust anytime she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there was her face. It was quite doughy, to say the least, compared to the lean version that most knew her by. There were hardly any angular features left; like most of Cagalli\u2019s body, fat accumulated in her cheeks and permanently led to her chin becoming a double. It wasn\u2019t to the point where her chin and neck melded into one, but the soldier was still concerned, nonetheless. Problems, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Cagalli had gained so much weight was that she had been stuffing herself with Athrun's delicious cooking. The two had settled down together after the war and now spent most of their time relaxing. While the war had taught them many things, how to cook while one of them, which was a problem since as tasty as ice cream and other snacks were, they didn't want to just eat snacks. So Athrun became a chef, and he turned out to be a rather talented one. Sure, it took a bit of trial and error but it wasn't long before he could absolutely delicious meals. Meals that Cagalli would happily fill up her belly with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli attempted to get up from her chair, which she found difficult, since all the food in her full gut was weighing her down into her seat. After attempting for a few seconds, Cagalli plopped right back into her chair, an irritated look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun gave a friendly chuckle. \"Need a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Cagalli said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling Cagalli up, with a bit of grunting form both of them, Athrun threw her arm over her shoulder and walked her over to the couch. The blonde's large, overfed tummy was pressing against Athrun's slim belly, it actually felt kinda nice to him. The blonde Gundam pilot then planted her ass on the couch and Athrun took a spot next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli rubbed her packed full belly as she and Athrun watched TV, occasionally letting out a large belch. While the massage was helping ease the pain, Athrun could tell that she would probably feel better if he rubbed her gut instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind if if I rub your belly?\" Athrun suggested. This wasn't the first time the blue haired Gundam pilot had given Cagalli a belly rub, in fact, he always gave her one after she finished stuffing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, -URRRP- thanks.\" Cagalli said, a small smile on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun placed her hands on Cagalli's gut and began rubbing the bloated sphere of adipose. The Gundam pilot's massage felt amazing, it filled Cagalli with a soothing warmth as his hands made rhythmic moments on her stomach. The overfed blonde had a pleased grin on her face as she released a loud, satisfied belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit into the massage, Athrun accidentally pressed down slightly on Cagalli's tummy, causing her to belt out a giant belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry about that.\" Athrun stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. UUUURRP!\" Cagalli said, giving her gut a few pats. \"I mean, we are alone.\" The fat blonde capped her statement off with another burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I g-guess that makes sense.\" Athrun responded, plus, burping did get rid of some of the excess gas in his friend's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while into the rub, Athrun had something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cagalli, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Whaddya -URP- mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For...\" Athrun was about to say that \"For making you gain so much weight.\" but he realized that given Cagalli's temper, it would probably be a good idea to avoid calling her fat. \"For stuffing you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize, it's my fault for eating so much.\" Cagalli comforted. She didn't want to admit and she certainly wouldn't say it, but Cagalli knew she was fat. A part of her wished that there was someone she could blame it on but she knew there wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course \u2013UUURRRP- not.\" Cagalli said, smiling warmly. \"Anyways, what's for dinner tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you can even stomach the thought of food after eating all that.\" Athrun stated, he gave a slight pat to Cagalli's stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda am too.\" Cagalli chuckled. She was planning on hitting the gym soon but one last big dinner couldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll make some pasta and chicken.\" Athrun said. he then leaned on his side next to Cagalli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think could -UUUURRP-  make some donar kebabs?\" Cagalli suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gotta have pizza too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some ice cream too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" This was starting to seem like a tall order to Athrun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and -UUUUUURRRRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli accidentally unleashed a massive belch right into Athrun's face. Silence followed it, while Cagalli was fine with letting out some burps, she didn't really much of a choice anyways, burping into Athrun's face was a completely different story. The two looked at each other for a moment, Cagalli's face beat red. After a few seconds of silence, they started giggling, which soon turned into full-on laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Cagalli joked, still laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you've still got your manners!\" Athrun also joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun continued to massage Cagalli's big belly, the blonde letting several more belches. They continued to talk about about a variety of thing until Cagalli fall asleep. Athrun smiled, looking at his bloated friend, her gut moving up and down with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how heavy you are, you're still beautiful, Cagalli.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cagalli cradled her swollen stomach, trying to suppress a belch that was threatening to escape her lips. Looking down, she saw that her stomach had gotten incredibly bloated from the feast, pushing her shirt up by a large extent. Sure, it had already been getting more and more spherical these days, but at least having the rolls she did meant that most meals didn\u2019t leave much of a dent; this one, on the other hand, made her stomach the closest to taut it had been in a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if one took a good look at the blonde, they\u2019d notice that her stomach wasn\u2019t the only area of note. Her ass, for example, had swollen with collected fat from the many binges she\u2019d been having recently, each sphere of flesh filling up the seat so much that they were practically spilling off the sides at this point, which embarrassed the formerly fit blonde to no end. Her butt used to be so perky, but now it had practically lost all its previous definition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest had, by some small consolation, gotten bigger, though. Her boobs were comfortably contained in a bra that her old chest would\u2019ve been far too small to fit into, each sack of creamy flesh full of fat that rested upon her large belly. It sort of acted like a makeshift shelf in that way, and Cagalli was happy to note that part of her shirt\u2019s tightness was because of her chest pressing against the fabric as much as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli\u2019s face was also much chubbier than before, her cheeks having swollen up with fat that met with her fledgling double chin, and overall made her face incredibly soft and inviting, quite a contrast to her formerly intimidating demeanor. It wasn\u2019t exactly a change that the blonde was happy with, but considering the types of changes that could happen with one\u2019s face during wartime, she felt she hardly had room to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn regards to Athrun\u2019s changes, his belly was certainly the most prominent area of change within the past several months. It had gone from firm and flat to a giant sphere of adipose, jiggling and wobbling with practically every substantial move the bluenette made nowadays. It had developed quite the spare tire, and the love handles coalescing around the size were nothing to sneeze at, either. It wasn\u2019t a stretch to say that one could fit quite a variety of objects within those dark folds of flesh. This was on top of the impressive moobs that rested right on top of his giant gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis posterior had also been filling out, not quite as much as Cagalli\u2019s, but still to a noticeable extent. Unlike his blonde friend\u2019s, while it hadn\u2019t spilled over the chair\u2019s sides, it had \u201cmerely\u201d filled up the entire thing, but no more. It was still putting an incredible strain on his somewhat out-of-date pants, the ones that had fit perfectly a few sizes ago, but were sorely inadequate now. The poor guy just hadn\u2019t been able to find the time recently to go clothes-shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was his face, which had chubbed up just as much as Cagalli\u2019s, with cheeks that complimented his softer chin. This was something that was emphasized anytime he laughed, since the fat tended to fold and bounce complimentary to the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Athrun and Cagalli had gained so much weight was that they simply let themselves go. The Bloody Valentine War had ended and the two were now enjoying some well-earned relaxation. The two close friends helped themselves to a lot of good stuff. Movies, TV, video games, and of course, lots of good food. Cagalli and Athrun spent a lot of time lazing about their house, happily eating pizza or ice cream while enjoying a good movie or video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, such a gluttonous lifestyle led to them both gaining a lot of weight. Athrun and Cagalli had just eaten a massive pizza feast and were both completely stuffed. The bloated teens were laying back in the couch, massaging their bloated bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm \u2013UUURRRP- stuffed.\" Cagalli said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me -URP- too.\" Athrun said, patting his bloated gut. \"I couldn't eat another bite. UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one.\" Cagalli complimented, grinning. It was a little funny (and impressive) seeing a guy like Athrun let out a huge burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks.\" Athrun said, blushing. He let out another massive belch as he rubbed his engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how incredibly bloated the two were, Athrun and Cagalli didn't regret eating as much as they did. Stuffing themselves was always fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh~, this was good.\" Cagalli said, letting out another burp as she drummed her fingers on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was.\" Athrun said, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, let's have an eating contest.\" Cagalli said, a competitive smirk on her face. \"Think you can beat me, \u2013UUURRRP- Athrun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. You beat me last time, Cagalli.\" Athrun answered. As much as he loved having eating contest with his blonde friend, he was no match for her. He remembered the first time they had one, back when they were still skinny. Athrun and Cagalli were both completely bloated by the end. They had eaten so much that they both snapped their belts in half and the buttons on their pants had popped off. They both let out some pretty huge burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli was the winner. Since then they had made eating contests a regular thing between them. Athrun has still yet to beat Cagalli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not backing down.\" Athrun said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza again?\" Cagalli asked as she got closer to her overfed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With plenty of ice cream.\" Athrun enthusiastically answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun and Cagalli shoved their big bellies into each other's. Competitive but friendly smirks on their chubby faces. They simultaneously belted out a giant belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun and Cagalli began laughing and got back into more relaxed positions. They looked other their chubby bodies. While they knew the that they had both gotten fat they had never actually talked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know, we really should hit the gym soon.\" Athrun remarked as he rubbed his chubby gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We've really gotten fat.\" Cagalli gave her big tummy a good slap and watched as it jiggled and bounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Kira and Lacus have gotten fat too?\" Athrun asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Lacus really likes stuffing Kira.\" Cagalli said. She remembered how stuffed Kira and Lacus were the last time she and Athrun had dinner with them. She also remembered the belly rubs Lacus gave everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a pretty amazing cook, after all.\" Athrun said. \"Honestly, I think I'd be even fatter if I lived with her.\" The bluenette joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019d all be a lot fatter,\u201d Cagalli smirked, leaning over to her blue-haired friend. \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t think either of us are doing that bad, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Athrun said with a smirk, giving his belly a small rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t be greedy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Cagalli teased. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give yourself a nice belly rub, and leave me out of the action!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Athrun a moment to process what was just said, but when he did, he gave a belly-full laugh. He couldn\u2019t help it, the situation was just too cute not to let something like that out of his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s plenty of this,\u201d here the bluenette wriggled his fingers playfully as he raised his hands into the air, \u201cto go around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, both Cagalli and Athrun began to rub the other\u2019s bellies, relaxing into blissful states as their hands made rhythmic motions around their spheres of adipose. It was heavenly, to put it bluntly. Every so often, Cagalli or Athrun would place just a little more force on the other\u2019s belly, eliciting a belch from their lips. This would be accompanied by giggle fits that\u2019d last for several seconds, followed up by the \u201crevenge\u201d of the same being done to the \u201coffender\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, neither teen could think of a better situation to be in at the moment. Especially after all the hell they went through before, could life get any sweeter? Athrun and Cagalli drift off into deep food comas</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uuuggh\u2026 I think I'm going to explode, Cagalli... URRRAAAP!\" Athrun groaned, cradling his swollen middle. He was leaning on Cagalli for support as they walked into their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you've got a gut tougher then that.\" Cagalli said with a grin, giving her friend's belly a few affectionate pats through the straining fabric of his black jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun had gotten rather chubby recently, in fact he now weighed 208 pounds. Once completely flat and toned, Athrun's stomach was now very large, round, and soft. It was a giant sphere of adipose with plenty of side rolls and a very deep bellybutton. The bluenette's gut would bob and jiggle with every step Athrun made, emphasizing just how absolutely filled with fat it was. Athrun's large belly often made it difficult for the Gundam pilot to zip and button his pants. Even when he wasn't filled to the brim with food, one could still see a sliver of belly flesh poking out from the bottom of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Athrun's butt. No longer was it the toned posterior typical of a soldier, It now was an absolutely huge bubble butt now and jiggled almost as much as his gut. It strained his outdated pants quite a bit and would completely fill up every chair he sat in, with some of it flab even spilling off the sides. His ass would even leave a noticeable imprint on the couch whenever he sat down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were wide and constantly rubbed together. They wobbled with every footfall. Needless to say, Athrun's legs becoming so flabby and chunky meant that they weren't as strong as they used to be, a far cry from what most would expect a soldier to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam pilot also had some sizable man boobs. They were big and jiggly sacks of fat that rested on the top of the bluenette's stomach. If there was one thing most people would never expect to see a Gundam pilot with it was a pair of big man boobs. Yet not only did Athrun have them he was also one of the best pilots there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was Athrun's face. His cheeks that had swollen up with fat and were now very round, soft, and puffy, they met with a small but steadily growing double chin that was also quite soft. These features actually made Athrun's face rather cute in a chubby way, as they empathized just how soft his face was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Athrun's gain had mostly spread evenly, though his gut and ass got just a little bit more fat then the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the cause for such a drastic change to Athrun's body? It was Cagalli, actually. The blonde Gundam pilot had noticed that Athrun wasn't really eating as much as he should and was rather glum and quiet. The first part was the clear result of the war but the other part was regular behavior from him, he always had a small appetite, as Kira explained to Cagalli. Regardless, Cagalli felt that she should help him enjoy himself and eat some more.The first goal was accomplished by hanging out with him more and helping him enjoy himself. While the second one was accomplished by encouraging him to eat more, often by getting him more food without even asking him and taking him out to an All-You-Can-Eat buffet. To say that was success was an understatement, as Athrun's chubbed up body proved. Though Cagalli was willing to admit that she might've gone a little overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli and Athrun had just gotten from an All-You-Can-Eat buffet and Athrun was bloated beyond belief, as he always was when they went to one, thanks to Cagalli's influence. His gut had popped off the button on his pants and the resulting flab that came pouring out forced his zipper all the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli gently laid Athrun down, his well-fed stomach now sticking straight up into the air. The blonde turned on the TV and put on a show she and Athrun liked. She then turned her attention back to her bloated friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, Cagalli unzipped Athrun's jacket and saw his huge gut come bulging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've been working out.\" Cagalli teased before she placed her hands on Athrun's stomach and began rubbing the orb of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Thanks \u2013UURRP- for the rub.\" Athrun let out a moan, feeling the pressure within his gut ease from the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to thank me every time I do this, you know.\" Cagalli said. \"I mean, what is this, the fifteenth time I've rubbed your gut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good \u2013UURRP- point.\" Athrun admitted. He then suddenly let out a loud sigh. \"I've really gotten fat, \u2013UURRAAP- haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's not really that bad a thing.\" Cagalli replied. \"You still look just as good, if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just cuz your gut is keeping you from seeing your feet or your ass is tearing through your pants doesn't you're not still cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't ripped any pants.\" Athrun said in an annoyed voice. \"And thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli continued to rub Athrun's belly, with the bluenette sometime letting out a loud belch. Cagalli also engaged in some belly play, doing things like kneading, patting, and jiggling her friend's large belly, which they both enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later of this, Cagalli had an interesting question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Kira has gotten fat too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble sounded from Athrun's gut and before either of them knew it, a giant belch was emitted from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" Cagalli complimented with an amused grin. It was both funny and impressive seeing a quiet guy like Athrun belt out a huge burp like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks.\" Athrun said with a dorky smile, blushing. He let out another huge burp. \"And to answer your question, I never really thought about Kira getting fat. It's kinds hard to imagine him getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was also hard to imagine you getting fat.\" Cagalli said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Athrun chuckled a bit himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, Lacus was actually stuffing Kira right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, UUURRRRP! Man am I stuffed!\" Kira said as he gave his swollen belly a few pats, his pants unzipped and unbuttoned. \"You're an amazing cook, Lacus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kira! I'm glad you and your belly love my cooking so much.\" Lacus sweetly said before she started rubbing Kira's tummy. A sharp -ding!- sound then caught both their attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! The brownies are done!\" Lacus. \"Do you have room for more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When it comes to your cooking \u2013UURRP- I always have room.\"</span></div></div>",

One didn't even have to hear the moans of satisfaction he was letting out as he ate to tell how much he enjoyed it, just seeing the very pleased look on his face was enough. He quickly finished eating the entire plate of brownies and then rested a hand on his full tummy, letting out a satisfied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was delicious.\" The brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kira.\" Lacus said as she rubbed Kira's tummy. \"You really love filling yourself up with my cooking, don't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. UUURRAAP! I don't know who wouldn't.\" Kira stated. \"Though I might need to cut back on the snacking, I'm really getting fat.\" He then gave his big belly a few pats for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira had gained a lot of weight from the countless times he had gorged himself on his Lacus' cooking. He now weighed 210 pounds, with most of his weight going straight to his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was a huge ball of fat that was incredibly soft and malleable. It was even bigger then Athrun's stomach by a whole inch. Kira's belly was as soft as a pillow, Lacus had even used it as one a few times and felt very comfortable each time. Kira's belly was as jiggly as it was soft. The sphere of fat would jiggle and bob in a gelatinous fashion with every step the well-fed Gundam pilot made. This feature of it was especially prominent whenever the brunette was running. Kira had some noticeable love handles that would become especially pronounced when he sat down. Even when Kira wasn't bloated, his belly would still force his shirt up to just below his deep navel, exposing a noticeable amount of creamy belly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe softness of his tummy made it a very nice thing to knead and play with, something Lacus could attest to. Lacus could often be seen playing with her friend's tummy, doing stuff like jiggling, patting, rubbing, shaking, or kneading it. The pinkette loved feeling and playing with Kira's doughy belly, it made an amazing plaything. Even Kira had to admit that he enjoyed feeling his gut and even messing around with it sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's butt was now big and soft. While it hadn't grown as much as Athrun's, it was still quite big. Kira's bubble butt would jiggle and jostle whenever the brunette walked, emphasizing how big this asset of his was. His butt was also rather soft, without a hint of muscle to it.His legs had also gotten flabbier, making them a bit weaker. Thankfully though, Kira was a Coordinator so the effect wasn't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's chest had grown into a pair of flabby moobs. They were were plush and jiggly sacks of fat that sat on the top of his belly. They squished together whenever the brunette sat down and could often be seen jiggling. If they were only looking at Kira's man boobs and nothing else, some people might mistake them for the female equivalents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after all the battles, Kira's face had always had a certain softness to it, but his weight gain had only amplified it. He now had chubby cheeks that seemed to constantly be puffed full of air and his chin was double-tiered. That wasn't even mentioning the dimples that'd appear whenever Kira smiled, which was happening more and more often nowadays. Lacus couldn't get over how absolutely adorable Kira's face was. She never failed to say just how pinchable his cheeks were, or how much Kira's face could resemble a puppy's whenever he pouted now, much to the young man's chagrin and secret delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Kira, just eat as much as you like.\" Lacus assured as she continued to give Kira's belly a soothing rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but I really need to start losing all this weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually think it doesn't look bad on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. You still look great. And your big belly is really fun to play with.\" Lacus then gave Kira's stomach a little shake to prove her point. All the sudden motion elicited another burp from Kira's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is kinda fun to mess around with.\" Kira admitted, patting his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It totally is.\" Lacus said as she resumed rubbing Kira's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Kira know that Lacus didn't just like playing with his belly, she flat out preferred him fat. While Kira was always very adorable, Lacus found that all the extra weight really worked for him. His round, puffed-up cheeks made his face even sweeter, they were just so increabdly adorable soft his face was. They really suit his sweet personality. Lacus loved Kira's big belly, not only was it very fun to play with, it was very nice to snuggle with and hug. She found all it's jiggling to be very cute. She never got tired of rubbing and kneading her friend's gut. It was a cute big ball that made Kira all the more huggable. The pinkette found the pilot's man boobs to be adorable. She loved how jiggly and soft they were. Sometimes she would give them a playful shake (with Kira's permission of course) watch them bounce from it. The brunette's sizable butt and chunky thighs were also very cute. Much like with Kira's chest and tummy, Lacus loved watching his big butt bob and jiggle. All the weight Kira had gained made him like a giant teddy bear to Lacus. He was certainly just as huggable as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Lacus had never actually told Kira that she preferred him fat. The reason for that is because Lacus had a very well-founded fear that if she told him that, Kira would ignore his own desires and intentionally stay fat, maybe even get fatter. As much as the singer loved his chub, she wanted Kira to have the body he desired. While she did fatten him up with her cooking, it was completely unintentional. Lacus was just simply a very sweet and giving person that loved to cook and Kira really loved the meals she made him. Combinations like that had all too often resulted in someone plumping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she loved how fat he had gotten, Kira wanted to lose weight so Lacus was going to help him. After all, he still looked just as adorable when he was skinny, just in a different way. That said, she wasn't going to let him skip out on any meals. He still has a belly to fill up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I really want to \u2013UURAP- lose all this weight.\" Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help. Just don't skip any meals or I'll make you eat the biggest cake known to man!\" Lacus half-jokingly said with her usual sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, \u2013UUURRAP- I won't.\" Kira assured. He couldn't help but wonder how big such a cake would actually be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus continued to soothingly rub Kira's bloated belly, with Kira sometimes letting out a mighty belch. Of course, Lacus didn't just rub her friend's tummy, she did all sorts of belly play with it. She kneaded, jiggled, pat, and even shook it a few times. Occasionally, she would poke deep into Kira's tummy, forcing the brunette to burp loudly. The burp would usually cause Lacus and Kira to giggle, with Kira usually blushing a bit as well. Lacus found it absolutely adorable how Kira is such a sweet and gentle guy and yet he was still capable of letting out some pretty loud burps. The blush he often sported on his chubby cheeks after burping made it even cuter.</span></div></div>",

I'm \u2013UUURRRP- stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue Ramius and Flay Allster reclined further back into their seats, rubbing their bloated bellies. They had just finished eating a massive dinner in Murrue's room and had the guts to prove it. Murrue's and Flay's bellies had grown so large that they managed to break their belts in half as well pop off the buttons on their skirts. Needless to say, Murrue and Flay were pretty embarrassed by how large they bellies had gotten. Blushes appeared on both of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time they had stuffed themselves. Murrue and Flay had both resorted to over-eating to keep their minds off of the stressful situation they were in. Murrue would often fill herself up with tons of ice- cream, pizza, and hamburgers along with many other different types of food. Flay had recently entered a relationship with Kira. As such, she would cook up delicious and fattening meals for them to eat together. Murrue and Flay gained a lot of weight from their gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue weighed 217 lbs., while Flay weighed 213 lbs and they had the bodies one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue's belly was now large and spherical. It jiggled and bounced with every step the chubby captain took. It completely filled up her lap whenever she sat in the captain's chair. Her butt had also gotten much fatter. Murrue's ass was now a bubble butt that jiggled almost as much as her gut and made getting into the captain's chair a little more difficult. Murrue's already large chest had also gotten bigger and now rested atop of her big gut. The brunette's face was quite a bit plumber now. Murrue's cheeks were much more cherubic and a double chin had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay had a big, soft, jiggly tummy. The orb of adipose was responsible for busting off two buttons on one of her old shirts. The redhead's butt had gotten much bigger, to the point that it completely filled out whatever chair Flay sat in. Flay now sported chunky thighs that rubbed together whenever she walked and would wobble with every step the overfed redhead took. Flay's boobs had gotten noticeably bigger, which was the only thing about her weight gain the redhead didn't mind. Her face was much softer, with chubby cheeks and a small double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the Archangel had larger uniforms available for Flay and Murrue that fit them well. Of course, it was a completely different story when they were bloated.The lower and mid parts of Flay's and Murrue's uniforms were completely open as they massaged their big bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is \u2013UURRP- Kira doing?\" Murrue asked as she rubbed her overfed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing well.\" Flay answered as she gave her engorged belly a few pats. \"He's sleeping off a nice big \u2013UUURRRP- meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. He's earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue and Flay weren't the only ones gaining weight, Kira had gotten pretty fat too. While he had also taken to comfort food, his weight gain was in no small part due to the meals Flay made him. Really, the entire crew of the Archangel had gotten fat, even Natarle, the last person anyone expected to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay let out a small burp as she massaged her stuffed gut. This gave Murrue the inspiration for a way to help Flay relax, the reason she had invited the redhead to dinner. Though she was aware that it was more then a little... unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty weak, Flay.\" Murrue teased, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Is that a challenge?\" Flay asked, a competitive smirk on her face. It didn't show often but the redhead had a competitive side to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP! It is now.\" Murrue responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Am I interrupting something?\" Natarle said as she entered the room, a bottle of soda and a folder in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatarle hoped she did a good job of hiding her chubby belly. The brunette had no idea how she had gotten so fat. She now weighed around  221 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatarle had a large belly that manged to break her old belt in half. Natarle's gut would jiggle and bounce whenever she walked, which embarrassed her to no end. Natarle's butt had lost all it's tone and was now a large bubble butt that jiggled almost as much as her gut. The brunette's boobs had also seen some growth, they were almost as big as Murrue's. A massive blush would appear on Natarle's face whenever her breasts jiggled, usually due to the Archangel taking a bad hit. Natarle's face was now adorned with more round and soft cheeks and a double chin. Normally,these features would've made Natarle appear much less intimidating, but the brunette's personalty and demeanor more then made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We're just about to see who can burp the loudest.\" Murrue explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, well I need to get your thoughts on this new information.\" Natarle handed the folder to Murrue before drinking from her bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Natarle.\" Murrue said. \"I'll take a look at it later.\" The brunette placed the folder under a nearby lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Flay?\" Murrue asked. She could feel a belch coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Flay enthusiastically answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue fist bumped her chest as she prepared to belt out a massive belch. \"UUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.\" Flay complimented. \"UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatarle watched in silence as Murrue and Flay continued to belt out some of the loudest burps she had ever heard. She was completely disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue and Flay smiled at each other as they felt their bellies gurgle. They needed to burp and it was going to be a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue and Flay simultaneously belted out a massive belch. They soon burst out laughing. It was a bellyful laugh that lasted for a good ten ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatarle decided to say something, disgusted by Murrue's and Flay's powerful belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! This is clearly \u2013UUUUUUUUURRAAAAAAAAAP-!\" But then she accidentally cut her own sentence off by unleashing a belch bigger than the rest. Natarle immediately slapped her hands over her mouth, blushing up a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-E-Excuse me.\" Natarle uttered as she pulled her hat down over her face, hoping to hide her blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was amazing, Natarle!\" Murrue complimented as she gave her friend a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you, c-captain.\" Natarle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, we could have a burping contest together. Or maybe an eating contest.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"T-Thank you for the o-offer, captain. A-Anyways, I'll discuss the new information with you later.\" As soon as she was done speaking, Natarle immediately walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue and Flay laughed at Natarle's dorkiness. The two then chatted for a while about a number of different things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Fl \u2013URP -Flay.\" Murrue said as she idly drummed her belly. \"Are you planing on doing anything with Kira tomorrow? UUUURRRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natarle let out a loud burp as she laid down in bed rubbing her bloated middle, a blush quickly appeared on her face. The brunette apologized for her unladylike burst of gas. She looked at the large orb of adipose that was responsible for snapping her belt in half, she had completely stuffed herself again. She had only intended to eat just one bowl of ice cream but she ended up eating over twenty of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another binge \u2013UUURRRP-! Excuse me. Another belt broken.\" Natarle noted as she slapped her fat gut and watched in embarrassment and horror as it jiggled and wobbled from the impact. This was the fifth belt the chubby Ensign's big tummy had broken and she had no doubt that it wouldn't be the last. \"We're supposed to be soldiers, not competitive eaters! So why did we all get so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was the first one to gain weight. He would regularly stuff himself full with tons of junk food like potato chips, hot dogs, burgers, cookies, and ice cream as way to cope with his situation. It wasn't uncommon to see the brunette with a big, stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira started a relationship with Flay, who would often cook him delicious and absolutely massive feasts for him to eat to help him cope with all the stress he was under. Kira's tummy would be huge after every meal and Flay would always give it a relaxing and soothing rub. Needless to say, Kira's relationship with Flay resulted in him getting a lot fatter. Flay also ended up getting fatter, spending so much time with Kira lead to them sharing their gigantic meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about Kira and Flay lead Natarle to wonder what they were doing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Flay, how long have you and Kira known each other?\" Lacus asked, her usual sweet smile gracing her chubby face and Flay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only became friends after we started serving on the Archangel.\" Flay said. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious.\" Lacus answered. \"By the way, I have got to say, your cooking is really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus, Kira, and Flay, were going to have a little party as a way to relax. Since Lacus and Flay were both great chefs, they baked a massive feast for all three of them to stuff themselves to the brim with. Lacus was the one who came up with the idea, and while it was a little odd to hold a party aboard a warship, Kira and Flay couldn't deny that it did sound like something they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite technically being enemies with the crew of the Archangel, Lacus was as kind and friendly to them as she was to everyone she had met, which is to say very kind and friendly. The pinkette had grown to become close friends with Kira and would often bake him lots of yummy food for him to enjoy. It wasn't surprising that Kira and Lacus become fast friends. After all, they were both huge dorks with a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Flay said in a irritated tone. Flay held a strong dislike of Coordinators due to her father being killed by them and Lacus was no exception. Despite this, the redhead restrained herself, as Lacus was still Kira's friend. Lacus was aware of how Flay felt but she didn't hold it against her, she understood why Flay felt the way she did. Lacus firmly believed that she and Flay would become friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira is going to love all the yummy food we made him!\" Lacus happily said with a big, dorky smile on her face. \"I know our bellies will too!\" Lacus giggled as she gave her gigantic gut a big slap, she watched with amusement as it jiggled and wobbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing in at 221 lbs., Lacus was a very chubby girl. She had a big tummy that was incredibly soft and malleable. The large orb of adipose would jiggle and bounce with every step she took. The chubby singer absolutely loved playing with her big belly and how jiggly it was. She would often give it a good shake just to see how much it jiggled. Lacus would sometimes give Kira a friendly belly bump, resulting in quite a lot of jiggling form both their guts. Kira was surprised by how much he enjoyed bumping bellies with Lacus. Lacus had a bubblebutt that was just as jiggly as her gut, it was big enough that it completely filled up any chair she sat down in, to the point that it was practically spilling off the sides. This large ass went along well with her thighs, which were very large and constantly rubbed against each other. Lacus' boobs were very big and jiggly, one could often see them swaying about during her performances. It wasn't an uncommon sight to see the spheres of flesh bounce whenever the pinkette exerted herself. Something like that would embarrass most people in her situation but the singer paid it no mind. Lastly, Lacus' face was also quite pudgy. Her cheeks would very chubby and soft, practically puffed up in appearance. The singer's face also a double-chin that was also quite soft. All this helped to make her look like the nice person to cuddle with that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late. I had to work on the Strike.\" Kira said as he walked in, his gut was the first thing to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was a lot bigger then he was during his days at Heliopolis. The Gundam pilot now weighed 219 lbs., with most of his weight going straight to his gut. Kira now had a big, jiggly belly that was incredibly soft and almost completely spherical. This made Kira's tummy made a very nice pillow, something Flay and Lacus could attest to. The brunette's giant gut would jiggle and wobble with every footfall he made. The orb of fat was especially jiggly whenever Kira was running or when he was piloting the Strike Gundam. Next was Kira's chest. The brunette now had an impressive pair of soft moobs that rested atop his tummy. The jiggling sacks of flab were far from what most would expect to a soldier of the Earth Alliance to have, especially the pilot of the Strike Gundam. Yet Kira was proof that one could have man boobs and still be an incredibly formidable pilot. Then there was Kira's ass, which was now a giant bubblebutt that that was almost as jiggly as his gut. The brunette's ass was responsible for breaking a few chairs and was one of the factors that made the Strike Gundam's cockpit rather snug until it was resized. The Gundam pilot had also had some meaty and soft thighs. Normally it would've made made them noticeably weaker but Kira was a Coordinator so it didn't effect him much. And lastly, there was Kira's face. He sported a big double chin, and his cheeks were puffy and soft, which suit his kind and gentle personality. The extra chub Kira's face had actually made him rather cute. Sure, he was always cute but now he was chubby cute\u2122.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\" Lacus stated with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't keep you two waiting for long.\" Kira said as as he sat down in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you didn't.\" Flay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hungry teens' stomachs growled in hunger. While this caused Kira and Flay to blush slightly, Lacus rubbed her large belly in anticipation of their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I'd say you came at the perfect time.\" Flay joked, placing a hand on her middle for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to fill up your belly with all the yummy food me and Flay made?\" Lacus said as she affectionately gave Kira's belly a few pats, unintentionally annoying Flay in the processes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I know that anything you two cook tastes amazing.\" Kira said, taking in the sight of the feast before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three obese teens began chowing down, filling their bellies with lots of delicious food. While Kira and Flay wanted to lose the weight all their binging caused them to gain, tonight they were going to enjoy themselves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Watching Kira stuff himself reminded Flay of the first time the Gundam pilot stuffed himself silly, back when they were both skinny. Kira had just finished a difficult battle and was absolutely exhausted. Like she usually did, Flay joined him not long after he had exited the cockpit of the Strike Gundam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kira?\" Flay didn't even have to look at him for ten seconds to realize that he was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I-I'm fine.\" Kira answered. \"I just need to lay down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's fine.\" As if on cue, Kira's belly rumbled. The brunette blushed as he placed a hand on his middle, chuckling and grinning sheepishly. Flay let out a friendly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Flay, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring you some food in just a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning to his room and changing back into his causal clothes, Kira collapsed onto his bed. His mind was filled with thoughts about what was to come, nearly every battle he participated in exhausted him yet he continued to willingly defend the Archangel and with it his friends. Ironically, that meant he would have to fight one of his friends, Athrun. The Gundam pilot hoped that things could go back to normal when the war ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Kira.\" Flay's words snapped Kira's out of his thoughts. As he sat up, he saw that his redheaded friend was carrying a large amount of food in her arms. \"Plenty of food to fill your stomach with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks, Flay. I wasn't expecting you to bring that much food.\"  Kira said as Flay placed the food down. It looked really good, ice cream, potato chips, brownies, cookies and pretzels were just some of the food Flay brought him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, I even baked some of it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually only started a few days ago but don't worry, I made sure my cooking is good.\" Flay assured. Kira noticed that she sounded a little more upbeat then usual, it looked like cooking helped to take her mind off of things. Whatever the reasons, Kira was pretty happy to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you start with the cookies? I really want to see what you think of my cooking.\" Flay asked as she placed a plate of cookies on Kira's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kira took a bite out of one of the cookies and his face lit up in joy. \"These are really good, Flay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay breathed a sigh of relief. \"Think you, Kira. I was really worried you weren't going to like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I like them? They're great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Kira long to gobble up the rest of the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. You sure know how to bake cookies, Flay.\" Kira said, giving his stomach a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Now, are you ready for some brownies, Kira?\" Flay said, holding up a plate of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Kira began happily devouring the brownies and soon finished the entire plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're a really great cook, Flay URP!\" Kira began blushing. \"Excuse me. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay let out a friendly giggle. \"It's fine, Kira. I'm really just glad that you like my cooking so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is really great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira then began eating a tub of ice cream. As he shoveled more and more scoops of ice cream into his mouth, his gut grew bigger and bigger, this did not go unnoticed by Flay. For some reason, she couldn't take her eyes off it. Kira released another burp as soon as he swallowed the last scoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your, uh, stomach has gotten a little bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked down at his stomach and discovered that what Flay said was true. His belly was now a small round ball filled with food. Kira poked his gut, as if to confirm that it was really there. It felt so weird to have a bigger belly, his gut was usually completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... T-This is new.\" Kira was blushing as he ran a hand over his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do you want to stop eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira thought about it for a bit. While he was concerned about his weight, Kira wanted to enjoy his break as much as he could and he could tell that Flay wanted him eat a little more, since she was worried about how he had been letting work get in the way of eating. And it's not like he couldn't lose the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could go for a little bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he ended up eating everything Flay had brought him. Kira's gut was absolutely huge now and completely spherical, making him look and feel like he had swallowed a giant watermelon. Kira's stomach had no problem pushing up his now too-small shirt enough that its function was voided entirely.The button on his pants popped off halfway through his binge and his gut pushed his zipper down, exposing a bit of his underwear. The stuffed Gundam pilot groaned as he laid down in his bed and rubbed his swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Sorry, Flay.\" Kira said as he blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Kira.\" Flay said as she placed her hands on Kira's big gut and began rubbing the taut orb. \"This will help you digest. Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y \u2013UURRP- Yeah.\" Kira answered, giving his stomach a few pats. \"I'm just stuffed, that's all. This was really fun, thanks for all the food, Flay.\" The overfed brunette had a small smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. I actually didn't think you would be able to eat it all.\" Flay was grinning herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either, heh heh!\" Kira gave his belly a light slap for emphasis. \"UUUUURRRRP! Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay continued rubbing Kira's stomach as he continued to let out mighty belches. Eventually, Kira and Flay fell asleep as they snuggled together. Since then, Kira and Flay would often stuff themselves with massive meals that Flay would make, though some of it were snacks like potato chips they brought. By the end of every feast, they bellies were very large, completely filled up with food and drinks. Needless to say, their gluttony resulted in them becoming much fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, an incredibly loud belch snapped Flay out of her thoughts. She looked over at Kira and realized that it came from him. The pudgy brunette was blushing pretty heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Kira!\"  Lacus said, much to Kira's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" Kira replied, confusion evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Flay, Kira, and Lacus continued to shovel more and more food into their mouths, their belles grew bigger and bigger. Unfortunately, their clothes didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira grunted, he felt some discomfort around his belly, the cause was that the waistband of his pants was too tight, his belly had grown too big for it from all the binging he had done. Lacus and Flay noticed Kira's discomfort as he looked down at his bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something bothering you, Kira?\" Lacus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Kira answered. A slight blush appeared on his face as he continued. \"My, uh, p-pants are just a little tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fix that.\" Lacus said. The obese pinkette then unbuttoned Kira's pants for him. Needless to say, this caused Kira and Flay to blush heavily. Being a bit of a ditz, Lacus didn't realize how sexual unbuttoning Kira's pants would look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Flay was furious at Lacus and immediately decided that she would \"one up\" her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot the zipper.\" The redhead said as she unzipped Kira's pants completely, exposing his underwear. Needless to say, Kira's and Flay's blushes only intensified, their faces scarlet red. They both stared at each other in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call, Flay!\" Lacus said. \"Felling better now, Kira?\" She was completely oblivious as to why this would be embarrassing. After all, they were just helping Kira feel comfortable, it's not like they were actually doing something sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, y-yeah, thanks.\" Kira stuttered out. He could barely believe what even happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus smiled, but she noticed that her two friends seemed to be turning into ripe tomatoes. Still smiling, Kira saw the pink-haired singer begin to make the motions of getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys alright? Your cheeks are all red.\" Lacus asked. \"If you're hot I could turn on the AC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, y-yeah, that'd be great. T-Thanks.\" Kira hastily said as he and Flay got back into their regular positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, it is pretty hot in here.\" Flay said in hopes that they could get back to eating and forget this ever happened.</span></div></div>",

Pizza, cake, ice cream, potato chips, soda, and hot dogs among others all entered their growing bellies. Eventually, they finally finished their feast and they all felt like they would explode. Kira, Flay, and Lacus each released a massive belch, signaling an end to their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies were massive, round balls stuffed to the brim with food. Their shirts had all ridden up, completely showing their giant bellies. Kira, Lacus, and Flay each rubbed their big bellies as they let out huge belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, UUUURRRP! That was \u2013URP- good.\" Lacus said with a pleased smile as she rubbed her big gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe \u2013UUURRRP- I ate that much.\" Flay groaned as she gave her overfed stomach a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever be hungry \u2013UUUURRRRP- again\u2026 uuuggh\u2026\" Kira said, giving his big belly a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was laying down on his couch, his gigantic stomach sticking up in the air as it moved up and down with every one of Kira's labored breaths. Lacus was lounging on the other end whilst Flay leaned against the end Kira was on, too full to heave herself onto it. The three fatties choose to get into more comfortable positions as they let their tummies digest their feast, though their heavy stomachs made actually getting over to the couch a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have an \u2013UURRRP- eating contest someday.\" Lacus suggested, idly using her stuffed belly as a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I could beat you two.\" Flay stated. With a belly this full, she didn't even want to talk about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see. You up for it, \u2013UUURRP- Kira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble sounded from Kira's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds like fun. But it'll be a while before I can eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Kira meant to say but something else ended up leaving his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira accidentally released an absolutely massive belch. His burp was so incredibly loud that it caused the room itself to shake. A few seconds of silence followed it, Kira's face was beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing, Kira!\" Lacus excitedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It-It was?\" Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's gotta be the biggest burp I've ever heard!\" The singer clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, thanks.\" Kira said with a dorky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now, let's what I can do.\" Lacus said as she drummed her big belly, preparing to belt out a big burp. \"UUUUUURRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese singer then started giggling and Kira soon began chuckling himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Lacus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, I didn't expect that from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full of surprises, Kira.\" Lacus replied. \"And big burps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus and Kira then looked expectantly at Flay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The redhead asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Lacus asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay took the hint. \"\"I'll pa \u2013UUUURRRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay immediately slapped a hand over her mouth and began blushing up a storm. A few seconds of silence passed before they all burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\" Lacus complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really good, Flay.\" Kira said, a sheepish smile on his face. \"It feels so weird telling a girl how good she is at burping.\" He mentally added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Flay said, a warm smile on her face. She couldn't really explain it but for some reason, she didn't feel embarrassed.</span></div></div>",

Though readjusting to a normal life after spending so much time fighitng a seemingly endless war wasn't exactly the easiest thing in the world. It didn't help that Kira was already having some trouble doing that before the second war broke out. Luckily, he was living with Lacus, who knew just the thing to brighten up his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was current sitting on the bench he and Lacus had on the front porch of their house, staring out into the distance as memories flooded his mind. At the same time, Lacus had just finished baking a delicious meal for the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kiiira \u266a. I baked some yummy pies for you!\" Lacus said to her boyfriend from the kitchen, snapping him out of his day dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll be right there.\" Kira said before he got up and walked to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was surprised to see five whole pies on the kitchen table, all waiting to fill up Kira's hungry belly. \"Wow, Lacus, this looks delicious.\" He said as pulled up a chair and sat down in it. \"But, uh... don't you think you made a little too much for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll eat whatever you don't finish.\" Lacus answered. \"Besides, I've seen how much you love my cooking, I don't think you'll have any trouble eating them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you do always bake amazing food.\" Kira said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus giggled. \"Thanks! Now eat up, your tummy needs a lot more food in it.\" The pink-haired singer gave Kira's flat tummy a few friendly pats for emphasis, a sweet smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, Kira began to happily eat the pies Lacus had made him. Just as he expected, they tasted absolutely wonderful, just like everything else Lacus baked. One could easily tell how much Kira was enjoying his meal solely from the moans of joy he made and the pleased smile he wore as he ate more and more. Lacus ate her own regularly sized meal as she watched Kira eat and talked with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, five pies is a lot for one person to eat, especially someone as skinny as Kira, yet the delicious taste was all he needed to eat all five. As he continued to devour more and more pie, his belly grew bigger and rounder. Kira didn't notice this, as he was too caught up in enjoying his meal. Lacus, however, did notice but she didn't say anything as she didn't want anything to get in the way of Kira enjoying his meal. Plus, she felt he looked cute with a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kira had finally eaten all five pies, Kira's tummy had ballooned into a huge ball of fat that made him looked like he had swallowed a giant watermelon. It's large size forced his shirt to ride up to just below his chest, leaving his round belly completely bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, man, I'm stuffed. UURRAAP!\" Kira said as he leaned back in his chair, resting his hands on now big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, hee hee!\" Lacus giggled as she looked at Kira's satisfied tummy before looking back at the brunette's face. \"So how was it?' The pinkette already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was de \u2013UUUURRP- licious! Just like everything you cook.\" Kira answered with a pleased smile, giving his stomach a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see that you and your belly loved the meal so much!\" Lacus said with a pleased smile. \"And you didn't think you eat it all!\" The pinkette teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira let out a little chuckle as she scratched the back of his head. \"I should've \u2013UURRP- realized I can never leave something you baked for me uneaten. I'm gonna go lay down on the \u2013URP- couch and digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffed brunette then attempted to stand up but was stopped by his now much heavier stomach, surprising him. He then tired again for a few seconds before giving up and sitting back down, panting a bit from the exhaustion. Lacus giggled at the cute sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you mind helping me get up?\" Kira's cheeks were turning a bit red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus then got up and walked over to Kira. The brunette extended his hand, which Lacus grabbed and after a few seconds of grunting was lifted up. The couch wasn't far away but walking, or rather waddling, to it wouldn't be easy for Kira to do in his bloated state. So the singer had him throw his arm on her shoulder and she then helped him walk over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus gently laid Kira back on the couch, his packed-full middle sticking straight up in the air, gurgling and bubbling up a storm as it struggled to digest all the food it had been filled with. With a kind smile, Lacus undid the buckle on his top and his pants' button, as well as undid his pants' zipper, causing Kira's stomach to bulge out a good inch further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiting down next to her overfed friend, Lacus placed her hands on Kira's big belly and began rubbing the pale orb. Kira let out a moan of pleasure as he felt the discomfort in his stomach be replaced with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAP! Thanks for the \u2013URRAP- belly rub, Lacus.\" Kira said before another burp escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Lacus gave Kira's belly a few pats. \"Your big belly is so cute, Kira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cu \u2013URP- Cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's like a big pillow or a beanbag chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked at his stomach, which was looming over him. \"I guess it kinda is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pink then hopped up on Kira's round middle, the impact causing the brunette to let out an \"Oof!\", the pink Haro didn't weigh much but Kira's tummy was very sensitive right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Mr. Pink thinks so too.\" Lacus commented, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending some time rubbing Kira's taut tummy, Lacus laid down on her side next to Kira, still contentedly rubbing the packed sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot better now. Thanks to \u2013UUUURRRAAP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira cut himself off by accidentally belting out a giant belch right into Lacus' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Sorry! I'm so sorry, Lacus!\" Kira was blushing furiously. \"I-I-I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus then unleashed an equally loud burp herself. Unlike Kira, she did this intentionally, as such she turned her face away from Kira and towards the ceiling. This was her way of helping Kira feel less embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me.\" Lacus giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira started giggling with her.</span></div></div>",

Much to Kira's surprise, it had turned out that Lacus had also baked five pies for herself, seeing no reason why she shouldn't indulge more and enjoy herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very easy to see that the two were greatly enjoying their dinner, the pleased expressions they bore and the moans of joy they made as they ate more and more were a very clear sign of this. Of course, five pies is a lot for Kira and Lacus to eat, especially given how skinny they were, but they tasted so wonderful that the two of them had no problem eating all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kira and Lacus ate more and more pie, their bellies grew bigger and rounder. Kira was too caught up in on his meal and conversations with Lacus to notice this, but Lacus certainty did. Most girls would've been a little worried if they saw that their and their boyfriend's stomachs were slowly taking on the shape of a big Haro, but Lacus wasn't like most girls. She decided not to bring it up so nothing would get in the way of Kira enjoying himself. Plus, she felt he looked cute with a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kira and Lacus finished their dinner, their bellies had ballooned into huge balls of fat that made them look like they each had swallowed a giant watermelon. Their guts were filling up their laps. Kira's tummy was so big that it forced his shirt to ride up to just below his chest, leaving his round belly completely bare. Lacus' tummy was pressing against her sash with all it's might, convincing the pinkette that it was time for her to free her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, man, I'm stuffed. UUURRRP!\" Kira said as he leaned back in his chair, resting his hands on his now big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRP! Me too!\" Lacus leaned back in her chair and undid her sash, allowing her big belly to come bulging out, the overfull singer sighed in pleasure. \"Mmm, that was so yummy! UUUURRRP!\" Lacus said as she gave her happy belly a few loving pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" Kira replied, rubbing his stomach. \"It was de \u2013UUUURRP- licious! Just like everything you cook.\" The brunette said with a pleased smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kira. Our bellies certainly enjoyed it.\" Lacus said as she reached he right hand out to Kira and gave his stuffed belly a few loving rubs for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, looks like it.\" Kira said with a nervous smile as he looked down at his full stomach, his cheeks getting a bit red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't think you'd \u2013UURRAAP- eat it all!\" Lacus teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira let out a little chuckle as she scratched the back of his head. \"I should've \u2013UURRP- realized I can never leave something you baked for me uneaten.

URRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffed brunette and pinkette then tired to get up but were weighed down by their packed full middles. They then made another attempt that lasted for a few seconds of grunting  before they had to plop back down, still panting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should've expected that, hee hee!\" Lacus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Kira stated, his cheeks turning a bit red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus made another attempt at getting up and after a few seconds of struggling, she succeeded. Kira made another attempt as well but despite his efforts, he had to give and sit back down, panting a bit from the exhaustion. Lacus giggled at the cute sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you mind helping me get up?\" Kira's cheeks were turning a bit red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Lacus walked over to Kira and extended her hand, which Kira grabbed and after a few seconds of grunting was lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overfed teens then walked over to the couch, leaning on each for support. Though it was more of an awkward waddle, since their stuffed bellies were throwing them off-balance. When they sat down, Lacus turned on the TV and put on a show she and Kira liked, the singer then turned her attention to Kira's stomach. With a kind smile, Lacus undid the buckle on his top and his pants' button, as well as undid his pants' zipper, causing Kira's stomach to bulge out a good inch further. The Gundam pilot sighed in pleasure from the pressure that left his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacus placed a hand on Kira's big belly and began rubbing the pale orb. Kira belched in pleasure as he felt the discomfort in his stomach be replaced with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAP! Thanks for the \u2013URRAP- belly rub, Lacus.\" Kira said before another burp escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Lacus gave Kira's belly a few pats, eliciting another burp from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of having his stomach rubbed, Kira heard Lacus let out a loud burp as well as her stomach let out a loud gurgle, leading to some giggling from the singer. Kira looked as his girlfriend's equally bloated tummy, it was easy to forget given upbeat she was, but Lacus was feeling just as swollen as he was, her aching stomach in need of some belly rubs. Kira placed a hand on the packed orb and started rubbing it, Lacus moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not as good as you are but I hope I can help you feel better.\" Kira was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRAP! Oh, don't worry Ki \u2013UURRAP- ra, you're doing a really good job. UUUURRRRP!\" Lacus was starting to blush herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two lazed about for a while, burping, talking, and watching TV as their hands made gentle circles on the surface of each other's big bellies. Most of the belches they let out where loud, some of them for where even loud enough to send vibrations through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna bump bellies?\" Lacus suggested, puffing her stomach out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? W-Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Lacus admitted. \"I just thought it seemed fun, since we've both got some cute big bellies. So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... sure. I guess it sounds kinda fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens then stopped rubbing each other's stomach and got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Lacus asked with an excited grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Kira said, sporing a very similar grin. He wasn't really sure why he was all of a sudden just as excited as his pink-haired girlfriend. He decided to chalk it up to her charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. 1,2,3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira and Lacus then bumped their stuffed bellies, the contact immediately forced them to unleash a gigantic belch in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"More doner kebabs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Cagalli said, a greedy smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun chuckled. Even though Cagalli had just gotten done polishing off eight dishes of food, he knew she was going to say yes. On top of a huge gut, his lover had grown quite the appetite. That was kinda his fault, something he knew. Having settled down together after the end of the Second Bloody Valentine War, Athrun started learning how to cook, as Cagalli told him that she wasn't \"really cut out for that sorta stuff\", which didn't surprise him. Athrun quickly learned how to cook, and Cagalli found his meals to be pretty damn good. Trying his best to be a good boyfriend to Cagalli as a way to make up for his actions during most of the war, in fact he was trying too hard according to Cagalli, he would constantly cook \"Surprise Meals\" as he called it, for Cagalli. They tasted good but Athrun was cooking too many Surprise Meals and Cagalli soon found herself too full to eat another bite. For most people she would've simply told them to slowdown on the food, but the blonde just simply couldn't turn down Athrun's cute dorky face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this constant eating had the expected results on Cagalli's figure. She had a big, belt busting belly that would jiggle and bounce with every step she made. It was just as soft as it was jiggly, Athrun had used it a nice place to rest his head a few times. It had popped off the buttons of many of Cagalli's pants after a huge meal. Cagalli loved to playfully bump Athrun with it. It pressed against the hem of her pants with all it's tubby might, which was barely able to contain her plentiful belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam pilot's boobs had gotten bigger, the creamy sacks of flesh now contained in a bra that was formally one cup size too big for her to wear. Cagalli took a bit of pride in how tight some of her old shirts felt because of her bigger breasts, as well as how jiggly the fleshy orbs were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer behind was huge, each cheek a basketball of fat that strained her outdated pants. Cagalli's butt was almost as bouncy as her belly and so large it would leave an imprint on her couch whenever she planted her ass down on it, which was often these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were chunky and wide, with barley any separation between them when she was standing. Very clearly not suited for a soldier's career. It was a good thing she wasn't one anymore, besides, playing video games and snacking was much more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli now had cute chubby cheeks that were very round and soft, making her look like she always holding her breath. She had a slight double chin that would go from small to big whenever she looked down. Cagalli's face was just as beautiful as ever, just in a chubby fashion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli and Athrun took the blonde's huge weight gain rather well. Of course she was initially embarrassed and frustrated when she noticed she was starting to gain a potbelly but she soon started to not really mind being chubby that much. Cagalli wouldn't say she liked being fat, but she did certainly like being able to eat all she wanted without giving a damn about how big she was. Athrun found Cagalli to still be very beautiful, like she always. Cagalli sometimes enjoyed teasing him by jokingly calling him a chubby chaser. The bluenette was always ready to give Cagalli's belly some good rubs when she was stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that hit the -UUUURRRP- spot.\" Cagalli said as she leaned back into the couch, her pants unbuttoned and unzipped, and her sash opened, leaving her fully gorged stomach hanging out freely. She was using her belly as a makeshift drum. \"An orb-shaped belly for Orb's Chief Representative, UUUUURRRP! That's pretty fitting.\" Cagalli gave her stomach a hearty slap for emphasis, the impact making it jiggle violently, and causing her to let out another huge burp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun sat down next to the blonde and started rubbing her sphere of adipose. \"You're also living up to your nickname, seeing how you've got the appetite of a lioness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault your cooking is so good.\" Cagalli joked. \"You mind going a little lower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthrun moved his hands from the top of Cagalli's stomach to it's center, easing more of the pressure that was built up there from all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAP! Oh yeah, that's the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so much food stuffed in there, Cagalli's belly had a certain firmness to it but there was still a soft layer of malleable fat that Athrun could feel. He moved his hand in soothing circles on his blonde friend's tummy, eliciting a burp from her every now and then. Whenever he felt Cagalli's tummy gurgle and bubble underneath his hand, he would take a moment to focus on rubbing that spot until the gurgling calmed, which was usually announced with a belch courtesy of his well-fed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Athrun would do some belly play. He'd either poke, pat, jiggle, or shake Cagalli's belly. At one point he lifted the swollen orb up with his hands, then let it drop back onto Cagalli's lap, her tummy jiggling and wobbling from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, UURRRRP! It wouldn't hurt if you let yourself go too and enjoy yourself.\" Cagalli said, drumming her fingers along her dome of a middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it would, I'm terrible at handling stomachaches.\" Athrun said, still tending to his girlfriend's tum. His girlfriend's words made him imagine how he would look at Cagalli's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. I can easily see you being a total -URAAAP- wimp over a little tummyache.\" She gave the bluenette a small playful noogie.</span></div></div>",

The buttons on Sumeragi's vest looked like they were about to pop off at any moment, creamy flesh was clearly visible between each one. The buttons on Tieria's shirt as well as the one on his pants weren't doing any better, his stomach had already popped off the ones on his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just trying to lighten the mood.\" Sumeragi said in an annoyed tone. \"You need some more pizza.\" The overweight captain then picked up a slice of pizza and shoved into her purple haired friend's mouth, much to his shock. He began eating it, normally he would've just taken it out of his mouth but it just tasted so good. Sumeragi began eating another slice herself as she watched Tieria eat his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you put more thought into what came out of your mouth, Captain, that'd work,\" Tieria said with a huff. \"Then again, you and I can't seem to get a handle on what we put in, so I suppose it's just too much to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want to lose all this, you'll stop whining for a bit,\" Sumeragi stated flatly. She grabbed the sides of her gut and gave it a good shake for emphasis. \"Instead, why don't we brainstorm some ways to kick our habits? Come up with exercises?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria and Sumeragi had both gained a lot of weight, they were obese at their current weights. Most of Sumeragi's weight had gone straight to her gut, while Tieria's had mostly spread out evenly but he was no less enormous. But first, a description of their bodies was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria's stomach had become large and soft. It was a big, jiggly ball of adipose that stuck out from his torso. It had a noticeable collection of rolls on it's sides and would strain the buttons on Tieria's wardrobe, even when he wasn't stuffed to the brim. The orb of fat was also incredibly soft, Sumeragi had even used it as a pillow a few times, which would usually cause Tieria to blush. The purplenette's tummy had plenty of side rolls and some prodigious love handles. They were deep enough that one could fit some small objects in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria's chest had grown into an impressive pair of man boobs that made him look even more like a girl, leading to a fair number of friendly jokes from Sumeragi. They rested atop his fat tummy and were just as jiggly as their support. The Gundam Meister's man boobs would jiggle along with his belly with every step he made, often bringing a blush to his face. The squishy sacks of fat were so big, they could even fill up some bras. Sumeragi would love to tease Tieria about his chest, she loved referring them as his boobs and would even sometimes give them a playful shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ass also gotten much bigger, big enough to the point that it even felt cramped in his Gundam's cockpit. He hated how much it jiggled violently whenever he ran. His titanic ass had even ripped a few pairs of his pants, exposing his underwear and ass. Thankfully, Sumeragi was the only one who had ever witnessed this, whcih meant he only had to put up with her teasing. Because of how huge the Gundam pilot's butt had gotten, the Gundam Virtue's cockpit had be expanded, much to his embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam Meister's legs had also gotten flabby. They were thick and completely unsuited for combat, they certainly were not the type of legs one would expect a soldier to have. Tieria's legs were so flabby and wide that they constantly rubbed together, with virtually no separation between them. They would wobble slightly with every step Tieria made and were a big part of why the chair in his Gundam's cockpit had to be resized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Tieria's face was very pudgy. The purplenette's face was almost completely round. His cheeks were puffed up and he had a double chin. Needless to say, this resulted in him appearing much less intimidating. Tieria's chubby face made it rather hard to take him seriously. His moments of childish anger and pouting were rendered cute by his chubby cheeks. Sumeragi thought he looked absolutely adorable and she loved pinching his cheeks as a friendly way to tease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi's belly was a perfect orb of adipose that jutted out from her torso an inch or so further then her impressive breasts. The brunette's tummy would bob and jiggle like jello with every step the overfed captain took. Or really, whenever it registered any physical impact. The sphere of fat had popped off many of the buttons on Sumeragi's old clothes, including her old vest and white jeans. A pair of plentiful love handles accompanied the sides of her tummy. Thanks to the tactical forecaster's vest, her big belly was always on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, one also couldn't forget her breasts. While Sumeragi always had some very impressive boobs, they had gotten even larger as she packed on the pounds. They jutted out almost as much as her tummy and were just as soft and jiggly as it was, bouncing with every step Sumeragi made. Whenever the Ptolemaios took a bad hit during combat, her breasts could always be jiggling. The captain's boobs had gotten so large that they were able to easily break many of Sumeragi's old bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass had become quite the massive thing. It was a huge bubblebutt that was just as jiggly as her belly and boobs. The well-fed tactical forecaster's butt would jiggle and bounce with every step the brunette made, reminding her of how fat she had become. It completely filled up any chair she sat in and even broke a few of them, much to her embarrassment. Because of how massive her blubbery behind had gotten, the captain's chair had be resized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were quite fat and wide as well. They had gotten so meaty that there was almost no separation between them, even rubbing together when she sat down. The masses of flab would wobble slightly with every one of the captain's footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi's face had chubbed up as well, it now possessed soft, chubby cheeks and a small but noticeable double chin. Her cheeks would bounce and jiggle a bit whenever she let out a bellyful laugh. Dimples would even show up when she had a big smile on her face. Her face's chubbed up features actually helped to give her a very inviting and friendly appearance, as they empathized just how soft her face was now, especially whenever she grinned or smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cause of the drastic change to their bodies was Sumeragi's attempt to get Tieria to loosen up. It wasn't a secret that the Gundam Meister was rather anti-social, so Sumeragi decided to fix that by helping him enjoy himself. Towards the end of every day, Tieria would come to Sumeragi's room, where they would just kick back and relax. Of course, Tieria initially refused, finding the idea ridiculous, but Sumeragi fixed that by making it an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi's and Tieria's relaxation consisted of them kicking back, snacking, and enjoying a good TV show while they chatted. However, their snacks ended up slowly increasing in portion as their breaks became longer, resulting in them leaving these get-togethers stuffed to the brim, belching up a storm, and drunk, in Sumeragi's case. Needless to say, their countless binges soon caught up with them and they packed on the pounds to the point that they could truly be considered obese. And they showed no signs of getting any slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all,\" Tieria began. \"We need to stop eating so damn much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Sumeragi said after drinking from a bottle of beer. \"But first we gotta finish our meal.\" She said with a smirk as she reached for another slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria sighed. \"Of course. UUURRAAP!\" He didn't want to admit it but he was just as much of a glutton as his friend. \"We need a place to exercise.\" The fat purple haired young man then picked up his own pizza slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the \u2013URRRP- perfect place in mind.\" The fat tactical forecaster said. \"There's an extra room on Ptolemios. We'd have it all to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be the first time in your whole life you've gotten any exercise, won't it?\" Sumeragi teased with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off.\" Tieria grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Sumeragi giggled. \"Anyways, let's forget about this for now and enjoy ourselves.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two gluttons resumed their binge and soon finished eating all the food Sumeragi brought. They leaned back in to the couch, letting their big bellies bulge out. This caused the buttons on their pants, as well as the ones on Sumeragi's vest and Tieria's shirt, to be popped of their round middles. No longer restrained, their tummies bulged out even farther, filling up their laps even more and forcing down their pants' zipper. The two tubby Celestial Being members let out satisfied sighs, both from how comfortable it felt for some pressure to be removed from their tummies, as well as from how good all the food tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP! Man, that hit the spot.\" Sumeragi said as she gave her boated belly a few pats, a pleased smirk on her face. The tactical forecaster was feeling more then a bit drunk from all the alcohol she had consumed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't \u2013URRAAAP- deny that.\" Tieria responded as he gently rubbed his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbles suddenly sounded from their bellies and just as soon as they thought \"I think I'm gonna-\", massive belches quickly escaped their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one. You're almost as good at burping \u2013URRRRAAP- as me.\" Sumeragi said with an amused grin, entertained by the unusual sight of someone as serious as Tieria letting out a huge burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-T-That's nothing to be proud of.\" Tieria said, his puffy cheeks turning nearly scarlet. \"... And yours was much louder then mine. I'm not even good at belching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi let out a giggle, smirking in a drunk manner. \"Whatever \u2013URP- you say, Tier \u2013URRAP- ia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette then poked deep into Tieria's tummy, her finger even sinking in a bit, forcing one of the biggest belches either of them had ever heard to come flying out of Tieria's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi burst out into drunken laughter while Tieria's face turned even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny.\" Tieria stated, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hilarious!\" Sumeragi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sense of humor is completely immature.\" Tieria said, still pouting in anyonance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gundam Meister then moaned as his tummy let out a loud gurgle. He rubbed it in an attempt to sooth the gurgling beast, discomfort obvious on his pudgy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stomachache?\" Sumeragi asked, still recovering from her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Tieria said, a bit louder then intended. \"I'm \u2013URRRAAAAP- fine.\" The sickly moans and gurgles his poor belly let out proved him wrong. It was so embarrassing for him to need help with something as simple as a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it does hurt a little.\" Tieria said as he looked down at his stomach, blushing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi smirked as she rolled her eyes in a playful manner. Sometimes, Tieria really was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just the thing that will your gut feel better.\" Sumeragi said as she placed her hands on Tieria's puffy stomach and began gently rubbing it, causing the overfed purplenette to moan. The Gundam Meister felt the pain in his gut disappear and be replaced with a soothing warmth as Sumeragi's hands made slow, rhythmic movements over the great expanse of his blubbery belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" Sumeragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAAP!\" Was the only response Tieria could give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear!\" Sumeragi happily said with a big smile. She gave Tieria's tummy a few pats, eliciting another loud belch from his lips. She continued rubbing his gut, with Tieria occasionally letting out another loud burp, until due to a combination of the time as well all the food and drinks in their guts, they both fell into a deep food coma.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sumeragi Lee Noriega made her way through the Ptolemios, dire thoughts on her mind. Today was the day the world would first learn of the Gundams and Celestial Being, a truly momentous time in history. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only huge element of Celestial Being, not when Sumeragi herself was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it bluntly, the captain of the battleship Ptolemios was quite chubby, obese at 190 lbs. Her stomach was the area most notable, being a noticeable paunch that went past the waistband of her casual pants. As it was, her belly was straining a bit against the belt that was part of the standard suit she was given. It wasn\u2019t yet to the point of breaking, but it was nearing it. Love handles were also forming on Sumeragi\u2019s sides, although they weren\u2019t too bad. Granted, the fact that they were responsible for tearing several stitches and threads in her old suit was quite the annoyance,  but at least she had gotten a new one that could better handle all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of her ass, while it was toned before, now it was a bubble butt for sure. Each cheek jiggled and wobbled with every bounce and step the poor redhead took, although it was somewhat mitigated in the low gravity of the spaceship she was currently in. Still though, they made her ass absolutely huge, and it made getting through tight spaces a real hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn regards to the captain\u2019s cleavage, it was already fairly sizable before she had gained weight. But as a result of the weight gain, her chest had gotten a bit bigger. It wasn\u2019t too huge a difference, but each boob was now big enough that they were straining against her bra, feeling quite constricting. It was only the second bra Sumeragi bought since her weight gain began, and it was already becoming obsolete. At least her chest was still perky, but she didn\u2019t know if that would last if she gained anymore weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to Sumeragi\u2019s legs and arms, they were hit by the weight gain, of course. Not as much as several other parts of her body, but still enough to keep her from ignoring them. They were flabby now, all hints of muscle tone completely devoid from them. This proved to be quite the problem, since it meant that the redhead could no longer use her appendages in any sort of combat scenario whatsoever. Any punches and kicks delivered by someone as out of shape as Sumeragi would only hurt the opponent in minor ways, leaving her practically defenseless against anyone who was actually skilled in martial arts of any sort. While the captain of the Ptolemios wasn\u2019t planning on getting into any form of combat anyways, now it\u2019d be absolutely vital for her to avoid it like the plague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was her face. Sumeragi was very well-known for her good looks, having previously possessed very sharp and angular features in her slim days that not only made her look beautiful, but also helped to make the young woman look intimidating. However, the \u201cpointiness\u201d of her face had melted away as she gained weight, leading to a very fluffy and fatty visage now. She still looked every bit as beautiful as she did before, but it just manifested in a different way.  Instead of sharp, angular features, the redhead now sported soft, chubby cheeks along with a prominent double chin. Her neck fat was also starting to accumulate, making the support for her noggin look a tad thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi shook her head. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be thinking about her weight, now was the time to be thinking about the future of the world. After all, it was Celestial Being\u2019s goal to end all war, and with the Gundam Meisters, that would hopefully come to fruition. It wouldn\u2019t be an easy task, but it was a burden everyone on the Ptolemios was willing to take on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Sumeragi entered the main control and communications room of the battleship, where she saw the other crew members. They were all\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering the control room of the Ptolemis, Sumeragi almost gave a sigh. She hadn\u2019t been the only one porking up lately, that was for sure. Feldt and Christina had both seen a fair amount of weight gain since their thin days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, there was Feldt, who weighed in at 188 lbs. Her gain had been mainly centered around her belly, turning it into a plump orb that stuck out from her torso a fair amount, a stark contrast from its flat and firm form that existed before. There were a few stretch marks that had even popped up, as well as a couple love handles that were plainly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had gotten fuller, filling up her bra to quite an uncomfortable degree. Her cleavage was still fairly perky, due to the boons of youth, but the weight that her chest proved to be was becoming quite uncomfortable nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt\u2019s ass was had now become a bubble butt, filling up her chair in almost every inch. Each cheek was smooth yet squishy, and her posterior was stretching out the fabric of her pants to quite a fair degree, to the point where it was likely they\u2019d rip from any movements that might put too much stress on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina weighed in at 198 lbs, and had the same general figure as Feldt, except she had started to accumulate a bit more weight in her face. Her cheeks were becoming quite full and cherubic, and her chin was becoming double-tiered, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, another difference was her legs, which had also plumped up considerably. Anytime the redhead sat down, her appendages\u2019 flesh pooled over the seat, nearly touching each other as a result. Even while standing, the tops of them always chaffed together, which led to a bit of a sore that encouraged Christina to stay as sedentary as possible. Not to mention, she absolutely hated the feeling of her legs jiggling whenever she decided to even take small walks, which was another deterrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women were busy typing away furiously on their computes, almost breaking into a sweat due to all the work they were doing. It was hard trying to monitor the energy signals given out by the Gundams and the life forces of the Meisters, but they were proud to do their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, status report,\u201d Sumeragi said, taking her seat in the center of the control room. \u201cHow\u2019re those guys doing down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, Captain Sumeragi,\u201d Feldt said, as she scratched at her belly in anxiety. \u201cI think the world has gotten the message of just how capable the Gundams are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they better. It\u2019d serve them well not to underestimate us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Gundam Meisters have certainly left quite the impression,\u201d Feldt said, typing away furiously on her computer. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before they\u2019re recognized as a real force in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the sooner the better,\u201d Sumeragi said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cThe quicker we can put an end to war, the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm,\u201d Chrisitna said, nodding her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, gurgles from all three women\u2019s stomachs sounded off, causing all present to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems we\u2019re all a bit hungry, huh?\u201d Sumeragi said, giving a nervous chuckle as she scratched the back of her head. \u201cHey, do any of you guys know if there\u2019s any food lying around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually, there\u2019s some over in the storage area,\u201d Lichtendal Tsery said, scratching his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of it is kept, anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, we\u2019ve been keeping them there because some people can get quite greedy,\u201d Lasse Aeon said with a smirk. \u201cBetween all of us, we\u2019re probably gonna wipe out our food supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, Licthendal and Lasse were both plumping up as well, although not quite in that drastic a way as the other, female members of the crew. They were mainly belly-heavy, although their thighs and asses were also getting a fair amount of weight distribution. They were mainly in the mid-160\u2019s ranges, although they were steadily climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Well, sounds good to me,\u201d Sumeragi said with a sly grin. \u201cI say it\u2019s time to have a bit of a party!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi sighed. The party was coming up, so she needed to change into her casual wear, which consisted of a purple blouse and long white pants. Simple, right? Well, it was, in a bygone time when Sumeragi was still thin, but now, it was an absolute chore. The reason? She hadn\u2019t updated her wardrobe in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale stomach was so doughy and big, it actually obscured the hem of her pants, pushing against the button and zipper to such an extent the brunette was honestly surprised they hadn\u2019t broken yet. However, there were already a couple rips that could already be seen in the thigh-level part of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt was the worst of all, though, requiring several buttons that needed to be buttoned. It was meant to be somewhat tight when she was thin, but now, it was absolutely suffocating. Every space between the buttons had pale flesh oozing through, audible creaking noises prevalent whenever the young woman so much as moved the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery side and back roll was clearly visible, with the blouse riding up to such an extent it actually was just barely able to cover the top of her belly. And considering how tight the buttons were now, they\u2019d only get tighter as she filled herself up with food from the party. At this point, the poor Captain just wanted them to hold on for one more meal before she got a new blouse and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, said party was quickly able to devolve into basically gorging and belching as the major attractions. All sorts of delectable food was on display, ranging from fried chicken, lasagna, ice cream, cake, cookies, soda, and of course, lots of alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five members of the crew were taking as much food as possible, piling as much onto their plates as they could get away with and not giving a damn about calories. At the moment, Sumeragi was tipsy, giggling like mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha ha! Well, I think this is \u2013URP- quite the victory for Celestial \u2013UUUURRRRP- Being!\u201d she proclaimed proudly, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I\u2019ll \u2013UURRP- say, war\u2019ll be a thing of the past in no time!\u201d Feldt said, giving her belly a big slap. \u201cNow, is there any more buffalo chicken lying around\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely, there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll lose, our \u2013UURRP- conviction is too st-URP- strong!\u201d Christina said, downing some more soda. \u201cWow, I love this brand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but let\u2019s all \u2013URP- keep our heads on straight and not get cocky,\u201d Lichtendal said. \u201cWe are going up against the entire world, don\u2019t forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but a confident \u2013UUUUURRRRP- outlook is key in this type of conflict,\u201d Lasse said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re doomed to fail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi, meanwhile, was reclining in her chair, lazily giving her belly a scratch as she yawned. Downing some more alcohol, giving another belch, Sumeragi realized in her hot state that she had some really nice friends to just kick back and relax with. How could things get better\u2026?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celestial Being's armed intervention campaign had been going on for a while, but that didn't mean Christina, Feldt, and Sumeragi couldn't take a day off to relax and enjoy themselves at the beach. In fact, Sumeragi said that they needed to relax and a trip to the beach is just what they need. It really was nice to hit the beach and enjoy themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed in satisfaction as she reclined further back in her lounge chair. She always loved the beach. The brunette looked over at Feldt and noticed that she seemed worried about something as she looked at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Feldt?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nothing.\" Feldt answered. There was something bothering her, a fact she had a feeling Christina knew, but she was too embarrassed about it to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Feldt. You can tell me.\" Christina said, a comforting smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt sighed, it took her a few seconds before she was ready to tell her friend. Her face turned bright red. \"It's just that I've gotten so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, Feldt. You look good no matter what your weight is!\" Christina comforted her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt didn't respond. She gave her belly a poke and watched as it jiggled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, look at me.\" Christina said as she got up from the chair and struck a pose. Feldt looked at her friend, a little confused. \"I've gotten pretty fat and I still look good, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt and Christina had gotten pretty chubby. The two would often spend their free time together enjoying lots of delicious food such as ice cream, potato chips, hot dogs, hamburgers, and the like whilst watching TV. The lack of restraint around food, along with their roles on the Ptolemaios being mission control, helped to bloat up their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt had a big soft potbelly that jiggled and bounced whenever she walked, often causing a blush to appear on her face. The fact that most of her shirts couldn't really cover the orb of adipose in its entirety without considerable effort on her part made its softness quite known to everyone who saw. Of course, this also meant its plentiful love handles and side rolls were also on full display, on top of its noticeable overhang. Her breasts, having gotten so big, were practically never static, as evidenced anytime the Ptolemaios got rocked by any sort of impact. She had been thinking of getting some reinforced bras for a while now, and the investment seemed better ever day.Feldt's butt was almost as fat as her belly and was just as jiggly. Whenever Feldt sat down, her ass would completely fill up the chair. Of course, the fact that it tended to create several tears and holes in the seat of most pairs of pants she owned didn't exactly help to boost her self-confidence. Thankfully, her large ass did come in handy every once in a while: her cheeks had gotten so huge, it was easy to use them close any door she needed to whenever her hands were full. Feldt always had a rather soft gentle face and it was now even softer. The round cheeks and double chin she now possessed made her appear even more sweet and gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's belly was spherical yet flabby. The orb of adipose was beginning to show hints of a double-roll coming on in the near future. The brunette's gut always pushed a ton against the waistband of her shorts and formed a nice muffintop. A spare tire was beginning to form. Her breasts were big and very soft. Whenever she wore a bra, her large boobs could barely be contained within the cups, the straps could occasionally be heard creaking and straining to keep the mounds of fat within. Christina's boobs rested atop her big tummy pretty much all the time, and that, along with her youth, helped keep them relatively perky despite their large size. Of course, one couldn't forget Christina's ass, which has also seen a fair brunt of her weight gain. The two cheeks of flab and cellulite that jiggled and wobbled with even the slightest of movements used to be perfectly pert and firm for the young woman's liking, but not anymore. Now, with how the skin bobbed and spread out over flat surfaces anytime she sat down, no one could be blamed for not realizing her posterior had once belonged to the body of a thin woman. Christina's face had also gotten plumper, with round cheeks and a small but noticeable double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, you two! Looks like you're having some fun, huh?\" The captain of the Ptolemaios had a big grin on her face as she walked over to Christina and Feldt. \"I had a feeling this mini-vacation was a good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt nearly did a double-take anytime her superior officer came within view of her, because even though she felt she was getting huge, well... Sumeragi was definitely the biggest of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi's gut completely eclipsed Feldt's and Christina's. The chubby brunette's belly had a noticeable hang to it and would jiggle and wobble with every step she took. Her gut was so big that it had managed to pop off every button on her old vest and even a few on the larger version she had gotten. Sumeragi's big belly was on full display whenever she wore her casual clothes. Sumeragi always had a large chest and much like her belly, it had gotten even bigger. The brunette's boobs now jiggled and bounced when she walked, and had gotten so large the captain of the Ptolemaios already had to update her bra twice. Sumeragi's ass had also gotten fatter and was now a giant bubblebutt that jiggled as much her gut and boobs. It had lost all sense of tone and athleticism it once had, now looking like the behind of someone who lazed around all the time stuffing their face as opposed to that of a fit commander (which pretty much fit the bill for Sumeragi nowadays). Her legs were incredibly wide and had absolutely no tone. They jiggled with every step she took. Sumeragi's face was now much softer. Her cheeks were very chubby and she now had a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure was!\" Christina enthusiastically stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed to see if the ice cream cooler was still working properly. Don't want it to fail while we're all the way out here, right?\" the officer said with a wink. \"It's way too hot for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right!\" Christina affirmed, almost sighing in relief. \"Can't have that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi placed her hands on her stomach, a greedy expression overcoming her features before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I think it's about time we treated oursevles to some of it, you know? I mean, just in case it does fail and all those delicious examples of dairy excellence all go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt could feel her stomach sink with every sentence the other woman was espousing, knowing full-well where this was going. Her fears weren't assuaged with Christina joining in the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?! Are we allowed to eat it now? Please tell me we are. Pretty, preeeetty please?\" the brunette beggeded excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio made their way over to the cooler (one, however, taking the rear at a snail's pace), eager to start eating the dairy confections. Once they all made it, Sumeragi and Christina beamed at Feldt expectantly. Unfortunately, she was too busy realizing that the walk across the beach had actually made her out of breath, something she was almost shocked to admit to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think there are a few words needed first, huh?\" Sumeragi said joyfully, planting her large ass down on the sand, \"Here's to a wonderful beach vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Christina nearly cheered in response as she plopped on down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"Feldt mumbled as she joined the others, resigned to her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina, Feldt, and Sumeragi started eating their ice cream. They shoveled as much of it as they could into their greedy mouths, happily talking to each other all the while. Their bellies growing bigger and bigger with every bowl they finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Celestial Being's campaign is really going well. We've already ended a few wars!\" Christina remarked before eating another spoonful of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're just that good! UUURRRP!\" Sumeragi proudly proclaimed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feldt didn't seem as proud as her friends. She stopped eating and was now silently looking down at her full bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Feldt?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just remembered that while we have a lot and can get fat even by accident, the wars of the worlds deny many other people those same luxuries.\" The pinkette somberly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi noticed that the mood was taking a turn for the worst. Luckily, she knew the perfect way to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant belch filled the air, instantly snapping Feldt and Christina out of their thoughts. Of course, it came from Sumeragi, and they looked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! Is it me or does it get harder and harder to feel full as you get bigger?\" Sumeragi said before slapping her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, it does.\" Feldt remarked as she looked down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would've been completely stuffed before and I'm looking to the next couple of bowls.\" Christina said as she jiggled her sizable belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think It's time we see how much we can really stuff ourselves. You girls up an eating contest?\" Sumeragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt was genuinely curious where this sudden idea came from, but she wasn\u2019t about to question her superior on it. Instead, she meekly nodded her head as Christina beamed her approval of Sumeragi\u2019s idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that sounds nice! It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had something really filling!\u201d the brunette said, giving her gut a rub. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 Well, we already have a bunch of ice cream, I think it\u2019ll do! There\u2019s a ton in this cooler here, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d The captain gave a subtle wink to Feldt as she finished saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina giggled excitedly and Feldt early groaned in reluctance. She had already packed on so much weight, she definitely did not feel like stuffing even more calories in her ever-greedy gut right now. But, her two friends were incredibly enthusiastic about the idea. Maybe she could compromise just this once\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m in,\u201d Feldt said with a sigh. \u201cJust make sure we don\u2019t go too overboard, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Feldt, you don't need to say that,\" Sumeragi said, shifting her bulk to get into position for the coming feast. \"I'll definitely be keeping our health in mind, here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the attitudes of her superior and colleague, though, Feldt wasn't too sure about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Sumeragi plopped down the ice cream they\u2019d have to eat for the contest, Feldt\u2019s heart sank down into the pit of her titanic tummy. While there was certainly a nice variety of flavors, such as mint, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and so forth, the redhead knew they were all calorie bombs. Placing a hand on her gut, the genius really did wonder if it was too late to back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, time for the main event to begin!\u201d Sumeragi boomed happily, expectantly looking at Feldt. Seeing Christina look at her with the same expression, the redhead knew she had her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYaaay\u2026\u201d she mumbled quietly before digging into the meal along with her friends.<br>\r\nThe three women sat down on their respective chairs gathered around the table they had set up (Feldt noting that there was an uncomfortable level of creaking let out of the appliances as a result), and each \u201ccontestant\u201d piled ice cream into their bowls. Feldt tried to make her serving a little less extreme than the other two, although she knew she couldn\u2019t make it too noticeable or risk getting called out on. She was still extremely hesitant to do this, even as she lifted the spoon up to her lips with the first scoop of ice cream. The moment the dairy product hit her taste buds, though, her eyes lit up in surprise. This ice cream\u2026 it actually tasted really good! Fantastic, even! Feldt had chosen a nice scoop of mint, and the creaminess of the ice cream, along with the nice sprinkling of delicious chocolate combined together to create an out-of-this-world flavor sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to pick up the pace, the redhead started to shove scoop after scoop into her awaiting maw, only occasionally stopping to allow the frequent brain freeze to pass before going right back into her gluttonous rhythm. She of course ate much more than just mint; considering how it tasted, she was curious to see if the other flavors held up just as well. To her delight, they did indeed, which meant there was a nice variety of worthy treats to choose from. Granted, all this testing and gorging also served the (unintended) purpose of keeping her mind off of just how much junk she was ingesting, leaving Feldt blissfully ignorant of all the soon-to-be pounds she\u2019d be accumulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn\u2019t so distracted that she couldn\u2019t steal glances at Sumeragi and Christina every once in a while, and every time she did, it seemed as though they were definitely eating just as fast, if not even faster, than the rotund redhead. The other, bigger redhead had already polished off seven bowls as opposed to Feldt\u2019s four, and she showed no signs of slowing down. Sumeragi\u2019s swimsuit was visibly tightening against her ever-expanding gut, the strings and fabric keeping it together practically begging their wearer to slow down a bit. The Captain of the Ptolemis, on the other hand, was eating with reckless abandon, bits of melted ice cream coating her chin and cheeks as she fervently scarfed more and more fattening goodness down her esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina wasn\u2019t doing too badly, herself, although she was a little slower than her superior. She was about halfway done with her sixth bowl, and had an extremely dreamy look on her visage as she also partook in the absolute gluttony abounding. The brunette would occasionally let out little belches of indigestion anytime there was a break in scoops getting to her mouth, which were so common by this point that she didn\u2019t even bother excusing herself. At one point, a plop of ice cream actually dropped down right into her cleavage. Shivering a bit, Christina looked down for only a second before taking a finger, scooping it up, and plopping it right into the area it was meant to be. After that, she resumed eating just like normal, hardly fazed by the sugary cream that still lingered on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the three women were able to finish all the dessert before them, leaning back in their chairs as they did so (and eliciting even louder creaks than before). Sumeragi let out a booming belch, giving her gut a nice rub through her extremely stretched swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, was that a great meal, or what?\u201d she asked lazily. \u201cI think this is definitely something we should \u2013URRRAAP- do again sometime, what do you girls think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm!\u201d Christina nodded in enthusiasm, her attempt at leaning back causing her shirt to roll up even higher over her massive dome of a stomach. \u201cThat was a gre-UURRRP-great meal, I\u2019d say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women now looked expectantly at Feldt, obviously hopeful that she\u2019d have the same response. Put on the spot, the genius redhead momentarily blushed, unsure of how exactly to tackle the situation. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat and took a deep breath\u2026 which turned out to be a mistake, considering her belt buckle for her shorts popped open as her stomach reached its apex circumference. At first, Feldt was too shocked to do anything but just look down in bewilderment, but when she realized what happened, her blush came on fiercer than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026 I think it was okay, but it was really \u2013UUURRRP- fattening, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked timidly. \u201cI mean, we shouldn\u2019t really \u2013URP- make a habit out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw, come on, you worry too much!\u201d Sumeragi said, getting up off her chair with a grunt of effort. \u201cBeing fat isn\u2019t nearly as bad as you make it out to be. It\u2019s not like we have to fight, and besides, did you \u2013URRRAAAP- forget what we were talking about earlier? We should \u2013UARP- really be grateful we even have the ability to do all this in the first place, when there are so many unfortunate people out there who don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and besides, I\u2019ve heard there are plenty of \u2013URP- guys that are into big girls, anyways!\u201d Christina chimed in. \u201cAnd a lot of people respect you for your intelligence, Feldt, that hasn\u2019t \u2013URAP-changed, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, I mean\u2026\u201d Feldt stumbled around with her words. \u201cI suppose when you p-UUUURAP-put it like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi nodded, satisfied with the points she and her subordinate made, and promptly let herself plop right down onto her beach chair. Which, due to her girth, ended up breaking the moment her backside made contact with it, causing the poor obese woman to fall down right onto the sand in an embarrassing manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this happen, Feldt had to admit, she did feel at least a little better about her own weight: she hadn\u2019t broken any chairs yet. Giggling, she laboriously got up from her seat and outstretched a hand to help her superior back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, maybe you guys are right: there isn\u2019t anything wrong with \u2013URRRRP- indulging yourself every once in a while, right?\u201d she said with a wink.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"UUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina Ismail belted out a massive belch as she rubbed her stuffed belly. Despite being alone in her room, the princess of Azadistan was still incredibly embarrassed by her unladylike burp. After all, as a princess, she was raised to be as polite as possible and belching loudly is far from polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me...\" Marina apologized, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina had just finished eating a massive dinner to cope with the stress of her country's current state. It wasn't a simple meal either, it was a massive feast truly fit for a princess. The princess of Azadistan had managed to eat all the food scattered all across her bed, overflowing with chicken, pie, and cookies, among others including even some food most people wouldn't expect a princess to eat like pizza and ice cream. Needless to say, eating such an incredibly large amount of food caused Marina's big belly to become very bloated. She moaned and laid back, her rambunctious stomach gurgling in digestion as she let herself sink into the soft mattress, giving her gut a good rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time Marina had stuffed herself silly. The princess of Azadistan had been eating quite a lot of feasts lately and she had the appearance one would expect. Marina now weighed about 210 lbs., with most of the weight centering on her breasts, stomach, and rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina's stomach was large, round, and soft. It jiggled with every step she took, which often caused a blush to appear on her face. Her breasts were straining against her outdated bra and could occasionally be seen jiggling. Her butt would take up pretty much the entire chair while spilling over whenever sat on one. Marina's ass jiggled almost as much as her belly whenever she walked. Marina's face had also gotten fuller and rounder. Marina now had chubby cheeks and a small double-chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina had updated her wardrobe to suit her new weight (except her bras which she was too embarrassed to update.) but unfortunately, it didn't accommodate her belly after a feast. The brunette had to pull her shirt up so that she may massage her bloated tummy. Marina couldn't believe that she had gotten so fat. Marina looked at her bloated tummy, it almost completely obscured her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope \u2013UUURRRP- Excuse me. I hope my meal will be finished digesting by the time Setsuna arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina and Setsuna had decided to have a friendly meeting tonight both to enjoy each others company and catch up with each other as they hadn't seen each other in a while. While Marina knew that Setsuna wouldn't judge her for her weight and probably wouldn't even care, the princess of Azadistan still wished that she could've lost all this weight before they had met again. When they had last seen each other, Marina was still as skinny as she normally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wonder if Setsuna had gained any weight himself. She imagined what the Gundam Meister would look like at her weight as a joke. Setsuna had a nice big jiggly belly, \"moobs\" as Marina believed they were called, a cute fat butt, chubby legs that rubbed together whenever he walked and barely had any separation normally, and an adorable fat face with chubby cheeks and a double-chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, she suddenly imagined herself rubbing his bloated belly after a huge meal and watching with joy as he burped, easing the pressure in his tummy. She them imagined them rubbing their distended tummies after a meal as big as the one Marina had just eaten. They both belched spectacularly and began rubbing each others bellies, coaxing several large belches out of both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina instantly snapped back to reality. Her imagination was getting way too weird for her. She noticed that she had been drooling a little too. Understandably, she didn't want to think about it any longer and dismissed it as just an incredibly odd dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least reality isn't that weird. UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh, Marina apologized for her unladylike burst of gas and continued to rub her stuffed gut as she belted out powerful burps and apologized after each one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Setsuna arrived two hours later. While Marina was still feeling quite bloated, she had managed to digest a good amount of her feast. She was certainly belching less, which Marina felt was definitely a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Setsuna.\" Marina greeted Setsuna as he walked in. \"How have you been lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I suppose.\" Setsuna answered in his usual stoic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Setsuna didn't say anything, and his expression didn't really show it, Marina could tell he was surprised by how fat she was. The fat princess could practically feel Setsuna scanning her now chubby body, she had a feeling he could probably also tell she had just stuffed herself not even five hours ago. The next belch Marina knew was going to inevitably slip out would erase all doubt in the Gundam Meister's mind that wasn't the case. On the upside, Marina noticed that Setsuna didn't really seem to care that she got fat, just as she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I need to tell you about.\" Setsuna suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has something bad happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about Azadistan. Celestial Being believes there's still a chance that conflict may break out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the conservatives and reformists have made peace thanks to your intervention. Er, I mean your armed intervention. That is what Celestial Being calls their operations, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Setsuna confirmed, he was a little pleased to see that Marina now held enough respect for Celestial Being to use the correct terminology. \"There's still a chance of a coup by radicals, so I've been ordered to stay with you as a bodyguard until Celestial Being is certain there's that fighting won't break out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Marina said. \"I'm certain that nothing will happen but I appreciate your concern. I don't mind you staying for a while though I wish you would've informed me beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured I should tell you in person since you invited me here anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you told me earlier I would've had a room -URRRRAAP-!\" Marina immediately slapped her hands over her mouth as her cheeks turned scarlet, her loud belch catching both her and Setsuna off guard. \"I-I'm so sorry, Setsuna. Um, w-would you like some tea?\" She said in a desperate attempt to take both their minds off her impressive belching skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina and Setsuna spent some time chatting over tea, it was mostly them catching up with each other, and Setsuna telling Marina what the other members of Celestial Being are like. Setsuna''s description of how Sumeragi could be found binge drinking at least once a day reminded Marina of how much comfort food she was chowing down on these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has she gained any weight?\" Marina asked, subconsciously resting a hand on her still full tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I've seen her stomach get bloated sometimes.\" Setsuna said. \"Two days ago she drank so much that her stomach popped off every button on her vest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this in her room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was on the bridge. We had just finished another armed intervention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I was expecting your tactical forecaster to be more... professional.\" Marina didn't really find Sumeragi's attitude to be a bad thing, just highly unusual. \"Your stories sound more like their about a family then a -UURRRAP-! Excuse me. More like a family then a paramilitary group. It's hard to believe people like that are the ones carrying out armed interventions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the fact that Setsuna and the rest of Celestial Being spent most of their time acting like a normal family made the reality of them fighting in wars even more unbearably sad to Marina. The fatty brunette thought to herself about how Setsuna didn't even look like someone who would be fighting in wars. He didn't even look like he had gone through any physical training. Though it would make sense for Celestial Being to place much more emphasis on pilot training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though they definitely wouldn't allow someone as fat as me to be a pilot.\" Marina thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that the gears in Marina's mind started turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone as fat as me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to the daydream she about Setsuna as a fatass. What if Setsuna really was that fat? Would Celestial Being still allow him to fight? There's no way they would. If that happened, then Setsuna might never fight again. And Setsuna was with her right now and was going to be living with her for a long time. In the same building with all the delicious food that Marina had gorged on enough to completely fatten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Marina could finally give Setsuna a normal life, or at least a merciful break from all the fighting. She was going to fatten him up to obesity. Fatten him up so much he would constantly be popping off buttons. Fat to the point his flat middle would balloon up into a giant fatty orb that jigged like it was made of jello with every step he took. So big and round that he would be breaking chairs with his humongous ass and couldn't even fit into his Gundam. So chunky that he has man boobs as big as Marina's breasts. So obese his cheeks would be round and puffy like a chipmunk's. So full to the brim he would be belting out monstrous belches nonstop as Marina gave him a loving belly rub after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna was going to be so completely obese and full of cake that he would be living a wonderful and peaceful life away from war and fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna's word snapped Marina out of her scheming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked like you were thinking about something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I did?\" Marina said like she just found out there was a bit of ketchup on her cheek. \"I was just a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina felt a little embarrassed, she was completely willing to admit that she was getting caught up in her little monologue. Maybe she just wanted to try sounding cool. At any rate, now was a good time for Setsuna's first fattening dinner as her guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina opened her mouth to say invite Setsuna to dinner but something else left her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRAP!\" Marina started blushing again. \"E-Excuse me. Oh, I just realized that you must be starving. Would you like dinner now?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Setsuna let out a content sigh and belch as he leaned back in his chair and rubbed his big stuffed belly. Marina was very pleased by the sight of her plan being off to a wonderful start. Setsuna's belly had swollen into a large orb from all the wonderful it had been stuffed to the brim with. Setsuna's dome of a middle was straining the buttons on his shirt, and his sash wasn't anymore comfortable. Marina knew Setsuna's gut was going to be big by the time she finished stuffing him but she didn't think it was going to be this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Setsuna was so bloated because Marina kept encouraging him to eat more and more, to fill his belly more and more with all the tasty food she gave him. He wasn't normally so gluttonous, that was Sumeragi's forte, but Marina's insistence on how he just has to try this dish, sometimes by describing in detail how delicious it was as she held it up to his face, made it hard for him to refuse. Nearly every dish turning out to be as tasty as Marina made it out to be wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna wasn't the only one who had eaten their fair share. Marina had also pigged out quite a bit herself. She hadn't as much as Setsuna had, as she was still digesting some of her earlier binge, she had still eaten an amount that would've left her slim self stuffed several times over. She had lifted her upper dress up to slightly below her chest so she could give her gut a much needed rub. The brunette didn't like burping up a storm next to Setsuna but Setsuna also burping up a storm next to her did make it a little less embarrassing. Though she really wished he would have some manners and ask for his belches to be excused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't that delicious, Setsuna?\" Marina said as she looked at her glutted friend and tended to her own bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y -URP- Yeah, it was. UUURRRP!\" Setsuna said, already feeling another burp rising up. He thought to himself on how he now knows what Sumeragi feels like when she's bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURAAP! Excuse me. Your shirt looks really tight, maybe you should undo a few buttons and your sash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's -URRRP- not that tight.\" Setsuna, the discomfort he was feeling from his tight shirt and sash was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOn't worry, I'm not judging. After all, I'm just as full myself.\" With a small smile, Marina undid her bloated friend's sash and most of the buttons on his shirt, giving his gut the freedom it needed to bulge out. She then undid the button on his pants, causing his stomach to bulge out even further and force his pants zipper all the way down. In total, Setsuna's belly had bugled out three whole inches further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thanks.\" Setsuna said before a small belch slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Marina said and then returned her hands to her aching belly. \"UUURRRP! Excuse me. We should probbaly lay down, our stomachs will certainly feel better. I just hope we can even walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRAAP! I can. URP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully they could both walk, though actually getting up was a bit difficult thanks to their stuffed bellies. And it was less walking and more waddling,also thanks to their stuffed bellies. The overfed fatty and overfed future fatty walked back to the couch, the same one they used while having tea, as fast as their gurgling middles would allow. The two chubsters sighed in pleasure as they plopped their asses on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo spent some more time rubbing their stomachs, belching, and chatting, until Marina worked up the courage to make a suggestion she was a bit nervous about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, w-would you like me to rub your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I'm not too tired to do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belly rubs feel better if someone else is doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess you can rub it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't rubbed someone else's stomach before, so I hope I do this right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some hesitation, Marina reached out and placed a hand on Setsuna's belly. She got goosebumps. This was an idea she had to think over to herself for a while before she suggested it since it was such an intimate thing to do, even though Setsuna didn't consider it to be intimate. The princess started slowly rubbing Setsuna's belly with great care, easing the pressure he felt within and causing him to emit sighs and belches of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" Marina nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna burped before he answered. \"It feels really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt heavenly to Setsuna to have his stomach massaged. The discomfort he felt in his tummy was slowly leaving with every soothing circle Marina made with her hand over the expanse of Setsuna's tight as a drum belly. The warmth he was feeling from the massage was unlike anything he had ever felt, it felt so good. The bloated pilot of the Exia let out many belches, the volume of some had impressed Marina. One particularly loud belch left the princess stunned. Setsuna himself was reminded of some of the really loud burps Sumeragi would sometimes let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow. That was an impressive one. I didn't even know it was possible to belch that loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't explain why but for some reason Marina liked that belch. Maybe it was just because such a large expulsion of gas meant Setsuna's tummy would feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina was rubbing her own belly with her other hand as she rubbed Setsuna's. Naturally, this meant she was burping just as much as her equally glutted friend, who thankfully didn't mind.<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRP!\" Setsuna belched for the upteempth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRRP!\" Marina also belched for the upteempth time. \"Excuse me. I know this is a really odd compliment but you and Shirin are the only ones I feel comfortable belching in front of. Maybe comfortable is too strong a word but I think you understand what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess.\" Setsuna replied, not really sure what to think of that. Or what to make of this whole situation for that matter. All he knew was that he liked the food he was given, that he liked Marina rubbing his belly, and that Marina was a lot more giving then he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while, with them continuing their discussions from before and starting a few new ones about dinner and food in general, until it was time to go to bed. Marina led Setsuna to his room, which was sjut a hallways away from Marina's own. They were about to exchange good nights but were cut off as they released an incredibly loud belch at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, pardon us.\" Marina said. Unlike before, she actually smiled a bit. She still was embarrassed of course, but she felt the fact that they were both cut off by their own belch at the same time to be rather funny. Funny enough that she actually didn't mind that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad Sumeragi isn't here, she'd never let me live this down.\" Setsuna remarked. Images of her with a playful grin playing with his stuffed stomach and poking it to make him burp loudly were flooding his mind. \"She wouldn't be the only one either. She'd probably try to drag me into her binges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I'm invited too if she does.\" Marina half-jokingly said. She liked seeing Setsuna worry about normal teenager problems like being teased by a big sister, it was pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter properly exchanging their good nights without belching, the bloated duo went to their respective rooms and went to sleep. Marina had a dream of her and Setsuna living together and getting fat. She really liked that dream. Though the part where his Gundam started getting fat too was really weird.</span></div></div>",

She almost always woke up at 5:30 AM but all the binging she had done last night with Setsuna made her sleep in, though the fact that it only made her sleep for an extra two hours shows how good she was at waking up early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she got dressed, she did the first part of her morning routine, which was weighing herself. When she placed herself a white scale in her private bathroom, she couldn't see the number on it, only her large breasts and dome of a gut. She sighed, she always kept forgetting in the morning that she can't see her feet. She tried sucking in her stomach but didn't work, it only went in a little. She grabbed the sides of her gut and lifted it up, feeling how malleable and squishy it was in her hands, and read the scale. 213 pounds, her binging yesterday had made her three pounds heavier. Sighing, she let go of her tummy and let it come flopping back out in an avalanche of jello, the jiggling, her weight gain, and the sheer size of her gut all came together to make her face take on the coloration of a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this would happen...\" She lamented as she looked down at the massive, soft orb that was her belly. Resting a hand on it, it felt almost like a pillow. \"So why do I keep eating so much? I'm only going to get even fatter.\" Ironically, that bout of self-deprecation helped to cheer her up, as it reminded her about Setsuna's soon-to-be big issues with his own weight. \"Ah! And that means Setsuna will too. He must have a big potbelly right now.\" She thought. \"And a softer chest, larger butt too, and of course a rounder face. Anyways, I should probably tell Shirin about my plan, she might be able to give some advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a shower and brushing her teeth, it was time for Marina to get dressed, which she knew was going to be much harder then it should be. The bra and underwear were easy enough to put on, even though it was a bit of squeeze. The undershirt was easy too, though it couldn't actually fully cover her gut, riding up on her huge tummy to just above her cavernous bellybutton. Looking at herself and her exposed belly in the mirror, the princess thought it was  a good thing this wouldn't be visible under the rest of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were the pants. They used to be baggy, and intentionally so, for the young woman, but now they were as tight as the rest of her usual outfit, which was probably the most embarrassing part of it. She puffed and grunted as she tried to squeeze the leggings past her chunky thighs, which she managed after five seconds of struggling. She took a break to catch her breath, knowing she would need it to get her pants past her ass. That took even longer, a grand total of ten seconds was needed before it went past her bubble butt, she was seriously afraid the whole time it was going to rip her pants. Again. And that was still a possibility even now, as one could see how incredibly tight her pants were on her huge butt just by looking at it, you could see her prodigious behind pressing against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't even the hardest part, that went to her corset. She sucked in her stomach as she tried to force it on, hard enough that her face went red as she grunted, this felt like exercise to her, which made her feel even more out-of-shape then this whole experience did. After ten seconds of struggling, she had to stop and take a breath, letting her big, fat gut flop right back out and push the sides of the corset away so fast she nearly lost hold of them. After a 20 second break, she tried again and met success when the sides of the corset met, despite her tummy's best efforts to be free, after twenty seconds of hard effort. It didn't really feel that rewarding, since the corset, which was meant to be a little tight when she was skinny, now felt uncomfortable and nearly suffocating, not that it kept her big belly was bobbing and bouncing with every single step she made. A part of her was even looking forward to when her belly would free itself by snapping her corset open after she inevitably stuffed herself silly today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those hurdles out of the way, Marina was able to put on the rest of her outfit without any problems. Even with her arms getting rather puffy, she could put on her open gloves fine. Now that she was all ready for the day, it was time for Marina Ismail to tell Shirin about her new executive decision as the First Princess of Azadistan to fatten Setsuna up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered her office, jiggling the entire short walk from her bedroom to there, she saw that Shirin was waiting for her there. It was a good thing no one else had to meet with her today, she was not going to tell Shirin her plan with anyone else present. \"Good morning.\" Shirin said, choosing to not bring up that Marina had slept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Shirin.\" Marina said as she sat down at her desk. \"This is rather hard to talk about but I need your help with something, it's very important but you can't tell anyone else about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is surprising, I never thought you would order a black ops mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's not anything like that. Well, I suppose it technically is a black ops mission, in the sense that that were will be no record of this anywhere and no one besides us will know about this. On second thought, it's more a personal request to you as a person. Rather then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I speak bluntly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you don't need to ask me for permission. You can always say whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to the point for both our sakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina sighed and closed her eyes in embarrassment and in preparation to tell Shirin the answer, her double chin looking more visible. She opened her eyes. \"Right, sorry. I need you to... I need you to help me fatten up Setsuna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirin blinked, a painful pause occurred as she looked at her princess in confusion. \"I didn't think I'd ever hear a joke from you, especially not a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina blushed, she now knew that being called crazy wasn't the worst thing Shirin could've said to her. \"I'm not joking, Shirin, this is serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-You are? Why? Is this a fetish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina blushed the hardest Shirin had ever seen he., looking almost completely red like her chubby face was an apple. \"NO! God, no. It's all for his sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is fattening him up against his will for his sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so he'll never have to fight again. Celestial Being won't keep him as a combatant if he's obese.\" They both imagined him as being over 300 pounds, with his clothes being stretched tight, with some rips on his pants and all his buttons popped, his big gut completely hanging out free, his obesity complete with chipmunk chunks and a big double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, this is a rather heavy order. Uh, pun not intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I understand if you don't want to help me with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've still got some reservations about this but I suppose I should help. It's not like saving a child soldier is a bad thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina looked relived. \"Thank you, Shirin. Please tell the cooks to prepare a massive, fattening breakfast for Setsuna.\" Just talking about breakfast made Marina's big belly growl loud enough for Shirin to hear. Blushing, the princess looked down at it and rubbed it, Shirin looked at it too. \"And for me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at how filled the table was, Marina almost wished she was the one getting fattened up, then she could eat it all by herself instead of sharing it with Setsuna. There was piles upon piles of pancakes and waffles, omelettes with strips of bacon on the side, and lots of toast, French and otherwise. She knew Setsuna was a very reserved person but she  had a feeling even he wouldn't need much convincing to start gobbling all this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the Gundam Meister, Marina was very pleased she saw him walk, looking a bit tubby. He had a big potbelly that was straining the buttons on his shirt a little, as well as it's sash. Marina just wanted to open his shirt for him and pull off his sash so his growing belly could be free. She noticed his belly even jiggled a bit when he walked. It was clear most of his weight went to his gut but the rest of him was softer too. His chest looked a lot less toned, looking downright soft now. It bulged out ever so slightly, the start of a pair of developing moobs. His legs seemed to be a bit more chunky too and his butt was softer and bigger, both of which strained his pants a little. And last but certainly not least to Marina was Setsuna's face, which had become more full and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Setsuna.\" Marina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" He stoically said as she took his spot at the table, not knowing that Marina was watching his chubby tummy jiggle. \"This is quite a spread, do you normally eat like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just like to treat my guests well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Setsuna said as he started eating, Marina following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know whenever you could use a snack, my servants would be happy to get it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt I'll be hungry after eating just a fraction of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, you certainly won't be leaving this table hungry. Not at all.\" Marina said as she again imagined what Setsuna will soon look like.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Setsuna sighed as he looked down at his big belly as he grabbed the sides of it, an annoyed look on his face. He was truly the last member of the Ptolemaios that anyone would expect to get fat. Yet here he was, weighing 217 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna now had a gut that was an almost completely spherical orb of adipose. It was incredibly jiggly, to the point that it would jiggle and bounce with every step the well-fed Gundam Meister made, especially whenever he was running. He really hated how it made even his running hard to take seriously. Even so much as just shifting in his seat or patting his big belly (especially by patting it) could cause it to jiggle. Setsuna's belly was also very soft, almost like a pillow. In fact, Sumeragi would sometimes grab his gut as she did some friendly teasing about his weight, causing him to groan or sigh in annoyance and embarrassment. The young man's stomach also had some squeezable love handles and a very deep bellybutton. Setsuna's gut had a slight hang to it, empathizing it's enormity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's chest had grown into a pair of squishy moobs. They were big, plush orbs of fat that rested on top of his tummy and jiggled almost as much as it. They were big enough that if they were the only one part of the brunette's body one saw, it wouldn't be surprising if one mistook them for a female's breasts. This was the part about his weight gain that Setsuna hated the most, next to his face getting puffier. Just being fat made it hard enough for others to take him seriously as a Gundam Meister but a pair of big man boobs made it even harder. And to be honest, Setsuna didn't blame them. The young man would cringe in embarrassment whenever he saw his moobs jiggle and bounce, sometimes the sight would even cause him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna's butt had seen some growth too, to the point of becoming a huge bubblebutt. The brunette's ass had become so fat that it jiggled and bobbed just as much as his stomach. Each cheek was big, flabby, and soft, completely unlike what most would expect a trained pilot to have. Setsuna's rear was big enough that it actually filled up nearly any normal-sized chair he sat in. His legs were also rather chunky and wide as well, making them weaker then they used to be. Because Setsuna's legs and butt had gotten so chubby, the cockpit seat for the 00 Gundam was incredibly snug, with Setsuna even having a bit of trouble squeezing his ass in there. Even though Sumeragi offered to have it resized to fit his growing bulk, Setsuna refused as he didn't want to have to admit that he was that fat. Still, Sumeragi didn't want him to feel uncomfortable, especially with his Gundam given how much admired Gundams, so she had it resized anyways, which Setsuna thanked her for while trying to hide his blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Setsuna, his face had also chubbed up. He now had a pair of soft, round chubby cheeks and a double chin, making his face appear a lot more inviting and cute. This was easily the aspect of his weight gain that he hated the most. It made his attempts at being intimidating fall flat, as he looked so adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince returning to Celestial Being, Setsuna had been spending more time with Feldt. Feldt had grown a little less shy over the course of her service in Celestial Being and now that Setsuna had finally returned after years of being missing, with no small amount of worry from Feldt, she began regularly hanging out with him. Since the pinkette still wasn't the best at striking up conversations, and neither was Setsuna, she would usually start hanging out with him by inviting him to a meal, which he would almost always accept. As the two of them got more used to hanging out together, their conversations lasted longer as their meals got larger. This resulted in Setsuna gaining the weight he had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to eat, Setsuna?\" Feldt said as she walked into the brunette's room with a big chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna couldn't help but notice the amount of jiggling Feldt's belly was doing. He certainly wasn't the only one who had plumped up from all the eating they had done together. Feldt now weighed 215 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce completely flat, Feldt's tummy was now a big ball of fat. It was very soft and jiggly. In fact, it was so soft that it would actually make for a pretty nice pillow. Sometimes, Feldt could be seen rubbing her belly, feeling how soft it was. Feldt truly liked doing that, though her face would become as red as a tomato if anyone caught her doing it. There were some prodigious love handles and rolls on the sides of Feldt's gut. The pinkette's bellybutton had gotten much deeper, it now almost looked like a black hole in the center of her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt's chest was always of a good size and now it was even bigger. Her boobs were incredibly plush and soft. They jutted out a few inches more and had grown so much that Feldt had to get a bra that was one cup size bigger then her old one. Thanks to her youth, Feldt's boobs were still just as perky as it always were. The pinkette's breasts were also quite jiggly, which would occasionally cause Feldt to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass hadn't been spared from her growth either. It was a huge, soft amalgamation of two spheres of fatty flesh. Her butt jiggled almost as much as her belly did, especially whenever the pinkette was running, the jiggling was practically in tandem with her gut, in fact. Feldt's huge ass would completely fill up almost any normally sized chair she sat down in, with the sides of her butt even spilling off the sides. This big butt went along well with her chunky thighs. They would rub together when Feldt sat down and there was barely any separation between them when she stood up. They also wobbled with every step Feldt made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt's face was much more chubby now. While it always had some softness to it, all the weight she had gained made it even softer. Her cheeks were much puffier and soft now and she had a double chin. This helped to give her face an even more sweet and inviting appearance. It really suit her kind and gentle personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce glaring issue the brunette and pinkette were both having is that their clothes didn't exactly fit them. While their pants fit fine, their uniform's shirts were completely incapable of containing their bellies. Their shirts were forced by their tummies to be kept unzipped up to their chests, completely exposing their big bellies. Even when they weren't stuffed, Feldt and Setsuna still had to go about their daily business with their tummies completely exposed because they were just so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this was very embarrassing for them. Unfortunately, they wouldn't be able to get better fitting uniforms for a while, as the Ptolemaios was far away from any Celestial Being bases that could supply them with any. Not to mention that would be the second time they updated their uniforms to better accommodate their growing bodies. So for now, they would just have to make due with what they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt and Setsuna sat down on the Gundam Meister's couch, ready to dig into their meal. Feldt cut them both a slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never get tired of this brand.\" The pinkette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't either.\" The brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake wasn't the only thing the two gluttons were going to eat, they also had ice cream, hamburgers, cookies, and hot dogs among other different types of food with them. Back when they were skinny, the cake alone would've been enough to leave them stuffed. Yet now, it was just one, albeit a big part, of a truly massive feast they were going to have. How times have changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt began eating forkfuls of her slice, pleasure evident on her chubby face. Setsuna on the other hand, was much less enthusiastic. He hadn't even started eating yet, as he knew that all this eating was going to make him even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt noticed how her friend was feeling immediately after she started eating. So she grabbed his fork, took a forkful out of his and then it held up to his face, a smile on her own face. Setsuna looked at Feldt. He then looked down at his gut and grabbed the sides of it, a disapproving expression on his face. Despite his dislike of his current weight, Feldt was a very persuasive person, and someone he cared for deeply. He hated how fat he was but he liked eating with Feldt a lot more. He ate the piece of cake, it tasted delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna looked down at his tummy again before he asked his pink-haired friend something.\"Can I talk to you about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it about your Gundam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta.\" It was clear to Setsuna that Feldt knew that he was about to voice some worries about his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright if we talk about it after we're done enjoying ourselves? I'd rather talk about normal stuff while we eat, if that's alright with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. By the way, do you want to watch a movie when we're done eating?\"</span></div></div>",

UURRRAP!\" Setsuna said, rubbing his gut as he also leaned back in the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter over an hour of gorging on sweets and other food, Feldt and Setsuna finally finished their feast and were both completely bloated. Their bellies had grown into even larger orbs of fat from all the food they were packed full of and now completely covered their laps. The two chubby Celestial Being members had to undo their belts, along with their pants' button and zippers to make room for their expanding tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsu \u2013UUUUURRRRP-, excuse me. Setsuna, what did you want to talk about?\" Feldt said as she placed a hand on her friend's over-fed tummy and began rubbing the big ball of fat, causing Setsuna to moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAP! I wanted to ask you if my performance as a Gundam Meister has changed.\" Setsuna then began rubbing Feldt's own orb-shaped belly, causing her to feel the same pleasure Setsuna was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Setsuna and Feldt were bloated after a large meal, they would give each other a soothing belly rub to ease the stuffed feeling in their big bellies, often eliciting a belch. Feldt was the one who initially suggested this, and while this was something they were both very shy about at first, as neither of them had experienced this type of contact with someone of the opposite gender before, they slowly grew more and more used to the feeling of bringing one's hand over another's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't, you're an amazing Gundam Meister, just like you've always been.\" Feldt could tell that Setsuna was specifically asking if his weight was affecting his performance but was too embarrassed to actually say anything that implied he was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna almost let out a sigh of relief. \"That's good to \u2013UURRP- know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRRP! Don't worry, your, um...\" Feldt was trying to think of a way she could mention Setsuna's weight without implying he was fat \"Well, this\" Feldt gave the Gundam Meister's tummy a few pats before she resumed rubbing it. \"isn't affecting your skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks, Feldt. That means a lot.\" Setsuna was blushing a bit from the attention she was bringing to his stomach, but her words still comforted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now, are you ready to watch that movie? Ms. Sumeragi and Mileina said it's really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pudgy Celestial Being members just lazed about for a while as they watched the movie, rubbing each others' packed stomachs as they belched up a storm. Not too long ago they would've been horribly embarrassed by this even while they were in a private room, and there was still a part of them that was embarrassed, but after spending so much time together eating and belching, this had become (mostly) normal to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi walked passed their room door, on her way to her own room after doing some planning in the briefing room, when she stopped in place after hearing a loud belch erupt from Feldt. Even with the door completely closed, Sumeragi could hear the belch perfectly fine. She walked a little closer to the door to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRAAP!\" Setsuna burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRAAP!\" Feldt let out a belch of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the sounds of young love.\" Sumeragi said to herself, a bemused expression on her face. \"Those two have really come a long way.\" The brunette added as she thought about how much more quiet they used to be. She resumed walking to her destination, pleased to see (and hear) Setsuna and Feldt were enjoying their time together. The brunette was all for the two becoming a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie ended and the credits began rolling, Feldt asked Setsuna what his thoughts on it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough almost as soon as she looked at the brunette, Feldt saw that he had fallen into a deep food coma, his belly moving in and out with every breath. Feldt let out a little giggle, Setsuna just looked too cute. Less then ten minutes ago, he was completely engrossed in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Setsuna.\" Feldt said with a small smile, feeling pretty sleepy herself. She rested her head on her friend's big, soft belly and began drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

While Tieria had a very feminine face and could put on a convincing female voice, he obviously didn't have breasts or any feminine curves. So to make the disguise complete, he would have to put on enough weight to have moobs big enough to be mistaken for female breasts, as well as some curvy hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way your disguise will work.\" Sumeragi said. She didn't go into this talk thinking for a second it would be easy to convince Tieria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not, I refuse.\" Tieria already had an upset look on his face. \"What you're asking for is insane, it would directly impede my abilities as a Gundam Meister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to lose the weight after the banquet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we're attacked while I'm a blob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking you to get that fat. And the other Meisters would be able to handle it. We've only come across small patrols, we don't even need three Gundams to handle them.\" The tactical forecaster explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly how fat would I need to get?\" Tieria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just big enough to get breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumeragi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred and fifty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria sighed. \"Only you would come up with a plan like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would gaining weight really be so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would.\" Tieria matter of factly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you ever wanted to just let go and enjoy yourself?\" Sumeragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not a glutton like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi was about to say something but a burp then slipped out of her mouth. Tieria just grinned smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have that much pizza.\" Sumeragi claimed, a slight blush to her cheeks. \"Back on topic, you're already willing to risk your life for reforming the world. Would gaining weight for a while be worse then that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-It wouldn't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a vital mission. If it's a success, we'll be bale to identify who's pulling the strings behind the A-Laws. Don't you think that's worth putting on weight for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi's words affected Tieria more then he or his waistline would've liked. He looked down at his flat abdominal and placed a hand on it. He let out a deep sigh. \"... I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tieria, I really appreciate this\" Sumeragi rested a hand on her friend's shoulder, a warm smile on her face. And with that, all the doubts the Gundam Meister had about this were washed away. He knew he made the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''m only doing my duty as a Gundam Meister of Celestial Being.\" he said. \"But you have to help me lose every single pound when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this is a team effort after all.\" The brunette said. \"Now let's fill your belly up.\" She said as she then gave Tieria a few pats on his soon to be huge stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nCurrent Weight: 134 lbs<br>\r\nTarget Weight: 250 lbs<br>\r\nWeight Difference: 116 lbs<br>\r\nTime Until Federation Banquet: 30 Days</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi took Tieria to her room, where she already had two whole extra pizza boxes, along with some soda and beer cans, placed on her coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've known you'd have all the food out before I even said yes.\" Tieria commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a tactical forecaster after all.\" Sumeragi joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not forecasting that I'll eat two whole pizzas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, the second one's for me. Can't have you hogging all the food. Unless you're up to a challenge.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you start stuffing yourself, let's get you weighed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria then weighed himself on a scale in Sumeragi's room, it read that he was 134 pounds. It was time to change that. Sumeragi cheered on and encouraged Tieria as he kept shoving more and more slices of pizza into his awaiting mouth. Being a total pig proved surprisingly challenging to Tieria. He already found himself feeling rather full after the first slice, were it not for his tactical forecaster friend's encouragement, he wouldn't have been able to finish the second slice. There were a few moments when he had to take a quick break and down what he had eaten with soda. Sumeragi would hand him a soda can when it looked like he needed a drink. She also gave him belly rubs during his breaks, the intimacy making him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria's belly slowly begun to take on a spherical shape. He often looked down down at it to see that it was a bit bigger then the last time. He honestly had no idea what to think. On one hand, he was taking steps towards becoming a fatass. On the other hand, becoming a fatass helped Celestial Being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his attempts at suppressing them, as he felt it would be impolite, ungraceful, and completely disgusting, Tieria burped quite a bit throughout his meal. His burps ranged from small to surprisingly big, but nearly all of them made him feel embarrassed. Often bringing a blush to his soon to be chubby cheeks. Sumeragi complimented him on the really big ones, which only embarrassed the Gundam Meister even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith five whole slices in the pit of his gurgling middle, the purplenette was on the verge of giving up, telling the brunette he felt like he was going to explode. Sumeragi fixed this by by undoing his belt, unbuttoning his pants, and undoing his zipper before giving him a belly rub to help him burp. This all embarrassed Tieria greatly and made him blush so hard his cheeks were practically scarlet. this was enough to give him the strength he need to conquer the pizza, so he muttered \"Thank you\" to Sumeragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm -UURAP- I'm dome.\" Tieria groaned once he finally ate an entire pizza. He then immediately flopped down on his back, basketball-sized stuffed stomach sticking straight up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you could do it, Tieria!\" With a big grin, Sumeragi gave Tieria's tummy a congratulatory slap. \"I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap forced a gigantic belch out of Tieria's lips. \"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi started rubbing her overfed friend's stomach, the stuffed pilot moaning in pleasure as the pain and aches in the pit of his middle were soothed away by the rhythmic moments Sumeragi's hand made. As Sumeragi's left hand helped Tieria, she used her right hand to help herself to some pizza. Seeing Tieria hog it all made her hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" Sumeragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria burped before he answered. \"I still feel like I'm going to ex -UUURRRP- explode. Don't poke my stomach too hard or I really will explode. UUUURRRP!\" He said with a weak smile, one of his rare attempts at telling a joke.</span></div></div>",

He was standing on a scale in Sumeragi room, the room's owner standing besides him. \"All that for just three pounds?\" Truth be told, he was relieved when he woke up that morning to find that today wasn't the day a newly developed potbelly was awaiting him. Though he knew that day would soon come. Or hopefully would soon come, for Celestial Being's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your metabolism is better then we thought.\" Sumeragi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can reach the target weight at this rate.\" Tieria said in a frustrated voice. \"Are we going to have to resort to some kind of drug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm prepared for this.\" Sumeragi informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats our new plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a diet plan set up that will make sure you've completely blown up before the month is over. Get ready for some hardcore dieting and exercise, Tieria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purplenette raised an eyebrow in skepticism. \"Exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Exercise 1: Couch Potato</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to slip into your pajamas.\" Sumeragi said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you I don't feel comfortable dressing like that in front of others.\" Tieria pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were in Tieria's room. Sumeragi told the pilot that she would meet him in his room in ten minutes, and to change into his pajamas. Tieria refused to do so, but Sumeragi hoped he would've come around by the time she came over with a bunch of snacks. Evidently that wasn't the case. As his idea of a compromise, Tieria only changed into his casual clothes. Minus the shoes, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactical forecaster sighed. \"Let's just start the exercise already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going to exercise in here? And more importantly, why would I want to if I'm trying to get fat?\" The pilot sassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to think outside of the box. Exercise isn't just running on a treadmill or lifting weights, it's anything someone does repeatedly to gain a skill or body they want.\" She explained as she placed a bunch of snacks and drinks on the coffee table in front of Tieria's couch. \"And your first exercise is being a couch potato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi then sat down on the couch. \"First of all, sit your soon-to-be-fat ass down.\" She joked with a grin as she gave the spot next to her a few pats. Tieria was visibly annoyed by her comment but he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up a snack.\" Sumeragi and Tieria both grabbed a bag of potato chips. Tieria also grabbed a soda can while Sumeragi grabbed a can of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put your feet up.\" They both looked at the coffee table and realized there was no room with all the snacks on it. \"... When there's room.\" Sumeragi then passed Tieria the TV remote. \"Put on something good.\" Tieria turned on the TV and flipped through the channels until he got to a show he and Sumeragi liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly, dig in!\" Sumeragi opened her bag and started eating. Tieria opened his own and started eating, only to immediately get a surprising reaction from Sumeragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing it all wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you pig out wrong?\" The bothered Gundam Meister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to keep it at your side and not look at it when you grab a handful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria felt like he had just gotten the most pointless advice ever. \"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're training you to scoff down food as second nature.\" The brunette clarified. \"Not only will that mean you're eating more often, but you'll feel less full if you don't realize exactly how much you're eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense. So I'm just supposed to lay around here all day, pigging out and watching TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only is that the behavior of a slob,\" Tieria grabbed a handful of chips without looking at the bag and ate it. \"it sounds boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it wasn't for either of them. They soon found themselves just kicking back and relaxing as they lazily watched TV, snacking the whole time. Despite what one would expect from their appearances, Sumeragi and Tieria could get very into TV. A marathon of a show they really liked was playing, they spent all the commercial breaks discussing their theories on what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've had -UUURP- a bit too much beer.\" Tieria snarked after Sumeragi told him a theory he found completely implausible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy making comments like that while you can, because after you really balloon up, you're not gonna be able to tell anyone they've had too much of anything.\" Sumeragi teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria blushed as he imagined how fat he'll be soon. Sumeragi was playing with his gigantic belly with the Gundam Meister completely powerless to stop her, she was teasing him the whole time and forcing him to belch loudly. \"If you want a picture of your future, Tieria, imagine my hand playing with your huge belly. Forever.\" The imaginary Sumeragi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, I think your theory makes a lot of sense.\" Tieria nervously said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we could come to an understanding.\" The smug brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria's flat middle once again ballooned up as it was filled with tasty, fattening snacks. Unlike before, Tieria didn't notice this at all. Sumeragi's was correct, Tieria was able to eat more if his focus was away from the food itself. Of course he would reach a point where he'd eaten so much he had to notice, but that point was much farther away now. He didn't even think anything of how much he was burping. Though to be fair, Sumeragi was burping a lot too and she wasn't bloated. Sumeragi would occasionally sneak a glance to see how Tieria's tummy was bloating up. She liked what she saw, Tieria looked good with a belly. She was looking forward to when he reached his target weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Tieria was finally too full to eat another bite. He moaned with a sick look on his face, which signaled to Sumeragi he hit his limit and the snacks had defeated him. The captain of the Ptolemaios undid the stuffed young man's buttons, zipper, and belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat... UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for your second exercise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats... UURRRAP! Whats that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Exercise 2: Nap Time</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's napping. Sleeping while your belly is digesting means your metabolism will slow down, that way you'll gain even more weight.\" The busty brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Tieria would complain that would be slobish of him, but he was way too stuffed to care. There was still one problem though. \"I don't think I can stand -URRAP- like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi playfully rolled her eyes. \"You're not gonna sleep on the bed when you're already on a perfectly -UUURAP- comfortable couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieria burped again and then started laying down on his back. His right hand on his poor tummy, and his left arm hanging limply by his side. Sumeragi rubbed Tieria's stuffed and aching belly as he burped up a storm. She did some belly play too, mostly stuff like patting or jiggling her friend's tummy, but at one point she poked him in his bellybutton, forcing out a loud, ungraceful belch from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thoughts on the fatass lifestyle so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda fun, I guess.\" Tieria meant to say that, but what he did end up saying was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUURRRRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya got that right!\" Sumeragi gave a smile and thumbs up. She gave her friend's belly a few pats, making him belch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Feldt was walking by Tieria's room when she heard a huge belch, startling her. She stopped to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" Sumeragi beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Tieria said right before he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight, Tieria.\" Sumeragi pat his belly a few times again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he doing so far, Miss Sumeragi?' Feldt said as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. In just a few weeks he'll be a real fatass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeldt stared at Tieria, the Gundam Meister in a deep sleep, hand still on his belly as he snored loudly. His tummy went up and down with every breath. Attracted to the belly, Feldt rested her hand on it. She got goosebumps<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A real fatass...\" She echoed as she thought of what her friend will look like then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait until he was one.</span></div></div>",

Just as she feared, she had gotten fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fighting ended Noin settled down with Milliardo, her lover. While they both loved their new lifestyle Noin absolutely hated that it had caused her to gain so much weight. Milliardo turned out to be a surprisingly good chef and would cook wondrous and incredibly large meals for Noin every day which she would happily devour. While Noin has never really had a particularly large appetite Milliardo's cooking was just so delicious that she couldn't help but eat everything Milliardo would prepare for her which was always a lot. The buttons on her clothes would usually pop off during her binges if she didn't unbutton them the moment they started to feel tight. Whenever she wore a belt during her meals it would be busted by her swollen stomach if she didn't undo it before then. Regardless of what shirt she was wearing it would always ride up on her bloated belly during her meals, exposing the orb of fat which embarrassed her quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucrezia Noin possessed the body one would naturally expect from someone possessing her appetite and capacity for food. Her massive belly was easily the dominating feature of her new physique, being incredibly soft to the touch. If one were to feel her flabby midsection, they would find it to be velvet-soft skin, free of lumps and craters. Whenever she walked, Noin's belly was constantly in motion, jiggling and bouncing to constantly bring a blush to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of her cheeks, Noin's face had not been spared by her gain. Chubby cheeks, a small albeit noticeable double-chin and softer lines changed the strikingly sharp beauty of her face, making her seem warmer and delightfully adorable. Looking downwards, one would see that nothing about Noin's frame had been spared. Her breasts, the firm and perky things they had been before, had blossomed under the steady influx of calories her new diet had provided, becoming quite large indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass, however, was also much more developed and broadened. Rivaling her stomach for the title of being her dominant feature, Noin now had a bubble butt which matched her giant gut jiggle for jiggle. Velvet-soft and malleable, whenever she sat down now Noin was sure to leave an imprint on any cushioned couch or chair she graced with that rotund rump. Her arms and legs had also grown flabbier, her arms being pillowy like marshmallows while her legs would press against each other all the time. Both sets of limbs had lost all their former muscle tone, washed away under waves of snacks and blubber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoin lifted her shirt up and looked at her bare belly. She gave it a big slap causing it to jiggle and wobble quite a lot. She blushed heavily at the sight. Noin couldn't help but imagine piloting a mobile suit with a belly this jiggly. She cringed at the thought of her belly jiggling and wobbling during a tough battle. She was definitely going to have to start working out soon. She really wished she wasn't such a glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is ready, Lucrezia.\" Milliardo shouted to his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoin's belly growled loudly. She gave an annoyed sigh and placed a hand on it in frustration. It was time to stuff herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there.\"</span></div></div>",

The table was absolutely filled with pizza, ice cream, cookies, hamburgers, soda, hotdogs, donuts, potato chips, and cake among others. While Noin wasn't a stranger to large and delicious feasts Milliardo has truly outdone himself this time. Noin's mouth began to water at the sight. She was going to stuff herself and she was going to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy it.\" Milliardo stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Noin said. \"Thank you for cooking this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Though I wish I could make a better meal for you.\" Milliardo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If a meal this good is your average then I can't wait to eat your best.\" Noin said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too kind.\" Milliardo was smiling as well. He then left the room to enjoy his much smaller dinner. While he would've liked to stay and eat with his lover he knew that she was rather embarrassed by her gluttony and would probably prefer if he didn't see her while she pigged out. He didn't think it was anything to be ashamed of but he believed Noin just needed some time to get used to her new appetite and weight and that it was best for her to enjoy her feasts in private until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoin quickly began devouring her massive dinner. She started with pizza along with some hotdogs and hamburgers with lots of soda to wash it down. As soon as she finished her first slice the gluttonous bluenette simply ate whatever she felt like, no longer even bothering to finish whatever she was eating before shoving some completely different in her mouth. All the food and soda caused Noin to belt out some loud burps though she apologized after each one. Her shirt began to rise up as her belly filled up with food, exposing her deep bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through her feast, Noin let out a sigh of relief and a large belch as the button on her pants popped off and her belt snapped in two. Noin's bloated belly felt much better without the pressure them on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better. UUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Noin said before continuing her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to eat and burp, Noin began to wonder how much fatter she would be after her dinner digested. As much as Noin hated gaining weight it was worth it to taste all this delicious food. But that didn't she was going to give up on losing weight. She definitely going to hit the gym soon. She was going to get back in shape, no matter how hard it was. But for now, she was going to enjoy a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Noin finally finished her feast. She leaned back in her chair and let out a giant belch, hands on her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Noin still had her manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoin rubbed her big belly as she belted out powerful burps. Noin had a satisfied smile on her face, this dinner was one of the best she had ever had. She gave her big belly a slap, causing her to belt out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Noin said, giving her gut a few pats. \"Delicious. UUURRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikazuki leaned back in his chair and released a very loud and satisfied belch as he rubbed his bloated gut. He had just finished eating a massive meal with Kudelia, who was equally bloated, at the restaurant of a hotel they were staying at in Dort 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your manners aren't the best but I was still hoping you'd cut back on the belching at least little bit where we're in public.\" Kudelia said. While the blonde wasn't overly polite she still had standards. \"Would it really be \u2013UUUURRRP-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she was trying to undermine her own point, Kudelia was cut off by her own belch that was of equal magnetite as Mikazuki's. She slapped a hand over her mouth, blushing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me! Sorry about that.\" The blonde stated in an embarrassed and ashamed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Mikazuki said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Kudelia said, relived that her friend hadn't taken offense. She knew it would be completely out-of-character for him to do so but she was still worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKudelia looked at their table, once nearly overflowing with a wide assortment of food, it was now littered with empty plates, a good amount of which Mikazuki had licked clean. She sighed, they really did pig out today, not that that was unusual behavior from them. They had both began to take clear advantage of the amount of food they had available. While it wasn't shocking that Mikazuki ate so much, given how long he had gone mostly eating food of both much lower quality and quantity, but Kudelia was not someone most would expect such gluttony from. At first it just started out as her picking up whatever leftovers there where when her friend was done eating, as they usually ate together, but it slowly escalated to her just plain feasting alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of their gluttony, Kudelia and Mikazuki had both gotten pretty fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikazuki weighed 217 pounds and most of his weight had gone right to his tummy. It was an almost completely spherical ball that was very large and jiggled in a gelatinous fashion with every one of Mikazuki's footfalls. In stark contrast to the toned abs he once had that were nearly hard as rocks, Mikazuki's orb of adipose was very soft and malleable. The brunette's big belly was on full display whenever he took off his shirt and jacket to fight on land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot's once toned and hard pecs had grown into a pair of soft and flabby man boobs that rested atop his chubby belly. And much like said chubby belly, they were completely exposed whenever he was undressed to pilot on land, eliciting quite the blush from Kudelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikazuki's butt's tone was completely gone now and it had been replaced with soft fat. It was much bigger now and made the pilot seat for Gundam Barbatos rather snug. The obese Gundam pilot's butt was nearly as soft and jiggly as his gut, something that was proven whenever he ran. His arms and legs were in much the same state, they had gone from toned to rather flabby and chunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was hit the least hard. While his cheeks were softer and he now had a double chin, he didn't lose as much of his face's vestige as he could've.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKudelia weighed 213 pounds and her weight had mostly spread evenly. Her tummy was incredibly soft and almost as big as Mikazuki's. Unlike her friend's, which was all one big mass, the blonde's stomach was divided into two tiers by a large roll in the middle, making it a double belly. There was a noticeable collection of side rolls and the soft orb had a deep bellybutton. Kudelia's belly hung down slightly and was very jiggly, especially when she was running for whatever the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKudelia's chest was always of a respectable size but now it was even bigger. The blonde had some pretty impressive boobs that jutted out from her chest almost as much as her belly did. They were very jiggly and had already forced Kudelia to get a bigger bra. While most girls in her situation would be very pleased with this development, Kudelia was rather shy when it came to things like this and hated how much attention her now much bigger breasts drew to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's ass was now a giant bubble butt that was jiggly and soft. Whenever the blonde sat down in a chair, her huge butt would completely fill it up, with some of her ass even spilling off the sides. Kudelia's legs were now very wide and meaty. They constantly rubbed together and would wobbled slightly with every step the blonde made. Kudelia's legs were connected to some rather impressive hips that showed off her curves well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's face was not spared from the effects of her countless binges. Her cheeks had chubbed up a lot and were now very round and soft. The blonde's face also now possessed a noticeable double chin. Such puffy cheeks would normally make it rather hard for one to be taken seriously but Kudelia's words and demeanor more then made up for it. Whenever she wasn't being her usual dorky self and blushing up a storm that is. Plus, her chubby cheeks actually made her face look even more inviting and suit her kind and gentle personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the giant meal they had both consumed, their guts were now even bigger then usual and nearly took up the entirety of their laps. Kudelia had to unbutton her coat and both her and Mikazuki had to undo their pants' zipper and button to make room for their gigantic and bloated bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should keep burping if your stomach hurts.\" Mikazuki advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burping helps your stomach feel better. UUURRRRP! So if you've got a stomachache you should burp as much as you can.\" Mikazuki explained as if he was not suggesting that Kudelia do something that most would consider absolutely disgusting. He then demonstrated his suggestion by releasing another loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKudelia was truly surprised by what she heard. Never had she imagined that someone would ever suggest that she throw all manners to the wind and belch in public. Granted, they were the only customers currently there but still. And yet what her friend said made sense. Burping really did help her belly feel better. So she thought that maybe she should burp more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKudelia let out a loud burp and started blushing even harder then she did before. The only response she got was another sizable belch from Mikazuki. Kudelia sighed, she couldn't believe what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, Kudelia and Mikazuki belted out as many big burps as possible, each one helping to ease the pressure in their bellies. They rubbed, pat, poked, pressed, and even sometimes shook their bellies to get themselves to burp. Some of the belches they summoned were so loud that they shocked Kudelia. The soothing rubs they gave their bellies also helped a great deal to ease their pain. Burping and rubbing your tummy was quite an unusual way to get rid of a stomachache but it was proving to be a very effective one. As slowly but surely, the pain was leaving their swollen bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, yet another loud sound filled the air but it wasn't a belch. Instead it was a yawn coming from Kudelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikazuki, UUURRAP! I'm feeling pretty sleepy.\" The fat blonde said in a drowsy tone. \"I'm going to rest in our room for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! I think I'll take a nap too.\" Mikazuki replied as he rubbed his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overeating does make you sleepy, doesn't it?\" Kudelia giggled a bit, giving her tummy a few pats. \"Oh, and thanks for suggesting all that belching, it really worked. UUURRRP!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Misa had always been a big fan of Gundam and video games for as long as she could remember. Every day she would visit the local game center, Irato Game Park, and stay there for hours playing the various video games there. While they were all fun to play, her favorite game by far was Gunpla Battle. She'd been hooked on it ever since she'd first played it. She had even customized a High Grade Akatsuki Gundam, a personal favorite of hers, into her own custom Gunpla, Azalea Gundam. She truly was a big fan of Gundam and video games, in more ways then one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Misa was always rather chubby, she currently weighed 198 lbs. Her tummy was a large ball of adipose that was incredibly soft and malleable. Her belly went past the waistband of her short shorts and was quite jiggly, something that was proven whenever she exerted herself in any major way. The brunette's ass was also rather big, it filled up nearly any chair she sat down in and was almost as jiggly as her belly. She had also very chunky legs, that were very close to to touching each other and would wobble ever so slightly whenever she walked. Misa's boobs were the smallest part of her, a source of annoyance for her, but they were still of a decent size and rested on top of her tummy, she just wished that they were as big as most chubby girls' breasts. And finally, there was Misa's face. Her chin was double-tiered  and she had very round and chubby cheeks that were practically puffed-up in appearance, this helped to make her moments of childish anger even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisa walked into Irato Game Park as she happily munched on a large pretzel, her tummy giving a bit of a jiggle. As always, she was greeted by Info-Chan, the game center's workbot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for visiting again today, Ms. Misa.\" Info-Chan said in her robotic yet warm and friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thank you for the warm welcome you give me everyday, Info-Chan.\" Misa said after taking another bite out of her pretzel. \"I'm going straight to the simulator today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new customer entered the simulator just a little bit ago. Play will commence shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" The game center's business wasn't the greatest right now, thanks to some tough competition from Times Universe, so Misa was very glad to hear that it had gotten a new customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby brunette bolted over to the simulator and saw a boy her age, give or take a month or two, that was just about to start playing. His Gunpla was very well-made. I twas a customized G-3 Gundam with a GM III head and backpack. It was colored in the traditional Gundam color scheme, except the blue and red was replaced by a bright orange. The modifications didn't stop there, it had decals and emblems on it. Most of the emblems were some variation or 3 or G-3 Gundam, aside from the military rank on the sides of the head and the words \"Gundam Breaker\" on the right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gunpla's armaments were also different, the shield was the G-3 Gundam's painted orange with the Gundam Breaker emblem on it and a large white number 3 right below said emblem. It had the Beam Machine Gun of the Powered GM Cardigan painted like the rest of the model and the 00 Raiser's GN Sword III with the orange replacing the blue, the glowing light green outline of the blade replaced with a glowing light orange, and the Gundam Breaker emblem on the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a very well-made Gunpla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisa looked again at the young man who was piloting the Gunpla.

My belly needs -UUUURRRP- more!\" Iori roared like a mad women as she gobbled up more and more cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might be enjoying the food -UURRP- a little too much, Iori.\" Yui said, rubbing her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we all enjoyed the food a little too much.\" Kyosuke gave his stomach a few pats for emphasis. \"UURAP! But yeah, Iori's got us beat in the enthusiasm department like usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo celebrate their victory over Shougo and by extension Shield Of Laplace, Side 0 held a little party themselves with tons of food. At this point, everyone was stuffed to the brim, except Iori. They all looked as if they had swallowed a giant watermelon whole (and felt like it too), their bellies being big orbs that covered up their laps completely. Yet despite this, Iori was still eating and eating, with the same attitude she had during Gunpla Battle no less. All of them had undone their buttons and zippers to make room for their bellies, but Iori hadn't, as she wnated to actually break them with her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying it too much?! Ha! UUURRAP! I'm the only one here eating as much as she should! UUUURRP!\" Iori replied before immediately eating more ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Iori would mind her manners while eating, but in this state she couldn't care less. She didn't mind all the foodstuff coating her cheeks, lips, and clothes. She would even belch loudly without shame, in fact she was actually proud of some of her really loud burps, not that she was the only one impressed by them. The brunette was eating at a very fast rate, the others were wondering how she hadn't given herself a really bad stomachache at this point. Iori would often do her maniacal laughs that she would usually do during Gunpla Battle, except here they often interrupted by her own burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis loud belch that was bigger then all of Iori's came from the most unlikely source: Marika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, E-Excuse m-me.\" The purplenette stuttered out, lowering her hands from her mouth, her face beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Marika!\" Kyosuke complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, thank you. T-That was a good, er, thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not like we should be worrying about manners during a party.\" Yui answered for Kyosuke. \"I think you actually outdid Iori there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIori immediately stopped eating the second she heard that, her sinister smile vanished. \"She did not! My belches way louder! They're as loud as the Atlas Gundam's Railgun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta side with Yui.\" Kyosuke said. \"Marika's was way louder then your best burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm on Iori's side.\" Marika said, rubbing her bloated belly to ease her tummyache. \"So can we please, er, stop talking about m-my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, which it is NOT!\" Iori's maniacal grin returned. \"Then I'll just have to belt out my biggest belch yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIori grabbed a two litter soda bottle and started chugging. Her chugging skills were just as impressive as her binging skills. After chugging down one fourth of the bottle in one go, Iori removed the bottle from her lips and slammed it back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it brewing in my stomach! Here goes!\" She then gave her gut a fierce slap. \"UUUUUUURRRRRRAAP! Ahh, now that's a belch! Ready to admit I'm the winner now?\" She gave her gut another slap in pride, eliciting a smaller burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was louder then marika's burp but Yui and Kyosuke were having too much fun messing with Iori to stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is pretty loud but I'm not sure if it's louder then Marika's best.\" Iori teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need Marika to demonstrate her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She-She won! I-I concede!\" Marika cut them off, hoping to end all discussions of her belching as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Marika, Iori was satisfied with her \"victory\" and the subject ended. The rest of Iori's binge went by mostly without incident. Except of course for when she returned to her normal personality the second she was done eating, her gut was even more swollen then the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I'm stuffed. I can't believe I ate so much. UUURRRP! Excuse me. \" The brunette said as she leaned back in her chair and softly massaged her belly. Fortunately for her berserker side but unfortunately for her normal side, leaning back caused her stomach to reach it's apex, sending the buttons on her uniform and skirt flying, startling Marika. Iori's blushed as she looked down at her big, exposed belly in silent horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think just a few seconds ago you would've been happy to -URAP- see that.' Kyosuke teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I ever be happy to see this?\" Iori obliviously said. \"Ugh, I have a really bad stomachache. UUUURRRP! Excuse me.\" Iori continued to belch loudly with embarrassment instead of pride and gently give herself a much needed belly rub.</span></div></div>",

Any character from any show or game can gain weight, provided that they are at least in their teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The only fetishes that are allowed are weight gain, its sub-genres, and minor slob behavior like belching and some messiness though don't go too far with the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Keep everyone in-character unless there is a (good) reason given for the change in personality. e.g., Audrey is more open to Banagher due to spending her childhood with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sex is fine but don't make it non-consensual or have it happen constantly. I know it sounds odd but some people are more attracted to their fetish then sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Straight and gay pairings are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. I noticed some people are into this so feel free to make a Mobile Suit fat. No justification, explanation or even acknowledgement required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. No character death unless you're adapting a scene that has it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Making gaining realistic. No overly rapid weight gain, no weight gain through methods other then eating, and don't have someone reach an impossible weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. It's Puru, NOT Ple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, the rules are much less restrictive then they seem. Two of them are just giving you permission to do something after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just to clarify two thing, even if you pick a girl you can still have males gain weight and vice versa. And if you have someone start out fat, don't make them obese. They do have to gain weight after all, just make them chubby if you want them to be overweight from the start. This only applies to the protagonist though, feel free to have anyone else start out obese.</td>",
