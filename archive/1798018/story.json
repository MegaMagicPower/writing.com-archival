She had a red cape and a red mask covering her eyes. The letters \"SG\" were on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's SneezeGirl\" the robbers said in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know better than rob banks in this town\" she said \"Don't you know that I'm allergic to crime?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot her\" one of the robbers shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled out their guns and aimed them at the heroine. She inhaled deeply, her nostrils stretched out and sucked in the weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our guns\" one of them said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....Ah....AH-CHOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneezed with tremendous force. The guns flew out of her nose and the robbers flew back into a wall. She sneezed again sending a thick stream of snot over them, cementing them to the wall. She wiped her nose on a corner of her cape as people around her cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should keep you there until the police arrive\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bank workers took the money back inside and waited for the police to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for everything SneezeGirl\" one of the workers said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all in a day's work\" she said \"Now I'm off....Ah....Ah.....AH-CHOOOOOO\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneezed herself into the air and went flying through the sky. After a few minutes of being airborne, she landed safely in front of a house. She dove into some bushes, changed clothes, and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time for dinner\" Jane said to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.......</span></div></div>",

She was just a sophomore in high school, not exactly on top of the food chain, but Jane had always been self-confident. Jane had plenty of friends and not many people made fun of her, and even when they did, she always did her best not to let it bother her. However, there was one thing that always did manage to get on her nerves. It was peak allergy season, all the huge amount of pollen in the air was making bothering Jane's nose. She continued forward, but she started to frown at the sudden itch in her nose. Jane rubbed her index finger back and forth under her nostrils, trying to deaden the irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Jane, allergy attacks didn't always end in disaster. If she could keep her sneezes small, they wouldn't activate her powers and no one would catch on to her secret identity. However, if she did succumb to a powerful enough sneeze, she might accidentally end up using one of her sneeze powers and blowing her cover. On top of all that, if she had an allergy attack when she <i>did</i> want to use her powers, it would make them very difficult to control. Thankfully, she managed to get inside quickly before too long, and the school's air conditioning started to soothe her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot worrying about her allergies anymore, Jane made her way to her first class. Chemistry, not her favorite, but she still did her best to enjoy it. She sat down in her usual seat along the wall farthest from the door and next to one of her friends. However, her nose suddenly started to itch again. Jane looked around for the cause and finally noticed that the window right next to her seat, the window that was always closed, was actually open for once.</span></div></div>",

But just as she placed her hand on it to swing it closed, a gust of wind loaded with pollen surged through, and she couldn't help taking in more than her nose could take. She pushed the window shut even as she began to lose control of her breathing, and she hurried back to her seat where she kept a small supply of tissues, face contorting as her breath hitched.<br>\r\n\"ehh... ahhh... aaAHH...\"<br>\r\nShe fumbled for a tissue and brought one to her nose just in time to catch the first sneeze.<br>\r\n\"Atischoo!

ACHOO! heh..eh.. ih- Asishoo!\"<br>\r\nJane was trying to restrain her sneezes as best she could, but some of them were coming so hard on the heels of the sneeze before them that she barely had time to gasp a breath, let alone reduce the power of the sneeze that followed. And she didn't dare fully stifle them, not only because the power of the sneezes would hurt her, but because she didn't want to trap the pollen inside her nose for any longer than necessary.<br>\r\nShe blew her nose, hoping to clear some of it out, but she could sense the futility of it. Already she could feel the next wave of sneezes building, her nose feeling almost like a separate entity as it twitched and flared, desperate to expel the irritants dancing within it. There was only one thing that could happen next.<br>\r\n\"Ah.. ah...ihh...<i>eehhh</i>....\"</span></div></div>",

Ahhhh...uh. Ahhh...aaaaahhhh...<i>ehhhhhh</i>...guh. Wuh... huh...heh...heh...<i>heh</i>...\" the sneeze built agonisingly slowly, each build-up bringing her a little closer to relief. But as it grew, Jane suddenly felt her powers beginning to stir. She tried to keep them from fully activating, but to no avail.

Instead, Jane's super sneeze blew the stall door right off its hinges, and everything in the bathroom on the other side of it was completely smashed. One of the sinks was split in half, its broken faucet spurting water into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" Jane said, placing her finger under her nose. After giving her nostrils a rub, she slipped out the bathroom window. Unfortunately, there was simply no way this would go unnoticed.

Now all that remained was to find Sneeze Girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the staff meeting, Mr. Frieze headed to his private office. He was confident no one would disturb him there, and even if they did, no one would suspect anything if they simply saw him painting a portrait.

It was certainly the way she had to go to catch up to the gang, but what she saw didn\u2019t bode well for her nose. It looked as though this had once been a factory, and long plastic sheets filled the space just inside the door. Perhaps they had once acted as dust-guards, protecting the rest of the building from machine by-products, but all they had done to dust in recent years was gather it. There was no way she was getting through that without stirring up a cloud. But it had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneezegirl took a deep breath through her mouth, and began to make her way through, as quietly as she could. The dust swirled around her, making her eyes itch and her nose burn. It was all she could do to quash the reflex to sniff, knowing that that would just make everything worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices were clearer now. Sneezegirl moved close to a large piece of machinery and listened. She would have to take a breath soon, she knew, but\u2026 She lifted a corner of her cape and tried to wipe the worst of the dust away from her prickling nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job today, lads.\u201d Came a voice she didn\u2019t recognise. \u201cThe Big Man will be pleased.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the robbers had a bigger boss? That was interesting. Sneezegirl\u2019s lungs were bursting. She took a fresh breath of air. Well, not so fresh. Dust-filled would be a more accurate adjective. Sneezegirl pressed a finger to her nose as, despite her best efforts of will, her breath began to hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>hh!</i> hhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Tam.\u201d That was one of the robbers she had followed from the bank. \u201cI hope that means he\u2019ll be good to his word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cah\u2026ah\u2026 <i>ahhh</i>\u2026\u201d Sneezegirl crushed her finger viciously against her septum, and prayed. Miraculously enough, the urge seemed to recede. Her nose still tickled, though. That sneeze wouldn\u2019t be delayed for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d said the first voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your cut. Let\u2019s have it on the table, share it out here and now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed as good a cue as any. Sneezegirl stepped around the corner.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she was within arm's reach, a small pouch rolled out of his sleeve and right into his hand. He quickly tore it open and threw its contents right in Sneeze Girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...

Everything within a good 30 feet of her had been covered in green, sticky snot. Even the woman the counter was dripping with it, though she seemed more shocked than angry. The insides of Jane's nose still felt sticky and slimy, so she whipped out her handkerchief and gave a good, loud blow.

She picked it up and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gesundheit, Sneeze Girl. Check inside the rose for the dice, but you're still not getting me. Better luck next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a grunt of frustration, Sneeze Girl tossed the note back into the snot and turned the rose over. She shook it out into her hand and the two ornate dice fell into her palm. They appeared to be real, so she supposed that was good enough for now. Sneeze Girl was angry that The Gambler managed to get away from her yet again, but this was better than nothing. Sighing to herself, she headed back toward the mall parking lot.</span></div></div>",

AH!!\" She almost sneezed but the cloud of dust that was summoned in the air did the worst trick ever. \"Hah-CHOO!!\" She sneezed a bit loudly into her hand. This startled some of the classmates, including the Goth Girl, which she had a sinking feeling in her heart. The Goth Girl neither looked up nor read along. She read her manga as if she didn't care about the government policies or anything special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's blue eyes looked towards the heterochromatic girl. The \"goth\" had one green eye and one purple eye, as if she were some kind of zombie. The goth girl didn't realize what kind of action she was going through, though she had to face the music. Tiffany's long, blonde hair bounced as she slammed the textbook onto her desk. \"The page's 342.\" Her British accent rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany appeared more than annoyed. \"All right, all right, Treinta. Dammit...\" She shuffled through the pages towards page 341 and 342--the place to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane began reading along with Miss Felesha Gordie and kept the handkerchief she used earlier to her nose. Treinta Nanario Halogen was one of the biggest anime fans in the school. She was very interested in Jane.

Still holding her handkerchief under her nose, Jane headed into the girls' bathroom and checked to make sure she was alone. After looking into each stall to make sure the bathroom was empty, Jane closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Then, Jane blew her nose. For a brief instant, Jane lost control of her sneeze powers, which caused her nose blow to be so loud and powerful that it could be heard from anywhere in the school. Even worse, once Jane finished blowing her nose, she saw that her handkerchief was full of thick, sticky snot, the same kind she usually only sneezed out when using her Snot Storm power. Frowning to herself, Jane threw the handkerchief away and headed back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreinta immediately noticed how embarrassed Jane looked when she returned to the classroom.

Now she needed to find the source of her danger sneeze. The itch in her nose gave her an idea of the general direction, but she needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming very carefully, she sneezed down at the roof \u201cah\u2026CHOO!\u201d and propelled herself straight up in the air, praying for low wind speeds. From this height, it was obvious what had alerted her super-senses. People were pouring out of a building a few blocks away in panic, stumbling and running into each other as they went. Landing back on the rooftop, Jane re-aimed and \u201cah\u2026AH\u2026 ACHOOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneeze Girl landed atop a van in the street facing the scene. She recognised the building as the City\u2019s largest jewellery store- hardly surprising that it had been somebody\u2019s target. A strange, brownish fog filled the widows, and she couldn\u2019t tell anything of what was going on inside. <br>\r\nBut by far the most disturbing sight here was the crowd who had fled the building. Jane now knew why they had been running so clumsily- almost all of them were being racked with fits of sneezing! All over the square in front of her were people with their faces buried in tissues and handkerchiefs, trying to appease their unhappy noses. A desk clerk was curled up on the ground, whole body shaking with each new eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA police car was at the scene, but one of its occupants was bent over the bonnet, gripped by violent paroxysms of helpless sneezing. His partner seemed to be calling for backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneeze Girl dropped down next to one of the women who had fled the building and was now hovering some little distance away. She was a sneezy mess, eyes streaming and irregular spasms convulsing her gently curved nose. But, sympathetic as Jane might feel, Sneeze Girl needed to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuh-rob-atishew! Ah\u2026ah\u2026 tishoo!\u201d The woman held up a trembling finger, before taking the bridge of her nose between thumb and forefinger of her other hand and pinching hard. Amazingly, this seemed to stop her nose in its tracks. I should take lessons from this woman, Jane thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree of them.\u201d the woman gasped. Her hand hovered above her nose, ready to resume pinching if necessary. It probably would be. Her nostrils were flaring in a way that reminded Sneeze Girl of impatient horses, twitching to be off. She spoke quickly, her voice increasingly distorted by the interference of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWore masks. Can of- heh\u2026 s-some sort of ga-ah<i>hh</i>\u2026\u201d the fingers clamped back onto her rebellious nose and squeezed hard.

Everyone-\u201d and the woman gestured to her current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly feeling that she had got her message across, she pulled a packet of tissues out of her pocket with her off hand, then released her nose. It was like breaching a dam. The sneeze that she had been holding off tore out of her, drawing its siblings behind it in a ceasless cascade<br>\r\n\u201cAHTISHEWW! <i>TISHew</i>! shoo! AHtishew!

Her eyes were prickling like crazy, and she could feel her sinuses going into overdrive.

Worst of all, it was still connected to her nostrils. Jane tried to separate the string of snot from her nose, but it was stuck in place. She tried to pull it out of her nose, but it wouldn't budge.

Penelope gave her a kiss on the forehead, and then she stood up on the bed to reach the ceiling. Penelope grabbed the trail of snot and yanked on it, but it was still stuck firmly in place.

It was spring, and the pollen was in the air.

But the, one of the other students - I didn't know her name - she sneezed. Seeing and hearing that had an effect on me - it got my tickle unstuck, and I had to concentrate on holding it back. By the end of that class, two other students sneezed, but I didn't see them, so it wasn't as bad as the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But things got worse when I got to my second class that day. Not only were more students sneezing, they were sneezing more frequently. It was torture, seeing them all sneeze to their hearts' content while I had to hold back or risk a crisis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" said Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My third class that day was thankfully my last one,\" continued Penelope. \"There wasn't a single sneeze from any of the other students.

Or you, of course.\" Jane blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I held back. The mucus had filled up my nose to the point that I had to breathe through my mouth with my teeth shut. I was hyperventilating by that point. Then, blessedly, class was dismissed. I was first out the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realized that if I went back to my apartment, my pent-up sneeze would cause some suspicious damage. So instead, I ran from the campus to the local landfill. It was farther away than my apartment, and the jog took two hours, but it was better than the alternative. When I got there, the place had closed up, but I was able to scootch in through a hole under the chain link fence. And then, once I realized I was alone, I braced myself against the fence, and let the tickle have its way. I just went, simply, \"KER-CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!\" ;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane laughed at her mother's fake sneeze, but the sight of it made her a bit itchier. She tried to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing on the news about it the next day,\" said Penelope. \"Nothing about the tidal wave of garbage that I created.\" She smiled. \"You know, I wish I'd gotten into the art scene. I could have taken a picture and called it my masterpiece.\" Jane giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have loved to see your masterpiece,\" said Jane. \"Uh-oh... the tickle is coming back...\"</span></div></div>",
