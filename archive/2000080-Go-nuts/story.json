My wife is a lawyer and you should be thrown in the slammer for fraud Oz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswalda makes a run for it, but before she could get away she was sucked up by a tornado. As she screamed she saw a strange distortion. It seemed like she was being pulled into the clouds. Oswalda then passes out. The tornado spits her out in a lake in Oz. Oswalda woke up and tried swimming to shore, but she was pulled under by the nymphs of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help! *Gurgle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oswalda was struggling for her life a bear was heading to the lake to go spear fishing. The bear stopped in his tracks when he saw Oswalda drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to save that poor girl. Don't worry I'll save you!\" The bear  shouted as he tightened his bathing suit before jumping into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear swims out to Oswalda and rescues her from the nymphs. He then performs CPR on Oswalda. When Oswalda awakens she is shocked to see an anthropomorphic bear standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are you? You speak like a person, but you're a bear. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I speak. All anthros can speak. Where did you come from? You're not from Oz I reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oz? You mean the story? Wait my name is Oz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be talking about the ancient history of Oz. One hundred years have passed since someone from another world came to Oz. Also what did you mean that your name is Oz? Only the wizard mentioned in the texts who saved Oz from the wicked witches was named Oz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is that my name is Oswalda Zimmer. My initials form my nickname.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Intriguing, a new prophecy speaks of a witch from another world who destined to save our world. \" Said a a man dressed in a green cybernetic suit with a white jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am one of the wizard's who watches over Oz. I am Maverick Westley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're the Wizard of the West!\" Oswalda exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. My cousins look after the South and East of Oz. Only the ruler of Oz loops after the Northern region of Oz. Unfortunately my aunt died without an heir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What his lordship says is true. I am Theodore Bearsevelt by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you but I have to find a way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry,  but it's impossible right now. Maybe my cousin Elvis Easley can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Really? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah he's in the Emerald City. I can take you on my B.R.O.O.M.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Broom? Don't witches ride those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not a broom. It's a B.R.O.O.M. It's the latest  hover cycle created by Oz Tech. Sorry Theo, but I don't have room for three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's ok my lord. I drove my Zipcar here anyway. I have to prepare for winter. Once winter comes I'll be ready to hibernate. I tried staying awake last winter,  but utilities are too expensive. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wish you luck my friend. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Oswalda and Maverick take off for Emerald City. As soon as they arrive they are greeted by...</span></div></div>",
