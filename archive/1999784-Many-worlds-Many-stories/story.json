Mages, Wizards, and Witches from around the globe come to my den and try to tame me. After all, having a <b>dragon</b> as your main mode of transportation is considered very <i>impressive</i> in the Mage world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when a boy/girl (you choose) at the young age of 12 came to my den. He/She knew no magic at all, and just wanted to see if the legends were true. If there really was a dragon the size of their house living in a cavern only a few miles away. I liked him/her very much, much more than any of those mages, and decided to show them the world. So, I did the most sensible thing and kidnapped them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story line, follow Harley the dragon, and his rider, around the world as they run from hunters, survive storms, and overcome the odds of the wildlands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds interesting.

Now here are the two earths to choose from. If none of them are to your liking then you may choose to add in your own alternate Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechno Gladiator Earth- In an alternate future, after the outcome of the 2016 election in the United States, the people were distraught with who was in power and decided to revolt. Prior to the revolt many Americans and their allies disapproved of the former president's tendency to act like a complete child and make decisions that would bring the country to ruin. After a second civil war broke out in the USA other countries began undergoing similar civil wars the people's fear of terrorists and their feeling abandoned by the politicians added to their anger. One hundred years later the Earth has transformed into a world where technology is highly advanced, but brutality is intense due to each country using what is known as the War Games to settle discourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe War Games features human warriors who have been genetically altered into fighting machines and who wield high-tech weapons meant for combat. These men and women are educated from childhood by the military. It is said that many high ranking officers in the military have competed in the War Games themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistortion Crisis Earth- In an alternate universe the Earth faces a new worldwide problem. In the year 2050 a strange rift was discovered by the Bermuda Triangle. Two months later rifts have formed in several majors cities across the globe. Those who gone to investigate the rifts were attacked by strange creatures. To make matters worse those who have been bitter by the creatures have mutated into monsters. The fabric of reality is in danger as the humans are slowly being transformed into Rifters, humans who have acquired unique abilities and monster-like features who are known to go completely savage. Is there a way to save humanity? Should humanity try to accept their new fate? Or will they come to a compromise and use Rifters for their own benefit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the story. Before we begin, some rules hmm? <br>\r\nRules: No sexual chapters. Keep it P-G 13.<br>\r\nNo transformations unless, say, since humans don't exist in one universe, you have to be another species. But this isn't a transformation story. That will be for another day. Focus on the adventure and see how you would act in different worlds.<br>\r\nI now would like all storylines to start with an introduction o your character and their situation. I am now also allowing non-humans but keep it tame, no creatures that would get the reader all weirded out or confused. A good example I what is allowed is an anthro or your basic mythical creatures. <br>\r\nKeep it interesting.<br>\r\nYou can have any game or show or what have you be a world, but I would like a lot of original worlds and, if you must go with a pre-existing world, some choices that you normally wouldn't hear about, or something that's not mainstream.<br>\r\nKeep it neat and have good grammar. To err may be human, but can we keep that IRL?<br>\r\nLet's not have any focus on anything but the adventure okay? It's a simple story, we don't want potential readers an authors not reading the rest of the thread because they see something that doesn't appeal to them. This means no, what'd you call them, fetishes? In return, I will see if I could make a story where anything can happen. For more info on this story idea, email me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNew: When you introduce your character and situation, make sure you add one \"continue with this thread option\" and the rest as \"another storyline\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone that breaks these rules will have their chapters edited or even erased, as per the usual. Also, I have to warn you, I'm a sucker for references, jokes, and, most of all, fourth wall breaks. Any of these may *cough* will, be rewarded with gift points depending on how good they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may sneak a few appearances from the Tales of Ignus group, so keep an eye out for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave a swell time adding to this story!</td>",
