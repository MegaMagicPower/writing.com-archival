Unofficial leader of the castaways (though not without opposition) he tries to keep the good of the group in mind.  Rachel is his sister and Gina his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector Tompson:  16, black hair brown eyes.  Very tall and thin.  He is shy and removed, mostly keeping to himself.  He has feelings for Clarisse but has told no one (though Sarah knows.). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Kernst:  16 brown hair blue eyes.  A lanky athlete, he is also very smart.  He doesn't like John taking charge on the island, although he plans to learn survival before voicing these opinions.  Clarisse is his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger Sumner:  16, red hair gray eyes.  He is their primary scource of survival knowledge.  He works with John as he respects John's nerve to take a leadership role.  He is dating Rachel, though for only a short time.  She tries to get Rodger as the leader.  Gina is his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina Franks:  16, black hair, hazel eyes.  John's girlfriend and Rodger's cousin.  She supports both of them on the island.  She is rather clever and can create new tools that even Rodger could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse Kernst:  15, brown hair blue eyes.  Alex's sister.  She likes Hector but is unsure if he likes her back (which he does.) She knows basic survivalism and learns fast from Rodger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Rienbeck:  15, blonde hair blue eyes.  Hector's confidant and Alex's closest friend on the island.  She struggles to learn survival which she had no exposure to before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Lawerson:  15, brown hair blue eyes.  John's sister and dating Rodger.  She hates taking orders from her brother and tries to get Rodger in charge, the last place he wants to be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylie Hearn:  15, red hair blue eyes.  She knows Gina and Hector but none of the others.  She is very independent and keeps to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you follow?</span></div></div>",

He saw Sarah looking at a bizarre flower, bright yellow and pink.  The feint smell of roses was coming from it.  The smell lulled Alex to drowsiness, as he found the smell of roses euphoric.  A terrible thirst over came him as he stared at the flower.  Only when Sarah moved did he notice the golden colored sap dripping from the flower.  Sarah got some on her finger and tasted it.  She clearly liked it as she started drinking right from the flower.  Alex's thirst overcame him and he too started drinking from the sap.  Its taste was beyond words.  After he started he couldn't stop until his thirst was satisfied.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sarah fall to the ground.  It was then that he noticed his own drowsiness and he laid down on the soft flowers to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Then as suddenly as it had come it passed.  Alex found that he was laying on his side looking up.  He sat up but everything felt strange as he did.  He turned to Sarah and was dumbstruck.   Sarah's blonde hair had turned a bright gold color and had grown down to her waist.  Her eyes had become become pink in color and seemed to almost glitter.  Although she still looked her age, she was only four feet tall.  She was wearing a white dress that looked like some unrecognizable cloth.  After taking this in for a second he remembered the strange feelings he had when he moved.  He looked at himself and nearly fainted again.  He looked just like Sarah did; four feet tall, golden hair down to the waist, pink sparkling eyes and a white dress.  He had a girls body.  When he spoke his voice was female, but also sweet and almost musical.  <br>\r\n\"What are we?\" he/she asked.<br>\r\n\"I think we're pixies.\"</span></div></div>",

He was taken back by her beauty, the way her hair fell around her neck, the way the light caught her eyes, was beyond words.  Alex had never noticed it before but Sarah was the most beautiful person he had ever seen.  He felt his heart grow heavy at the sight of her.  He knew now that he loved Sarah, and had for years.  He only hoped that she felt the same way.  She turned to him after looking up from the flower, the petal she had been drinking from.</span></div></div>",

Sarah stood in the middle of the room in front of a large mirror.  He came up behind her and looked at the massive sheet of glass.  Sarah slowly reached out and touched it, right where reflection's breasts were.  Without warning the cave was filled with a bright light.  Even before his sight returned, Alex could feel something was wrong.  He felt an unnatural weight on his chest.  By the time his eyes could see clearly he saw that he did indeed have breasts.  He turned to the now flat-chested Sarah.<br>\r\n\"What did you do!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know.  I just touched the reflection and...\" she trailed off.  <br>\r\n\"Well touch it again.  That should work.\"<br>\r\nShe did and nothing happened.  After another try words appeared on mirror:  Mirror transformations are one-way.  Find the opposite mirror on the other side of the island to undo changes.<br>\r\n\"Well that's what we need to do then,\" Sarah said.  \"This shows a map of the island so we can find the opposite mirror.\"<br>\r\nAlex nodded his agreement.  As he turned to leave his hand brushed the mirror.  Sarah paled as the room began to glow.</span></div></div>",

Mental changes are allowed and encouraged, but don't go overboard.  If you want to change everything about a charecter, do it slowly over time.  Also don't change everyone's minds.<br>\r\n4. Don't kill main charecters.  People introduced after the start are expendable.  The only exepetion to this rule is if they are dead but still in the story, such as a ghost or a vampire.
