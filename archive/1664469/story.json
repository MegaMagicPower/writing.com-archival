He rules with an iron fist and he has put an end to the Supers by killing the world renowned Super, Peacebringer. There were wars and attempts fought afterwards against Nex, but he asserted his power and destroyed all that would oppose him. The Musketeer disappeared and became, once again, Ben Frost. He goes about his daily routine, with a hellish version of Big Brother breathing down his neck constantly. There are curfews, spending limits, commodity coupons, and other restrictions placed upon the things society once took for granted. Life is a living nightmare. But hope will come knocking at Ben's front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b><u>Behold the Betrayer</u><br>\r\nMarie \"Lady Mercury\" Devoix</b><br>\r\n<i>Firestarter, super powers, <span class=\"cred\">Evil.</span></i><br>\r\nIn Marie's storyline, she has just witnessed the brutal murder of her leader and friend, Peacebringer, at the hands of the super-villain, Nex. He is the first Super to die. Supers are still flashy pop stars and most are still in it for the fame. But the death of one of their own will shake the Super community to its core. The controversy and political war that wages after Peacebringer's death are just signs of things to come. Now, every Super has a choice to make. As the world cries out for Peacebringer's death to be avenged, the Supers realize they either give the public what they want and face Nex - and certain death - or put their masks and capes away for good. Or will they join Nex? Will they side with the villain that put an end to the Supers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b><u>The Huntsman</u><br>\r\nAdrianne \"Demon Bane\" Klein</b><br>\r\n<i>Gunsmith, no powers, <span class=\"cred\">Evil.</span></i><br>\r\nIn Adrianne's storyline, Nex is supreme ruler of the world. He has conquered every rebellion made against him thus far and has proven that he is not a power to be questioned or challenged. The world is under his control and every day, more and more Supers lend their services to Nex. With so many pawns on his side in this winning game, it is a wonder why one day Nex comes to the Super villain former known as Demon Bane and ask him personally to join his army. It turns out, there is a war coming. One that will change the fate of the world and could very well bring the downfall of Nex. Nex needs Demon Bane's help and he hires the gun-toting preacher man to hunt down and slaughter those that would stir this uprising and rebellion against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b><u>Veiled Vengeance</u><br>\r\nChristopher \"Hood\" Crumbe</b><br>\r\n<i>Masking, super powers <span class=\"cyellow\">Neutral</span></i><br>\r\nIn Hood's storyline, Nex has risen, he has destroyed, and he rules supreme. He has gone unquestioned and unchecked for far too long and now holds the world in the palm of his hand. There has not been an uprising in years, the last attempt to dethrone Nex ended in blood and carnage. But there is one who has yet to make his stand. One who has yet to challenge the ruler of the earth and will do so by starting a gathering what Supers were not killed off by the villain Nex and starting a revolution. Hood will lead them to victory. He will lead them to freedom. He will lead them to justice. Because he is not your ordinary Super, he is not just a boy in a mask and a cape. He is Peacebringer's son and he has a debt to pay to the Super who killed his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b><u>The First Family</u><br>\r\nShannon \"Nightingale\" Crumbe</b><br>\r\n<i>Healing, super powers, <span class=\"cgreen\">Good.</span></i><br>\r\nIn Shannon's storyline, the Supers are just coming into fame and fortune. The tides of their popularity have shifted and instead of just being crime fighters, they are now signing endorsement deals, appearing on television shows, and staging events for mass audiences. It has become more than just stopping and fighting crime, it is pop culture. The villains they fight while wearing their masks are often friends of their alter egos. There is one family that stands above the rest in the popularity of the Supers - Peacebringer and his wife, Nightingale. Otherwise known as Elijah and Shannon Crumbe. They have a seven year old son named Chris. Follow this family as they deal with the hardships of fame and fortune and the exploited world of the Supers. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was one of those sexy librarian types, the kind that had their hair pulled back so tight you\u2019d think they were going for a natural face lift. The kind that wore glasses low on her nose because she didn\u2019t really need them, but they made her look sophisticated. He imagined her hair falling down about her shoulders and her blouse disappearing and her swinging her glasses above her head and a few screams and moans coming out of that perfect fucking mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so maybe he wasn\u2019t trying to think about her question, but how was it fair that he had to sit through this damn mind washing group therapy session and have a therapist as hot as she was? It wasn\u2019t fair. And this session was part of Nex\u2019s agreement not to kill him for just being a known Super. So, pardon him if he rebelled a little by imagining his hot therapist riding him like a fucking cowgirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m scared of Nex,\u201d a voice next to him said and he turned to look at the younger man who was sitting timidly in his chair. He must have just been a teenager when Nex took over the world. Maybe just starting out on his Super path. He didn\u2019t recognize him, or the crappy name he\u2019d made up for himself. Das something or other. Must have been German. The kid didn\u2019t look German. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe therapist nodded and scribbled something onto her clipboard. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should all be scared of Nex. It is what keeps us in his good graces and it\u2019s what allows you your freedom. Good, Bastian.\u201d Yeah, not German. The therapist scanned the others seated around her in a circle, waiting for someone else to say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older woman across from him spoke up. Ladybird. He remembered her. She\u2019d been hot in her days as a Super. But then she\u2019d had like, forty kids and gained a hundred pounds. He resisted the urge to shrug because, hell, he\u2019d still do her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNex\u2019s guards. I\u2019m scared of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Vivian,\u201d the therapist nodded to the woman. \u201cNex\u2019s guards are a part of Nex. They do his will and we should be afraid of them as well. This is good. Our session is going very well. Does anyone else have something they are afraid of?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around the circle and then sighed quietly, raising his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Frost, you haven\u2019t spoken yet in our sessions, good. What are you afraid of?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lowered his hand and wondered how <i>good</i> she was going to find this answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBees.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he saw an eye twitch. Just behind her glasses and he tried not to smile because he was waiting for her to answer. She reached a hand up and pushed her glasses up her nose, looking down at her clipboard for a second and he could almost see her counting to ten in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me?\u201d she said and her voice was less pleasing as she rose her eyes to look at him, almost daring him to say it again. Okay, he\u2019d bite. These sessions were for the birds anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking bees,\u201d he said and shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a low, long breath and shook her head. \u201cWe are trying to be serious in these sessions, Mr. Frost and we have made remarkable headway. I will not allow you to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever been stung by a bee?\u201d He demanded, cutting her off. She looked surprised because she wore Nex\u2019s symbol on her shoulder and she probably hadn\u2019t been interrupted or cut off in years. She didn\u2019t look irritated though, so he thought maybe he still had a chance not to be murdered tonight by Nex\u2019s guards. \u201cThey\u2019re scary! I got chased by a swarm of bees once, when I was a kid. Me and my kiddie girlfriend, whose Dad works in a funeral home, we were out playing and bees attacked and I got stung all over. I died and she was sad and it made her think about her mom or some shit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other ex-Supers snorted and Ben turned to look at him. Gavel, a villain in his time. He still looked like a villain, but Ben had always liked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s the plot to My Girl,\u201d Gavel grinned at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pointed to the man. \u201cYou see? He knows what I\u2019m talking about. A horrifying movie scene. So horrifying, I put myself in the place of the kid. I saw myself die. Therefore, bees equal fucking scary. I think I need more therapy, doc.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavel chuckled slightly, but stopped as the therapist glared at him. She turned her attention back to Ben and tapped her pen on her clipboard. \u201cMr. Frost,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI think your session is over for the day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen clapped his hands together. \u201cGreat, can I go home, then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she shook her head and pointed her pen towards the door. \u201cGo wait in my office.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and stood up and head into her office. He closed the door behind him and then looked around the room. It was quiet and the furniture was nice. He wondered who it really belonged to. He wondered if she was an actual therapist or if Nex had just given her the job because she talked smoothly and had boobs and could convince people to believe the words that were coming out of her mouth. She spewed shit. She taught people to fear Nex and brainwashed people who used to be Supers into thinking there was no hope and no way to avoid Nex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there wasn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, Ben had spent the last few years working some shitty job that Nex had given him. Only recently had the ex-Supers been required to go through these damn therapy and conditioning sessions. He wondered why. He knew Nex had some psychic capabilities and he wondered if the great villain saw something coming. He wondered if there was another rebellion or revolution being planned. It had been a while. Maybe he\u2019d get involved with this one. Probably not. No one ever won. No one ever would. He shook his head, because that was no way to think. The therapist was getting to him. She sucked all the hope the Supers ever had right away from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing around the mahogany desk, he collapsed into the spiny chair and twirled around for a bit, looking at the fake degrees on the walls and the pewter carving of Nex\u2019s familiar symbol plastered around the room. Nex was everywhere. He was always watching and knew everything that was going on. He had goons on every corner and all day long he listened to people talk about how there was no hope, there was no escaping Nex, how he should just lay over and die and take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of him did. A part of him had given up a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a part of him still liked to rebel. So he talked about bees when he should have been talking about Nex. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd already finished showering and had gotten into her nightgown and was trying to go to sleep. But Ben couldn't stop washing his hands. He'd been at it for nearly ten minutes and when she lay there, on the bed, not understanding why she couldn't fall asleep, she realized it was because the sound of running water coming from the bathroom hadn't stopped. It just kept prattling on and every so often the soap bottle would squeak and Ben would sigh and the water would just keep going. It was annoying and it was keeping her awake and if she tried really hard, maybe she could convince herself that it wasn't the day's painful events that was keeping her up, but the fact that Ben couldn't stop washing his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she rolled over and watched him, a familiar frustration and anger building up inside of her. They'd been fighting for months. Never in public, because they had an image to uphold, but behind closed doors, their marriage was falling apart. She could see it coming to an end, even if neither one of them wanted to admit it. Small, off handed remarks were more painful these days than bullets. Habits that she'd once loved in him were becoming annoying. When he tried to change, she'd become angry with him and tell him to not fucking change because of her. She knew she was being a bitch. She knew that she was getting to him, just the same way he was getting to her. They both knew it. They both could see the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had erased any doubts of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause if their marriage had a chance of being salvageable, they would have been talking or hugging or comforting each other. But they weren't. Marie was on the bed, glaring daggers at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ben couldn't stop washing his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're clean,\" she finally grit out when she couldn't take it anymore. He'd added squirted the soap bottle again and that was the last straw. She stood up from the bed and came into the bathroom, shutting the water off. She tried to ignore the fact that he'd managed to use up all the hot water just washing his hands, or the fact that he'd rubbed and washed his hands raw to the point where it wasn't someone else's blood he was washing away, it was his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood was still there. She could smell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said quietly. \"I just...\" he didn't finish. He couldn't. She stared at him for a moment and almost reached out to touch his arm. She'd loved him. At one time, she'd honest to god loved him. She would have gone to the ends of the earth for him - had on several occasions, actually. Sure, they were staged events because the masses loved it when Lady Mercury rushed to the aid of her beloved Musketeer, and vice versa. Their steamy romance had filled tabloids and lit up Hollywood with movie deals, book signings, the works. It was different from other Supers. Other Supers had the \"American Family\" type deal going on. But with Marie and Ben, it was something different. It was sex, it was steam, it was completely and utterly fake. Maybe it had started out real. But it didn't stay that way. She couldn't pinpoint when they'd stopped loving each other. Maybe Ben still loved her. But she'd checked out of this relationship a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just come to bed,\" she said, more heated than she meant to, because even if she didn't love him, a part of her still cared for him. Ben Frost was a snarky comedian, in and out of his persona. So when Ben couldn't stop washing his hands and he just stood there in the flourescent light of the bathroom with a blank look on his face and his mouth not running with snark, a part of her felt bad. A part of her wanted to acknowledge his pain. But she hadn't even acknowledged her own yet. And fuck it if she wasn't done putting Ben before herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look at her and his eyes were big and wide and glistening. She couldn't meet them so she turned and walked back to the bed, climbing under the covers. She lay with her back to him and she could feel him watching her. She wondered if he saw a stranger where his wife once was. She knew that's what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elijah's dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's voice was so small that she almost missed the words. She closed her eyes, though, and the pain that struck through her chest at the words being spoken outloud told her that she'd heard him. He was right. Elijah was dead. He'd been killed this morning by some masked idiot who she'd never heard of before. Nex or something equally as ridiculous. It wasn't even a real Super name. What did it even mean? She didn't care and she wasn't going to bother to find out because the bastard had surprised them all today. Elijah had been giving his monologue, because the news cameras had been following him for years. They knew him as Peacebringer. And Peacebringer always put on a good show. The man was the freaking All-Star of Supers. And right in the middle of his speech, some corny rendition of something he'd given a thousand times about saving the world from evil doers and blah, blah, blah - Nex had pulled a gun and shot Elijah right between the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacebringer, and Elijah, was dead before he hit the fucking ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had shocked Marie, because none of the villains they fought anymore used live ammunition. The lawsuits for when a bullet went stray had grown to be too much of a hastle. They used blank rounds and usually the Supers who were battling called each other ahead of the battle to decide the outcome. They should have known something was up when a no-name jackass had called Peacebringer out in the open without a meeting to discuss the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said, opening her eyes, but not rolling over to look at him. \"I was there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shot him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was fucking there,\" she spat. The venom in her voice came out of nowhere. The room seemed to heat up a few degrees and she took a deep breath, trying to calm down. The last thing she needed was to burn down their house. Knowing her luck, Ben would sue her for arson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room seemed quiet for a moment and she almost rolled over to see what he was doing. She couldn't hear him. She used to love that about him. He was stealthy, he was silent when he wanted to be and he was a fucking god with a sword. She'd always made fun on him for not choosing a better Super name than The Musketeer. He didn't even carry a Musket. But he'd liked it and she couldn't argue that it was sellable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't stop it.\" The words were quiet and harsh and she heard the accusation aimed at everyone involved, including herself, and him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost turned around and fought him about it. What the hell were they supposed to do? Nex had pulled the gun out of nowhere. Even Elijah, who had the capability to dodge a fucking bullet hadn't been expecting it. Otherwise, he would have dodged the god damn fucking bullet! That was his super power, and he still was able to be shot between the eyes, his head exploding and blood and brain matter spraying the rest of their damn fucking useless league of Supers who had done nothing - just stood back and watched him fall lifeless to the ground. Even his damn wife had been there, and she'd tried to heal him, but she was a healer, not a necromancer. He was already dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the water came back on and she heard the squeak of the soap bottle, she sighed and gave up. She closed her eyes and tried not to picture Elijah's skull exploding out the back of his head. She tried not to picture all of them covered in blood. She tried not to hear Nex's laugh and the camera crew's gasps of horror and shock. She tried to block out Ben's lack of snark and the water running over his bleeding and raw hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacebringer was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ben couldn't stop washing his hands. </span></div></div>",

Some of them - I don't know where they came up with them: Captain Justice, Hammer of Truth, The Silver Spork. That's one of my favorites. The characters were coming out of the woodworks, wanting to protect the world, save the earth, fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves, blah blah blah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while it was good. We fought for mankind and for everything good mankind stood for. Superheroes fighting supervillains. After a while, we grew into something else. Supers. Pop culture influences. Started seeing heroes' faces on Wheaties boxes. There were action figures, tv shows, movies. We lost our direction along the way. Heroes and villains were only enemies in costume, when there was someone watching. Hell, I went to my arch enemy's daughter's birthday party. Any good looking punk in a cape could call himself a Super.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was glamour. It was fame. It was fortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNex was a villain none of us saw coming. We stood against him, our little, League of Virtue. Peacebringer was our leader, a good man. He stood before Nex, expecting a staged fight, just another kid who wanted a name and a mask. We watched as Nex killed our leader without mercy and without restraint. He was the first Super to die. He was not the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany retired after that. And those who stood against Nex, died. Nex's empire grew and spread and before long, he ruled half the world. The Supers disappeared - gave up their masks and capes and hid with their alter egos. Humanity handed itself over to Nex in exchange for its life. Nex spared those who pledged allegiance to him and slaughtered those who refused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freedom we know does not come without penalty. We live our lives as we always have, with Nex watching over us, taking what he pleases, destroying those who become too powerful. The Supers watch, most thinking Nex has won. That there's no way to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no one as powerful as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it just so happens, I might know a guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">- Ben Frost a.k.a \"The Musketeer\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/noteg.png\" alt=\"*NoteG*\" title=\"NoteG\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b><u>Characters</u></b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/noteg.png\" alt=\"*NoteG*\" title=\"NoteG\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<i>storyline characters...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Ben \"The Musketeer\" Frost - Swordsman, no powers, <span class=\"cgreen\">Good.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Marie \"Lady Mercury\" Devoix - Firestarter, super powers, <span class=\"cred\">Evil.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Adrianne \"Demon Bane\" Klein - Gunsmith, no powers, <span class=\"cred\">Evil.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Christopher \"Hood\" Crumbe - Masking, super powers, <span class=\"cyellow\">Neutral.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Shannon \"Nightingale\" Crumbe - Healing, super powers, <span class=\"cgreen\">Good.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Other characters...</u> <br>\r\n<i>updated when a new character is created.
