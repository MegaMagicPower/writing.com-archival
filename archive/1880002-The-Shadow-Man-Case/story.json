School had ended about 4 hours and right after it, you and your friends had gone out to wander around town.

Ian was a fair-haired 16-year-old guy that went to Hightower with you. His parents were rich as well, since they were doctors, and it was a wonder how a completely loving couple like Mr. and Mrs. Castillo can have such a good-for-nothing son as him. Why were you guys so bitter to each other? Well, that's a story for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ian saw you, his eyes immediately narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" he snarled. \"Look what the cat dragged in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mood immediately dropped. \"Shut up,\" you spatted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's face darkened. \"You know, we still have some unfinished business to take care of,\" he said. \"How about you and I get it over with now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what he was talking about. This morning during 2nd period, a fight had broken out between you two, and if it wasn't for that annoying physics teacher of yours, someone would've won. This was a good time to finish what you two had started this morning. But then again, your parents had warned you not to cause any more trouble. You . . .</span></div></div>",

Rarely did you ever turned down a challenge, especially if it involved him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me,\" you responded. \"I said no. I'm already on probation with my parents -- call me a mama's boy but whatever. We'll settle this another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was a tense silence, but it soon broke when Ian smirked. \"Fine then. Suit yourself,\" he said with a sly grin. Then, just like that, he walked pass you and disappeared around the corner 10 seconds later. You scowled and continued on your way. You knew you had just given him satisfaction by backing down, but you didn't care right now. You needed a way to get rid of these annoying thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later you arrive at a cafe in the middle of the city. As you enter, you see your best friend, Tony, sitting in the corner of his parents' restaurant playing on his laptop. He didn't notice your arrival until you pulled up a seat in front of him. He grinned as he realized who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey!\" he beamed. \"How was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, pushy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"You only missed two days of school -- nothing usually happens anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from what I heard. You and Ian got into a fight again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I don't really feel like talking about it. Entertain me. And don't think wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony grinned, and for the next few hours you guys talked about random things. It wasn't until about 11 that you decided it was time to leave. You and Tony said your goodbyes before you left. However, about 15 minutes later as you were on your way home, you passed by a dark alley. Everything was fine at first. Then it happened:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gunshot rang through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ducked on impulse. Several seconds followed. Nothing happened. You slowly got up before peering slightly into the alley, the place where it came from. You . . .</span></div></div>",

However, a little while into your relaxing time, you get interrupted when a familiar person jumps out of nowhere and pushes you off your chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you shouted as you look up to the person that mobbed you.

The building is busy. Officers swarm around, running back and forth between divisions, and you dodge a female officer as she flies pass you with a stack of folders. You walk up towards the check in area a few yards from the front entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" a bubbly woman at the desk greets. \"What can I help you with ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" you reply back. \"I'm from the FBI department. I just transferred here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman checked something on the computer before turning to you with a bright smile. \"Oh hello! You must be the mew Special Agent assigned to the Special Crime Division. You can find the department on the third floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and thank her before going on with your way. As you step into the elevator, a tall man about 2 years older than you follows you in. He presses the button to the third floor before standing there silently. The elevator doors then close. As you travel up, you can't help but slightly glance over at his reflection against the glass walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stands there in deep though. He is tall, dark-haired, good-looking, and looks like one of those people that don't smile even if his life counted on it. However, before you could further \"observe\", there's a dinging sound and the doors open. You exit first and turn right at where a sign reads \"Special Crime Division\" followed by a pair of sliding glass doors. You enter the department. To your surprise, instead of seeing 20 other officers sitting at their desk, there are only 2 people: a blonde-haired man about your age and a brunette sitting beside him playing what appeared as Goldfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette notices you first. She beams and throws down her cards, much to the blond's dismay, and jumps up to greet you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" she exclaims. \"You must be the new addition to our team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and extend your hand. \"Yes I am. I'm Special Agent Williams. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette shakes your hand energetically. \"I'm Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond then stands up and grins at you. \"Well hello there,\" he greets with a wink. \"I'm Jay.
