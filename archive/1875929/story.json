Being a war hero, she goes down to random outposts to boost the troops morale. You serve as co-pilot until you get to the surface of negus four. You land the pelican and get off. Then you watch it fly back up to the ship to get some more supplies. You are their with Miranda as her bodyguard. You are armed with a battle rifle and a magnum. You also have three frags and a smoke grenade. You are wearing ODST armor except the helmet, which you left back on the pelican. Miranda is armed only with a magnum. She is wearing her regular uniform with a bulletproof vest underneath. You two are walking around chatting with the soldiers when a Sargent calls you over. \"Sir, ma'am, we are detecting an incoming attack on our southern front!\" he says. \" I suggest you get yourselves to the bunker in the east end while we take care of it.\" \"Is it covenant?\" you ask. \"No, it's a local rebel base five clicks out. We usually don't consider them a real threat, but their getting bolder, and their attacks increasing with more troops every time.\" he says.</span></div></div>",

You head out into the vehicle depot. All that is left is three mongooses and a warthog. Well this won't be enough to counter the firepower that they have.\" you say. You make your way to the front lines with miranda and the Sargent in the fallback line. You run over to a machine gun and man it. You mow down three rebels and destroy a rebel mongoose. Two explosions come in close to you, one knocking you back. \"Fall back!\" you hear someone shout. You quickly sprint to a position about thirty yards from Miranda and the Sargent. You are killing rebels on all sides when one leaps at you brandishing a knife. He knocks you to the ground and tries to stab you. You take hold of his hand and thrust the knife backward, stabbing him in the forehead. You push his body off of you and continue to fight. \"Uuuuuugggggghhhh!\" you hear someone say. You look around just in time to see the Sargent fall to the ground. A bullet had entered his skull and killed him instantly. You see Miranda running back to check another marine when she gets shot in the back. \"MIRANDA!!\" you shout. You sprint towards her. You see a rebel standing over her about to finish her off. \"NOOOO!\" you shout as you ram your shoulder into him sending him flying backwards. You pull out your magnum and put three bullets in his chest and head before running back to Miranda. You open up the back of her shirt to see the bullet only passed through her uniform. It did not get through her vest. She had, though, been paraliyzed by the force of the bullet hitting the armor. You sigh in relief as the butt of a rifle hits you in the back of the head, knocking you out cold...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
