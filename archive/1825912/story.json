You're mid-teens, quite slim and slightly small for your age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the last Semester the school invited students to enroll in classes in the new Humanities Department. You did - without bothering to find out anything about the courses.  Today is your first day back and you find out you've enrolled in Behavioral Sciences - whatever that is!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class starts, and your teacher clearly expects everyone to have studied the information packs previously distributed, and therefore to know about the subject - and to be prepared for the first class. You now get a little un-nerved. You had previously been given something, but assumed that was just a generic information pack - and not actually relevant, so you hadn't even opened it!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class gets underway, the tutor assigns everyone to a group for the first project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where do you end up?</span></div></div>",

However it becomes clear very quickly that none of you have much of an idea what the course is about, or what your project should focus on. Fortunately a couple have brought along the information packs, so you can at least look up the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says here we need a project to study behaviors.\" one boy announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit broad - what sort of behaviors?\" another asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well social interactions I guess. Don't really know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all talk around what you think the scope of the project is supposed to be, although with little certainty, and achieve nothing in actually selecting a subject. You notice another group - consisting of 5 girls - who are clearly well advanced in their planning, with a detailed timeline and action plans outlined on a whiteboard.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid. We're just a bunch of boys without a clue - look at them. At least they know what they're doing.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's 'cos they're girls. Wish we had a girl in our group.\" a boy called Andy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What good would that do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they always seem better prepared and quick at picking up odd concepts. If we had a girl in the group I bet we'd be well underway by now.\" Andy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's to do with genetics.They're built different to us - like inside.\" you respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Everyone expects girls to be able to do things better, so they do. It's expectations, not genetics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" you ask. \"So you're suggesting that if I was a girl then I'd have been more prepared, and come up with ideas for the project, purely because everyone expects girls to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spot on. That's what everyone expects, so girls deliver. Us lot, well everyone expects us to be crap, so we are -  except by random chance anyway. It\u2019s absolutely nothing to do with genetics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do you have any evidence to support that theory?\u201d you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2026.\u201d There is a pause as the virtual penny clicks into place in Andy's head, and the mental processes gently whirl around, \u201cit is feasible that you have just managed to give us the subject matter of a project.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, if you were a girl you\u2019d be better motivated and better prepared, because that\u2019s what everyone expects. I say it\u2019s expectations; you say it\u2019s genetics. So if we could turn you into a girl we could prove the theory, one way or the other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d You reply, \u201cIf I was a girl I'd have female genes, so that wouldn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That's not what I meant. If everyone <i>thought</i> that you were a girl, so had the expectations of you as a girl, maybe that could work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to hypnotize everyone in the school to think I\u2019m a girl. Nice plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you numskull. That would nullify any natural behaviors. Bit if we could make you <i>look</i> like a girl, so that everyone treats you like a girl, we could measure any expectations of you, and how you respond. How are you in a skirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome off it! If I was to turn up tomorrow wearing a skirt everyone would still treat me the same. Actually they definitely <u>wouldn\u2019t</u> treat me the same, but they certainly wouldn\u2019t treat me as if I was a girl. You\u2019ll have to do far better than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean <i>just</i> putting on a skirt.\u201d Andy retorts. \u201cYou would have to be convincing - no point otherwise. Guess the question is how we could do that. Measuring the results would be easy by comparison.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys in your group are listening intently to your exchanges, although until this point have been keeping any thoughts to themselves. Then Robin, one of the other boys, chips in with a comment. \u201cMy sister could help. She works in the beauty salon in the Mall. She took her boyfriend into the salon once before a \u201cdress as your other half\u201d Halloween party, and <u>he</u> came out looking more like a girl than <u>she</u> does.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but this isn\u2019t just for a party. I couldn\u2019t go to your sister\u2019s salon every day on the way to school. That\u2019s just silly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d Robin replies. \u201cIf you\u2019re careful you\u2019d only need her to tidy you up one or twice a week. She\u2019d show you how maintain it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about clothes?\u201d Andy asks. Tony would need to dress up as a girl too \u2013 anyone got anything suitable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Robin answers. \u201cMy sister used to go to this school. I think she still has her uniform, so we could borrow that from her \u2013 reckon it should fit Tony fairly well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. In that case it looks like we have our project!\u201d Andy announces. \u201cAll we need to do now is work out how to measure expectations and how well Tony fulfills them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on just a second!\u201d you say, realizing that you had unintentionally set expectations. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that it would be <u>me</u> dressing up as a girl! It could be any of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy replies\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guidelines are clear that if there's a disagreement about the project then we put it to the vote, and the majority decision rules. The alternative is that we all fail Humanities before we even finish the first lesson. So it's now up to you - do we all flunk the subject before we even start or are you going to give the group a chance at getting a grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you know full well that there's no way that anyone will manage to come up with a fresh project idea within 10 minutes, and you know your mom would kill you if you failed trying to get your grade, so you seem to be left with little alternative but to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bugger.\" is all you can initially say. \"Surely there must be something else?\" The other four all look at you, with expressions being a cross between desperation and pleading. and you know that the future of this project, and therefore your possible success or failure in Humanities, lies in the decision you take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bloody Hell. Alright, I'll do it.\" you utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sense of relief in the group is evident instantly, and you have suddenly become everyone's best friend, with smiles all around, and everyone wanting to express their gratitude.

It seems that Robin has already been in contact with his sister, who (no doubt after a good laugh at your expense) has turned out her old school uniform and a selection of other clothes that may fit you. Robin suggests you all go to his house so that you can try on the uniform for size while the others try to work out how to manage the rest of the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Robin lives quite close to school so you're there within a few minutes (Andy, Robin, you, plus the other two team members Tom and Zak). Robin introduces you to Sarah, his older sister, who has lemonade ready for everyone. She's around 18 or 19, a bit taller than you, quite slim and you are definitely attracted to her. Hmm, if only you were a couple of years older...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tony,\" she says, while clearly eyeing you up and down. \"So you're Robin's friend who wants to dress up a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" You reply, \"it's more a case of drawing the short straw than wanting to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'd be more convincing if your heart is really in it, so you may need to consider your motivation.

If you're doing all the difficult stuff in this project you may as well have some fun doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah beckons for you to follow her, and she leads you to her bedroom. On the bed is laid out her old school uniform, plus some other bits and pieces, and you notice that she doesn't just have a dressing table, but what seems to be a full make up studio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then Tony, we haven't got much time but I'd like you to prove to yourself and your mates that not only are you up for this, but that you could be convincing as your female counterpart.

Whilst the boys are talking we'll do a little quick magic. First take off your jacket and shirt and put this on.\" Sarah points to what appears to be a bra, but with filling already in the cups. Seeing your confused stare, she explains. \"Don't worry, they're falsies. My boyfriend used them once for a party. They'll give you the shape you'll need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as asked and strip down to your waist, and then pull on this bra onto your arms, and do up the clasp under the front of the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK - it just needs tightening a bit.\" Sarah says, as she pulls on the straps over your shoulders. \"There.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you can't really see what it looks like, but at least it seems to fit reasonably comfortably, and does what its supposed to do, giving you the impression of breasts - which you reckon to be B cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Next we'll do a bit of make-up. Come over here.\" Sarah indicates the chair in front of the mirror surrounded by spot lights, wigs, and make up. \"OK - I'm going to try to add some makeup to your face, so sit tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah starts by thoroughly brushing out your hair, then spraying it to keep it in place, so instead of being a straggly blond mass on top of your head, it's now relatively tidy with your natural curls reaching nearly to the base of your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, wish I had some extensions... That would help no end\" she mutters to herself. Then she starts working on your face, first applying foundation, which as Sarah gently rubs this in you have difficulty noticing the difference. She then rubs on a concealer around your chin to cover your spots, and blusher to your cheeks, giving a slightly pink tone. Then she applies a brown eye-shadow, eye liner, and finally lip gloss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then Tony. Let\u2019s get some kit on you, and then see what needs finishing off. Try this blouse on first.\" She hands a shirt to you, much like your own school shirt - only this seems to be a slightly softer material, and buttons up the wrong way around. You pull this on, and button it up. Sarah then gives you a skirt to put on instead of your trousers, which you pull on over your boxers. You cannot help but comment about how short it is, as you are seriously concerned that your boxers may be visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sniggers slightly. \"Don't worry Tony, it really isn't that short, but we need to show as much of your legs as possible. It's not all about making you look 100% female, but kick-starting the guys into thinking you're a girl, and then they'll just accept the rest far more easily.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe has some black shoes for you, which seem about the right size. Finally she puts a tie around your collar which she loops into a loose bow, and helps you to put on a school blazer \u2013 shorter than your own, and more tightly fitting. You are keen to see what you look like. You walk slowly back to the dresser and look at your reflection in the mirror, and are amazed at what you admit seems to be a girl staring back at you. \"Wow. That's amazing.\" you say to Sarah. Not only do you really look like a girl, you seem to have aged by a good couple of years, now looking to be around 17. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a pretty clear complexion, and your features aren't too distinct, so it wasn't too hard. Actually you don't make a bad girl. Give me a bit more time I could do better. However, looks are only part of the issue - you would need to speak and act like a girl too, so you're not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah spends the next few minutes giving a few suggestions about changing the way you speak, how to walk (particularly in the different style of shoes with the heels), and how to stand and sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready to show off to your chums?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So reluctantly you agree. \u201cGreat.\u201d Sarah says. \u201cNow, I know you\u2019re not entirely comfortable about this, but I think you\u2019re looking pretty good. So I suggest we don\u2019t just roll you out for the boys to criticize, but try something a little different - which should prove to you that you\u2019re actually doing OK. Just treat it all like you\u2019re acting \u2013 pretending to be a different person, a different character. It just happens that the person you are trying to be is a girl. Let\u2019s see who can tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leads you out of the house through the kitchen and tells you to go around to the front of the house and ring the front door bell, and then to follow her lead. She disappears back into the kitchen, leaving you walking around outside the house, dressed as a school girl, or more accurately looking like a school girl, and feeling very exposed and self conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ring the bell, and wait. You can hear a noise inside, and clearly Sarah is making her way to open the door. As she opens it from the inside she welcomes you enthusiastically as if a long lost girlfriend, in full sight of the boys, and welcomes you inside. She then introduces you to the boys as being Tilly, one of her friends, and offers you a drink of lemonade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what Sarah had said to you, you accept, and Sarah suggests you sit for a moment. Again, recalling Sarah's instructions, you don't flump into a chair as you would have before, but perch delicately on the front edge, keeping your knees and feet together and pointing your toes. Whilst you are totally self conscious you try to keep in character, and manage to engage in small talk with Sarah and the boys, although you are really struggling. You can tell from his expression that Robin (Sarah\u2019s brother) has seen through the scam almost instantly, but he keeps quiet. However, two of the others don\u2019t seem to have much of a clue, and you are sure they are eyeing you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Sarah stands up, as if remembering something. \u201cOh blast.\u201d She says. \u201cI forgot that I\u2019ve left Tony in my room \u2013 I\u2019d better go to check on him. Would you like to come too Tilly?\u201d For a second you don\u2019t respond, forgetting that was your assumed name, and wondering who Sarah was talking to. However, you remember in time, and stand up, and follow Sarah from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back to Sarah\u2019s room you can relax, and consider the reaction that you had outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat went well!\u201d Sarah says. \u201cRobin saw through you at once, but that\u2019s no surprise, but I think the others fell for your new persona. Well done!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up her phone, and after a few moments pressing keys, put it down again. \u201cOK. I\u2019ve told Robin to leave us alone for a while now.

They okay up front?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting her to check that too, you say \"Yes, they're fine. I do like these a lot.\"</span></div></div>",

What would you choose to wear if you had silk underwear and stockings on? Bet it wouldn't be a Dorothy dress..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, that's true. I'd tend to wear the silk if I was dressing up a bit. It doesn't show so much, so it's good for something fairly tight fitting. It's also great for satin or silk blouses and they just slide down nicely. Something like the cocktail dress would be brill as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be nice, but I'm not actually going to be going anywhere am I?

One of my latest projects was trying to engineer a gender changing pill. I made a bunch of prototypes and after five months finally found a formula that should work.\" Sarah confuses you as she goes on about this, making you wonder what this has to do with your boner incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, because I really want to see the formula in action!  I have to see what the results are. Would it  just gives you breasts or fully turn you into the perfect girl! I did the research and technical design but never got to see what went on in the test lab! Now's my chance!

Then you start to to think about what might go wrong and you ask her \"Will it hurt? How long will it take? Have you even tested it? Could I change back again?!\" You start to freak out but Sarah reassures you will be just fine \"Calm down calm down! Everything will be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of my colleagues tested it on animals like guinea pigs and even bears. After they had the notes they needed they moved on to something more along the chain of human descendants like orang-utans and apes. After that someone called the university and said they knew what we were testing. This got us worried but after explaining that he would be willing to be a human test subject the team were relieved. Of course I didn't know what exactly was going on behind the wall behind my desk but now I finally can! I can show them that I am just as interested and committed to genetic modifications as they are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised that something like a sex changing pill actually exists in the world. You think for a bit and you agree. \"Ok seems fairly straight forward\" you say. After all, if you could actually switch from being a boy into a girl for the duration of the project, surely that would help the results - and you wouldn't have to worry about people thinking you're a cross-dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"eeek! I just knew you would come around! Alright, lets go get the pill.\" she says as she reaches for her car keys. \"You'd better change into this.\" and she hands you a cute tight outfit, a purple skirt blue tank top and purple flats. On your way to the bathroom to change she slaps your butt playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later you come out wearing the new outfit and ask \"why did I have to change out of the dress? I just put it on?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Would you rather go out in a prom dress?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I see your point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, lets go.\" She says.

Well, the most definite think you can say is that you are definitely a girl - well, physically anyway. You still feel the same person you were before 'inside', but are patently aware of the physical differences that have occurred. You change your underwear for the fresh bra and panties that Sarah offered you, noticing that they now fit somewhat better on your body than when you were a boy, with your real breasts filling out the bra cups.

However, you then notice that you still have breasts sitting comfortably on your chest. Your hand instantly reaches down to confirm what your senses told you was down below, and indeed your member has definitely returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I have changed back...\" you say, although realize then that you still have your higher pitched voice. \"Only not fully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap. That wasn't supposed to work like that. The DNA resequencing hasn't worked right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I think I worked that one out for myself. But what went wrong? Wasn't the dose large enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I measured it based on your body mass so it should have been just right. Either we're trying this too quickly after the original switch, or somehow your body is rejecting the resequencing, like it doesn't want to switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can just increase the dosage then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically I suppose. but we don't know what effect that may have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd guess it could turn me fully back into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, maybe, but too much could affect the balance and structure of your cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, like make me more masculine than I was? Doesn't sound too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but similarly you could end up as a very masculine chimpanzee or gorilla - there really isn't a huge difference in the DNA sequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, not so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid this will need some more research to be sure of what we need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?

You'll still got hips as well as your boobs, and legs any girl would kill for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so I'm stuck as a long legged girl with a stunning figure - and a dick. I think's that's possibly worse. I might be able to hide the boobs if that was all I had. If I was fully a girl at least everything would, um, fit right. I could almost live with that for a little while, but not this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we really shouldn't do anything until I report this to the researchers and they set to work.

So, whilst Sarah is not keen to pursue this option, you do feel that you should have another go at getting your own body, or rather, gender, back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm prepared to try another dose - perhaps a <i>little</i> stronger.

I'll sort out another dose for you, and see if we can get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leaves you again for a few minutes, opening a cabinet, then fiddling with some measuring equipment and obviously checking the new dosage, before returning with another pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, this one is the same as before but a much higher dose, so it should do the trick, although I'm not making any promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop this new pill into your mouth and swallow, and then wait again.

It\u2019s not just a modification of our own DNA, but we seem to have swapped some DNA between us. I\u2019m really not sure how we can swap back again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on. You mean that up until now I\u2019ve retained my own DNA, be it modified to either a male or female version, but now I\u2019ve got your DNA instead? So, in essence I am now you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as far as body DNA is concerned, yes, although technically you still have the same body you had before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider this for a moment. \u201cSo even if we could change back to our correct genders now, I\u2019d still be you \u2013 well, a male version of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I said I think we\u2019re stuck like this for a while. Switching genders now could actually confuse things even further. What worries me is how far the changes extend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right,\" you respond. \"So whether the changes are purely physical\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. This may be limited, but equally could extend to physiological capabilities, you know, like our perceptions, behaviors, responses. So, the question is how much of the DNA changes have affected our minds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Now I\u2019m panicking slightly. I look like you \u2013 or at least close enough that most people wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d You notice that your hair has remained the same length throughout your changes, and you were always slightly smaller that Sarah, reflecting your younger age, and you still are slightly smaller. \u201cSo, you\u2019re suggesting that the changes could be more than just physical, so I may actually think like a girl - or more like you would - until the boffins sort out a solution?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell pretty much, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I might start fancying boys?  Yuck!  OK, so what do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to log everything that happened, and get the techies looking at this. In the meantime we\u2019ll have to manage as being each other.\u201d Sarah concludes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean - manage as each other? Why not manage as ourselves?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have to explain to all and sundry how and why we've both changed gender and look like each other? 90% wouldn't believe us, and the others would want to pull us apart to work out how it happened. I'm afraid it'll be better if we temporarily pretend to be each other - the main difference between us now and our original forms is our hair - your's is now too short and mine is too long, and our ages. You're essentially like a slightly younger version of me, and I'm a slightly older version of you, but at a brief glance I don't think anyone would notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we'll need some fresh clothes. You can put back on what you came in, and I'll find something in the locker room.

So you remain the same age, and your hair is the same length and color that it was. Similarly Sarah's hair remains as it had been before, meaning that as a girl your natural hair is now relatively short, but as a boy Sarah's is now quite long - and if she's going to pretend to be you, far too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sarah proposes that you head to the mall to get your hair extended to look more like hers - and therefore match the expectations of anyone who knows her - and have hers cut shorter in line with your normal length.  \"After all,\" she says, \" if we're going to stay looking like each other for the next few days - or perhaps even  longer - we'll need to look the part. Oh, and I guess you'll need to get your ears pierced too.\" You look at Sarah in what is  effectively your body wearing large silver loop earrings, and realize that this will now be part of the package that will be you for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought occurs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sarah... If we're going to have to stay like this, and effectively live each others lives until we get switched back, does that mean I'll have to work here, and you'll go to school in my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, possibly not living each others lives 100%, as I'll need to check in here as well, and I'm not sure if I'm up to hanging out with a bunch of boys - at least not as one of them - but otherwise that's the general idea. Why d'you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'd probably be a wiz at doing my school work, but you'll recall that I was nominated by your brother to take part in the humanities project by dressing as a girl. That means that you'll have to do that now. So you'll be a girl who's been changed into a boy, having to dress as a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, at least it should come pretty naturally to me then!\" she replies. \"Not sure if that fits the rules of your project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it's technically going to be <i>your</i> project now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well. We can worry about that in a while.  OK, lets go. Need to get your hair and piercings sorted out anyway. I need to think about how we're going to do this so we can keep it a secret - not that anyone would believe us if we told them the truth anyway ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the heck is she doing? Then she pulls off her tee shirt, so she's now just in her bra and panties. Blimey. Oh, hang on. You remember that she was supposed to have put on the other prom dress that is still laying on the bed. She steps around the bed, picks up the dress and steps into it, pulling it up over her body and slipping her arms through the delicate shoulder straps. She then reaches behind her and swiftly (and you notice very easily) pulls up the zip at the back. The difference is quite amazing. Whilst before you found her attractive, in this dress you are fairly entranced by her and cannot stop yourself staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Mouth shut, and don't stare. It's off putting.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, oh, sorry.\" you reply, dropping your eyes from her, and feeling a bit embarrassed. \"It's just that you look really, um....  nice in that dress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's why I really wanted it for the prom. However, I'm not wearing it now for its aesthetic appeal, but to let you see what you could look like once we sort out how to hide you boy features. Now, do you think we could get away with being sisters?\" She points to the mirror, and jesters for you to go over to it. You comply and stand in front of the mirror with Sarah standing beside you. OK, she's taller, and more well built (with real boobs rather than a padded bra), and to your mind does actually look like a girl, whilst you, well, technically look OK, but there's definitely something different but you cannot put your finger on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" you answer, \"but there's something not right about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, you're a boy. I never considered a boy to be completely all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's not fair. I....\" then you realize she's kidding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she continues, \"you're a boy, and there are fundamental differences beyond just the shape of the body that we'll need to sort out. The wig isn't the best, so doesn't look really natural.  You'll need better make up. A shave of your arms and legs wouldn't go amiss. Then some jewelry.  Yes, a bit more to do yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So basically I still look like a boy in a dress then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look like someone who needs a little more help to look their best in the outfit you've chosen. Even some girls need a little help looking a bit better, so don't feel bad about it. Besides, I...,\" she pauses slightly... \"I think you actually look really quite cute.\" With that you feel her gently slap your butt again.  \"I've never been particularly inclined towards girls, but if I was I think you may have been a contender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen..<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Although, you do wonder if she thinks you're cute as a boy, too, since you haven't really changed your look that much, just enough to fool the other boys earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a knock at the door, and Sarah says, \"Come in,\" while you're still considering all this and forgetting how you're dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah,\" Robin beams before doing a double-take at you. \"Tilly! My, oh, my,\" and he whistles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it's a few moments before you remember that Tilly is your feminine name. Your blush deepens as a shock appears on your face. Robin blushes a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tony. You did a great job down there. None of them had a clue. Andy even asked if you had a boyfriend. Good thing he didn't see you in this or he might have asked you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush deepens with your emotions are all over the place from feeling embarrassed to giddy to angry at Robin's whistle, even to thankful for Sarah's help, ending on totally confused.

It's not a good look,\" Sarah directs then asks Robin. \"Where are they now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent them home saying that it must be really difficult to get Tony fixed up which is why you must have called Tilly over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles then offers seriously, \"Well, there is some more work we need to do which is why we were trying on these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might hold off 'til near the end of class on the fancy stuff, though.\" Robin gives you a wink indicating it's a jest. \"Look, Tony, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

You half want to lead them along for the way they sort of bullied you into this, then surprise them, or maybe embarrass them. Or you could never tell them and make Tilly just disappear - after getting Andy to ask her out. You chuckle to yourself about that. Of course, if you don't tell them, it may mess up the whole class project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you pondering what to do, Sarah steps in with, \"Robin, why don't you give us some time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

His red hair was styled with extensions, his eyelashes were longer, eyebrows thinner, his lips looked fuller and redder, and his skin seemed smooth and hairless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a girl!\" The other boys, Tom and Harry say with a laugh. Robin just glares at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you're next.\" Robin gives the two boys an evil grin as they walk into the salon. Twenty minutes pass and they return, made up just like girls. Harry looks like he could pass with the proper clothes, but Tom looks like a bad Drag Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you two next...\" Harry says with a sigh, before Andy hops off his seat and steps in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, what are ya watin' for Tony?\" Andy calls to you as you reluctantly follow him in to a room filled with pink. You see two chairs cleared for you, and a tall redhead, Robin's sister, gestures for you to take a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two are four and five, right?\" Robin's sister, whose name tag reads Rebecca, asks. \"Can't say I understand you boys wanting to do this, but that's your choice.\" She gestures to he coworker, who begins shaving Andy while Rebecca does the same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next twenty minutes, your face is shaved, followed by your legs (which requires you to take off your pants, much to your embarrassment,) then makeup is applied to your skin to hide your beard shadow, followed by mascara to make eyes look bigger, your brows are trimmed, and your lips are painted with lipstick. Finally, she applies hair extensions and styles them into wavy curls. When she turns your chair so you can see yourself in the mirror, you are amazed to see yourself as a pretty brunette. You look over to Andy to find he now looks like a gorgeous blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the best I can do,\" Rebecca says, \"I'd suggest getting some clothes, though, if you really want to complete the look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" Andy exclaims, taking your hand. \"Let's go clothes shopping, Tony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting way too into this, man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy shakes his head. \"I'm just committing to the role is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you reply, \"but let go of my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" he says as he leads you out of the salon, still holding your hand, \"girls hold hands all the time.

The really weird part was underwear though; it took a lot of work to get a bra on (though you weren't sure why you even needed it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Tom, you felt bad for him. Even in girl's clothes he couldn't disguise his large masculine frame. Still, you hoped for his sake people would just think he's a fairly muscular girl. Robin and Harry fared a bit better, looking like they might pass. What really surprised you was Andy: to complete his blonde look he was now wearing a pink blazer with a white shirt underneath, paired with a short pink skirt to show off his smooth legs and matching pink heels he somehow knew how to walk in perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I look good, guys, but that's no reason to drool.\" Andy said, and you indeed caught yourself with your mouth agape. Looking around, you noticed the others were staring too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just wasn't expecting you to be so good at this.\" Robin stammered out. \"Have you done this before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy laughed at the question, but there was something underneath the laugh... Nervousness? \"Well, I think we should choose our new names now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New names?\" Tom balked. \"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I ain't ever heard of a girl named 'Tom' or 'Harry', have you?\" Andy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Tom growled, \"call me Tammy, then. That good enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Andy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll be Harriet,\" Harry decided. Robin, on the other hand, insisted his name was gender neutral already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my name's Juliette,\" Andy explained, \"At least it's original. What about you?\" The group turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Tonya I guess?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette shrugs. \"Your choice. So... Now what? It's getting pretty late, we could call it a day... or go grab some pizza as girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh,\" Robin grunted. \"I'm going home. I've had enough of this for one day.\" Harriet and Tammy agreed, and began to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Juliette exhaled, \"guess it's just us then. Girl date?\" The way he (she? They?) smiled made you wonder how platonic that was meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched the back of your neck. You <i>would</i> like to put off meeting your parents like this as long as possible, but something about 'Juliette's' excitement for all this girly stuff was making you feel a bit nervous. What if <i>you</i> started to like it too?</span></div></div>",

You introduce yourself to the other members of your group, and they similarly tell you that they are Tom (the other boy), Samantha, Josephine, and Tamara (the three girls).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you ask, trying to get things moving forward, \"Does anyone know what the project needs to focus on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was the first to respond. \"Didn't you read the brochure? It laid it out in that. We need to agree a project to study behaviors, but clearly need to steer clear of the obvious topics that have been done before.  So we need something original, but which meets the brief. The fact that you haven't even read the brochure isn't going to help us at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm sorry. I was a bit busy. Besides I didn't think it was going to spell out the project topics, just introduce the new department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well.\" Sam replies. \"We still need to think of something for the project...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next 30 minutes talking over a variety of different behaviors that you think could be displayed and potentially measured but with little real success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whose behavior are we trying to study?\" Tamara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't understand.\" Jo responds. \"\"Aren't we just supposed to be measuring behaviors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy tries to elaborate. \"Yes, but most behaviors are in response to something. So my little sister behaves like a 9 year old because she is a 9 year old, but people around her also behave in a particular way, knowing that she is a 9 year old. If she behaved like a 3 year old, would that affect how people treated her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they'd say 'act your age'\" Tom chips in. \"I get that a lot from my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what do you do then?\" Tammy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, generally stop mucking about and do what I'm supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy continues with her idea. \"So if your mom didn't say anything, you'd carry on mucking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess so, for a while anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you mom was to actually treat you as if you were a 10 year old all the time?\" Tammy prompts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, dunno. Guess if I could get away with it, I'd probably carry on acting like a 10 year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Tammy exclaims with a flourish. \"So what we have is behaviors which can be controlled by the actions of others! What we need to do is think of examples we could try out, and then measure the affects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What - like me acting like a 10 year old? \"Tom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of, but we need to work out how to manage the behaviors by both people. Guess your mom wouldn't really want you running riot at home - besides we need to keep everything inside the group if we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tom acts like a 10 year old around us, but we let him?\" Jo asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy concludes her initial proposal. \"Not exactly, but on those lines. This will involve role play. We will each of us in the group to take on different roles to interact with each other, one to set expectations, and then see how the other responds. But we need to make each scenario as realistic as possible to get the best reactions. So, ideas in the hat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you all now consider different roles based around the idea that Tammy has put forward, and compile a list of possible behavioral pairings regardless of how practical they would be: teacher and student, boss and employee, master and slave, adult and young child; boyfriend and girlfriend, siblings, dominatrix and submissive partner, mother and baby... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple are rapidly struck from the list (teacher and student first to go), and Tammy questions who added the dominatrix.... perhaps one for the back burner. You are all feeling like having some fun with this, and agree you would need to be a bit different to get it noticed and therefore (hopefully) a decent grade. So you all agree that you will focus on three ideas:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Eventually you agree that two of the group will take on the roles, and the others will try to monitor and record the relative behaviors, and particularly how the 'child'  will respond when quite literally treated as a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all draw straws to seen who take on which role, which seems the fairest way. Jo picks out the first short straw (mother) and you pick out the other (child). Well, that seems quite a good outcome for you - the others will be doing all the work monitoring and logging the results, and all you need to do is cram around and play with toys. That's a pretty good result!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Tammy then outlines how you are going to run the project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said we want to have the scenario as realistic as possible, so this in not something to cover off in an hour in a lecture room. I suggest we run this over a weekend, which should give everyone a chance to get into their character a bit better, and give us a reasonable period to see if behaviors change at all. My sister's house is empty at the moment so we could all stay there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all agree that seems a sensible arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy continues \"And of course we will need to arrange a suitable environment for the play acting, any equipment we will need, and appropriate clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes?\" you ask. \"What clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're going to act as if you're a young child, then we can't have you wearing your school uniform, or your football strip or whatever. We will need to have you dressed as a toddler. Similarly Jo will dress as a young mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but....\" you tail off. You realize that actually that does make sense. \"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, can everyone make this weekend? Sis is away, so I can get her place ready. She already has a room decked out as a nursery so that save up a fit of effort. Just need to get some outfits sorted out for you guys - enough to last a weekend in character. Anyone up for a bit of shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As her playacting boyfriend you'd be quite happy to snog her - or more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let pull straws to see who will be involved with this, and which role we'll take.\" Tammy continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, surely it will only be between Tony and me for the role of the boy?\" Tom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't see why.

You looked over your red straw, then over at his blue, unsure of what to expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so Tom, you'll be paired with Tony, and Sam, you and Jo will be the next group,\" Tammy says, \"but first, we gotta prepare. This'll be interesting either way, though.\" She said, smiling at Tom, who was somewhat concerned and confused, and you. You were altogether unsure of what to think, say or do besides look at the straws and hang your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But which one is the girlfriend?\" Jo asked, \"and what happens to the rest of us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tammy started, \"the first question isn't so easy. We can either take a vote, or go by color rules, whichever suits this better. If we go by vote, we'll need to raise hands for Tony or Tom individually, but if we go by color rules, blue comes before red, which means Tony will be the girlfriend,\" she says, looking over the straws one more time and nodding. \"As for what the rest of us do, well that's simple; for the first few months, Sam will study Tom's behavior, and I will study Tony's. Jo will record the results. Then we will reverse, to see what results are to be had when different people record behaviors and see if any patterns start to emerge,\" she says. \"So, do we vote, or do we go by color rules?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" you start to protest, \"surely this won't last the whole semester, right?\" You finally ask, dreading the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Tammy says, \"it will. Behavior Sciences lasts all semester, and indeed, all year, so you'll need to attend classes, lectures, and such dressed for the occasion; don't worry, I will file the appropriate paperwork, talk with the principal and teachers and inform them about this so you won't have any embarrassing situations. Unless a pigeon flies through and scratches my eye, or I call in sick of course,\" she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..don't we get any say in this whatsoever?\" Tom asks, speaking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jo says, \"you get to pick whether or not you're the boyfriend or the girlfriend. So, we doing this vote, or going by 'color' rules? Whatever that is,\" she said, not entirely convinced anything like what Tammy suggested even exists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy rolls her eyes at Jo, shaking her head, \"It's just something I came up with based on the color palette; red comes after blue, green comes after blue, etc, right? It's simple; the color that comes after is the girlfriend, and the boyfriend comes before that. It's based more on placement, and the idea of co-existing on the same plane, but in separate panels, together. Make sense?\" Tammy asks, glancing at Jo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo and Sam both nod, while Tom leans over to whisper in your ear, \"I don't get this at all.\" You retort back similarly, though you did get the gist of it, you still weren't sure you followed this kind of rule. The vote sounded better, and this rules thing seemed like a ploy to make sure you were the girlfriend either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we go for a vote,\" you say finally, prompting the girls to look over in your direction, eyebrows raised. \"But why?\" Sam finally asks, \"the color rules are easier. Besides, even if we did do a vote, you'd be the choice,\" she said. \"I mean, Jo, Tammy and I all agree that the color rules are good, so why bother with the vote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't understand it,\" you said, \"but I feel like I'm being unfairly ganged up on here!\" You said, a bit too loudly; the teacher looked up from the desk to glance in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright over there?\" The teacher asked, staring at your group in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine,\" Tammy says, \"just a bit of a disagreement over something. We'll sort it out,\" she reassures the teacher, who nods compliantly, and sits back down at the desk, pouring over some basic paperwork and forms. \"Look, I'll understand if you think we're ganging up on you, but we aren't. It's basic logistics; Jo, Sam and I all agree with the color rules, and we all agreed on you. Tom is unlikely to protest, as he probably doesn't want to dress like a girl for a year,\" she glances at Tom, who, despite a feverish protest from you, nods, \"so no matter what, we're ending up with the same result; you. Sorry, Tony.\" She says, though you don't think she really means it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you finally say, giving in, \"I guess I have no choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Sam says, smiling, \"but first thing's first; we have to get this squared away with the principal and teachers, at least aside from our own,\" she says, \"I'll help Tammy with that. The second order of business though, is the play itself; since the actors have been decided, we'll need the costumes. Tom's already got his costume on, so that leaves Tony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble, knowing you had no choice in the whole matter, and nod. \"Yeah, yeah. Let's..at least try and hurry it up,\" you said dejectedly. Tom nudged you gently, muttering an apology in your direction, \"don't apologize, you don't have anything to apologize for. I agreed to the group and the project, so I gotta agree to the rules. Even if I'm not thrilled by them,\" you say to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom just shrugs and sits back in his chair; you grumble, looking over at your new 'boyfriend', and sigh. How this was going to work out, you had no clue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First order of business,\" Jo said, trying to alleviate the depressive environment cooked up between your appointment as Tom's girlfriend, \"is Tony's clothes. Name will come last, but clothes first. So, what're we doing about this?\" She asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anything too girly, I hope,\" you said, perking up a bit; you could, at least hopefully, keep it from being TOO embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Tammy says, looking you over; Sam and Jo also do the same. \"He's pretty skinny; could probably fit into either mine or Jo's clothes. Sam's too, come to think of it. What do you all think?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom raises his hand to speak up, and the girls turned their gazes over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to at least say what I like in a girlfriend,\" he said, \"if that'll help or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sam said, smiling, \"in fact, it'll help us decide whose clothes Tony will swap with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you said, gently banging your head against the desk; you knew Tom's words had weight, and would impact what kind of year you would have to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tom said, \"I really like girls who..\"</span></div></div>",

They have long hair and prefer skirts and dresses unless pants are just more practical, like for hiking for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled, and Tammy says, \"That will be fun! Okay, everyone meets at my house tonight at six o'clock. We have a lot of work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group tells the teacher of your project, \"Excellent!,\" she looks at you, \"Don't worry, I will take care of the school, and I will inform your parents. In fact, I can meet with them while your group is meeting at Tammy's to transform you.\" You groan loudly! That is just great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show up at Tammy's house a little late on purpose. As soon as you knock, the door opens and you are dragged upstairs to Tammy's room. Once there, they hand you a package of panties, a bra, and a pink robe, with interactions to choose a pair of panties from the pack, put on them, the bra, and the robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look with dismay at the panties. You are not sure what you were expecting, but somehow you had a foolish hope that you could find a pair of panties that was not so feminine. That thought makes you laugh at yourself a little, but just a little. You struggle with the bra, but eventually get it on. The cups seem a bit large to you. At last you put on the robe and gather you things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are instructed to place your old clothes on the bed, and then you are escorted back to the bathroom where the girls washed your hair twice and conditioned it even more! You were then taken back to the bedroom, sat down at a vanity, and started on lessons on applying foundation. When they were satisfied, they made you take it off and put it on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam said, \"That is good! She, um he, is starting to come along.\" She paused, \"I can do it this way though. He needs to be a she. We need to name her and only refer to her in feminine terms after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protested, \"Hey! Shouldn't I pick my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey giggled, \"Did you pick the name you have now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled, \"No, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smiled, \"Then you shouldn't pick a girl's name either.\" After much debate, during which you were forced to learn more about applying makeup, the girls come to you and Tammy says, \"You are now Emily Nicole! Welcome sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at each other and Sam says, \"Now! Let's make Emily look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey move in like crazy, one working on your hair, another your nails, and another your makeup. It seems like forever to you, but they finally stop. Tammy comes close to you and says, \"Excuse me Emily. I just need to put these in.\" She inserts two large, pink water balloons into the bra you are wearing. It seems a bit much to you, but you know better than to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your nails are dry, including your toe nails, they dress you in a blouse with a blue-flower print. Next they teach you how to put on pantyhose, which is even more awkward feeling to you with the weight on your chest. That is followed by a blue skirt and a pair of Espardrille sandals with three-inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protest, \"Why do I need to wear heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy giggles, \"You need to get used to them. Now turn around.\" They gasp and giggle as you awkwardly turn on the heeled shoes you are wearing. Tammy says, \"I think she is prettier than me! That does not seem fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turn you to a full-length mirror, and you gasp as you see not three, but four pretty girls, and the only one in a skirt is you! Except for the short, but feminine hair, you looked like a real girl! You get scared, \"This has gone too far! I can't do this!\" You look for your stack of clothes, intending to put them back on, but they are gone! \"Where are my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggles and points to a large, pink suitcase and some bags, \"In there!\" She smiled, \"We all donated something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did through them, but only girls clothing, underwear, and shoes are to be found. \"Not this stuff! MY clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy turns you toward her, \"For the rest of the school year, those ARE your clothes! Get used to it!\" She hefts touches your balloon filled chest, \"Except for those. Those are temporary until the falsies that were donated arrive. We are done for now. You will have more lessons as the week goes by. You will find Tom is waiting downstairs to walk you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. \"Where is my wallet? My keys to get in, my cell phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smiled, \"In here of course. You will need to get used to carrying it. Most of your skirts and dresses don't have pockets.\" She handed you a purse. You grabbed it, put it on your shoulder, and with their help, carried your new clothing down. You knew what you would do with them as soon as you were home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom looked up and saw you, he whistled, \"Wow! I gotta be honest, I thought you would be a dog of a girl, but wow! Ready to go home Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled, \"Ready to give you a punch in the face if you don't watch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel strange walking in a skirt in public, but the weirdest part was having guys notice you, and some even whistle! It seemed like forever to get to your house! You couldn't wait to get out of this girly getup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you got in, you were greeted by your parents and teacher. Your mom said, \"Oh my word! You are so pretty! I knew you should have been born a girl! This will be so much fun to have a daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is more you don't know.

When you open the door to your room though, you find it transformed! There are pink curtains on your window, girlie posters on your wall, a white vanity has replaced your desk, and the sheets and pillow cases on your bed are full of pink flowers printed on them. A quick look through your closets and draws reveals that all of your male clothing is gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom and your teacher walk in. You look at your mom, \"What is going on? Where are my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mom smiles, \"Sweetie, this is a great experiment! I am glad you are doing it. The best way to move forward is if you live a girl's life the whole way. We can't have you living a dual life. Girl by day, boy by night. You are a girl now Emily, and I am here to help you learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it! And she has not called you 'sweetie' since you were in kindergarten! You sit on your bed, shaking you head, \"I think this was a mistake. I don't want to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mom comes to you. \"It wasn't, and you are committed now.\" She takes your hand. \"I sent your dad to the donation bin. All of your male clothes are gone. The only things you have to wear are what you brought with you.\" She smiled, \"The great news is that, the owner of one of the biggest teen shops in town has donated a thousand dollar shopping spree for you! We will have you looking great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned, \"You\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026 threw my clothing out! How could you do that without asking me? That is not right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mother looks at you sternly, \"Emily, we will talk more abut this later, but for now, you need to sit correctly! Straighten your back and cross your legs! I can see your panties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and realize that the way you are sitting matters a lot in a skirt! You turn read and cross your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mother adds, \"We will work on how to sit in a skirt more tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up again, \"I don't want to learn how to sit in a skirt! I want to wear pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your mom and your teacher shake their heads. This time it is your teacher who says, \"No. The best method is emersion, as I discussed with your parents. You will have to earn the privilege of wearing slacks Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get mad. \"I am NOT EMILY! I AM TONY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your mom look at your teacher. You see your teacher nod. Then your mom walks up to you and says, \"One more thing sweetie. If you want to consider changing back, open your mouth and say ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa! Do you want to change back? Are they kidding? You don't know what that has to do with it, but you do as she asks. The next thing you know,  she sprays two pumps of something down your throat! Even as you cough, mostly from surprise, you notice your cough sounds strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your mom and say, \"What was that?\" But your voice has changed! It sounds girly! Very girly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher chimes in, \"It is a new invention, not even on the market yet. An old classmate of mine invented it.That dose should keep you sounding like that for a week. The more you use it, the longer it will last.\" She gives you a wide grin, \"So you can stay dressed as a girl and sound like a girl, or you can try to come off as a boy, but sound like a girl. Which is it? Are you Tony or Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you are defeated. You have no male clothing, a girl's voice, and even your parents are backing this. You sigh, and it sounds more feminine than you would like, \"Okay, you win. I am Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looks at you, \"And who is Tom to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again, \"He is my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and looks at your mom, \"I think she is off to a good start. This will be an interesting school year for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and walk to your window, \"If you are happy now, may I be alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they quietly leave, you wonder how you ever got yourself into this. What is next?</span></div></div>",

I don't get up this early!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Well sweetie, you'll find you need to get up earlier from now on. It takes a girl longer to do her hair and makeup, not to mention picking out the right clothes for the day. Since I have to help you, we have to get up extra early, so if you want a little more sleepy time, the sooner you learn how to do your hair and makeup yourself, the more sleep you will get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, but what can you say? At least you learned how to do the foundation. Your mom fusses with your hair, keeping the feminine style intact. You pay close attention to how she applies your makeup. She makes you apply the lipstick yourself, saying, \"You need to know how to do that since you'll need to freshen it from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all is done, and she has you dressed in a lavender dress, she looks at you and smiles, \"You are so pretty sweetie, I can't even see a hint of Jeff! And that nice boy Tom is waiting outside to walk you to school. Have a good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walk outside, Tom is there, \"Wow! Good morning! You look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks shocked, \"Wow! Not only do you look like a girl, you sound like one! Ready to go to school?\" You only nod.  \"I am supposed to take you to the office first when we get there.\" He smiles, \"Here, let me carry your books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl on the inside and wonder if he would be willing to carry your purse too, but you take advantage of this one perk, and let him carry your books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to school, they take your picture and give you a new ID as Emily! You realize that you are in deeper with every passing minute. The principal then says to you, \"Now Emily, The staff has discussed this. You will be allowed, even expected, to use the girl's bathrooms now. However, since things get a little more intimate in the locker room, even though you are now in the girl's gym class, you will change in the unisex bathroom in the gym. We don't want to much fuss from the other girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hands you a pill, \"We also have your parents permission to give you this. Please take it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at it, \"What is it?\" They won't answer, but you shrug, \"Okay.\" You grab the glass of water the nurse offers and take the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal smiles, \"Good. You will report to the nurse every morning for your pill. If you don't, you will get detention. Understood?\" You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then talked to you about the school in general. \"Since the goal is for you to learn what it is like to be female, and treated as such, we decided to keep who you really are a secret. Only the ones in the group and a select few staff know who you really are. To everyone else, you are a visiting student. We will tell everyone that you are in a sort of exchange program where Jeff went to another school for the rest of the school year, and you came here. If anyone reveals your secret, they will be severely punished. You also need to be responsible for keeping your secret. We can't be responsible for the results if you let your secret out. You must learn to act as a girl at all times, is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but realize you are truly trapped now. You leave, and Tom is there waiting to escort you to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thankful that the halls are empty as you walk next to Tom. But when you walk into class, there's a bit of a buzz. At first you think that your secret is already out, but then you realize from the looks the boys are giving you, that they really think you are a new girl! You're not sure what to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at John, one of the school jocks. He grins at you and flexes his muscles. As you are ready to throw up in your mouth? The girl next to you, Mandy, says, \"Hi, I am Mandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \"My name is Emily. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins, \"Ignore him Emily. He is a hunk, but he is also a jerk toward girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked to hear this. You had always thought that girls swooned over John! Then it occurs to you. Mandy was talking to you girl-to-girl! She would probably not tell Jeff how she felt about John, at least, not unless they were very good friends. This is what the experiment is all about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses become easier to deal with as the day goes on, but walking into the girl's bathroom for the first time was hard. You were glad there were no screams, but you rushed into a stall all the same. This was going to be the biggest pain yet. All you had to do was pee, but there were no urinals, even if you would be allowed to use one. And not only did you have to sit down to pee, but you had to go through pulling down pantyhose and panties, and then putting them on again when you were done. No wonder girls took so long in the bathroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, it was odd to see lipstick on your glass and know it was your own lipstick. Tammy ate with you and reminded you to freshen you makeup afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so happy when school's over, though you had to admit that it went well, all things considered. You really don't want to go to Tammy's house, but Tom won't let you go home. \"You need to go through your training. They said we need to do this every day until you can pass their tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"I know, I know! I need to be able to pass as a girl in every way.\" You grumble, \"That does not mean I have to enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get inside, You are forced to strip to you panties, then you find out that...</span></div></div>",

All this attention from the girls causes you to feel a stirring in your crotch, but instead of the embarrassing erection that you expected, you only feel an unfamiliar tingle. Nothing more happens than that you can feel a small amount of your cum leak into the padded crotch of your panties. (Since your penis is tucked back to give you a somewhat flat looking crotch.) That actually worries you. You should be rock hard right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your body is perfectly smooth, dried off, and ready, you get the biggest shock. Tammy produces a pair of high quality, artificial breasts. They are so good they even have realistic nipples! They walk up to you and play around making marks on your body and working out just where the breasts should be positioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Why are you making such a fuss? They are just bra stuffers anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smile, but say nothing. They then apply something to your skin, and after a time, you see them apply something else to the back of the false breasts. They then carefully place them on your chest, one girl holding each one in place for a while. When they are done, the girls let go. To your surprise, the breasts don't fall off. Worse than that, you can feel them pulling on your skin. They are glued to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout, \"What is this? What did you do? Take them off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's giggle, but it is Sam who tells you. \"A girl's breasts are not just bra stuffers Emily, they are a part of her. These are the top-of-the-line in realistic look and feel. The glue we used is semi permanent, and needs a special remover to safely remove the breasts. From now on, you'll know what it like to really have breasts. Welcome to our club girl.\" She smiled, \"You may get dressed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull the breasts off, but it hurts if you pull too hard. They are truly stuck to you! When they see the trouble you have putting on your bra, the girls do teach you how to do it more easily.  You are amazed at how every single motion of your body somehow gets transmitted to your new breasts, and you can feel them move and jiggle. You find yourself actually relieved when they are held in place by a bra. They still move, but it is less noticeable and far less annoying. Do all girls feel that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next lesson was makeup. More practice, practice, practice! When that was done, it was lessons on sitting. You were glad when it was time to go home, but things were not to end. Sam says, \"If you are supposed to be Tom's girlfriend, you need to get used to being close to him. Go over there and sit with Tom.\" You do, but they make you move over until you're snug against him. Sam smiled, \"Good! That's how a girl sits against her boyfriend! Now Tom, put your arm around her and lets watch this TV show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a half-hour, you have to sit there with Tom's arm around your shoulder. Sometimes he squeezes your shoulder, and it feels very strange. You're relieved when it's finally time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, your mom's overjoyed to learn about your new breasts. You're less than thrilled though, as they are a pain when you're trying to get a comfortable position to sleep. Sleeping on your stomach was out for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you manage to go to sleep. Perhaps it was thinking about the fact that tomorrow will be Friday, and at least you won't have to deal with school over the weekend. You do wonder what new humiliations tomorrow would hold for you though.</span></div></div>",

Your teacher told me that you have gymnastics for gym today, so you'd better pick out a leotard to wear.\" your Mom says, smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, and sit up in bed. \"Do I really have to wear a leotard Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sweetie.

Besides, all the other girls will be wearing them.Try one to see how it fits.\" your Mom says, still smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and get up, and go across to your dresser to look for a non girly leotard. you find a red and black one that you quite like the look of, so you take off your night gown and try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/1896900_10152314337781706_2929917740903777314_n.jpg?oh=4d057a0ed9e817caac536b4cc27569a9&amp;oe=550E0579\" target=\"_blank\">https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hpho...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels really nice on.

She starts brushing your hair gently, and you find you quite enjoy the experience of having your hair brushed. She then put your hair into a pony tail. You smile at her and give her a hug, and she hugs you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really enjoying having a daughter.  I'm sorry I got rid of all your clothes. It was a bit hasty. Once you're back to being Jeff again I'll buy you new clothes, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that Mom, thanks. No hurry though. I'm starting to like being Emily\" you say without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course you can sweetie. I love having a daughter. Now take off your leo and get ready for School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off the leotard and put on a cute sweater dress with black tights, then go to have breakfast with your Mom and Dad..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Yes, you have your lessons to work on, but they are going well, and you are getting used to being treated as a girl. Things are going mostly smooth for two weeks when something new develops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are at your locker, before you are able to close it, a big football player by the name of Brad leans up against the door so that you can't close it. You look up at him, \"Um, excuse me Brad. I need to head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, \"Don't worry baby. Why don't I walk you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"Thanks for the offer, but I already have a boyfriend. You know I am dating Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs, \"Tom! He is not much of a man so much as a good boyfriend! You must not think much of him anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused, \"What would make you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, \"I have watched you two together. You never hug, never kiss. He didn't even take you to the last dance!\" He smiles at you, \"I would do that and much more for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are upset, not only at this problem people are seeing, but at Brad's presumption that you would care! \"Well, he is taking me to the next dance, and as for the kissing and stuff, that was me, not him. I wanted to see if we were compatible first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned, \"So, is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but say, \"Just wait and see. In any case, it is not any of your business.\" He had relaxed his hold on the locker door, so you take your chance to push him off and close the door, then stomp away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at Tammy's you tell the group what happened. Sam frowns, \"He is right you know. The two of you don't really act like much of a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked shocked, \"What are you saying? I need to kiss Tom? I don't know if I can do that! Besides,\" you look at Tom, \"Tom has a say in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles shyly, \"Well, it might not be hard for me. To be honest, it is hard for me to think of you as anything but a girl named Emily. It would not be hard for me to kiss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned, but before you can answer, Tammy joins in, \"That settles it, we need to focus on you to acting like a real couple. Emily, how are you at poker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou played, but you didn't feel that you gained much. If you won, you got a new pair of pantyhose or something feminine. If you lost, you had to give Tom a kiss on the lips. Unfortunately for you, you lost a lot. But in spite of your being very embarrassed at first, by the time the night was over, you were at least 'used' to giving Tom a small kiss on the lips. It wasn't' unpleasant, but you would die before you admitted that to anyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the insistence of the others, you kissed Tom goodnight when he walked you home from then on, and kissed him hello in the morning. It was harder in school, but Tom insisted on a kiss from time to time, and eventually you got used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was two weeks to the next dance, and what were you going to do? You had told Brad that Tom would take you! You knew you were stuck now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Tom takes you to the dance, you have adjusted very much to your new life. Enough so that you don't feel awkward walking into the dance wearing a short skirt and heels. In the two months that have passed, your hair has grown out faster than normal for some reason. It is now almost shoulder length, so you look a lot more feminine in that way too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also are used to walking around holding Tom's hand. And while you would never admit to it, you feel very secure when he is around. You were never a good fighter, and the nice thing about being a girl is, they rarely fight physically. And with Tom to protect you, you find yourself feeling more secure as a girl than you did as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you are nervous too. This is your first dance as a girl, and you wonder if you can really pull it off. Part of your nervousness comes from the other girls. While girls may not fight the way boys do, they can be very nasty. And some of the girls were jealous of your looks, and even of you being Tom's girlfriend. It was good at first that the other girls in the group were there for you at times, but you did make other friends. Mandy, the girl you talked to you first day in school as a female has become a close friend. Knowing that her and her boyfriend Paul will be there helped you have the courage to come to the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet up and Mandy greets you with a hug, \"Hey Emily! I am glad you made it! Paul is great, but it is good to have other nice guys to swap with and mix it up some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had not thought about that, but it was true that there was a lot of swapping partners at these dances. On the inside, you began to panic at the thought of needing to dance with guys other than Tom, but you tried not to show it, \"Always glad to help you out Mandy! Just don't steal my boyfriend!\" You both giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoyed yourself greatly, dancing with Tom and Paul, until there were series of slow dances. It was very nice at first to dance with your head on Tom's shoulder, but then the DJ called for a change of partners. The next thing you knew, you were dancing with one of the football players, and he seemed to like to dance while holding your ass! He made sure to give it a good squeeze when he left you, and you found that many guys treated you the same way. One even groped your breast. Your breast may be artificial, but it was still attached to you, and you had learned to recognize certain sensations transmitted through the gel inside it. You made sure to slap that guy's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in the girl's bathroom, Tammy caught you alone. \"Wow! Emily! You are doing great!\" She checked the stalls to make sure you were alone, then said, \"I swear to you, if I didn't know who you really are, I would never suspect you are a guy! How do you feel tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, \"Well, to be honest, I like it a lot. I was always too shy as a guy to ask girl's to dance, but tonight, if I have any problem, it is turning down offers. Tom has been such a gentleman to me also. He is a really nice guy.\" You notice Tammy staring at you, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"The way you said that, it was like a real girl.\" She hesitated, \"Are you falling for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply, \"What!?!? No!!! He is a good friend! That is all! The rest is just part of the act!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy looked unconvinced, \"Well, maybe, but you know we don't really know what is in that pill they are giving you. What if, well, it helps you like guys or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou counter, \"No. They wouldn't do that! Besides, I still like girls.\" Just then some girls walk in and the conversation ended. But as you walk back to Tom, you really begin to wonder how much of Emily has taken over Jeff. You may have denied it, but you really don't feel the same toward girls as you did. You also realize you should be asking more questions about that medication.</span></div></div>",

When he kisses you at the door, it is a long and passionate kiss, and his hands are all over your rear! What is more, you love it! You love it all! And after you go inside, you lean against the door panting. You have come to the realization that you really do love Tom! How is that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice other things too. Your hips seem to be getting bigger, your waist smaller, and in spite of your excitement, you did not have a single twitch from your cock tonight! As you went upstairs to use the bathroom, you suddenly notice what you should have noticed before. Your cock looks smaller than it used to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday, when you go into the nurses office for your pill, you look at it and say, \u201cOkay, enough secrets. What is this doing to me? I have some idea, but I want to know now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse called in your teacher who explained, \u201cYes Emily, it is doing some things to you, but only enough to make things easier.\u201d When you questioned what, she reluctantly said, \u201cIt is a new treatment that a friend of mine is developing. I can\u2019t begin to explain how it works, but it kind of, well, tells your body what to turn on and what to turn off. It is not hormones, so it is not the same thing. It is fully reversible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare, \u201cYou still did not say what it changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \u201cWell, it gives you faster growing hair, and makes it thinner like a female. It also makes some changes in your body. It make your hips wider, waist narrower, and shrinks your penis a bit.\u201d Your look makes her continue, \u201cit also, well, gives you some female tendencies, such as being attracted to guys and preventing you from getting an erection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at her, \u201cIs there more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \u201cNo! I promise. It was just to help you be comfortable as a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize after a moment what really upsets you. \u201dSo this is toned down? Is there a stronger dose, or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stutters, \u201cI, I don\u2019t know. I could call him and ask.\u201d After a time on the phone, she tells you, \u201cThere is more. He could make it so that not only does your penis shrink, but he can make things happen so that you will have an external appearance of a female, well, down there. He could make you grow breasts, but when you go back, you might need surgery to remove the excess skin that will develop. Your muscle tone and voice could be controlled if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, \u201cTell him I want the full package! If I am going to be in love with a guy, I might as well look as much like a girl as possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \u201cOkay, I will order it, but you can\u2019t go that far unless your parents agree.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When you meet him at your home, he looks at you and says, \u201cForgive me for staring, but the effects on you are not only a bit more than I expected, but you are also very pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some questions from your parents about the safety and reversibility of your \u2018treatments\u2019, you ask, \u201cI realize that you cannot make me a true female, but just how far can you take the changes? Could you make me pass for a real female even when I am naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you, \u201cYes. Absolutely. However, depending on what is changed and to what extent, it could effect reversibility. In very non-technical terms, what I am doing is turning genetic switches in your body on and off in a way that is independent of your hormones.\u201d He sighed, \u201cBut to go to the extent you are asking, some things will change. For you to have breasts, as I told you, a reversal won\u2019t removed the expanded skin. That would require surgery. Also, those switches will inevitably require even my method to switch on some hormones. You will end up with true female breasts that are even capable of producing milk. Most likely, in that case, many of your male attributes will change. You will never get male facial hair, and your voice will naturally feminize. Some of that can be hard to change back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \u201cTo do some of what you described, I am a bit hesitant. For one thing, while I can give you a female bone structure, including your pelvis, I would only be willing to do that in a clinic. It is major, would be painful, and is absolutely irreversible. The nature of the differences make it possible to go from male structure to female, but not the reverse. So instead of hips that are padded to look female, you would have real female hips.\u201d He hesitated, \u201cAs to you last request, well, there are two options. I can sculpt your body so that, externally, you will appear to have a vagina, only it will actually only be on the surface. No true depth. This is should be reversible, though you would never have a large penis if you changed back. The other option would, in a sense, invert your penis. Instead of a filled tube going out of your body, it would be a hollow tube going in. It would be flexible, sensitive, and would very closely approximate the feel of a vagina to a sexual partner. However, for reasons that are hard to explain, if you wanted to get rid of that in the future, the best I could give you back is a neutered crotch. You would be neither male or female in appearance. For this reason, I would not recommend going that far unless you are sure you don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him and think of Tom. With a brief discussion with your parents, you decide, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start by giving me real breasts, and the real-looking pussy. Maybe narrow my waist more. Make me look enough like a natural girl that I could walk naked into the shower of the girl\u2019s locker room and not raise and eyebrow. Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \u201cWith the way you look already, yes.\u201d He did some calculations. \u201cIn four weeks, you will look so much like Emily that your own parent will think they had a girl.\u201d He smiled, \u201cAnd as you requested, once the changes are made, it won\u2019t require a daily dose to maintain them. I will flip the right switches so that the changes stay until they are switched back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents signed the papers he required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, The school nurse had your first dose, and you too it gladly! Within a week, you have a noticeable swelling in your breasts, and your penis is so small that you couldn\u2019t use a urinal if you wanted to.</span></div></div>",

With lust in her eyes she presses her mouth against yours. In shock you don't resist and go along with the passionate lip embrace.

Tammy vigorously gropes your ass through the thin material of your dress but you don't stop her, intoxicated by the taste of her lips.

Seems he's always treated his little sisters like shit, and when she heard what he'd done to you, far from being angry at us, she thinks it could be the best thing for him to learn what it's like to be on the receiving end for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like he'll be staying at home for a day or two, but then she's sending him back to school as a girl, and seems he'll be under strict orders to behave properly if he wants any chance to be a boy again before the semester is out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's a turn up! You were a bit worried about his parents reaction, but that's quite unexpected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and apparently he's been renamed. Not sure if he told his mom that we'd called him Tanya, but his mom has re-christened him as Lottie, as that's the name he would have had if he'd been a girl when he was born.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then head to the school office to take your daily tablet, and it's also time for your weekly dose of the voice altering throat spray. You've been taking the tablet daily without asking what they're for, but it hasn't really taken too much of a stretch of your imagination to work it out. In the last few days your body hair has stopped growing and you're convinced that your body is changing shape ever so slightly. It's clearly hormone treatment, and whilst you were initially a bit worried, you're now quite comfortable with it. After all, all you'd have to do at the end of the project is to stop taking them, and all the changes would obviously undo themselves... at least you presume they will. Maybe prudent to check on that point sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start another day at school as Emily, but with no Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Besides, you're still mightily pissed by what Tom did, so you have a genuine distaste about him that you would be happy sharing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was by mutual consent,\" you say. \" He decided that he was superior to me, and learned his lesson the hard way.\" (Yeah, and harder than you're ever likely to find out, you think to yourself.) \"After that he decided that he was incompatible with me, so we split.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn gives you a knowing look, as if he had an inkling of an idea what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I'm looking for someone who isn't a total dickhead, knows how to respect a girl, and doesn't expect his girlfriend to be there purely for decoration and his prestige while he carries on being a total prick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looks slightly taken aback (almost as if he recognizes some of his own traits), but as you stop his eyes seem to brighten slightly, and he looks like he's about to speak. <i>Not on your Nelly</i>, you think, and quickly continue, \"So as there doesn't seem to be anyone around here who would qualify, I thought I may try elsewhere. I've heard that St Mary's (the next closest High school) has a good reputation for having boys who respect the opposite gender, so I may try there....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can see that John has figured out what you're saying, and clearly on behalf of the male of the species he feels he has got to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit unfair on the guys here, you know. Yeah, there may be a few who are a bit, um, dis-respect-ful to um, girls, but they're only a minority.\" Boy, you can appreciate that was not only a mouthful for him to spit out, but also surprisingly coherent. To be honest its probably the first time you've actually heard him say the word 'girl' instead of 'skirt'.             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you respond, \"when I find someone who doesn't fit in this minority then I might be interested, but until then I think I'll focus my attention on St Mary's. It'll take a lot for someone here to convince me they warrant any of my time. If they do, then that's fine, but they'd have to earn the right to consider me a friend, let alone girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you slam your locker, snap the lock into place, and turn and walk away, before John the Jerk has any opportunity to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn the corner in the corridor so you're out of view you slow you pace a bit, and reflect on what you've just said. Oh, crap. You really need to keep your Emily persona under control. You've just told the school jock that you think the vast majority of the mail students consider girls to be arm d\u00e9cor, and that none of the boys are worth your time. You reckon death threats are possibly the nicest reaction you may end up receiving....  bugger. May be you'd better consider moving to St Mary's at this rate. You may manage to survive the semester there, at least!       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, the Hell with John the jock. What next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I like long hair, but I don't really care for makeup or heels.\" You sigh. That's...something, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chuckle. \"Alright, that's fine,\" says Jo. \"Now we don't have the necessary stuff here, so I think we should meet at my house tonight to change Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group tells the teacher about the project. You're hoping she'll reject it so you can do something else, but no such luck. \"That's a wonderful idea!\" she says. \"Don't worry, I'll handle the paperwork and everything with the school, and I'll notify your parents. I may even be able to get something to make it more authentic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to Jo's house, you see that you're the last to arrive, and Jo quickly drags you to her room. \"Alright,\" says Sam, \"the teacher called me earlier. We'll be getting a bunch of stuff to make this more realistic, but most of it won't get here until tomorrow, so that's when we'll do most of the changing. Tonight'll just be the preliminaries.\" She produces a small bottle of dark red liquid. \"This did arrive today, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the bottle. \"What is this?\" you ask. \"And what stuff are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see the other stuff tomorrow,\" says Sam. \"Way I understand it is, the teacher got approval from your parents and got you into a few trials to get this stuff. It's all reversible...eventually.\" she measures a small amount of the liquid into a small cup and holds it out. \"This is for your voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to take that, and you say so. Tammy sighs. \"Look, this'll be much easier if you cooperate. We could hold you down and force you, but we don't want to do that. If you don't cooperate, we'll tell the teacher and you'll be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, then take the cup and drink the liquid. It tastes bitter, and you cough. You try to speak, but it just comes out as a high squeak. \"Give it a minute to settle,\" says Sam. You glare at them angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo hands you some panties and a bra, and instructs you to change into them. Reluctantly, you strip down, then pull on the panties and get the bra on after a bit of struggle. Tammy quickly takes your boy clothes and puts them aside. Sam produces a pair of small squishy balls, probably stress balls, and inserts them into the cups of the bra. \"That's just for now, until we get something better,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then take you to the bathroom, where they wash your hair and comb it into a softer, more feminine style, saying that this'll make do until your hair gets longer. Tammy considers the makeup, but decides against it, remembering that Tom said he didn't like it. Looking in the mirror, you see you already look rather androgynous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bring you back to the bedroom, where Tom is now waiting, leaning against the wall. Jo passes you a long pale blue dress. \"I know Tom said to put comfort first, so we made sure to get nice comfortable clothes. There are some pants, but you should at least start with a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he -I mean she- is coming along nicely,\" says Jo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Tammy says. \"We need to refer to him as a female. And name her, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't-\" you stop, flinching at the soft feminine sound of your voice. Seems the stuff they had you take is working. \"Shouldn't I pick my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because nobody names themselves,\" says Sam. She talks with the other girls for minute or two, then turns back to you. \"Okay, you're now Amy. Your middle name is Laura, and you keep your last name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I get to decide <i>anything</i>?\" you complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look at each other. \"Sure,\" says Sam. \"You decide your interests and such outside of the relationship, and since you're the girlfriend you can pick what to do on dates - though you <i>do</i> have to accept them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo adds, \"And since Tom got to say what he likes in a girlfriend you get to say what you'd want in a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble: \"If I were a real girl and not a fake one, I'd want someone who's smart and nice, but treats me like a person, not a 'lady'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'fine,\" says Tom, nodding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smiles and pushes over a suitcase. \"In here will be your clothes for this year. We'll keep your old stuff safe.\" She then hands you a small black purse. \"Your wallet, phone, keys, and other stuff's in here. Don't lose it.\" You take the purse hesitantly and hang it on your shoulder. \"Now Tom's going to walk you home,\" she says pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he does.  He even carries the suitcase of girls' clothes for you. When you get home, your mom greets you enthusiastically with a hug. \"This is gonna be so fun!\" she says. \"You make a great girl!\" You just grumble and head upstairs to your room. When you get there, your room is the same, but all your old male clothes are missing. You rush back down and complain about that, but your mother just shakes her head. \"The best method for this experiment is to immerse yourself. You can't be half-girl, half-boy. You have to be a girl all the time. We've put all your old clothes in storage. Don't worry, we won't do anything that can't be reversed - unless you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore that last bit and go back upstairs. You're tired and you want to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Your heart sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom said, \"I'll go in the stall with Tony to see that he takes off all his clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to go through with it, so Tom enters one of the stalls with you, and Jo goes into another.

Unfortunately, you realize too late that it's arousal at having actual girl clothes that a girl just wore and that you get to put on. The only thing missing is the naked girl to make this fantasy complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Tom tsk-tsks directing your attention to where his eyes are pointing. \"Better control that before it becomes too obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn almost as red as the silky panties and bra. You never pictured Jo as the type to wear such frilly, girlie underwear. She's not one to act all super feminine or get made up. Not that she seemed frumpy, but just more ... neutral is the only word that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the bra on first gives your body time to relax so the panties easily fit. Next comes the jeans. They are skinny jeans so you hope they are too tight so you have an excuse to stop this charade, at least for now. However, to your amazement, they slide up your legs smoothly and button up perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn me for being skinny,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you are rather slight, and Jo is a bit pudgy, so all the clothes fit including the shoes. Fortunately, those are just one inch sandals so you don't have to learn to walk on your tiptoes  Even the bra stands out by itself under the denim blouse although you have nothing to fill it. That's when you realize that it's padded. Jo must have very small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set,\" Tom calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready here,\" comes Sam's voice from next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, come on out,\" Tammy instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom steps out first, and you follow very tentatively glancing into the mirror as Tammy says, \"Looks good. ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'It's just a bedroom... It's just a bedroom.', you tell yourself as a mantra. You catch your reflection in the nearby mirror. It's hard not to, there are three of them there, and turned to give an wide view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nervous agitation you're feeling is obvious to anyone else in the room. Your hands fidgeting in your lap, and your collapsed shoulders tell of a man retreating from this environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft fluttering catches your attention, and you turn towards the noise. Just in time, you catch the soft landing of a pair of panties on the bed beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be a girl, all the way down.\" Jo tells you commandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, you find your hand reaching to caress the underwear. It's shinier, and shimmering, satin you guess. Far different from your plain cotton boxers. It's smooth, soft and slightly chilly to your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand twitches, and you jump as a bra lands atop your wandering hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cups look far too big, terrifyingly huge. You look intently at Jo, as she turns back to her wardrobe. Imagining her wearing these items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity! Curiosity, not interest! makes you pick up the bra. Turning it this way and that, you see the different hooks and loops to hold it in place. You discover a tiny tag inside, one side marking it as 'Bravissimo', and the reverse of the tag as '34GG'. Shaking your head, you can tell it's far too big for Jo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what's ahead, you try not to picture yourself wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... Toni.\" Jo chides you. \"Everything will take all night, if you sit entranced by the simplest of items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes goggle, at the satin finery. \"If you're holding out for lacy lingerie, you'll be disappointed, I don't have any.\" she confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T.This...\" you ask uncertainly. Holding up the bra, extended out as if it's an item of some disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that was a joke present from a hen night.\" Jo answers. Her cheeks colour at some memory. \"It's the only one that'll fit.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mustard coloured roll-neck sweater, and a too-brief red skirt land beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have you prancing around in just your underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching mustard socks follow, and you recognise the pattern. \"Jinkies.\" your response getting a broad smile from Jo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather be Daphne?\" she asks. Shifting her hips, as if that somehow defined Daphne. You shake your head, briefly, stiffly, but her question isn't serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toni's taller and thinner than you, she'll make a better Daphne.\" Jo tells you, amused you even needed to answer.</span></div></div>",

Okay.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It came with these.\" Jo announces, turning back to face you. You crash into each other. Or perhaps Jo was being deliberately awkward. She slips two large weights into the sagging cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're filled with two sloshing weights. Each the size and heft of watermelons. You fight the urge to poke and prod them. The battling urge to heave them out. The weight on the straps already digging into your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They came with breast forms.\" she explained, eyeing your bust, appraising it. An embarrassing adjustment, and you find her nodding her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly you're bustier than her now, and feeling self-conscious, you reach for the jumper. Your new heaving chest makes movement awkward, forcing you to consider the effect of your bust moving, and also you have to not bump and jostle the girls yourself too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... body heat activates their adhesive qualities.\" Jo explains as an after thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug the jumper down, snarling to yourself. Face hidden by the jumper, as it snags, caught on the expansive shelf of your bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you emerge from the neck hole, and tug the sleeves into place. Catching your reflection, you have to confess to making a passable Velma. That sumptuous bust doing a lot of the distracting work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo plants the wig atop your head, and slides the glasses into place. Finding yourself looking to a convicing impression of Shaggy Rogers, her bust obviously bound tightly to her chest. The loose fitting hideously green top, hangs down past her... his waist, hiding the start of the equally loose fitting ugly tan trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few straggly hairs are painted onto her chin to suggest a hint of stubble. Jamming her hands in her pockets, Jo lifts the cuffs of her pants, revealing a pair of wedges on her feet. They give her an extra few inches, and you realise that now she's taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoinks... you're pretty Velma.\" Jo says with a good impression of Shaggy.</span></div></div>",

I was only kidding about your being Shaggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an interesting idea, but I'm not kidding Toni. Pants off. Now. Unless you want me to take them off you and give you a spanking first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly remove your pants, not wanting to make a bad situation worse. Jo was clearly a fireball when she got riled.  \"Okay Jo. Whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, Toni. I don't suppose you've ever shaved your legs, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no.

I don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd rather take your spanking and then have me shave you, that's okay too. I'll count to 3.  1, 2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bottle, step into the shower and apply the lotion as directed. After a few minutes, Jo takes the spray nozzle and gently sprays warm water on your legs. They are as bare as Telly Savalas' head. \"See Toni?  What pretty legs you have!\", Jo squealed with delight. \"Now shower and let's get you dressed.\"  You finish the shower while Jo looks through her closet. After toweling off, you wrap the towel around you and head back into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really have to do this, Jo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Toni. We do.\"  Sitting on the bed next to your sweater and red skirt is an oversized green T-shirt and maroon bell bottoms.  \"An old costume of my brother's\", she said, setting a long hair boy's wig next to them on the bed. She hands you the panties. \"I assume you know how to put on underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide the panties up under the towel and step into them. They are silky and luxurious, feeling even more amazing than you'd imagined. Jos grabs the towel and yanks it away.  \"Hey!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make sure they fit you. Turn for me.\" You turn slowly and feel her eyes examine every curve and bulge in the panties. \"Verrrry nice Toni. Let me help you with your bra.\"  She picks it up and steps behind you. Without being told you put your ams through the straps as she holds it in front of you, then works the clasps behind you. \"Now, what to fill it with...\", she wonders. \"Oh, I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo picked up your socks and stuffed them into the bra. There was way too much bra for just your socks, so she deftly pinned up part of the material to make them into a firm set of C cups. She stepped in front of you to examine her work.  \"Jo?\", you ask, \"I don't think I can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can, and you will. We promised the group.  Now put on your sweater, skirt and socks. I'll see if I have some better shoes for you.\"  She picked up the green short and bell bottoms and left you alone in her bedroom to dress.  When she returned she looked like Shaggy Rogers (well, a little anyway) except for her hair. She placed some red flats on the bed. \"My mom's\", Jo said as she put on the Shaggy wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip on the shoes and become suddenly aware that your satiny bottom is feeling the breeze from an open window. \"Thanks, Jo, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jinkies Toni! You look adorable!\"  said Jo. \"  You may be the girl in the room with the too-short skirt but at least of the two, Velma was the smart one.

Well, things are starting to improve already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher asks each group to discuss ideas and agree a topic for the Semester long project, based on the guidelines in the introductory packs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all start talking about their thoughts and ideas, and clearly have a far better understanding of the subject that you. You are seriously floundering with absolutely no idea what the subject matter is or what the project should be about. A number of topics are debated, and some quickly dismissed before you even understood what they were, and many of the details they are talking about are a bit beyond your immediate comprehension. However, they do finally reach a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you are not fully on board with the topic, they try to explain it to you. \"OK Tony, we need to have a project studying either sociological or psychological affects on a person or society. Yeah?  Well we thought we could study how a person's attitudes and behaviors are affected by their gender by them living as the opposite gender. So we'll each take on a roll in the project appropriate to our skills, experience, and suitability. OK?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all agree that this would fully meet the brief, and they all support this choice, but want you to agree as well. Well, it sounds straightforward enough, although you're not sure where you're going to find someone willing to live as the opposite gender, although you guess one of the girls must know someone, otherwise they wouldn't have suggested it. All sounds a bit weird really, but sort of interesting. So, despite not really understanding how this fits the assignment requirements, you agree. They all seem very pleased, and high five each other and you. The fact that they are all smiling at you makes you feel quite buoyant, and a bit more part of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice of project is then announced to your teacher by Rachael, one of the girls in your group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to study the sociological and psychological impacts on a person living as the opposite gender, to determine how the person is perceived by society based on their assumed gender, and how the subject's own attitudes and behaviors are affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael continues. \"Tony has agreed to be our subject for the project. So he will dress as a girl, wear makeup and  act as if he's a girl. We will study how he is treated by his peer group, and how he responds to see if his behaviors change based on his perceived gender.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" you start. \"You didn't say anything about <u>me</u> dressing up as a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" your teacher responds, \"I think you have an excellent topic, so on the assumption that you can resolve Mr Jackson's apparent dissent I think this could be one of the most promising projects so far. Well done group.\" He moves on to the next group, leaving you almost speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At which point did I agree to cross-dress? I thought we were studying someone else, not me!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The project guidelines are quite clear,\" Rachael replies, \"We must select a subject for the project from within our group. Everyone is assigned a roll based on knowledge and suitability. I'm the project leader, Louise is the research assistant, Amy is the archivist and librarian, and Susan has studied sociology before, so is our most qualified to observe and monitor any changes. You have least knowledge of the subject matter, but are ideally suited to be our subject. You haven't developed much body hair yet, your complexion is quite smooth, and you're the right size to fit into girls clothes.

There's no way that you're going to dress up as a girl, and you tell the girls that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael asks if she can talk things through with you and try to find a compromise so that the group can still proceed with a project. You find a couple of chair in a quiet corner of the hall, and sit down. Rachael then turns her chair so that she is directly in front of you, facing towards you. She looks you right into your eyes, blue and large, with long plump black lashes and a delicate turquoise eye shadow. Momentarily your gaze is transfixed by her eyes, but the she starts speaking, and your eyes are drawn to her mouth instead. Slightly plumped, with a rich rosy lipstick. Wow, she's really quite attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Tony, I'm sorry if I jumped the gun a bit there and made some assumptions. We are all really keen to get a good grade in Humanities, and maybe we were a bit too enthusiastic. Can we talk about our options?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches forward and grasps your hand, squeezing it gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond with a nod, still feeling rather annoyed. Rachael continues. \"Now as I said earlier we need a project based on behaviors, and I thought we all agreed that the concept was OK. Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but...\" you reply, but Rachael cuts you off. \"Yes, I know - you didn't think that you were going to be our subject. That's OK. As I said, lets talk options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to repeat much of what she said before about everyone's prior knowledge or experience, and ask you what role in the group you would like. As you work your way through each potential option she points out your lack of knowledge compared to each of the girls. She then asks who you feel would be better suited as the subject for the project, assuming that you keep to the same topic. As you work your way around each of the girls in the group,  Rachael points out why they wouldn't be suitable to dress up as a boy, ranging from legs so long they would look totally disproportionate for a boy, to naturally plumped and colored lips, and as you have been listening to Rachael your eyes had already dropped down to notice Rachael's chest, and you can appreciate that it really would be impossible to hide her bosom, and pretend that she was anything but a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we saw that you had been assigned to our group we knew that you could be ideal! You're nice and slim and about the same height as the rest of us, so we could lend you all the clothes you'd need. You're fit and sporty, so you'd fit in with our other activities so we could be nearby to help if you need us. Your hear what the tutor said - this could be our ticket to good grades without a lot of work, so every one would benefit. Besides, we all like you, so we could all hang out together. Come on Tony - what do you say? Are you in?\"</span></div></div>",

You've always wondered what it would be like to dress up in girls' clothes and now you're going to have the chance to see what it's like without any need for anything sneaky and without any guilt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael calls you to tell you to come over to her place at one o'clock.  She is very authoritative, clearly the team leader.  \"Don't be late, the entire team will be here,\" she says.  \"OK, Rachael, I'll be on time,\" you reply.  You are starting to feel a real need to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one o'clock, you arrive at Rachael's place as instructed.  She answers the door and lets you in.  \"Come on upstairs to my room, we're all up there and ready to help you with your \"transition\".  Remember, there's nothing to be afraid of. It's just the four of us and nobody will make fun of you.  This is a serious project and we all want to secure a good grade at then end if it, so we're all here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel reassured and follow Rachael up the stairs to her room.  There you find Louise, Amy and Susan.  They say hello and then Rachael asks you to sit down on her bed.  You do as you're told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Tony, we've been discussing how to approach this and we've decided you should start off slowly and take things at your own pace.  We think the first things you should try on are a nice set of bra and panties.  First you go in the washroom and put on the panties and then we'll help you put on the bra.  We'll measure your reaction and then once you're comfortable we can move ahead with other items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling less and less anxious, you take the panties and go into the washroom, closing the door.  You take off your clothes and look at the panties you're about to slip on.  They are very feminine, black silk with lace trim.  Oh well, here goes, you think.  You pull them on and immediately feel a rush of satisfaction.  Unfortunately, that \"rush\" now means you've got a large bulge in your panties.  You're too embarrassed to go back out and sit down on the edge of the bathtub, trying to get yourself back into a relaxed state.  But to no avail - you're too aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay in there?\" asks Rachael after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've, um, got a small problem,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what that might be,\" says Rachael.  \"Don't worry, that's all part of our research.  Come out now.\"  That same authoritative voice she used on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you open the door and walk back into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice, you look really good in those,\" says Rachael, ignoring the obvious bulge.  The other girls agree.  Louise now hands you the bra and tells you to slip it on over your shoulders.  You do as you're told and then Louise goes behind you and hooks up the clasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" asks Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can see, I'm pretty...um, excited at the opportunity... And the material feels, er, really nice, soft and silky,\" you stammer.  Amy diligently notes these comments in her log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, you're doing really well,\" says Rachael.  \"Even better than we thought you would.  So well, in fact, that I think you might be ready for the next step.  Susan, do you agree?\"   Susan nods her head and says, \"Absolutely - he's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael now walks up to you, looks you straight in the eye and asks you if they can proceed.  Looking into those penetrating blue eyes with long dark lashes, you feel helpless to say no.  But part of you thinks maybe this is enough for one day.       </span></div></div>",

So, for instance, you'd be OK if nobody knew it was you dressing up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess so, yes. But if I turn up here tomorrow dressed as a girl everyone in the school will know it's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then.

I can have a word with your mom and explain it all. I'll catch up with you later, OK?\"  The bell rings to signify end of the class, and the normal chaos ensues as you gather your books together, and head to your next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Isn't that the new department that the school has opened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're doing behavioral science, and we've got a project where... um...\" You start faultering in your attempt at describing the project, but Rachael then steps in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to decide on a group project. The aim is to study perceptions and behaviors, and we agreed that Tony would be best suited to take the central role in our project, but we wanted to talk it though with you first to make sure you're happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. I'm fairly sure that if you've all agreed on the project and sorted out the best roles for everyone, then why should I have any problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I will need to dress up as a girl.\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said it was a Humanities project - not something theatrical...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" Rachael cuts in again. \"We need to study behaviors. We want to observe and record how peoples' behaviors change based purely on the perception of a person's gender. We considered everyone in the group, and felt that Tony was best suited for the key role. We wanted someone with a very clear understanding of their own identity, but who could be disguised fairly easily. For anyone who doesn't know him, at first glance he could easily be taken as either a boy or girl.\" She pauses for a few seconds to let the concept settle, and then continues. \"So we'll study how Tony interacts with others as himself, and then make him appear to be a girl, and repeat the process in similar situations, and so identify any differences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sounds quite ambitious. How long is the project for - sounds a lot of work just for a couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's supposed to be completed by the end of the Semester...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes you mom approve?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Rachael dear, what are the parameters for this - is it limited to whilst you're at school, or just out of school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well we hadn't actually worked that out yet. I guess if we include out of school activities it could improve the scope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would make more sense. I'm not sure how you could expect him to dress and behave as a girl just for school, and switch back to being a boy the rest of the time.\" your mom replies. \"It would be far easier for him to stay in character all the time. It's a bit like acting really - the more you can stay focused as the character you're portraying, the more believable you are.\" She turns towards you. \"Well, I always say that if you are going to do something then you should commit yourself 110%, otherwise why bother?

Despite your misgivings, you are looking forward to the next few months, and the prospect of hanging out with four girls, and potentially having one sleeping over from time to time as well. If that wasn't enough, the thought of dressing in girl's clothes is giving you a bit of a buzz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not sure how Rachael thinks she can keep the whole thing secret, but if she can, then this could be really good fun. Hopefully later on you'll find out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunchtime you make your way to the Humanities block, where Rachael has called the meeting. All of your group are there, and you all sit around a table, each of the girls with their laptop open in front of them, and a number of books and other material in the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great - glad you could make it.\" Rachael welcomes you.\"Now, how are the preparations going?\" she asks as an open question around the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan is the first to respond. \"I think we have a great scope for observing and measuring Tony's interactions. The more thoroughly he can try to behave like a girl when we reach phase 2 would strengthen the responses, and should make the results more valuable. It should take me a few days getting all of the criteria defined so that we're ready to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" replies Rachael. \"Tony's mom suggested that he should try to get into the role properly by dressing as a girl 24/7 during phase 2. She also suggested we extend monitoring to match - or as close as we can achieve.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be brill.\" Susan responds. She beams at you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then chips in. \"I've got loads of spare clothes that should fit Tony. I'm about the same height and build, but I've also got all of my sister's stuff that's she's outgrown. I think I'll need to have a session with Tony soon to work out the styles that would suit him best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Louise adds her comments. \"I've done a bit of digging. Most people subconsciously assess whether they are addressing a boy or girl from the clothes, hair and face, so that is where we should focus first. However, there are clearly other differences too, and for Tony to be convincing as a girl we need to consider everything so I'd suggest a full make-over before we start phase 2, and maybe some, um, medicinal help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a second,\" you interject. \"What exactly do you mean by a make-over, and what medical help are you suggesting? This is only for a few weeks you know - I'm only pretending to be a girl, not having a sex change!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's OK.\" Louise responds quickly. \" The make-over is just a full manicure, pedicure, hair cut and styling, and make-up. You'll need that anyway. And I wasn't suggesting anything surgical - possibly just a few tablets to help emphasis the female aspects a bit. Nothing sinister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, tablets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my aunt works at a clinic and she told me about them. They use them for guys changing gender, but it takes them years to work fully. If you take them it would only be for a short time just to help the overall effect, so its nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What effects are they?\" you ask, now slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, things to help you look more like a girl. They re-balance body fat a little, reduce body hair, reduce body odor, and, um, firm up your chest a bit, so you'd need less padding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What - you mean they'd give me boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  You'd have to take loads over a prolonged period to develop proper breasts. It would just give you a little boost to help the overall affect, you know, to help convince people you are what you seem to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. \" Rachael interrupts the flow of the debate before you have a chance to reply. \"Seems we have plans well underway. Thanks girls\" She winks at you. \"Suppose we'd better start scheduling these things then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going to be first?<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She commences with a foundation cream, which she gently rubs into your face. She then explains that you will need a little color which will come from a blusher, and after a few minutes for the foundation to soak in fully, she brushes some blusher onto your cheeks. Louise then continues with eyeshadow and eyeliner, and finishes your eyes with mascara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, almost done now.\" she says. Just your lips to go.\" She completes your make-up with lipliner, lipstick and and finally a gloss finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze at your reflection in the mirror. \"Blimey. I look, well, almost like a girl. Guess the hair doesn't help,\" indicating your unruly mop of hair, \"and, well, I do still look a bit like a boy with make-up on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the first step.\"Louise replies. .\"You will need to practice this to get it right yourself, but we'll also need to tackle your eyebrows, hair, clothes, and .... oh yes. Hang on a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise disappears out of her room. As you sit waiting for her to return you look again at your reflection, and try to pat down your hair to try to make yourself look a little less, well, like yourself.  It's not much use. You know your hair needs a cut, but to be convincing as a girl would need a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Louise returns with a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what will really help make you look more like a girl - HRT patches. If you're serious about this project, then this is the way to go. Do you want to look like a boy wearing makeup and dressing in girl's clothes, or <u>really</u> look like a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back in the mirror. What wil you do?</span></div></div>",

I've got the details here somewhere. Um, hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, ethinyloestradiol, Lynoral, and anti-androgen, whatever they all are. Basically they will help make the changes that you can't achieve with make-up alone. Let's see...\" She starts reading one of the leaflets. \"Um, The effect of hormones varies between patients, but many experience changes within one or two months such as change in skin tone, lessening of body hair, development of breasts, expansion of the nipples, redistribution of body fat causing fuller cheeks, a more pronounced waist and fleshier hips and buttocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have that long.\" you say. \"I need to start looking like a girl in the next few weeks, or there's not much point. Oh, and how quickly could I undo all of that and turn back to a boy again once we're finished? It is all reversible isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Well I guess we can pump up the dose a bit to speed things up. Then  when you want to stop you just stop applying the patches, and everything should naturally return to normal. So if you stop using them a few weeks before the project finishes, by the time we've completed the project you'll be pretty much back to normal.\" Unbeknown to you Louise has her fingers crossed behind her back... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'd reckon you should use a couple of patches at a time.\" Louise says brightly. \"They're actually short dated, which is why we've got hold of them,  so they've probably lost much of their strength, and we want to try to get fairly quick results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rips open two of the patches and slaps them onto your upper arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, we'll change them daily and see how it goes.\" She turns and picks up a couple more items. \" Also, it might be a good idea to change some of your body care products - here, try these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you some bottles of shampoo and body lotion - you read the label which declares them to contain lavender and tea tree oil. Oh well, looks like anything goes now, so guess you may as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This one is with Amy, who will be responsible for your wardrobe once you commence the second phase of the project. At this stage she just wants to check the size that you will need, and then try to ensure she has enough clothes that will fit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has invited you to her house, to allow you to try different sizes and styles of clothing as necessary without her having to carry loads of stuff to your house. So after school has finished for another day, you go home with Amy.<br>\r\nWhen you arrive the house is all quiet \u2013 her parents both work and won\u2019t be back for a while, and her sister is now at college. She leads you to her sister\u2019s bedroom, where she has previously laid out a number of outfits on the bed, and you can see bags of clothes scattered around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then Tony. I\u2019ve been trying to sort things out already, but need to get the right size, so need you to try a few things on for me.\u201d She waves her hard towards a school uniform laying on the bed. \u201cMay as well start with that. After all it\u2019s one of the main things that you will need to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is fundamentally the same as your own uniform \u2013 with the obvious difference that the female version has a skirt rather than pants, and Amy has laid out a bra and panties on top of the uniform \u2013 definitely not standard wear for a boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you get dressed in that first, we can work out if my guesswork was right, or if we need to change anything to a different size.\u201d Amy says, and then stands waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, aren\u2019t you going to leave the room or anything?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I tell if the underwear fits if I can\u2019t see you putting it on?\u201d Amy retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself starting to blush. This is just a little embarrassing \u2013 having to strip naked in front of one of your classmates. \u201cLook, could you at least let me get into the underwear on my own? I\u2019m not quite comfortable stripping with an audience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, OK. Sorry. I wasn\u2019t really thinking of you as a boy getting undressed, so much as, well, just needing to get you dressed as a girl. I\u2019ll wait outside. Just shout if you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy leaves the room, and shuts the door behind her. You start undressing, removing your own school uniform, and then your boxers and socks until you are naked. OK \u2013 so what\u2019s first? Some underwear. You pick up the panties. Fortunately Amy decided to give you some fairly full briefs, so nothing skimpy or frilly, which you pull on. Whilst they do comfortably cover everything, you are aware of a smoother texture of the material against your skin than you are used to, and with the current situation that you are in, and the imminent prospect of getting dressed in girl\u2019s clothes, there is an increasingly larger bulge in the front of the panties than you would really like, given that Amy will be returning in a few moments. You decide to press on, and focus on the next item - the bra. How the heck are you supposed to put this on? You put one arm through one of the straps, pull the cups across your chest, and struggle manfully to get your other arm similarly through the other strap. So, how the devil are you supposed to do it up? After struggling for a few minutes you decide to admin defeat and call Amy back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she enters she cannot help but smirk a little at your obvious predicament. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that you sometimes need to be a bit of a contortionist to get bras on. Here, let me show you an easier way.\u201d She gets you to remove your arms from the bra, rotates it around your chest so that you can see (and reach) the clasps, then rotates it back the right way so that you can put you arms through the straps, competing the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 first problem.\u201d You say, wiggling your fingers in the empty cups of the bra. Unless you have one with a zero cup size there\u2019s not much point in this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiles at you. \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 the important bit for now is the straps over your shoulders, and how tight it is across your back. That looks fine. We can pad out the front a bit later. The briefs look OK too \u2013 although you may need to wear a couple of pairs to help smooth out your, um, bumps, and help give more of a female shape.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance your reflection in a mirror and instantly regret looking. You see your slim, slightly gangly and clearly male body in an ill fitting bra and girl\u2019s panties \u2013 and to be honest it\u2019s not a sight that fills you with any confidence that what you are doing will stand any chance of working.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAmy notices you looking, and your concerned expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! By the time we have you dressed up with clothes than fit you properly, plus have your hair and make up done, you won\u2019t recognise yourself. Come on!\u201d She picks up the skirt and throws this at you. \u201cPop this on next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst uncertain if this is really a good idea, you realize that you don\u2019t have much to loose, and may as well continue for the moment. You look at the skirt. It is pleated gray cotton, lined, with a short zip below the waistband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull it on, zip it up and then rotate it so the zip is sitting on your right hip.\u201d Amy advises.  You follow her guidance. She then passes the blouse to you, which you then pull on, and button up, noticing two key things \u2013 first the buttons are all on the wrong side, and also that the material is noticeably softer than any of your own shirts.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOK, that all seems to fit you.\u201d Amy confirms. \u201cNow your shoes. Would you prefer tights or socks?\u201d<br>\r\nSeeing your blank expression she throws a pair of short white socks to you. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave tights for another time then. Put these on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, and you then pick up the shoes. These are black leather, and whilst fully covering the toes are otherwise open at the top, with a strap and buckle across in front of the ankle, and totally unlike yours have two inch heels.<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of the bed you slip the shoes on, and tighten the buckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere \u2013 all done.\u201d You announce.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGreat. All seems to be about right for sizing. Just need to get you used to wearing it now. Could you stand up?\u201d<br>\r\nYou are already aware that your feet are angled at a much steeper degree than usual. As you try to stand up you can feel significant pressure on both feet, and initially have trouble straightening your legs. Once standing you realize that you are not very stable, and wonder how girls manage to walk in high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour weight should be spread down your feet, not pressing down into your toes.\u201d Amy says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must admit you are finding it difficult to determine where the weight is, as the muscles in your legs are stretching and compressing in a manner they are not used to, and are already starting to ache.  You take a few steps around the room. \u201cBlimey. This will take some getting used to.\u201d You say, half to Amy and half to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, just for now we can give you a bosom with some socks, but we\u2019ll sort out something better for you before we start this properly. Push these into your bra cups.\u201d She passes two rolled up bundles, which you stuff into the front of your bra.  \u201cRight, smooth down your blouse and skirt, and look in the mirror.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as Amy asks, and turn towards the mirror. However, Amy has angled this so that you can no longer see your face, with the top of the reflection starting at your shoulders. For a moment you are slightly disconcerted as you see only the reflection of a slim girl, and momentarily think this is Amy. However you then realize that you are looking at yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBit happier with your appearance now?\u201d Amy asks. \u201cYou still need a lot of work to get everything looking right, but I think we\u2019re on the right lines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you study your reflection closer you start spotting obvious problems. However, even you are forced to admit that at a cursory glance you could be mistaken for a girl \u2013 however briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, now that I know what size you are I can focus on the right kit. I\u2019ve got a fair bit together already, um, in here.\u201d She opens a wardrobe door to reveal a number of outfits hanging inside \u2013 ranging from dungarees and everyday dresses to short party frocks, and slightly disconcerting, a cheerleader outfit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHang on! There\u2019s absolutely no way that I\u2019d be able to wear half of that stuff,\u201d You exclaim. \u201cunless you can create a convincing pair of boobs out of thin air. And I couldn\u2019t wear anything as short as that!\u201d indicating the cheerleader outfit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK \u2013 don\u2019t panic!\u201d Amy quickly responds.  This was just to show you I was gathering lots of things together for you. Let me worry about getting you to look good in them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do you want to try anything else on whilst we\u2019re here? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now you are wearing a real pair of girl's panties, which is a definite first for you, and was certainly on your list of girls clothing that you always most wanted to try, and the skirt is a bit of a novelty.

But you've aways fancied these sandals that have straps that wrap around half way up your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be OK to try the pink dress on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course.

I always wore proper panties, so don't think there's any rules that you need to follow. I would suggest something a bit striking though, just in case. But the sandals are really great - I love them myself, and I'm sure you will too....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy reaches into a drawer and pulls out a different pair of panties - white but completed ruffled. \"These should do the job. They're actually probably better than what you have on now, as the ruffles would help disguise the boy bulges you you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that though had crossed your mind as the thought of anyone happening to see your panties now would have no real doubt about your own gender, which in any situation could be extremely embarrassing, if not worse! So that seems a sensible change as far as you are concerned - and definitely preferable to a thong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK - let's do this.\" you say. You undo and remove the school uniform until you are again down to only the cotton panties and bra.  Amy then stops you, and stuffs some rolled up panties into the bra cups until they form a reasonable shape and seem to be able to hold fairly firm. You then pull on the babydoll dress over your head and let it drop down into place, with the now fuller bra being more noticable and matching the contours of the dress. You then pull off the cotton panties, and pull on the ruffled white ones, for a second forgetting that Amy was watching. \"Oh blimey, I'm sorry.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, don't worry. I had a pretty good picture of everything earlier when you were in just the panties. Besides, I have spied on Connie and her boyfriends from time to time, so it's nothing I haven't seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK, Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't mean I'd complain if I saw it again, mind, perhaps in a slightly different situation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish off the outfit by pulling on and strapping up the sandals. Then you stand and look in the mirror. \"Blimey! That's really.. well, blimey.\" Apart from your head you could imagine you were looking at a girl, and in the babydoll dress and the knee high sandals, a reasonably attractive one. God, maybe this whole idea could work. You're almost getting turned on looking at your own reflection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so have you considered jewelry?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, sorry, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\" She shows you some jewelry to complement the outfit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We'll need some photographic evidence of you throughout the project  - including whilst you're  obviously a boy to verify the fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you took some shots earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few, but not many.., um, and none when you were naked.

Everyone in the project has now sat down in a circle ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Let's start, shall we?\" Rachael started. \"School's now finished for a week, so this is our opportunity for some intensive coaching for Tony so that when school restarts in a week's time he'll be readily accepted as a new female pupil. So, has everyone completed everything that was scheduled to be done by now?\"  She looks around to silent chorus of nods. \"Excellent. So, we still have a few points to finalize...\" She turns slightly to face you. \"First and foremost, have you decided what your new name will be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been thinking about this over the past couple of weeks. You'd agreed that it may be best to try to disguise your voice slightly by having a slight accent, and as you were fairly fluent in French, posing as a Canadian exchange student may be  a solution, so to go with this you opted for a French sounding name. You put on a slight Canadian French accent \"I shall be Madeleine Dubois. I am from Quebec, and shall be studying here for a while.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not bad,\" Rachael says. \"although I'd suggest you either need to go up an octave, or be a bit huskier. Actually, scrub that one. That would probably send the boys wild - a new girl with a husky French accent. They'll be tripping over themselves to say hello.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues... \"Unless anyone has any issues with the name, then Madeleine it will be. I'll notify the school office so they can get the registers sort for when we start back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody says anything. \"OK then. That's sorted. I suggest that from now onwards we only use Tony's new nom de plume, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so that's not technically correct, you think, but you guess she's trying to get something French into her comment, so you decide against picking her up on that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy starts speaking. \"So, now that school has broken up for the holiday, we're ready to get you ready for your reappearance as Madeleine. I have three large cartons of clothes being delivered to your home this afternoon, and I think you've already packed up most of your stuff?\" You nod in response. \"OK, so by first thing in the morning we'll at least have you dressing as Madeleine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look towards Louise, knowing that she will also be key to making to look the part. She notices your unspoken prompt and speaks. \"Yeah, that's only part of the story. I'll start tutoring you properly over the next week on your appearance - hair, makeup, and so on. You should have an adequate supply of that to keep you going for several weeks, but I'll keep an eye on it anyway. Did you keep up with using the patches and body lotion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" you reply at once, \"patches applied and changed as regular as clockwork. Can't say I've noticed much in the way of the changes you'd suggested though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early days - and I did say they were past their best before date, so possibly not as strong as they should have been. Although...\" she tilts her head slightly as she looks at you, \"I'm tempted to think your skin is a bit smoother, although guess we'll need to wait to see if anything else is happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, what you were not saying was that you'd doubled the dose of the patches, and you had actually noticed that your chest was definitely developing breasts - albeit relatively small, and your boxers were starting to feel tighter across your butt. Well, you don't have any intention of showing these changes off to them now, so you keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan then adds her contribution to the discussion. \"To be honest I think I'd prefer another couple of weeks recording Tony's interactions as a boy, as it took me the first few days trying to work out a matrix for what was effectively measurable, so I haven't been able to get as much 'base' measurements as I would have liked.\"  Talk about dropping a lead balloon. Everyone stares at Susan - you included - and the positive atmosphere in the room seems to dissipate in an instant.  \"However,\" she then continues,\"we won't have another opportunity to start phase 2 for several weeks if we don't do it now, so I'm OK for us to go on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looks at her. \"Are you sure? There's really no point in doing the rest of it if we're not monitoring everything properly. That's what we need to validate our whole project...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Susan responds immediately, \"I <i>am</i> monitoring everything properly! I'm merely suggesting that more data captured at the baseline level could have been useful, but given where we are I'm confident that I have sufficient data for us to more forwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you'd never thought of your life and interactions with other people as being data, but guess from a third party perspective that's what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you're considering your life being categorized and logged on a spreadsheet, the girls seem to have resolved their slight disagreement, or misunderstanding, or... well, they have both agreed that the project can go ahead. So, is that it? Everything now ready to go? </span></div></div>",

This time Susan is not accompanying you, as she will not monitor anything during the 'transition' phase, but will restart once you feel more confident as Madeleine in around a week's time - ready to head back to school. You have mixed feelings about this - you've enjoying having company at home - even if she's always tried to remain remote from you ('observing how you do things, and how people respond to you'), but it's also quite nice to know that for a change you're every action is NOT being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home, and indeed three boxes of clothes and other feminine items had been delivered earlier in the day, although your mom has already emptied these out, filling your drawers and closet with female apparel. She's also replaced your deodorant with a female equivalent, and there's now a bangle tree adorned with bracelets and necklaces. However, the most obvious change, and what you hadn't expected, was the pink flowery bedding on your bed. Yes, you knew that when your mom had agreed to you participating in the project, she would take it really seriously, and would not accept anything less that 100% commitment from you. It was actually her who suggested that you take on the role of a girl 24/7 rather than just at school too, and it looks like it's starting now, not even giving you the opportunity of one last night as a boy. Oh well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull off you school shirt, and look around for something to change into, and realize that what had remained of your own clothes has now been swept away by your mom, and all you have left is, well, Madeleine's clothes. Bugger. You grab a clean tee from a drawer - pink with butterflies across the front - and put it one. You then look for your trainers, only to find they too have been replaced by different ones - with pink laces.  OK, so you're getting the message here. What will you do, stick it out as you are, or take the plunge and get changed fully?           <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought you said that once school had finished you wanted to start wearing the new clothes as soon as you could to get familiar with them? There's plenty to choose from more than than just a clean tee shirt.\"<br>\r\nYou give her an exasperated look, and are about to say that you thought you'd have one last night as a boy, but then remember you <i>had</i> said that, and knowing your mom would never accept less than 100% commitment on the project, you let it go. <br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" you say, ejecting as much enthusiasm as you can, \"I'll just go and see what else I can find.\"<br>\r\n\"That would be nice dear, thank you.\" your mom responds, with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to your bedroom, and look around. Yep, they've done a pretty comprehensive job of removing anything that could allow you to be perceived as a boy, with the only remaining truly male clothing being what you are still wearing (obviously excluding the butterfly tee). Just about the only thing that your mom hasn't changed is the basic decoration of the room, so you still have the same (OK, fairly non-gender specific) carpet and curtains, and the same pictures hanging on the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some slight misgivings. Up until now you've just had the chance to 'role play' being a girl, and any dressing up was just to try things out  - not to say you didn't quite enjoy the experience at the time! You've now reached the point when it's all about to become very real, and you will live for several weeks as a girl. You realize that you're confidence is faltering, and decide that if you don't get on with it now, you're more likely to find potential reasons not to proceed, which you know would be pretty disastrous for the project, and your grades, and your self belief, and your mom's trust in your commitment levels... Oh, crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do, stand here and worry about all the things that you should have thought about beforehand, or bite the bullet and get on with it? Well, it really is a bit late now. You've committed yourself, and to stop now would let everyone down. You try to control the panic starting to build inside you, and remember all of the good reasons why you should be really happy to get on with the next phase. Of course, if it does all go horribly wrong, you could just stop. It's not as if you're committing yourself for ever. OK, so let's bloody well do this then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip off completely. If you're going to do this, you're going to do it properly. You search around for some panties to replace the boxers that you've taken off, and pull these on instead. Fortunately Amy seems to have secured fairly generously sized panties for you, so they fit fine. You consider briefly whether you should immediately opt for a bra, or last out today without, although based on your previous discussion with mom conclude that doing it properly definitely means a bra. You select one from your underwear drawer, check it's a small cup size, and attempt to put it on. Hmm, maybe you should have left this until later in the week, after you get some coaching on how to dress yourself. After some fiddling you manage to close the catch, and tidy up the straps over your shoulders. This is the first time you've had a bra on since you tried on the outfits with Amy - and  before you'd starting applying the HRT patches that Louise provide you with. You've previously noticed a little growth around your nipples, but haven't really taken too much notice. However, this bra (OK, admittedly only an 'A' cup) seems to fit reasonably well. Oddly,  you're sure that your breasts are definitely more noticeable with the bra on, as if its squeezing and projecting them forwards a bit. You try to remember what the HRT patches were supposed to help with - skin tone, breasts, and a fuller butt, as you recall. OK, so your breasts seem bigger - although that could juts be the bra. You stand in front of your full length mirror, and turn to one side. Hmm, maybe, just maybe your butt is slightly bigger, or at least seems to be a different shape to previously.  Well, using the patches certainly hasn't magically turned you into a girl, which was sort of your worst fear (i.e. with no way back), but it may be doing a bit towards giving you a more convincing shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst they may be helping the smoothness of your skin, they certainly haven't stopped your hairs growing on your legs. Not bad, but you wouldn't want to consider showing off your legs any time soon - well not as a girl anyway. Perhaps you'll stick with something nondescript for now, so you pick some cropped leggings. They'll do. you discard the pink tee, and instead opt for a button through blouse, as you feel your mom might appreciate your efforts to simulate a bosom. You brush you hair back, and having not had it cut recently it's long enough to pull into a short ponytail. OK, last thing - some makeup. You decide that this should be very light touch - especially as you haven't had much in the way of tutoring on this, so are quite delicate in what you apply. You slip on a pair of sandals that have appeared in place of your normal shoes, and reckon that should do, at least for your first attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you head back down to see your mom again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You check your crotch area to make sure that everything is lying flat, take a deep breath, and open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, there you are,\" your mom says, \"I was about to send out a search party...\" You look blank at her, but then realize that you've been over 20 minutes getting changed. She looks you over. \"Not bad. Your hair will need some work. You could do with some foundation, you forgot eye shadow, but otherwise the makeup's not too bad. Glad to see you're wearing a bra now - although you'll probably need to pad yourself out a bit.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh - so perhaps what you'd thought were slightly developing e in your chest area was just in your imagination then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, sweetie,\" your mom continues. \"Not a bad effort at all. Are you ready for something to eat now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am,\" you reply, \" I could eat a horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't have one of those readily available tonight. Thought you may like a small salad, and a vegetarian smoothie....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Did she just say that? What happened to what you normally have? You don't eat salads! Your expression clearly conveys to your mom what you're thinking. She smiles. \"Just kidding! You'll still need the same calorie intake as before, so there's no need to change much - at least not at home.\" She opens the oven and takes out a steaming plate laden with meat and veg. Phew. That's a relief. You pull up a chair. \"Thanks mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start eating she asks more about the day. \"What did the girls think about Madeleine as your new name?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They liked it. I also gave them the French Canadian accent, which they seemed to like as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. You'll just have to remember that if you decide to be French Canadian, you'll need to maintain the accent all the time. If you let it slip, and anyone hears you, it could be the start of questions you don't want asked.\"  Hmm, fair point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as from today Tony has gone away, and his French Canadian cousin Madeleine is visiting instead. At least if anyone notices a resemblance to you, that would help explain it.\" She continues. \"It will be nice having another female in the house. No slamming doors, no loud music, no late night gaming sessions on your x-box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" you respond, \"Just because I'll be dressing as a girl doesn't mean I'll stop doing anything that I do - and I don't slam doors!  Anyway, girls play music as loud as I do, and...\" You can see that you mom was just winding you up - and fairly successfully. You admit defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish eating you grab your cell, and update your profile. This is going to be tricky. Beside the girls in the project team, only a couple of your closest friends are aware of what's going on, but they are sworn to secrecy. Otherwise, everyone else thinks you're going away, so you need to keep your profile up to date accordingly. You've also had to remove anything that can log your current location, which could undo the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you consider going for a lap around the park, but then realize that you can't carry on doing what you would normally do, but will need to change your routine a bit. Besides, you're not sure if you want to venture outside yet - an acceptable review from your mom is OK, but you still feel like a boy dressed in girls clothes, and are fairly sure it would be obvious to anyone else too. So you spend the rest of the evening indoors, trying to plan what your new routine as Madeleine might be.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, hang on, nearly forgot. Before the shower, you'd better use the hair removal cream that Louise provided on your arms and legs. That done, you wait the required time, and then pop into the shower.  You towel yourself off, and dry your hair, but decide that you'd better otherwise leave it alone until you have help styling it. You get yourself dressed. The same bra (despite your acceptance that you really do not need one) and panties that you'd put on last night, a plain tee and a denim skirt. you are still extremely conscious of the shortness of the skirt, but reckoned that you should get used to it in time. At least nobody could claim you're not making any effort to get into character. You head to the kitchen for some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom is already there. \"Bonjour maman!\" you say, in your new accent, trying to keep it fairly subtle. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, nice try, but aren't you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\nOh crap. What is she talking about? Then you remember. As Madeleine you're now her niece, so she's your aunt.<br>\r\n\"Ah, pardon. Bojour Auntie.\" <br>\r\n\"Better. Good morning, sweetie. You're looking very understated this morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n\"No makeup?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. Thought I'd wait until Louise gets here later. She said she'd show me how to put it on properly.\" As soon as you say this you realize your mistake, as clearly your mom had several years more practice with makeup that Louise. \"She's supposed to tutor me on makeup as one of her responsibilities on the project, otherwise I'd ask you to help.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine sweetie. I know you've all got your responsibilities, but I know a few tricks that may help, so don't forget to check with your dear old auntie later on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat your breakfast, and pour yourself some orange juice. The sunshine seems fairly warm, so you're tempted to go out into the yard, but your cell bleeps before you head outside. It's a message from Louise to say she's on her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Louise arrives soon after. Your mom offers her a juice, which she accepts, and you sit for a few minutes in the kitchen. All this time she is looking at you, although you fully appreciate it's not for the reasons you'd normally like a girl to look at you, but she's trying to work out the changes that will be needed to make you look like a Madeleine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually bite the proverbial bullet and ask if she'd like to accompany you to your bedroom - albeit that is where the boxes had been deposited. Far from her room which had been filled with  bottles, brushes, hair clips, bracelets, bangles, yours has a bangle tree, a couple of deodorants, and only one comb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around, locates one of the cases, and pulls out a carrier bags, which she carefully empties onto your bed. Oh, so that's where everything is. A multitude of eye shadows, lipsticks, foundations and blushers, false eyelashes, hair coloring, brushes, clips, and ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Tony, um, sorry, Madeleine,\" she says, \"last time we did this I think I explained the basics. This time we'll need to go into things in a bit more details - although apart from knowing the essentials the best thing will be practice. Your hair may be the only thing you can't do on your own, although with enough practice even that would be possible. One key thing to remember when you're doing your makeup - you'll be building on what you've done previously, so if you've screwed up the foundation, anything on top will look crap.\"       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise then takes each item of make-up individually, explains what it is, and applies it to your face. She commences with a foundation cream, which she gently rubs into your face. She explains how to get some color, brushing some blusher onto your cheeks but also telling you of other ways to do it. She adds eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara. She finishes with lip liner, lipstick and and finally a gloss finish as before. You look at your reflection in your mirror and are surprised that despite Louise doing exactly the same thing some weeks ago, this time you really do look like a girl. You cannot quite work out what is different this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Louise. Last time you did this I looked like a boy wearing makeup. Now I look like a girl. What's different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Good question. The answer is you. Over the past few weeks you've been using the HRT patches?\" You nod in response. \"And you've been applying the skin lotion?\" You nod again. \"So your skin has improved its texture, which allows the makeup to cover more evenly and naturally. You look more like a girl, because your skin is now more like a girl's skin.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise then has a go at brushing through your hair, and, as it was a bit unruly to start with, and you haven't had it cut now for several weeks, she manages to maneuver it into two braided pigtails, which you must admit would make you look quite different to before, with your hair pulled well back from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so you don't have a lot of face hair, but I think you'll need to shave very thoroughly to keep it down. The foundation will only cover so much... Your hair is improving a bit. We may need to add some color to it though - if only to maintain a difference to your own. You'll need to keep the body hair under control now, but otherwise your skin seems to be OK. Your body shape is still not right - obviously...\" She smiles at you. \"Mind you, I'd say that the HRT patches have certainly done something. It's nothing like an hourglass figure, but there's a definite hint of something, which is good. I think the key thing will be pushing out your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" you respond, fearing that she may be considering something rather more dramatic and possibly irreversible than you'd contemplated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your expression, Louise tried to ease your concern. \"OK, perhaps I'll rephrase that. We'll need to make your breasts appear larger, more appropriate for a girl. I know that some girls develop later, so it needn't be a major difference, but we do want you to appear obviously female. I think you have filled out a little since we started, but not enough to avoid some padding. The main difficulty will be wearing anything low cut, when your actual cleavage will be visible.\" She roots around in the bottom of the bag that she'd apparently not fully emptied earlier, and pulls out two pads. \"Pop these into your bra for now. We'll work out a better solution later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply, and then smoothing down the tee-shirt. Louise then prompts you to stand and view yourself in the mirror. The change from when you had done this previously is quite amazing. As you had mentioned to Louise earlier, you had then looked like a boy wearing makeup. Now your reflection is very clearly a girl, and whilst you know that it's your reflection, somehow you find it difficult to believe. \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cc/a3/ee/cca3ee085e8486e4245e82fb46c3ed9a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Louise says, \"that's the easy bit done. Now you need to start acting and behaving like a girl. Let's start with...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looks at her watch. \"The others should have reached the park by now, so we can catch up with them there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK.\" you reply. \"Surely that's not it, though? I thought we'd do a lot more, like, tutoring. I may look like Madeleine now, now I certainly don't feel like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we have a week to work through everything. Besides, I don't want to throw too much at you too quickly - after all you only have a boy's brain capacity, so I don't want to overload you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to ignore that particular comment. \"Come on, let's go then. Oh, guess I'd better let mom see me first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to the kitchen where your mom has her head down sorting out the washing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to the park to meet the others.\" you say. She looks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. Well, if I ever wondered what it would be like to have a daughter, guess this would be the answer. You look... very passable.\" She looks at Louise and mouths \"very good\" at her. \"Yes, these next few weeks will certainly be interesting.\"  <br>\r\nThere's something about her demeanor that doesn't seem quite right, and you realize that she's dabbing one eye. OMG - she's crying. You suddenly feel very guilty, and uncertain, and confused, and upset for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off you go,\" she says, shooing you towards the door. \"I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but..\" you start, but Louise gives you a jab in your back, and pushes you forwards towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now.\" she whispers into you ear, and she escorts you out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you turn to her. \"What was that all about? Something has obviously upset Mom, so why did you push me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So perhaps you're the one who upset her, but not exactly in the way you're thinking. Despite the past few weeks whilst we've been getting everything ready, this is the first time she's actually seen you dressed and made up as a girl, and she's a bit upset that her little boy has gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere, have I? I'm still here, and when the project's done I'll be back to as I was before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that's in the future. For today Tony has disappeared, and your Mom is a bit sorry to see him go. Don't worry, she'll be over it by the time you next see her, and from what she said, she thinks you're doing a brilliant job and will be fully supportive of you going forwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. What the hell did she say? I must have missed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. That was a level of female communication that you may never learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to give that argument up as a bad job, and accept what Louise has suggested. \"OK, let's go and meet the others then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the park is less than a mile, but you find that you are continually conscious of yourself, both how you look (and hoping and trusting you don't pass anyone you know just in case they recognize you) and what you're wearing - particularly the skirt, which whilst no shorter than some of your shorts, somehow feels that it's showing more of your thighs than you're used to. You're also conscious of how you're walking, and trying to sway your hips as you walk, as you think Louise is.  After a couple of minutes she stops walking, and you similarly stop, rather than carrying on without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some might call it that. It's more like you're parading in a beauty contest, or trying to attract the focus of any male in the vicinity. Look, stop wiggling your bloody hips. Girls don't walk like that. Take slightly shorter steps. Focus more on where your feet are going and keep your legs closer together. Then, relax. Stop being so conscious of what you're trying to do, just let it happen. It may actually be better to get you into heels soon - that will force you to walk differently - although will probably kill your ankles for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugger! And you thought you were doing OK. You set off again, trying to take on board the latest advice whilst trying not to think about it - yeah, right.  </span></div></div>",

OK, so you can just keep your head down (metaphorically at least) and try to ignore them. However, you realize that its a couple of boys from your school, and whilst you don't know them well, they are certainly in your circle of acquaintances. Oh bugger. Not what you'd hoped for.  Louise has also noticed, and whispers in your ear \"Let me do the talking. Just respond nicely if they say anything to you. Remember - you don't know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, guess this will be a test of the makeup, and whether you actually look like (and walk like) a girl or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Lou.\" one of the boys says. You remember his name is Zeb. Ah, yes, and the other is Leo. \"Who's you friend?\"<br>\r\n\"This is Madeleine,\" Louise replies. \"She's just arrived from Canada, and I'm showing her around.\"<br>\r\n\"Hiya Madeleine\" Zeb says. <br>\r\n\"Hi!\" you reply, in what you hope is your best female Canadian accent. You are conscious of both boys eyeing you up and down.<br>\r\n\"So, you just visiting, or sticking around for a while?\" Zeb asks.<br>\r\n\"Um, I'll be staying for a few months...\" you respond.<br>\r\nZeb is clearly keen to ask another question, but Louise cuts in. \"She'll be here for the rest of the semester, so you'll have plenty of opportunity to question her more. Give the girl a break - it's her first day here.\"<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to make her feel at home,\" Zeb responds to Louise, and then turns his face towards you. \"Any friend of Lou's is a friend of mine. If you fancy something a bit more exciting than a walk in the park of a Saturday morning, then I'm sure I could oblige. Just let me know.\"<br>\r\nWhilst you aren't close enough to Zeb socially to know much about his interests or love life, you have a sneaky suspicion what he may be suggesting, so decide that you'd better not get any more involved.<br>\r\n \"Um, thanks, I''ll bear that in mind....\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"No problem Madeleine, nice to meet you. Hope to see more of you soon.\"  You could swear that as he finished speaking he winked at you.  Oh shit. That wasn't something that you had contemplated - a boy hitting on you.  Stupidly you can feel yourself blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise grabs you by your arm, says bye to the boys, and pushes you forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of earshot she says quietly to you \"Well, that went OK, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Apart from nearly getting myself a boyfriend, then yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that proves the point, doesn't it?  They didn't have any doubts that you are a girl. And that's your first day out. By the time the holiday is over and we get back to school you should have perfected it!\"<br>\r\n\"I admire your confidence in me, but I still feel like a fish out of water.\"<br>\r\n\"I think you handled yourself fine.\"   <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You return their welcome and you both sit down on the grass. You remember just in time that you're wearing a skirt, so you don't drop straight down onto you bottom as you would normally, but lower yourself to your knees first, and then drop to one side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your first day so far?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\nRemembering that you will need to remain 'in character' now - especially with Zeb and Leo not that far away, you respond in your Canadian accent. \"Well, my mom was in tears when we left home, and I may need to start fighting off potential suitors. That aside, not too bad.\"     <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been thinking about that last bit. I think your husky Canadian accent is probably going to be more of a hindrance - there's something about it that seems to act like a pheromone, attracting the boys. We may need to consider a different approach.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, so what do you mean? Drop the Canadian accent? I'd just sound like me then.\"<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily dropping it, no, but I think we need to think about it. There's more to making you appear female than just your looks, but also your mannerisms - and how you sound. So, when you speak normally your voice is at a particular frequency. Generally a girl's voice is at a higher frequency.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, so a bit higher pitched?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. About an octave higher. But girls also speak differently, so even if you increase your pitch it would still not make a true female voice.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, so what do I do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, to raise your voice by an octave is normally surgical anyway. To change the <i>way</i> you speak can be done by training.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought there were sprays that would change your voice. Wouldn't that work?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really. They are primarily to improve the clarity of speech, not to increase the pitch. Anything that says it will increase the pitch is either a short term gimmick or is lying.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean like breathing in helium?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. It works to a degree, but the effects don't last long.\"<br>\r\n \"Could I just say that I would object to any thoughts of surgery on my throat!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I had considered it, but it's obviously a bit complex and costly, and not easily reversible, so perhaps not a route we want to take.\" You mentally breathe a sign of relief.<br>\r\n\"However,\" Amy continues, \"there may be some training options if we can get you to see a speech therapist. Either that, or you give up speaking in English.\"<br>\r\n\"What? You mean only speak in French? Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Everyone would be too busy trying to translate what you're saying to notice any inconsistencies in your voice.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not too sure about that. My French isn't brilliant.\"<br>\r\n\"Could be an ideal way to improve it then!\" Louise says.<br>\r\n\"How about speaking in broken English, like French is my primary language, and I'm still learning English. Would that be enough confusion?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe. Could we worth trying it I suppose.\" Amy responds.\"You'd have to keep it up though, no slipping back into 'real' English!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, school over for the week, and what a funny week this has been. At the beginning of the week you hadn\u2019t quite expected that you would now be involved in a humanities project, and definitely would not have considered being nominated as the subject of a behavioral sciences project. Of course the least likely thing was that you would now be planning to spend part of the Semester masquerading as a girl \u2013 assuming that you can actually pull this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unexpectedly received your mom\u2019s unconditional backing for the project, you\u2019ve have had an initial lesson on how to apply makeup, dressing as a girl, and are now applying HRT patches daily, plus, for some odd reason, also using lavender shampoo and tea tree oil body wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you are now decidedly uncertain about the project \u2013 or at least your role in it. Whilst you did decide earlier in the week that you\u2019d give this your total commitment, the reality of seeing yourself wearing girls\u2019 clothes did not fill you with any confidence that you\u2019d convince anyone that you\u2019re a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy has suggested that the project team meets up over the weekend to try to put each of the component parts together, and try to build your confidence in trying to look and behave like a girl. Well, for the moment you need to carry on with your normal schedule, so first thing tomorrow morning (Saturday) you have a soccer game planned. Your mom has agreed for the girls to come to your house late morning to concentrate on the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you now have this evening to yourself \u2013 possibly the last for a while without having one of the team monitoring what you\u2019re doing and trying to record your interactions and responses \u2013 although perhaps a bit pointless when you\u2019re on your own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the slightly embarrassing session with Amy, you decide that you will spend this evening doing some on-line research of your own. You are still determined to make this project a success, but also to try to enjoy the experience as much as possible. So you head to your room, sit down at your PC and start surfing, on the lookout for anything to improve the chances of success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disregard anything relating to clothes and makeup, as the girls seem to have these under control. However, you are not too sure about the estrogen patches that Louise provided \u2013 and which you have been changing daily as instructed. Whilst you think you understand the overall concept, you haven\u2019t noticed any changes yet \u2013 even with the double doses - although you\u2019re not really sure how long before any changes could be visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few searches result in more information about HRT, but also identify a number of other things that could be used to help make a boy look more like a girl \u2013 like anti-androgens to help control body hair growth. Whilst you don't need to shave yet, you do have body and leg hair inappropriate for a girl. You also find something new -  a breast and nipple hormone cream to rub into your breast area to promote faster results . Along with the oestrogen and anti-androgens this should give noticeable results in in hopefully only a couple of weeks. Ideal! You call down to your mom to tell her there's something you need to buy online for the project, and she immediately agrees that you can use her credit card to buy it, without you even having to explain what is it! Job done - with express delivery please!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that a number of the sites are related to gender reassignment - which you find a little disconcerting, as this is clearly not your objective, merely an equivalent visual impression for the project, and you try to reassure yourself that what you are doing is fully reversible \u2013 which as far as you can determine it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to check on the likely changes you might expect from the oestrogen treatment, rather than relying purely on what Louise had told you. So you embark on a number of searches based around your key words. This reveals the results that could be anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you stumble across a photo gallery of teenage girls. Whilst not at all relevant to your searches you\u2019re happy enough being sidetracked in this way. You browse through the gallery admiring these girls and their notable assets, and reflect on how your new project colleagues could look in a similar state of undress \u2013 realizing that Amy has seen you virtually naked (wearing only a pair of girl\u2019s panties), but you have so far only seen them fully dressed. Before long you find yourself caressing yourself through your pants as your mind wonders off topic and you scroll through the photo gallery, and a couple of minutes later you undo your belt and unzip your fly, and start rubbing your growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Something inside you is also telling you that you really want to have full breasts like these t-girls more than anything you've ever wanted before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up to your chest to feel your male breasts - what little there is, and as you fondle around your nipples you feel a real sense of disappointment that nothing has happened yet to increase their size - despite your having been applying the oestrogen patches now for, what, three days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course what you don't appreciate is that the patches alone are not a quick fix, and they could take weeks before there are visible changes, although hopefully now speeded up with the breast and nipple cream. However, the oestrogen is already having an effect internally and creating millions of new female cells in your body which are starting to react with your genes. Combined with the anti-androgens suppressing your body\u2019s testosterone production you are effectively being feminized from the inside out - without even realizing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you suddenly feel quite depressed at the lack of progress, and quite out of character for you, you burst into tears, and blubbing to yourself put away you now limp member, and collapse onto your bed, disappointed in yourself, but with a determination that you need to escalate your physical changes by whatever means possible. </span></div></div>",

Amy has invited you to her house to try on different sizes and styles of clothing, so after school has finished for another day, you go home with Amy. Both her parents work and won\u2019t be back for a while, and her older sister is now at college. She leads you to her sister\u2019s bedroom, where she has previously laid out a number of things on the bed, and you can see bags of clothes scattered around the room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to sort things out for you, but need to get the right size, so I've afraid you may need to try a few things on for me.\u201d She waves her towards the bed, but all you can see is a bra and pair of panties. \"We'll start with the basics and work out from there. Could you get into these first, and I'll sort out a top and skirt for you to try. You can put them on in the bathroom.\" She indicates a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into the little shower room, strip off your school uniform, and then your boxers and socks until you are naked. You pick up the panties, and pull them on first. They are fairly full, baby blue, with a embroidered lace trim. Hm, not really your color scheme or style but guess this in some ways represents the World you're going to be in for a while. You are instantly aware of the smooth texture of the material against your skin, and with the current situation that you are in, there is a distinct bulge developing in the front of the panties! You press on, and focus on the the bra - only it isn't really a bra. It seems to be a very short crop top in a jersey material which isn't quite what you were expecting. You pull it on over your head and pull it down, where it sits across your chest, looking like a bra but to your surprise actually fitting you quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that's done, so you return to the bedroom. \"Hey, that's not bad.\" Amy says, smiling at you. \u201cIt seems to fit across your shoulders which is the important bit, and the panties seem to be OK.\" She delicately avoided mentioning your bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though the idea was that I should, well, have boobs, or something to fill out a bra. This is as flat as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I didn't see much point in putting you in a bra that you can't fill out. This is a training bra, for girls who haven't got much breast development - and if you look in the mirror you'll see it's slightly padded so you will get a little shape from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if I'm supposed to look like a girl surely I'll need something more, well,convincing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a 'no' then. Girls develop at different ages and different speeds. Just because your eyes are attracted to the girls with the bigger boobs doesn't mean there are just as many others lagging behind. There's plenty of girls your age just starting to grow. Come on!\u201d She picks up a short skirt and throws this at you. \u201cPop this on next.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhilst uncertain if this is really a good idea, you realize that you don\u2019t have much to loose, and may as well continue for the moment. You look at the skirt. It is pleated gray cotton, lined, with a short zip below the waistband -  typical school skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull it on, zip it up and then rotate it so the zip is sitting on your right hip.\u201d Amy advises. You follow her guidance. She then passes a school blouse to you, which you then pull on, and button up, noticing two key things \u2013 first the buttons are all on the wrong side, and also that the material is noticeably softer than any of your own shirts.  \u201cOK, that all seems to fit you.\u201d Amy confirms. \u201cNow your shoes. She throws a pair of short white socks to you. \u201cPut these on first.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou do so, and then pick up the shoes. These are black leather, with only the toes actually covered, and with a strap and buckle across the ankle, and totally unlike yours have two inch heels. \u201cThere \u2013 all done.\u201d you announce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGreat. All seems to be about right for sizing. Just need to get you used to wearing it now. Could you stand up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You are already aware that your feet are angled at a much steeper degree than usual. As you try to stand up you can feel significant pressure on both feet, and initially have trouble straightening your legs. Once standing you realize that you are not very stable, and wonder how girls manage to walk in high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You take a few steps around the room. \u201cBlimey. This will take some getting used to.\u201d You say, half to Amy and half to yourself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOK,  smooth down your blouse and skirt, and look in the mirror.\u201c<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou do so, and turn towards the mirror. The first thing you notice is how short the skirt is. \"God - is this really school regulation length? It's minute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. don't worry. It's fine. Some girls wear them a fair bit shorter than that!  I'd reckon it's longer than your sports shorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they have a join across the middle!\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still need a lot of work to get everything looking right, but I think we\u2019re on the right lines.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell, it all seems to fit, and actually feels reasonably comfortable too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we know your size we can concentrate on what we have available. She swings open a wardrobe door to reveal a number of outfits hanging inside. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow, do you want to try anything else on whilst we\u2019re here? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amy tells you not to worry about that - she has other bras that could be better hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainly doesn't give me boobs - if I ignore my head I suppose I do look a bit like a girl, but only a younger one who hasn't developed her breasts much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and that's the point.\" Amy replies. \"Once we have your hair looking more like a girl's, and you put some make up on, and some nice sandals, you should look pretty convincing as a girl - just not the most buxom one in town! We could give you some extra size there by padding out the bra cups a bit, but I reckoned that you'd be happier with less artificial help, at least to start with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what's next then?</span></div></div>",

You thank Amy for her help, and change back into your own clothes. Weirdly it all feels a bit heavy and restrictive, which you assume is the difference between your usual long sleeves and full length pants, and the shorter  (or in some cases almost non-existent) equivalents of the girls clothes. Amy tells you that now she knows your size she can find everything that could be suitable for you, and have it all ready for when you start the second phase of the project. \"Mind you,\" she says, \"it wouldn't harm to have a couple of things on hand before then, so that you can get used to how they feel. After all, when you start dressing as a girl you'll need to be comfortable doing so, and not obviously wearing something that you are self conscious about. She picks up the bra and panties that you had been wearing, a skirt and top set, and stuffs them into a carrier bag, along with a couple of other things she scoops up from on the bed, and passes the bag to you. \"Obviously not stuff for wearing out anywhere, but it wouldn't hurt to slip something on when you're at home, just to get used to the feel of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, great, thanks. Not sure how Susan will feel about it if she's supposed to be monitoring me as a boy. Don't think I'm supposed to be dressing up as a girl yet - I think that sort of defeats the objectives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, although I'd reckon you'll get a bit of free time from her monitoring. Take them anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you leave Amy, and head home, clutching your bag which you realize somehow seems to represent you in a few weeks time. You're really not sure to be excited or worried, although on balance you are secretly looking forward to putting all the pieces together, as everything seems to suggest that the idea just might work, and people may actually believe that you could be convincing as a girl. Of course, that would still only be the first step for the project, which would be how people treat you, and how you would react if people genuinely thought you were a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you're on your way home, carrying the bag in some ways containing your future... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You want to be closer with Tony, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, but his father wouldn't like it if he was a momma's boy,\" your mother argues weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about what you want. You like feminine things. They\u2019re soft and warm and lovely to see. Imagine Tony being softer and more gentle. That\u2019s very appealing to you. You really want to help him with his clothes and make-up to do well in school. Then he could help you more around the house. Helping with the cooking and cleaning. It sounds delightful to you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Rachael insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother nods her head and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, when you think about it, you truly do adore all things feminine. That\u2019s only naturally, isn\u2019t it? For a woman to prefer feminine things to rough, dirty, dangerous masculine things. As a matter of fact, you find anything masculine repugnant, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d your mother insist,\u201d After all, I am a woman, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot doubt about it,\u201d Rachael smiles. \u201cYou are all woman and you like womanly things. Anything associated with women is something that appeals to you. Clothes, hair, jewelry, make-up. Naturally, even their soft feminine bodies are more appealing to you than hard, dirty, smelly masculine bodies when you think about it. Face it, you\u2019d rather spend time with another woman than with a man. You do enjoy chatting and gossiping with women. You share your secrets with other women. You feel comfortable around other women, so it\u2019s only natural, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s only natural. That makes perfect sense,\u201d your mother leans back and says confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael leans in and says, \u201cThen it would be perfectly natural for you to kiss me and feel my breasts because my body is so feminine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, your mother caresses Rachael\u2019s face and pulls it close for a kiss. After their lips touch, your mother\u2019s tongue slides into Racheal\u2019s mouth and responds in kind. Your mother\u2019s hands gently fondle Rachael\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Rachael breaks away and says,\u201d That was delightful wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d your mother pants, \u201cAnd your breasts are lovely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should call them, \u2018tits\u2019 from now on,\u201d Rachael suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTits?\u201d your mother questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, It\u2019s much more in tune with girls.

She appears quite angry, and speaks quite slowly and with determination. \u201cSo instead of studying how a person's attitudes and behaviors are affected by their gender, we will now study a person\u2019s behaviour if <i>forced</i> to dress as the opposite gender.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls grab you, and start to forcibly undress you, and despite your protests and efforts to fight them off, you are clearly outnumbered, and are soon down to only your boxers, which you clutch hold of tightly, just about resisting the girls\u2019 efforts to pull them from your body. Finally Rachael reaches into her bag and pulls out a pair of dressmaking scissors and advances towards you. You inevitably keep your hands clutching your crotch even tighter, but she slices the scissors blade straight up the side seam of your boxers, cutting though the waistband. She repeats this on the other side, leaving you effectively clutching just a piece of material over your crotch, actually no longer doing a lot of good. After a quick attack by a couple of the girls you are forced to relinquish this as well. Almost as a symbolic action Rachael then proceeds to cut up what remains of your boxers into strips, making them definitely unusable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now you are standing, backed into a corner of the locker room, totally naked, and facing four girls \u2013 all very attractive in their own right, but currently having something of a predatory pack mentality, and quite menacing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seems that the worst of their attention is now over, and they all seem to relax a little. Rachael then starts speaking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then Tony. You <u>are</u> going to take part in the project, whether you like it or not. There is something for you in the locker over there\u2026\u201d she indicates towards the end of the room. \u201cIf you are prepared to cooperate then we will be lenient, but if you continue to resist then we will have no choice but to repeat this again and make life very difficult for you. One way or another we will have our project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the opens the door, and all four girls file out, carrying all of your clothes with you, leaving you alone, naked, and utterly confused by what has just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the realization that you are alone, and as school has now finished, so you are likely to remain alone, you take a few moments to consider your predicament. Certainly the girls really didn\u2019t like your refusal to take part in the project, so are trying to force you to take part \u2013 although why Rachael locked away the girl\u2019s uniform that she showed you, you really don\u2019t know. You walk to the end of the locker room and find one locker door ajar. OK, so this is presumably where the clothes are that Rachael was referring to.

As you pick them up you see these are silicon artificial breasts, already embedded into a bra to effectively strap on over your shoulders. Grief - these girls really are serious about this, aren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you have no intention of giving in willingly, so you walk around the room checking all of the locker doors, to see if any had been left open (and therefore if there is anything else you could put on instead). Fairly inevitably they are either locked or empty, so you have no alternative but to return to the only clothing of any sort currently available. So it seems you have little choice - either try to make a dash to find some clothes somewhere else in school, or resort to putting on the cheerleader outfit in order to get out - and potentially to get home. You re-examine everything that you have emptied out from the locker to see if you can somehow use one or two parts of the outfit to escape from the locker room without actually have to dress up completely as a girl. After all if you are seen walking around the school in underpants it would be marginally less embarrassing and potentially more socially acceptable than being naked (or being seen by any of your friends wearing a dress)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealistically everything here really does scream 'girl' at you. You have a V-neck shell with V-front design in Royal blue and gold, with the school logo, a similarly colored A-line three knife pleat skirt, a matching shell jacket, the bra (with built-in breasts), a pair of blue tights, and a pair of briefs. You had initially thought that the briefs might by viable as a short term option to let you get to a boys locker room, and hopefully find something better. However, on re-examining them, you can only conclude that to be seen wearing a tight fitting pair of metallic gold boy briefs would only be marginally be worse than being seen naked!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at least have to give credit to the girls for their choice of clothes making your position virtually impossible.

Whilst technically large enough (at least fitting your waist size without issue), they are low rise briefs, and are only just big enough to cover the inevitable bulge that results from you wearing them. There is a mirror at the end of the room, and you check your reflection. Oh crap! They leave virtually nothing to the imagination, the thin material is clinging tightly to you and emphasizing the shape that you know these briefs were never intended to contain. Looking at yourself in these very feminine and sexy little boy briefs you cannot help yourself and put your hand to your crutch and grasp, and gently massage yourself through the metallic material. The combination of your situation, the feel of the soft metallic material, and rubbing yourself, has the unfortunate and inevitably result of hardening your penis, which then becomes even more prominent through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you had hoped that the briefs could look like swimming trunks, so that you could make your way around school in an attempt to find some boys clothes somewhere, but they have certainly failed completely on this expectation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, next option is to try to cover up this pretty useless item of clothing. You try adding component parts of the uniform to see if there is any combination that could enable you to look like a boy, rather than a boy obviously wearing girls clothes. The skirt unfortunately looks just like a skirt, and the V-neck shell is also very obvious. So this doesn't help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and damnation. OK - so how many people are there in school at this time of day? Will there actually be anyone around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the door, wearing just the briefs, pull it open slightly to assess the noise level outside. You can hear voices, but fairly distant.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can hear noises in the corridor outside the locker room, so you're well aware that there are still people moving around the building, and there's no way that you would either wish to venture out naked, or for anyone to find you hiding in a girls locker room - and particularly  whilst undressed as you are. You retry every other locker in the room, hoping that somehow there is an alternative, but they all remain stubbornly locked leaving you so other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn those girls.\" you mutter to yourself, realizing that the only choice you have to avoid getting into trouble for roaming the school naked is to put on these clothes. So you reluctantly decide to dress in the cheerleaders outfit, and then go somewhere else to find some proper clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you pull on the metallic gold boy-briefs, which you find are low cut, and not overly generous in their capacity, so there is a distinct bulge at the front, definitely not how they were designed to look. You then slip on the bra - complete with breasts. When you first saw these you has assumed that the breasts were an integral part of the bra, but they do appear to be separate, each being flesh colored, and as you inspect them you realize they will sit directly against your skin, being held in place by the bra. As you fasten and tighten the bra the breasts shift position slightly, pulling against your skin as if slightly sticky. Well you guess that silicon must have a natural stickiness, and think no more of it. You glance in the mirror to confirm that you have positioned the bra in about the right place, and you can see that the artificial breasts actually blend quite well with your skin color and you could imagine that from a distance they could conceivably be mistaken as belonging to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull on the V-neck shell top, and then the pleated skirt.  The skirt is quite short and you are revealing significantly more of your legs than you would normally do -  even when wearing shorts. Overall you are now looking really odd. Ah - of course, your hair. Your  crop of blond hair - very much a boy's, sat on top of a cheerleader complete with tits. You look around. Yep - there's the wig. Now - how the heck does this go on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next couple of minutes fiddling with the wig. It has a net inside which pulls your own hair tight, and seems to be slightly elasticated and almost sticky around the perimeter keeping it in place on top of your head. The wig, and therfore now your hair is auburn, loosely tied back into a ponytail which hangs down your back well past your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK - what else? You see the tights, but decide that these could be one step too far. So you pull on the white trainers, and slip on the jacket. OK, now for the test - could you really get away with looking sufficiently like a girl to get out of here? You stand in front of the mirror and study your reflection. Well, you can clearly recognize yourself, but at a glance what you see is a cheerleader, and despite your skepticism you must admit that you do look quite like a girl. You cup your hands under the shape of the bra through the top, and therefore cupping your breasts, and realize they are quite soft and pliable, and you can actually make out the shape of the artificial nipples projecting forwards. Well, you must admit that with the wig and the false boobs this is possibly feasible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, just maybe you could get to a boys locker room and change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there's nothing more you can do here, so you start towards the door.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you make a move towards the door, it suddenly opens towards you, and two girls enter the locker room. They are both late 15 or 16, in white tees and black shorts, and carrying squash racquets, clearly having just finished a fairly energetic game. They bustle in and head for their lockers, giving you a cursory acknowledgment. One of them drops her racquet on the bench by her locker, and immediately pulls off her tee shirt and unclasps her bra, pulling this off too. She then sits on the bench, and bends forward to undo her shoe laces, and you are instantly and unavoidably transfixed by her tits, dripping with perspiration, now bouncing freely in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to hit the shower.\" she says to her companion without even raising her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right - ho. I'll join you in a minute.\" the other replies as she opens her locker, pulling out a towel. Then she notices you again. \"Shit girl - what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is suddenly dragged away from the bouncing tits and you focus on the other girl instead. You can feel yourself blushing, and are immediately very embarrassed and feeling guilty. Surely she must have noticed you staring at her friend's tits. Is your cover as a girl blown already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, nothing.\" you manage to stutter out as a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new, aren't you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes.\" you manage to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheerleader practice should have finished ages ago - why aren't you on your way home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to feel a bit intimidated, and not really knowing how best to respond, you 'um' a little more, and start figeting, now getting genuinely a bit worried. You remember someone once saying that the most believable lie is the truth... \"Someone took my clothes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God. Not another one. OK - well I'm sorry. You'll have to report that at the office. So you're heading home in your kit then? Well, you certainly can't go out like that! You should know that you never, never, never leave off your tights. That's part of the uniform. If anyone sees you out of school like that...\" she indicates your bare legs, \"then you'll be off the team before you can finish your chant. You'd better touch up your make up too - you're looking awfully pale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that there was a make up bag on the bench with the blue tights. \"Right. Thanks. I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back towards the block of lockers where you'd left the tights and make up. Phew, that was worryingly close to a catastrophe. Hopefully these girls will disappear into the shower and let you escape. When you reach your original locker you sit on the bench, pick up the make up bag, and then glance back at the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who had been talking to you has now stripped to the waist as well, revealing her own tits - slightly firmer than the others, but still very appealing. The other girl has stripped completely and is now walking towards the shower cubicles with a towel grasped in one hand and a bottle of body wash in the other. You are again transfixed, and can only gaze in awe at her smooth deliciously curvy body and gorgeous tits.  However, you then realize that her companion is again looking in your direction. Oh bugger, looks like you've been caught out again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she calls to you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you realize what you're doing you blurt out your real name \"Tony\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Toni. I'm Sam, and that\" she waves towards the showers \"is Liesl.\" She looks more closely at your face. \"Mind you, looks like you haven't had any make up on today.  Surprised you got away with that at practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on the bench beside you, takes the make up bag from your lap, opens it, and removes a number of items. You are now desperately trying to avoid looking at her tits, conscious that they are barely 18 inches from your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, face me and shut your eyes. It'll be quick but should be enough to get you home.\" You turn towards her and shut your eyes. You can feel powder being applied to your cheeks and chin, then eyeshadow. \"OK - open your eyes and hold still.\" She now applies mascara, and then pulls out a lipstick. \"Now pucker up.\" You do so, and she adds color to your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. All done. You should really get a decent moisturizer - you've got very dry skin. Nothing personal, but you're not the prettiest cheerleader I've ever seen - you've got quite a boyish face and really short lashes. You need some decent falsies and some eye liner to show off your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam returns the make up to the bag and hands it back to you. \"Now get your tights on and bugger off home. Oh, and just to remind you, your spankies go on top - yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course.\" you reply, without a clue what she's talking about. \"And thanks again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam heads back to her own locker, where she swiftly removes her shorts and panties, kicks off her shoes, picks up her towel, and heads towards the showers. She looks towards you, winks, and steps into the shower cubicle leaving you temporarily alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit! What was that about? Has she actually seen right through your disguise, and realized that you're a boy, or does she just think you're a naive new girl in school? What are you going to do now? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment you consider what you should do next. Then you catch sight of your reflection in a tall mirror attached to the end of the next block of lockers, and for a split second think that someone else is in the locker room, before realizing that it is your own reflection. This time, far from your previous view that you could perhaps be mistaken for a girl from a distance and for a few fleeting moments, you are actually quite stunned by your appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, walk closer towards the mirror, and study your reflection more closely. Your facial feature remain, so it  really seems as if you're looking at your sister (if you had one) as the combination of the cheerleader outfit - complete with the undeniable shape of breasts - the long flowing hair, and the makeup really has transformed you. Well, despite what Sam said, you think you look pretty hot as a girl. You look more closely at your face. Well, perhaps for a cheerleader you could do with longer lashes, but otherwise everything looks very feminine. You rub your chin - all things considered it's just as well that your facial hair has not yet started to grow, so that you can get away with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, stop this. You're not supposed to be enjoying this. Your key objective remains to get hold of some male clothes and get changed so you can get home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another look at your reflection. Despite your reservations, you do appreciate from watching the school cheerleaders that Sam was right, and the tights are an integral part of the uniform, and you really don't want anyone challenging you on such a stupid detail and causing any more problems. Oh bugger! Now what did she say?  The tights go under the spankies. What the Hell are spankies?  You look around for anything else that you could be wearing, but there's nothing left. Unless - you pull up the front of the skirt to reveal the metallic boy shorts. Of course! When performing their routines you have often seen a flash of gold. Perhaps these are the spankies. Well it would make sense that they'd have to be on the outside - except it would mean wearing the tights under your underwear... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if you're going to do this, you need to do it now - before either of the girls emerges from the shower or anyone else comes in. You sit down again, kick off the white trainers and pull off the skin-tight boy shorts from under the skirt. Now all you have to do is pull on the tights. OK - just like long socks - scrunch them right down with a hole through the middle, stick your toes in and pull. Well, up the knee isn't too bad, but after that becomes a struggle getting all the way up - and you still have the other leg to go.  Eventually you get both legs in, and just about work out the technique for hitching them up to remove the accumulation of wrinkles in the nylon around your ankles.  Once they are pulled up and seem to be wrinkle free you pull the boy shorts back on top, and then smooth down the skirt over the top. Now you are less worried about being disturbed as hopefully you are again visually a girl. However you now have a really weird feeling like an extra layer of skin - albeit blue - over your legs, and pressing tightly around your equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this really what girls wear? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your mind focussed back on your ridiculous situation and what your next steps need to be. So what will you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least the time that you've taken in the locker room means that the school has now emptied out, so the chance of meeting anyone is now quite low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor is empty, as you had hoped. Phew! Your objective now is to get to the boys locker room near the gym, as you know from experience that there are often lockers left unlocked, and sometimes things left on coat hooks, so hopefully sufficient stuff for you to get changed back into  proper (boys) clothes and then get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you set off, feeling really quite strange and extremely self conscious. The ponytail bounces on your shoulders as you walk along, you are continually aware of the two bulges on your chest from the artificial breasts, and the feeling of the tights on your legs is really quite weird as you walk along. But the oddest feeling is the skirt. Whilst you often wear shorts, so your legs are used to being exposed, this feels different and you constantly want to smooth down the skirt to make sure it isn't lifting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn a corner into the main corridor through the school, there are two boys coming the other way. Fortunately you don't know them, which at least saves some additional embarrassment. They look to be around a year or so younger than you and as you walk past them you are aware of their eyes being drawn towards you. Oh shit, no. Please don't stare at me! You absolutely do not want to look in their direction but try to keep focused on the corridor ahead and try to maintain your pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce passed, you relax slightly, but in the quiet of the empty school their voices carry, and you hear them as them walk away from you. \"She's alright.\" one says. The other replies \"Yeah, bit skinny though. You're too young for her anyway. Besides, she's a cheerleader. She wouldn't be seen dead talking to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I can dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, just maybe you could pass as a girl. Without consciously thinking about it, you put a slight wiggle in your step making your hips sway a little as you walk on, and you feel a tiny bit more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes you reach your target location - the boys locker room. You are about to push open the door when you realize the absurdity of the situation, and that you are dressed as a girl, which could cause consternation for anyone inside. Oh Hell. There's really no alternative. You certainly can't wait around outside hoping that anyone inside will come out first. It's quiet in the corridor, and you can't hear any noise beyond the door. So you push the door open and step inside...  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boys locker room is empty. Phew. OK, the next step is to find any discarded clothing, or an unlocked locker with something that you could wear instead of this cheerleader outfit. You walk up and down each aisle checking the locker doors, and checking all coat hooks, and after a minute have managed to find an assortment of things - although not as much as you had hoped for. Nevertheless, a pair of football shorts and a shirt would be enough to make you look like a boy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start by pulling off the cheerleader shell top, which inevitably gets caught in your ponytail, reminding you that you'll also need to remove the wig. Once the shell top is off your next target for removal is the bra and artificial breasts. You unclip the bra claps at the back, and the straps fall loose on your shoulders, although the whole ensemble does not just fall off as you had expected. In fact, the bra cups haven't moved at all, still cupping the articifical boobs as if firmly attached to your chest. Oh shit. You grab the bra cups and pull - but they will not budge. You dig your fingers underneath the artificial boobs and try to lift them - also unsuccessfully. Oh, double shit. They seem to be stuck very securely to you. You cast your mind back, and remember that the silicone of the breasts felt sticky when you originally put them on. This suggests that when the girls left you, they'd already doused the bra and breasts with fast setting glue, and it appears that you're now stuck with tits whether you want them or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another thought occurs to you. When you were pulling on the wig, that had also felt tacky. and you had similarly attributed that just to the elastic material, to assure a good hold - not that it may have been tampered with! You reach up and pull on the wig hair, but as you now fear it does not shift a millimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next couple of minutes pulling and fiddling with both the breasts and wig, but to no avail. They have obviously used some type of super glue, and you reckon you'll need an adhesive remover to get rid of it - something not readily available in a locker room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, despite your best endeavors it seems that the girls did have an ace up their sleeves, and you are going to be stuck for a while longer with long hair and tits.  Not intending to be completely defeated, you pull on the tee that you found on the bench, to determine if you have any options here. As this settles into place on your body you already have doubts - it's not particularly large and is pulling tight across your breasts, making any possibility of this being able to make you look like a boy again a remote prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move towards the mirror at the end of the aisle to check what you actually look like - well, a your reflection is in essence a girl, although now wearing a boy's football shirt that isn't really big enough, so it's pulling a bit tight.  Not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, it now seems that your plans are totally thwarted, and you are going to have to stay dressed as a girl - or at least stay looking as if you're a girl - until you get home, and then somehow remove the adhesive holding both the wig and the boobs (and bra) on your body. Having been dressed as a cheerleader - albeit fairly briefly - and being subjected to the ogling looks of your peers (well, the male ones) you don't really want to have to walk home dressed like that! Besides, you learnt from your earlier encounter that the cheerleaders never wear their uniforms out of school except on a trip, so that may attract unnecessary attention. So, you decide to make the best of whatever clothing you can find here, and a soccer strip seems far more appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick off the white shoes, and pull off the pleated skirt, gold spankies and the blue tights, leaving your bottom half naked. As you are about to pull on the soccer shorts you realize that you have no underwear to put on - there's nothing lying around here (not that you'd be particularly inclined to use it if there had been). Well, you could go without...but you'd feel a bit more comfortable with something on, so almost regrettably you pull the gold spankies back on, and then pull on the shorts over the top. They are rather tighter that you like them, but will do for now. There's a discarded pair of short white socks under the bench which seem reasonably clean, so you pull these on before putting the white trainers back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fit may not be brilliant, particularly with the shirt clinging fairly tightly and so clearly emphasising the shape of your breasts, but at least it feels preferable to the cheerleaders outfit, so this will have to do. You look around and realize that you have discarded the cheerleader kit in a boys' locker room, which could cause some consternation for the janitor, or any boys who may come in later, so you gather the bits together and stuff it all into a small kit bag that you found on a hook. You then debate what to do with it, and decide the best solution would probably be to take it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sling this bag over one shoulder, and head out again, this time realizing you have no option but to head home. So you make your way towards the school entrance, again feeling quite self conscious, particularly with the breasts quite plain to see, but now you also notice that they are bouncing slightly as you walk. Of course you could carry the bag in front of you, and so hide the boobs, but you reckon that would just look silly. Just before you leave the building you catch sight of your refection in the glass window of a door, and to be honest need a second take. You may have changed your outfit, but of course you are still sporting the long auburn hair tied into a ponytail, have a very obvious pair of breasts, and are still wearing the make up. So from what you can see you are still very visibly a girl - albeit now wearing a soccer strip. Oh shit - one thing that has always turned you on is a girl wearing football strip, and now you are in essence that girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's too late to do anything about it now - you're going home! You go through the exit door, down the steps, and... ah, how are you going to get home?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Anything to avoid them recognizing you. Inside the cubicle - really just a fairly small treatment room with a narrow bed, a chair facing a wall of mirrors, a sink, and numerous items of equipment, some that you recognize and some you don't. Also in there is another of the parlor's assistants, who introduces herself as Amanda, welcomes you in, and asks you to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you having done today, dear?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, oh nothing. More like hoping to get something undone.\" you reply. \"I've just won the prize for being your 1000th client, but I don't need anything done. I'm just waiting until some boys from my school disappear outside at the moment as I really don't want them to see me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't want anything done? Your hair is a mess, and to be honest I'd take a bet it's not yours, your make up is amateurish, and your nails look like a boy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a good reason for that - I am a boy, and at this point in time the last thing I want is to be walking around wearing a wig, amateurish makeup and looking like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I can well understand that. Well, we can sort that out for you.. It's what we do - make people look like they want to look. Hang on - I'll just have a quick word with Lucy to confirm the prize,  then we can sort this out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves the little room. So maybe things can now get back to normal again. If they can remove the wig and false breasts that are glued on to you, clean up the makeup, and even get you some fresh clothes, you can put this little episode behind you. It almost seems a shame that a $500 makeover is going to be wasted on getting you back to looking like a boy. If you were actually a girl it would be a fantastic prize!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then returns. She has a beaker in her hand which she gives to you. It has a hot drink in it, which you can't actually identify but assume to be a herbal tea.  \"OK, I've spoken with Lucy who confirmed the situation with the prize, so you don't have to worry - we can get you looking decent, and get this rubbish off you. Now, sit back, enjoy the tea, and relax, and let me try to tidy you up.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, at last things are starting to go right. You sip at the tea as Amanda starts by applying a lotion all around your hairline to loosen the glue keeping the wig tightly in place, and then removes it, uncovering your own blonde hair underneath. \"OK - first thing we'll need to do is wash that to get the gunk out. You'd better finish you drink before we move to the sink.\" You do so, the she then proceeds to wash your hair, finally wrapping it up in a towel. \"OK, I'm come back to that later. Now, lie back, shut your eyes, and I've have a go at removing this makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as instructed, and find that Amanda has reclined the back of the chair so you are almost lying flat. You can feel her wiping around your face, clearly removing the make up, and you can smell her quite pleasant perfume wafting around you. You stifle a yawn.You are feeling really relaxed now, and wonder what was in the tea, but before coming up with an answer you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" Amanda says to herself, \"Now I can get on with this without interuption, and make sure you get $500 of value from this makeover.\" She smiles to herself and sets to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome while later you wake up, with a bit of a fuzzy head. You realize that you've been asleep, but have no idea for how long. You remember where you are, and open your eyes. Something feels different... funny. You sit up, and look around. You are alone in the little room. Then you realize that....</span></div></div>",

Your back hurts a bit and you feel very different in terms of clothing. Some long blonde hair obscures a bit of your vision as you sit up, as two somethings pull down on your chest. Just as you get your bearings, Amanda walks back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you woke up, good. How do you feel?\" She smiles and looks you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do to me?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wanted to play girl, so we helped you with that. It went a smidgen over your prize, but we were happy to help. Here, take a look.\" She helps you up and walks you towards a full body mirror. As you step down, you feel something push against your heels, making you stand up more. Also, something soft but firm presses hard between your legs. Walking is a bit awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there looking like a complete girl. Your hair is about shoulder length but similar color to yours naturally. It has also been permed and well washed. You notice the feeling on your ankles is due to some significant heels pushing your feet up. It's hard to stand but you manage to do so. A slight gasp escapes your mouth, looking at your outfit. Cleanly shaven and smoothed legs come out of a denim mini-skirt, going about halfway down your thighs. Your frame is topped with a pink tank top with a low neckline, showing some nice, about C-cup looking breasts. You can't feel them, but they way they've been done, they look completely real, cleavage showing and all. You feel some tightness around your upper torso and shoulders, and something stringy is riding your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the hell?!\" you stammer. \"What did you do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, we made you look better. We gave you some fusion lengtheners for your hair, so it'll grow onto yours and actually be yours in a day or so.\" She lists on her fingers. \"Also, some better breasts. The ones you had were kinda crap. Multiple layered so they're move around realistically, and a light top layer to fuse them to your chest. Finally, we covered that little male problem below. It's a prosthetic that covers it, and has a tube so you can do your business, but it's styled after a woman so you'll have to sit. Very popular with the males who come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a hurry, you lift the skirt to show some white panties, but without the budge you had expected, but merely a slight mound.  It looks like you're actually female down there. Noticing it now, you can feel something is pushing and squishing your manhood up into your crotch. Moving doesn't seem to change it at all. As you move, you notice how wide it is as well, pushing your legs out a bit. Trying to put them together only causes your knees to come together, legs staying slightly apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you start to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Everything is still there. It's just been pushed up a bit, but will all be fine when the prosthetic comes off again. However, both that and the breasts are designed to stay on for while, so whatever you do, don't yank on them at all, as it'll really hurt and damage your skin. We can remove them after a few weeks if you really don't want to keep them long term, but the body glue would really hurt to do anything now.\" Amanda adds, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it feels like you're going to be stuck like this for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something inside you is telling you they should be supported properly if they are going to retain their shape and bounce. Underneath your denim skirt your new cotton panties seem to fit nicely, and you cannot really image wearing your normal loose boxers over your new 'pussy' - or at least not without having to worry about someone accidentally noticing something amiss.

They really have gone all out on you, haven't they? Either they genuinely thought you wanted to live as a girl for a while, or really wanted to screw you up big time. Hopefully the first, although that's bad enough, and unfortunately the results for you are the same. So, it seems that whatever you may want to do, you will be looking like this for a while. Question is how we're going to let you do that. We could tell everyone the truth, although that would be pretty embarrassing for you. You could stay off school for a while, but this could be months before you'll be back to normal. Or, or, or you could pretend to be a girl for a while....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately respond. \"Oh right, as if nobody would notice.

Did you say that the girls had proposed you dress as a girl for the project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's what got me into this situation in the first place. The idea was that I should dress up as a girl to see how people would react to me, and if my responses would change as a result. Oh.

You get washed, still stunned by the face staring back from the mirror, and not really sure how to wash your new artificial parts. In the absence of anything else, you put back on the panties, bra, pink tank top and denim skirt from yesterday. You run a comb through your now lengthened hair, but fortunately you have not suffered from any knots, so it's swiftly done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pad downstairs barefoot, noticing your painted, or rather semi-permanently colored, pink toenails, of course matching your fingernails, and have some breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom telephones the school to inform the Head of Year that you are taking your role in the Humanities projected very seriously, and that you wish to spend the next few weeks 'in character' to ensure that the project can progress, but also that this will need to be kept secret from the majority of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you send a message to Rachael - the girl acting as project leader - advising her that you <u>will</u> be participating in the project - although voluntarily, and not because of her futile attempt to force you. You tell her of the plan to reappear as your cousin in a few days, and that your identity MUST be kept a secret, or you will pull out, and the project will fail (so they could wave goodbye to any hope of good grades as a result). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do I go back to school then?\" you ask your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a couple of days. I want the message that you've gone away to settle in at school first, before you reappear.  It'll give the girls in your project group a chance to work out what they need to study, and unless you hadn't noticed, we don't have a ready supply of girl's clothes for you, so we need to go shopping. Go put some shoes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively head for the shoe rack and grab your black trainers, and then remember what you are wearing. \"Oh bum.\" You realize that they are not really suited to the outfit, particularly if you want everyone to believe in your new persona, so you pull on the sandals that you were given at the salon.

You admit you're a bit disappointed, as you thought you'd be going to the mall to get your new outfits. Noticing your expression, your mom explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Tony, if we were only getting one outfit for you, we wouldn't normally come her, but we need to get you kitted out from top to toe with multiple changes to last you weeks, and I'm afraid our budget won't stretch to getting everything new. Besides, it would look pretty odd if you turn up as the new girl at school wearing only brand new clothes. Anyway the thrift store is pretty much a one stop shop, so we should be able to get everything you need here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really arguing at all, but her explanation makes perfect sense, and as you wonder around the store it seems she's right. You haven't really much of an idea what you're shopping for, but mom keeps putting things into your trolley, and after over half an hour stops outside the changing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, time for you to do something now.\" She passes a pile of clothes to you. \"Go try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? All of them? There's loads here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live with it. I'm not sure what will suit you, or even fit you, so this is the best way to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize there's not really any option, and beside your mom is right - you have no idea what size fit you are for girls clothes, so it probably better to try things on first. The changing rooms are not really rooms at all, but cubicles with a flimsy curtain that doesn't quite fit the width of the opening, and leaves a gap of about 18 inches at the bottom. Well, guess nobody is likely to be looking anyway, and if anyone sees your feet, then no biggie. So you proceed to change from your tank top and denim skirt, and try on a range of different outfits, each time having a look at yourself in the mirror, and then pulling back the curtain to let your mom see.  After the first couple, your mom starts being more selective on the sizes she passes to you, as some garments were clearly too big, too small, or just what you're describe as a weird fit.  To start with you look at each garment for what it is, but then start to look at your reflection as if you were a girl, rather than yourself. The odd thing is that if you forget its yourself you're looking at, some of the outfits actually look quite good on you, and one dress you try looks really really good, so you find yourself putting things into the 'buy' pile even before your mom does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly half hour of trying outfits on, you'd had enough, and you both head to the tills, with a trolley still fairly well laden. As you pass everything to the cashier you realize there's a load of stuff you hadn't even tried on - packs of panties, bras, socks, make up, hair grips, bracelets and bangles, and a couple of slim shoulder bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide not to ask your mom about it. All of it sort of makes sense, although does seem a bit overkill for a few weeks - OK, perhaps maybe up to three months - before the adhesive used for your artificial breasts and pussy softens up so they can be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you leave the thrift store and head back to the car.  The first thing you do is to take off the sandals that you've been wearing  and instead put on a pair you've just bought that are virtually flat, so relieving you of 4 inches of heel that you've really been struggling with.  You decide you don't really like heels - at least not on you.  On a girl, that's different, you like girls in heels...  OK, so that means you're going to be the sort a girl you don't like because you don't like to wear heels?  Oh, this is silly. You realize the scale of this is starting to hit home, and you're not sure how you'll cope...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

You have your own blond hair, but it has been styled and is somehow significantly longer than it was before - but clearly not a wig. Either she had made your hair grow incredibly quickly, or she's added extensions. You are wearing a stunning halter neck babydoll style dress in a soft baby blue color, revealing your legs which you really had never realized were quite so long and slim - and now suspiciously silky smooth and hair free... But the biggest shock is your face - you can barely recognize yourself. You have received a comprehensive makeover with false eyelashes, blusher in all the right places, glistening lips which look noticeably plumper than you ever remember them, plus large gold hooped earring in your - oh shit - newly pierced ears. You look down. Your nails are manicured, painted and polished and gleam like a new car still in the showroom - and that includes your toenails.

Just to reassure yourself that they hadn't interfered with that particular aspect you reach one hand down to your groin, where you can feel everything that you knew should have been there, and you then check out your breasts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you enter the main salon Lucy and Amanda look towards you. Lucy screams out \"Wow! Just look at you now! You look fantastic! So much better than when you came in here! You really must give us a twirl so we can see everything! God - you must be really excited by this!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis somewhat takes the wind out of your sails, and you stop in your tracks. \"Well, um...\" you start. You realize (as you had only just admitted to yourself) that you do look stunning, but it's somewhat different when a pretty girl tells you that - and you can feel yourself blushing slightly. The possibility that you are excited by your makeover hadn't even occurred to you, although in truth you do find it a bit of a thrill. However, all that aside, they have not done what you asked of them, and have violated your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um..\" you start again. \"I really don't think that you should have...\" you start, about to embark into a major complaint about what they have done to you, but are immediately interrupted by Amanda, who drowns out everything that you were trying to say. \"Well, perhaps we shouldn't have done everything quite so thoroughly as we did, but we felt that you were worth it. You have such a nice figure it really was crying out for some treatment to suit it, and you have a lovely tone to your skin. Your previous efforts at looking like a girl were really quite amateurish, and it was clear from what you said that you wanted it done properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I said was that I wanted all of the previously stuff removed\" you reply, \"and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Amanda interrupts again, you said the last thing you wanted was to be wearing a wig and amateurish makeup, so we've replaced the wig with real hair extensions, and replaced all of your schoolgirl makeup with professional quality kit. Now you really do look like a proper girl, and we thought we could celebrate the transformation with you.\" As she speaks she pops the cork from the bottle of champagne, pours some into a glass and pushes it into your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, you need to get your thoughts straight. Did you actually say you wanted them to make you look like a boy again? What Amanda has said about not wanting to wear a wig and amateurish makeup has struck something of a chord in your memory, so you'd better be sure of yourself before you make too many accusation. Meanwhile you realize you haven't drunk anything for ages and your throat is quite dry, so you drink the champagne in the glass. The bubbles make you cough slightly. Amanda has meanwhile poured out a glass each for Lucy and herself, and seeing you drink yours immediately refills it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then,\" Lucy says, \"let's have that twirl. I want to see what that dress looks like on you - you really do have the figure for it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if...\" you start, but then decide to shut up for a moment. You drink down the refilled glass (so as not to spill any when rotating) and then spin around 360 degrees. You can feel the hem of the dress floating outwards and lagging slightly behind as you rotate around, and can feel the air movement on your silky smooth legs, which actually gives you a bit of a kick.  Lucy is grinning like a Cheshire cat \"That really is brilliant. You look fantastic! You must be really happy now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda tops up your glass again, and you drink it down. Somehow you are not feeling quite so annoyed about everything now. You know they shouldn't have done what they did, but you do actually feel quite good. After all, you do look really, well, sexy now - something nobody would ever have described you as being previously- , and everything that Lucy is saying is really bolstering your confidence. The champagne is starting to give you a bit of a buzz, and dulling your sense of anger. Perhaps it would be OK to stay like this for a little while longer, and then you can get Amanda to remove all the makeup and get you back to looking like a boy later on... after all, it's only makeup and clothes, and you are starting to feel more comfortable about it all, so why spoil the mood now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

As you're now looking so good and dressed for a night out, why don't we actually do it? We're  all done here now, and I have no plans for this evening. Why don't we go out to celebrate how good you're looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite thinking that perhaps you wouldn't mind staying dressed as you are a little longer, the prospect of going outside and potentially being seen like this is really a step too far. \"I, um, don't have a coat, and it's probably getting a bit cooler out now...\" you say, ignoring that fact that you are currently feeling quite hot, possibly as a result of three glasses of champagne. \"Beside, the reason I came in here originally was to get away from some guys from my school as I didn't want them to recognize me. I don't want to risk running into them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be truthful there's no much chance of bumping into them now,\" Amanda responds, \"but even if you did I'm pretty sure they wouldn't recognize you. Unless you do anything <i>really</i> stupid they wouldn't even consider that you could be you - perhaps your sister or cousin at best. To anyone who didn't know, you're all girl. My professional reputation is your guarantee about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then that's settled.\" Lucy jumps in. \"We can go for a bite to eat something inside the mall, so we'll all keep warm, and then decide what to do later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really like being pressured into making decisions, but you realize you are quite hungry, and if you stay inside the mall you shouldn't really see many people. At least you could then get Amanda to bring you back to the salon to take off the makeup later on, so maybe it wouldn't be too bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well OK..b..,\" you start, but are again interrupted before your could add the 'but' part of your sentence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Lucy says. \"We'll finish up this bottle and I'll just check my face, then we're ready to go. Yeah?\" You look at Lucy and cannot understand what needs checking as she looks pretty good to you already. In fact she looks really, really pretty. It is only now that you notice that neither Lucy or Amanda is dressed in their salon uniform, but are both wearing smart outfits, almost as if they were planning to go out all the time. You find that the glass in your hand is again brimming with champagne, and the effects of the previous three glasses are already taking effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

You open your mouth to respond, but then forget what the question was. \u201cUm, I think I love you\u2026\u201d you utter, and then realizing that your saturated hormones have taken over, and quickly correct what you have said \u201cI mean, yeah, I\u2019d love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately neither of them seem to notice your blunder. Phew!   (...What you don't notice is Amanda and Lucy briefly exchanging glances, with a wink passed between them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy moves away from the reception area and crosses to one of the full length mirrors on the far wall of the salon, you see everything that she\u2019s wearing, Her top half appears barely covered with a sheer chiffon blouse pulled and tied into a knot on one side, through which her micro triangle bra is clearly visible, keeping little more than her nipples covered and ensuring her figure is quite clearly visible. In fact,the more you look, the more you can make out the shape of her nipples pressing through the soft material of her bra. Underneath that she has a pair of high cut grey shorts over black wet look leggings, and a pair of grey leather ankle boots sporting 6 inch heels. Every worry or care you have seems to disappear, and your eyes are transfixed by this petite beauty in front of you. You can feel your body reacting to this vision with a building erection, and you just hope your underwear can hold everything in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then, we have a threesome of girls going out, so we\u2019d better get one thing sorted out.\u201d Amanda says. \u201cWhat is your pseudonym?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, sorry, what?\u201d you respond, dragging your attention from ogling Lucy, and not having a clue what she\u2019s asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your female name?\u201d she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm. I don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m\u2026Tony\u2026 I\u2019m a boy. I thought we\u2019d already established that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. I have absolutely no doubt about that. Your satin briefs didn\u2019t magic themselves onto your body. But what name do you use when you\u2019re a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I mean I haven\u2019t.\u201d you stutter, suddenly realizing the meaning behind her remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, not even one you use yourself? Well, that\u2019s unusual. Most of the cross dressers I\u2019ve seen have got at least one pseudonym, and some more. Well, you will have to have a name \u2013 we can\u2019t really call you Tony when we\u2019re out \u2013 that would definitely attract undue interest. Hmm, I think you look like an Amy, or possibly, oh yes, how about Tammy? It\u2019s close enough to your real name so you should feel fairly familiar with it. You OK with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, guess so\u2026 although I think I\u2019d like Lucy\u2019s view as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turns her eyes so that she can see you reflected in the mirror in front of her. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d go with that. We definitely couldn\u2019t call you Tony \u2013 you're all girl now, so that wouldn\u2019t work. Guess Toni would technically be an option, but you'll need to differentiate between yourself and your pseudonym, and if anyone you know does hear that it may trigger some recognition. Tammy works for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then,\u201d you reply. \u201cI guess I\u2019m Tammy for the evening then.\u201d  Somehow this statement gives you a bit of a buzz. You\u2019ve never had a pseudonym before, and even dressing up and acting in the school drama last year didn\u2019t feel quite like this. Although you admit the similarity of donning a flat cap and overalls for a crowd scene in Oliver was as far removed from your current state as you could really imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. I\u2019m done here \u201cLucy announces as she turns and walks back towards you. \u201cYou ready for a night out Tammy?  Then let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The biggest issue that you encounter is coping with your newly acquired footwear sporting 4\u201d heels, and by the time you reach your destination your calves and toes are aching. You hope that you\u2019ll find a quiet table hidden away so that you can kick these sandals off, but the bar is already quite busy, and the only seats are high stools by the bar. You jump up and place your feet on the crossbar. Your dress, already on the shorter side, now pulls up even further around your thighs, revealing a little more of your legs than you would really have preferred. Lucy, noticing your distraction, says \u201cThere should be a table free soon, and we can move.  But don\u2019t worry \u2013 you\u2019ve got nice legs, so you haven\u2019t got anything to fret about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that may well be the case, but you don\u2019t really feel you want anyone staring at your legs however nice Lucy may feel there are, just in case they see something they shouldn't. The wine bar is busy, mostly with people having a meal before moving on to the theater or cinema, or having a drink before heading home. Amanda orders a bottle of wine and three glasses, and then pours some into each glass. She then passes you the menu. \u201cWe\u2019ll order here, but hopefully have a table by the time the food is ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select a chicken pasta dish (in fact copying what Lucy ordered), but are slightly more perturbed by the glass of wine in front of you. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t really be drinking that.\u201d You whisper to Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Too many calories? You\u2019re thinking like a girl already! Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I shouldn\u2019t be drinking at all \u2013 I\u2019m nowhere near 21!.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mention it, nobody else will. You could get away with being 18, and they\u2019re quite relaxed in here. Just enjoy yourself.\u201d With that Lucy leans towards you, puts her arms around you, and gives you a gentle squeeze. The combination of her touch, perfume, and the sight of her perk breasts advancing towards you convince you that perhaps complaining about being given a glass of wine is being a bit petty, and indeed there are reasons to be enjoying your time here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy points out little things that you can do to help keep \u2018in character\u2019, and keen to keep her happy you comply with each suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your body decides to take notice of the drinks that you\u2019ve had, and the time since you last emptied your bladder, and you decide that you need to visit the bathroom. \u201cI need to go to the little boys\u2019 room.\u201d You tell Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may find yourself in trouble if you do,\u201d she replies, \u201cI think you\u2019d better head for the little girls\u2019 room instead!\u201d  She offers to accompany you, which you find a bit weird - as if she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll find your way there, or to be able to have a pee on your own. You politely decline. The alcohol is definitely making you a little light headed, and you really could do with a minute or two alone, to get your head around what\u2019s happening. You slip down off your stool and follow the signs to the bathroom, making sure you go into the Ladies. You enter a stall and shut the door. You drop your panties and sit down \u2013 remembering one of the things Lucy mentioned earlier \u2013 \u201c<i>girls always sit to have a pee. I know you\u2019re not used to that but you really must do everything that a girl would do, including that</i>.\u201d  So you sit to relieve yourself.  Then you leave the stall and wash your hands, staring in fascination at your reflection. Well you really have to admit that for all external appearances you are all girl \u2013 although what you have just tucked back into your satin panties confirmed to you that you definitely are not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opens, and someone comes in. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

You dry you hands, and have a final look at yourself in the mirror, claw your fingers through your hair, and smooth down your dress. Noticing what you\u2019re doing the girl says \u201cForget your make up?

Not that it would ever happen of course, but the fact that she invited you is pretty fantastic. OK \u2013 then perhaps you\u2019d better take this a bit more seriously and make sure you follow everything Lucy was advising. Your light headedness remains, but you now have a added buzz. Sod, it, you\u2019re stuck as a girl on a night out with friends, so why not make the best of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the bar where you had left Lucy and Amanda a few minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe not quite so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Tammy.\u201d Matt replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy pulls you close to her, and whispers in your ear. \u201cThis is your chance to see how good you are in your new persona. If you can keep him thinking you\u2019re a girl, then I think I could give you a treat later.\u201d With that she gently runs her finger up you thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm, now you\u2019re even more confused. \"Yes but I...\" you start, unable to complete your objection that you don't want to be a girl, as Lucy immediate jumps down from her stool, saying \u201cLet\u2019s swap seats.Then you can introduce yourself to Matt properly, and I can have a chat with Amanda.\u201d Within seconds and before your could really prepare yourself you are seated by Lucy\u2019s ex boyfriend, who seems quite keen to find out as much as he can about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do you know Lucy then? Do you work in salon too? She hasn\u2019t mentioned you before. Then again we only bump into each other every so often, so I guess things and people change. So, tell me all about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to reply and potentially screw up the whole thing, Lucy learns over and cuts across you. \u201cBe easy on her Matt. Tammy\u2019s our new trainee. She\u2019s only just started, so don\u2019t ask her anything about the salon \u2018cos she probably won\u2019t know yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK.\u201d Matt responds. Then he turns his focus back to you. \u201cRighty, so I now know how Lucy knows you. So if you've only just started there I guess you\u2019ve just left high school. So, where do you live?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the ensuing few minutes you divulge to Matt that you live in Hill Valley, with you mom and older sister, you went to Hill Valley High School (well unknown to Matt you still do), that you like netball and racket sports (which is true as far as racket sports - although you have never played netball in your life, but like watching the girls play it at school), and that you don\u2019t have a boyfriend (which is definitely true!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact you find Matt quite easy to talk to and begin to wonder why Lucy broke up with him. You could understand how a girl could be quite taken by him charm and intense interest \u2013 in fact you are feeling a bit smitten by him yourself. After about ten minutes Lucy interrupts to tell you that there\u2019s a table free, and your meals are ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, then guess it\u2019s time I make a move. It\u2019s been really good meeting you Tammy. I hope it won\u2019t be the only time. I\u2019d like to find out a bit more about you. Have a great evening!\u201d With that he stands up, reaches over to Lucy and gives her a kiss on her cheek, and to your shock then turns and smacks a kiss on your lips.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit!!! </i>You think to yourself. You\u2019re being kissed by a guy. Or rather you\u2019re being kissed by a guy who thinks you're a girl.  What do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately it doesn\u2019t, and Matt then turns to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat stunned by what just happened you follow Lucy and Amanda to a table, carrying your wine glass with you. There you all sit down and your meals are served to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done,\u201d Lucy says quietly to you, \u201cGood job. Now, enjoy your meal and relax \u2013 no more pressure now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that at least is a relief. You hadn\u2019t expected that, but had hoped to have a while with Lucy, and in essence to have found out as much about her as Matt had about you - and then hopefully end up snogging her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat your meals, and get through two bottles of wine between the three of you, and by the time you have finished eating you are feeling quite warm, very light headed, and significantly less bothered about anything else than Lucy.

We met at school and sort of fell in with each other, but we were more like a brother and sister than boyfriend / girlfriend. When someone else come along it was not really like breaking up  - we still see each other all the time, but just as good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d watch this little one,\u201d Amanda says to Lucy,\u201dI think Tammy may be eyeing him up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a couple of seconds to work out what she means, at which point you nearly choke on the mouthful of wine you were drinking. \u201cNo!\u201d you reply. \u201cNot at all. I just thought he was quite nice, that\u2019s all.\u201d You can feel your face turning red in embarrassment. <i>He <u>was</u> nice</i>, you say to yourself. <i>Just because I think he's nice doesn't mean I want to date him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Lucy cuts in, \u201cAmanda\u2019s only kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat doesn\u2019t really help you feel better.

You tentatively push the door to the changing room, hoping that there\u2019s nobody in there. You cannot see anyone so venture in. As you hoped there were various items of clothing left on the hooks, so this should just be a case of switching clothes and making a hasty exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing is to get rid of this dress. Lovely and expensive it may be, but it is definitely too girlie for what you now have in mind \u2013 snogging girls and possibly doing what you have a feeling Simon had in mind earlier. You reach over your shoulders and find the zipper, which you eventually manage to undo, and then pull off the baby doll style dress. OK, the bra is next, and hopefully the false boobs with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra falls off, but the breasts remain attached. After some prodding and pulling they do come loose, and you can pull them off. Great \u2013 this is at last going to plan.  You look around to see what\u2019s available to change into. You find a number of items of clothing, but then realize that they are all too big for you. You are fairly small for your age, making you ideal for your current persona of a girl, but the majority of what you find is suitable for adult males so would swamp you, and certainly not meet your expectations for impressing the girls in the bars. Blast!  What now?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly decide that this isn\u2019t going to work, and decide that your best hope would be checking the female changing room instead for something more your size, and hopefully boyish enough that you could wear to look like you should (as a boy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the dress, bra and the false breasts and head to the door, intending to make a dash for the female changing room, but as you reach it you hear a noise outside. Realizing that you still look very much like a girl with your long hair, make up, and still wearing pink satin panties and high heeled sandals, you really do not want to be seen like this.

However, you have now reached the conclusion that this is as unlikely as having sex with Lucy, so are really not very optimistic.

You know of only one way out, so you go to kick him in the balls, but he catches your leg. Crap, you think. Should have thought that through -  he's got to have good reflexes being the quarterback.<br>\r\n\"Oh, trying to get your leg round me already are you? You must be desperate so allow me to help you.\" Matt goes to kiss you, and as a last ditched attempt you throw you head forward and head butt him, and jump for the door. However, he catches you, and pins you head first into a locker and starts grabbing and squeezing your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in shear terror as you don't know how to stop him, and he is about to find out your secret, but you can't help but be slightly amused by how he's trying to force himself onto another guy! Suddenly all you hear is a thud, and Matt falls over. You turn around and there is... </span></div></div>",

Maybe some lotion and better makeup would help, but right now you looked the part. It's slightly uncomfortable to know that you, a boy, could change into a girl In such a small amount of time. You brush your finger over your lips, trying not to smudge the makeup job that girl had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that girl! She winked at you! What if she had seen through it all, and was gonna tell all her friends that you, Tony was some creepy weirdo who wanted to wear girls clothes. Sh-she seemed nice enough to help you so why would she do that? Your trance like state on continues as you slide your finger down the v-neck and onto the skirt. It isn't itchy like you would like. Neither are the stockings...both are very comfortable in fact. But only for the time being! You would never be a cross dresser..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had examined and thought about the outfit over and over in a trance like state at the mirror. But you couldn't take your eyes off yourself. You look..semi attractive and your whole body was confused. But you're brought back to reality by one of those girls calling your name. \"Toni. Toni!\" One of the girls says, having a towel around her waist but still showing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yes?\" You say trying not to stare at her firm wet boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's traumatic I know to lose your clothes. But just rubbing your lips and touching your breasts won't help. You need to come on before the game starts tonight. You wouldn't want to miss that would you?\" She says smiling and starting to pull her clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The..there's a game tonight?\" You reply shocked. You were a nerd but surely you wouldn't miss a big game. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a college game I believe. You remembered that right?\" She said finishing getting he clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..no I never knew..\" You say squirming around not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she kindly says. \"Look you're a bit flustered I get it.

Deal?\" She pulls on a pair of heels and fixes her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like..like a date?\" You blurt out stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess.

Pulling you along you walk out of the locker room, and into the main school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I uh play video games..and play on the computer a lot...\" You reply, not lying, but realizing how stupid you sound.

In fact, it seems to be more gender neutral than the girl's school uniform of a skirt and jacket that Rachael locked away in the other locker.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you could wear this, at least, temporarily to escape and make your way safely home. Then again, you have little choice since you can't run out of the school and home in the nude. You just hope no one spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there is no way you're going to take a shower using these weird products. They don't even make sense. No cream is going to make part of your body bigger. Well, you don't think so, but you're not about to try and find out. So you just stick them back in the kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you realize that you have to get dressed and out before the school cleaning staff catches you in here. Then you'd be in really big trouble for being a guy naked in the girls locker room. Your reputation would be better if you got dressed as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you take hold of the panties and step into them. They are slippery smooth and feel nice gliding up your legs. You always wondered if girls clothes were nicer than guys. First try proves that correct as you smooth them on your hips. As a guy you do exaggerate them in front, no help to the fact that you're partially aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK. Settle down. It's just the material and not that you like it. Right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debate on wearing the bra, but wonder what it feels like. Fortunately, it snaps in the front so you don't have to struggle trying to be double-jointed behind your back. It is snug with a silky piece at each breast that slides enticingly on your chest as you adjust it. Since it feels good and doesn't give you an obvious bust, you leave it on knowing it'll be hidden under the t-shirt especially since it and the panties are beige skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark pants are baggy in the front and rather difficult to get past your hips until you realize that the zipper should be in the back. It still takes a little more work getting their tight fit over your thighs and settled on your waist. They're also a little short, ending several inches above your ankles. However, once on, they are rather comfortable. That's another takeaway about girl's clothes: wearing them isn't bad, maybe nicer than boys. If only you didn't feel self-conscious that you'd be thought of as a crossdresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some noise in the hallway and remember that you need to get going. You pop the t-shirt over your shaggy head without looking at the design. As you start to put the kit back in the locker, you see a movement down the row. There's a girl dressed similar to you at the other end of the lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart jumps and so do you, only to see the girl just as surprised and hop to the side as well. The panic spikes then slowly fades as you realize that it's just a reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, you shove the kit in the locker, slip on the sandals, and rush out the door. Now you just need to decide if you should try to sneak home or go meet the girls. You can't imagine that they would really do this to you every day. Perhaps you should let them know now, and they'll leave you alone. Or maybe just get home and change before anyone finds out, hoping tomorrow will be better.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You couldn't turn around and walk \"into\" the school without drawing even more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big sigh you thought, <i>Since they're bound to see me leave, I guess I might as well just go meet with them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was a noise behind you causing you to look over your shoulder. When you turned back, you almost walked right into a group of girls coming from another hallway. Two of them were in a class you had, and one smiled at you. You started panicking realizing she must recognize you and that you were wearing girls clothes. However, she just turned back and kept going with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all giggled, you imagined she was telling them about your clothes. Not wanting to draw any more attention, you held back. Then as they appeared to just be ignoring you, you figured they may be able to provide cover when you go outside. Perhaps Rachael and the others who did this to you wouldn't see you from across the street in the coffee shop where they were waiting. So you kept up and went through the doors together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were just about to start down the first of the main steps. you heard, \"Hey, Tony. Been waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Susan standing by a column. \"Good to see you took our advice and got dressed rather than run home naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like I had any choice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your pack. With your clothes. You didn't shower with the stuff did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your pack and slung it over one shoulder with a sigh and rolling your eyes as your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good. It was a trick anyway that I tried to stop them. At least you don't smell like a flower shop.\" She gave you a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're here to make sure that I go to meet with everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. Actually, I'm just here to give you your stuff in case you didn't want to meet. It isn't right to steal it. Although it would be good if you did come and report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the project. ... You remember, right?\" She leaned in and whispered, \"Being forced to dress as the other gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remembered that you were standing at the top of the school steps wearing the girl clothes. Other students had been walking by, and you had been talking as if everything was normal, not concerned how you were dressed at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was all they really wanted, then they would leave you alone. It seemed too simple, though. Maybe you should just head home. Or now that you had your clothes back, you could go change before more people saw you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ah, yes, I think we can make this work if you make you into a Goth girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell's bells,\" says Susan. \"I don't think we have enough black hair color for that, and won't we need a ton of black clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all,\" Rachael replies, \"it's not all black, although that's obviously the main color. We shouldn't need to dye Tony's hair too much to be convincingly gothic. We'll need to figure out what color looks best on him. Black isn't the only color in the gothic lifestyle. Dark reds, violet, blue, green, gray and white are often used as side colors to black, so we've got a lot of scope here.  We'll need to focus on make-up. Hmm, that will need to be dramatic. Tony will need black heavy eyeliner, um, red lips, and dark shades with quite heavy application to work well. Then black, red, and purple around and on the eyelids. Cat-eye eyeliner obviously! Then I think a band tee shirt, and maybe tight black jeans and boots.  We'll need to give Tony a bit of a figure under the shirt first. Hmm, yes, I think that could work.  I think we want a fairly cute goth rather than anything too brutal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael set the other girls to fetch different items, and within a short while everything is laid out. Then they start working on you. They strip you to your waist first, and start coloring your hair. You'd thought they were going to dye it jet black, but after a few minutes it seems to be a purple shade, which whilst seems quite hideous is actually one of your favorite colors, so you're sort of OK with it.   The girls then start on make-up, particularly around your eyes and mouth, but you can't see what they're doing as they won't let you look in a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist a little when they put a bra on you, complete with artificial breasts, but Rachael immediately reaches for the needle again, and you decide to let then carry on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they tell you to take off your pants and boxers, and give you briefs, a short black flared skirt and fishnets to put on. Realizing you've no choice, you do so.  They then have a pair of back chunky boots for you to put on. They add a number of 'final touches', and then announce that they're finished.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then Tony, have a look at the new you.\" and she indicates the full length mirror.  The boots only have a shallow platform so walking isn't bad. You step across to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you say before you can stop yourself. Not only do you look like a girl, but you now realize that you like the look of Goth girls! \"That's all very well, but you won't be able to spend that long getting me dressed like this every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true. \" Rachael replies. \"We'll need to work out a plan for that....  We'll need more clothes too. Um I think we should try a corset as well. That would help improve your figure as well. Yes, I think there's some scope with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what am I supposed to do now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to get used to the new you - let's go to the mall and see how you get on. Hmm, think we'll need to find a new name for you as well - something suitably gothic <i>and</i> girlie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is impossible you think to yourself. Surely it's got to take days, if not weeks, before the estrogen could have any real effect? You wonder how much of the stuff they injected into you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice that your skin seems somehow smoother. That's just weird. You pull open the changing cubicle door, and make your way, a little unsteadily, to the row of sinks to see your reflection in the mirrors. Well, yes, there is something different about your face - your complexion seems smoother, cleaner, although otherwise still just you. OK, maybe it's not too bad then. Suddenly, and for no apparent reason, you burst into tears, and sob away for a few minutes, cursing yourself for crying like a little girl. Then you realize what you had just thought. Why did you cry, and why did you associate the sobbing with a girl? Oh bugger and damnation. Surely that's not another affect of the blasted estrogen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, the final test. You stick your hand down your pants and feel for your dick. If they think they can turn you into a girl by injections alone they'll have a challenge getting rid of this - although somehow you do feel that your balls are perhaps a bit smaller? No, that's got to be your imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a noise behind you. Someone is coming into the changing room. You immediately move your hand from your pants, smooth down you shirt and pretend to be combing through your hair. In the mirror you can see a couple of boys who have fairly obviously been playing squash, and have returned to get changed.

You certainly dare not turn around now. Even if the boys don't notice the contours of your breasts then there's no way they'd miss two wet patches on your shirt, now clinging tightly to your nipples making them even more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you also can't stay in front of the mirror either. It may become a bit suspicious you standing there too long, and you realize that if you can see the boys reflected in the mirrors, then they can just as easily see you - and your new secret. You need to move - but where to? You can't leave the locker room as you are - you'd have to cover your shirt at least, and there's not a lot of spare clothing lying around that you could borrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best option seems to be heading into the changing cubicle until the locker room is empty again. Then you spot the showers.  You could probably do with a shower to freshen up after all your perspiring earlier. The two boys are now getting dressed and don't seem to be taking any notice of you, so you head quickly into the showers, choose a shower cubicle and get insidey. You strip off your shirt to reveal your breasts - which to you seem enormous, although you have no knowledge or means of actually measuring them (actually by now only a B cup). You then strip off the rest of your clothes, and turn on the water. Now at least nobody will question what you're doing, and hopefully when you're finished the two lads will have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you let the water cascade over you, washing away the sweat and hopefully anything that may have been seeping from your nipples, you daydream slightly, recalling images that you'd seen on-line of naked girls in the shower, and how your eyes had always initially focused on their tits. Without thinking you cup your hand over your breasts, still picturing those images, and find that your nipples are really sensitive, and as your finger brush against them you get a weird feeling - a cross between and electric shock and intense arousal. Wow! That's something you've never experienced before, and you must admit it felt really good, although your nipples are also feeling a bit sore, so best not to overdo it.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you stop the water, and shake yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

However, you really want to get some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that there's a drinking fountain by the auditorium also leads to realizing that there's an exit there that's seldom used. That would avoid going out the front where you're more likely to be spotted. What's better is that you also might be able to get into the drama department and find some better clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hide your breasts, you decide to hold your pack with both arms crossed against your torso, then you quickly stride off down the corridor. The clothes on you press against your body but not as uncomfortably as you would expect. The tight pants' waist forces you more upright with chest held high against the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants also make it difficult to take more than short strides and forces your legs close. There's a distinctive \"swish swish swish\" as your thighs pass each other which only causes you to slow more normally to limit the sound. Although your concern keeps you on edge, no one else comes by, and you relax once at the drinking fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water tastes really good, a bit fruity even as you pull it in through your lips. The fountain cooling mechanism churns into action to keep the water nice and cold. It's very refreshing, and you feel much better as you take several drafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stop, you hear footsteps and voices that escaped detection as you drank. As you look up, three girls come round a corner and spot you. Still holding the pack to your chest, you note they are doing the same for theirs. You almost turn and run except that might draw more attention. Instead you face the wall hoping that they just ignore you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he works on your face he tells you about the next school production - and that they're trying out the make up today for the different performers today, which is why Eric is there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare into the mirror and watch as Eric colors up your eyelids, applies eye liner, and trims and shapes your eyebrow into pencil thin stripes. With a little foundation and a couple of gently swipes with his fingers across your cheeks, he seems to make you cheek bones slightly more prominent. With your already pink lips you are amazed how much of a difference it makes, and you realize that you'd now have trouble recognizing yourself. You are also quite conscious of your enlarged breasts - as a consequence of the multiple injections of Estrogen and Risperdal that the girls gave you earlier - and are surprised that Eric hasn't said anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you had intended to sneak into the drama club to try to find something (male) to change back into, you must admit to being quite impressed by Eric's handiwork, and realize that even if you wiped off all the makeup, you'd still look pretty odd dressing as a boy at the moment, with bright pink lips and boobs. Dressing as a girl may make more sense, at least until your lips decide to subside again, and you can work out what to do about your enlarged breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry if I was a bit unappreciative earlier,\" you say to Eric. \"It's not been a good afternoon.

Louise (the research assistant) is slightly shorter, and really slim, with a relatively petite bosom (32A) in a white cotton bra with a pink lace trim. Her panties also match, with a similar trim around the waistband. Amy (the archivist and librarian) is the only one wearing glasses, and has ill-matching underwear, with her 34B cup bra in pink cotton, and white and pink polka dot panties. Finally Susan (the sociologist) has a striking red and black striped silk bra holding in a bosom almost as large as Rachael's (34C), with matching striped boy shorts, clinging tightly to her upper thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really have some difficulty not staring at their bodies, and can feel yourself getting physically aroused with a developing boner inside your pants. However you are also quite apprehensive, not knowing at all what these girls have in mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael then speaks again, this time directly to you. \"We have thought about the project and we don't want to force you to doing something that you're clearly unhappy with. However we really do want to proceed with our project, so we've agreed to change the scope a bit to make it a bit more appealing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So instead of our original plan to study someone living as the opposite gender, we thought we could study someone given the opportunity to wear <u>any</u> item or items of clothing of the opposite gender,.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose to keep any female clothing you wear hidden from view, that's your choice. However, to make the project work the rule must be that you always have at least one item of female clothing on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want me to dress up as a girl any more?\" you ask, somewhat taken aback by this change of direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you want to. The only condition would be that you always have at least one item of girl's clothing on. If you choose to have more than one, or even dress fully as a girl, we'd be very happy, but we wouldn't force you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only other rule is that you would have to wear a different item each day. We can't have you always wearing the same thing every day through the project - that would be boring and rather defeats the object of seeing how different items feel, or make you feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is a bit better. Maybe you will get the chance to see what it's like to wear some sexy girls underwear yet - your eyes land on the black and red boy shorts clinging to Susan's legs - and nobody would know! (well, not your mates anyway.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK, but why have you all stripped down to your underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Swapping only starts once you're top half is exposed, too, otherwise you won't be able to put this on.\" With that Susan reaches behind her, unclasps her bra which falls forwards, and which she then offers to you in one hand, whilst her tits bounce free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Oh shit. You mean all that you were saying earlier about boxers being underwear....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. You asked to swap underwear, which means you are now the proud owner of both my shorts and bra, and I get just your boxers in return, so these fellas will have to be self supporting for the next day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you have got to admit that this situation had been made clear more than once during the past few minutes, but your mind had been too focused elsewhere (mostly to be honest on Susan's boy shorts) to really take it in. So you can't really complain, so proceed to remove your shirt and tie, so that socks aside you are now as equally undressed as Susan, with her in only her silk shorts, and you in your cotton boxers - albeit now containing a rock solid boner, which causes you a bit of embarrassment, realizing that you will imminently be showing this off to Susan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she has already noticed. \"Not sure if my little shorts will be big enough to accommodate you at the moment.\" she says, reaching over and gently grasping her hand around your boner through the material of your boxers, instantly reducing your focus on the situation even more. \"Do you think there is anything we can do about this?

Anyone mind if I have a quick look now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a series of shaking heads you all pile in to the store, and Rachael starts checking racks. \"You may as well have a look around too Tony\" she says, \"after all, if I get something you may be inclined to swap into it, so you may as well get some ideas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think one item at a time is quite enough for the time being thanks.\" you respond.

Somewhat like Susan's boy shorts, but moreso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise notices what you're doing. \"Feels good doesn't it? I have some satin PJs which I adore. I look forward to going to bed when I put them on.\" She stops and seems to think to herself for a minute. \"Of course if you wanted to you could swap <u>anything</u> you wear, not just your day to day stuff like your school uniform and undies. So you could swap night wear too if you wanted. Same conditions would apply. It would help you appreciate the feeling of girls clothes better if you went all night wearing something girlie too. What do you wear in bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends - just a pair of shorts normally.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so it's topless nights for anyone you'd swap with then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Oh, I get it. Yeah, but how do I know that you'd go topless if I decide to swap nightwear?\" you find yourself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have my word on it. If you're lucky I may send you a selfie when I'm  ready to go to bed. If you need any better proof, then I guess having a sleepover would really confirm it, but that wouldn't go down too well with my parents, so I'm afraid my word is all I have at the moment.

After a couple of minutes waiting you can hear what seems to be Rachael cursing in the dressing room. Then she emerges wearing a black skater dress with a sweatheart neckline and mesh neck detail above the bust, with a flared hemline just a few inches above her knees. It looks great, but she is clearly not happy with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bloody tight across the bust. Otherwise it's just gorgeous. If I had smaller boobs it would be great. It's on sale at 50% off too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is clearly very disappointed.\"It's a shame not to get it at this price, but unless I loose some of my best assets there wouldn't be any point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise notices you eying up and down the little dress. \"Um, I know someone about your size but with smaller tits, and I reckon it would fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Who?\" Rachael responds, and then notices who Louise is looking at \"Oh blimey, you're right. Um Tony, how do you fancy trying it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! No! Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not. You've been eying me up in it, so I'd guess you like it, and reckon it would fit you well too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can object any more the girls are pushing you into the dressing room along with Rachael, and realize that you'll probably have to go through with this just to keep them quiet. So you undress down to the underwear, and Rachael pulls off the dress and passes it to you, so you put it over your head and slip it on. \"Take off your socks.\" Rachael says. \"They really don't look good under a dress, and I have another use for them.\" You comply, and Rachael folds them up and pushes then down into the cups of Susan's bra that you're wearing. \"That's a bit better. OK - now take a look in the mirror and tell em what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front is high enough that all you can see is bulges where the bosom should be, and the dress drops perfectly down your slim body. You don't want to admit it, but it actually looks really quite good. \"Could do with some black heels and you'd be well away.

Then only we can attach the things needed for the swap.\" Susan helps you pull off the skater dress, leaving you in the bra and panties you got from her earlier. Rachel does the same, and you marvel at how beautiful she is. Louise hooks up a bunch of electric pads on your hands and feet. She tells you they are required for the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise starts a countdown. \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1, swap!\" And you both black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes. You're not sure how long, but when you awake you're lying on a bed. You open your eyes, but don't move, so hoping nobody will notice you. The walls of the room are bright, and you're tucked into pink sheets. Then you remember the swap. You want to check if it worked but you don't want to move the sheets. You can definitely feel and see the two mounds sitting on your chest. Good, that worked. You can also feel the hair sitting at your sides. You can see Louise, Amy, and Susan talking on the floor of the room. You can also see your body sitting there talking to them too. You get up, and everyone rushes to you excitedly. \"How do you feel?\" Your old body asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel pretty good actually, but off balance\" You say, standing up and wiping the hair out of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the boobs, don't worry.\" Rachel tells you, from your old body. She sits you down with them. You're still in the same bra and panties. Rachel had tried to dress like a guy, she pulled grey sweatpants and a sweater out of her closet. She reckoned that would suffice until she gets to your house. \"Now we have to go over some guidelines and rules. The machine adds a link between the two bodies that switched. That means that you and I can communicate with each other, like a cell phone in our heads. If you think the question, I'll be able to send you back an answer and vice versa. That means if you're in an unfamiliar situation you can ask me for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds easy enough.\" You say in your new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for rules. You have to do everything the person would normally do. You have to talk the same, act the same, and do all the same things. We're all taking a risk letting you in our lives, so don't screw everything up for us. You have to do everything.\" As she said this, she winked at the others and giggled. You didn't know what it meant. \"You inherit the physical skills of the body, and the talking style. You'll know how to walk in heels and even dance like I can. You just have to come up with the words yourself. We're going to go home now, and let you do what you want. Your cell phone is on the dresser, look there for your schedule. Remember to be on time for school tomorrow. In the closet, school clothes are on the left, other clothes on the right. Everything is in outfits, so just pick an outfit and wear everything there. See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, and Rachel in your body all leave for the night. You head over to the closet to look for pyjamas. You slip off the bra and panties and exchange them for a t-shirt and shorts. But you got down to what you really wanted to do. You started feeling up the body you're in. It's amazing. Whilst getting a bit  lost in the exploration, you don't notice someone knock on the door. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

Bad enough normally but you are currently sporting a very healthy erection, caused by the same girls, already stripped down to their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually now that you've stopped to think about it, is this revised project scope really such a good idea? Trying on items of female clothing has admittedly featured in some of your dreams and fantasies, but actually doing it - and committing yourself to continuing to do so for several weeks - that is perhaps a step too far, especially as you would need to feed back your feelings to a bunch of girls. That could be as embarrassing as wearing the stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure that I want to start quite yet.\" you reply to Rachael. \"I think I ought to check all of the rules and conditions you're adding before going ahead with this.

After all, we have now modified the scope considerably to meet your concerns, and there are four witnesses to your committing to go ahead.\" She then picks up something from the bench that looks like a USB stick. \"And we have recorded everything as well. Do you really want everyone in the school to know that you really want to wear Susan's panties?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair, and besides that's not what I said.\" you respond, now slightly worried that perhaps that is exactly what you had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you have the feeling that you're heading down a dead end, and Rachael is going to keep throwing obstacles in your path until you give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can arrange to take a couple of nice photographs of you here as well if you'd like?

Believe me, we could make this look very bad for you, if that's what you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, hang on a minute!\" you say, realizing that indeed things potentially could look quite good. \"I just said I wanted some time to think about it, and review the rules that you haven't written yet.

I just state the facts as I see them and the natural outcomes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as I see it,\" she continues, \"you don't really have much of a choice. You can either agree to proceed with the project as we have suggested, or face the Head of Year with our complaints and verbal evidence, and then explain to your parents when you are suspended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I... \" you trail off in to silence, realizing that your goose is now cooked, and you seem pretty well tied in to proceed. Blast Rachael - far too devious for her own good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I suggest we all get back to where we were earlier, and make a start on the project? Then we can forget all about any minor disagreements that we may have had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are reluctantly forced to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Rachael says, \"Then we only have to agree on your penalty for causing us all such a scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penalty? Why? I said I'd go ahead..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we don't want you repeating it again, causing us all a lot of worry, and think that there's no repercussions. I think a little penalty might help to keep you focused going forwards... So, ideas please everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looked around the other girls. After a few seconds of thought the responses were announced. \"Wearing make up\", \"two items to be swapped\", \"wearing jewelery\".  \"Ok, all nice ideas girls, thanks girls.

That's in the rules.\" She seems to compose herself a little, and then adds. \"I thought you said earlier that you wanted to swap with Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no.\" you reply, trying to inject an air of innocence in your voice. \"I may have suggested that I quite admired how her boys shorts look on her, but that was certainly not a proposal for a swap.

Somehow the prospect of stripping off in front of these girls is actually of less concern to you now, and you have the feeling that Rachael will actually be more embarrassed than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course!\" Rachael responds, although the tone of her voice and her uncomfortable demeanor suggest otherwise.

Fortunately they were clean on today, although are just a regular pair, blue and black checked cotton, with a single button fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your shirt, leaving you wearing just your boxers, and hold out your hand towards Rachael, as if waiting to receive something from her. \"Shall we start at the top with your bra?\" you ask as sweetly and innocently as you can. \"I may need a little help putting this on though, if that would be OK...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes are now on Rachael, and she is now clearly blushing. You can tell she is now feeling a bit like you were earlier, backed into a corner with nowhere to go. \"Oh alright then.\" she says sharply. And with that she reaches on hand behind her back, unclasps the bra catch, and holds her other hand in from of her bosom to stop the bra falling off. However she realizes that she doesn't have a choice, and holds the bra out towards you, so letting her breasts drop and spread naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you say, taking the bra from her, and so leaving Rachael topless apart from her hands now covering her tits. \"Now if someone could help me to work out how I put this on?\" you say openly to the room. The other girls seemed to have been a bit stunned by the tables being turned somewhat on their Project Leader, and so it's a couple of seconds before one of the others (Louise) responds and comes to help. She shows you where to place your arms, and then clasps the bra behind your shoulders, then tightens the straps for you, so that whilst the cups are empty, it at least fits over your shoulders. You then push down on the cups flattening then as much as you can. \"Don't really need all of this here, so lets see if we can get them to stay flat...\" You are aware that you are probably looking odd and possibly stupid wearing your boxers and Rachael's purple satin bra, but not half as embarrassed as Rachael clearly is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. Bottom halves next!  Would you like to start first, or shall we do this together?\" you ask Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael is standing with her hands still covering her tits, and whilst her blushing has subsided she is still clearly quite embarrassed by her situation, which as you keep reminding yourself, is really of her own making. Whilst awaiting her response you scan her from top to toes, and appreciate that she is quite attractive, although her breasts are no longer quite so pronounced as before, and lie flatter against her body than when supported by her bra. With her hands raised to cover her tits you have a clear view of her purple satin panties, and can clearly see the bulge of her pussy. Hmm, quite nice. She does also have fairly significant thighs, and the thought occurs to you that she may struggle with your boxers, as you are actually slimmer than Rachael, and certainly have slimmer thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes are now on Rachael, waiting either for her action or response. You can see that she is actually getting a bit upset, and she wipes something from one eye. Then she sits heavily on the bench behind her, buries her face in her hands, and blurts out \"No, I can't do this. Not today. I, well I can't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in the room is immediately palatable. Everyone is clearly quite shocked by Rachael's reaction, as, to be honest, are you. However, an idea has now occurred to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK Rachael,\" you say to her, \"if you don't want to continue, that's fine with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you add, trying to make it sound as if an afterthought, \"but that surely means that you have fallen foul of the rules as well, by refusing to accept a swap, after having agreed to it.\" You are aware that you need to be very careful how you phrase this, recognizing that the remaining girls are now listening intently as you challenge their leader, and you will need their support. \"So surely if I must pay a penalty for trying to back out of my commitment, the same rule must apply for anyone else in the project team?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is different.\" Rachael splutters. \"I just can't do this today. I'm not backing out. It's just the wrong day, that's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that's fine then. Oh, hang on, wasn't that what I was asking for earlier? Just a little delay? Well, I think we need to apply the rules consistently, otherwise there's no point in having rules. So I think that the project rules force us to impose a penalty for you. What does everyone else think? Are the rules applicable only to me, or for the project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a bit of muttering around the girls, but they all concede that the rules must apply to the project, and therefore equally to everyone. Rachael stays quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you continue, \"if the rules apply to the project, not an individual, then anyone breaking those rules must incur the same punishment, which as I recall was a penalty taken from suggestions from the project team. So, could I therefore ask for your suggestions please girls as to what Rachael's penalty should be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a hush. Everyone seems afraid to speak. \"If we cannot agree on this point,\" you add, \"then we may as well tear up the rulebook and think of a completely different project, as this one is obviously destined to fail. So, I'll ask again, your suggestions for the penalty please? And appropriate to the situation please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the ideas do actually start. \"Um, Rachael could, um, have a body piercing as well...\", how about she has to wear two items of your clothes for every one of hers you swap...\", \"perhaps going without any make up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that's brilliant girls, thank you.\" you respond. \"However, as this is Rachael's first misdemeanor, I won't make a judgment on her, but let her choose her penalty herself. I do like to be fair about such things. So Rachael, which of these penalties will you accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You would actually be quite relieved to defer the whole thing for a day (or more!) until the rules have been properly defined, but with the current pressure now on Rachael, you are actually equally keen to continue. The prospect of wearing satin panties under your school uniform is definitely appealing as a fantasy fulfillment, but the additional prospect of making life awkward for Rachael, and particularly the thought of seeing Rachael squeezing her butt into your boxers - and have to wear than for the next day (or possibly longer!) makes the continuation of the project somewhat more desirable for you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sod it!\" Rachael exclaims.\"It's not fair catching a girl on the wrong day in the month, but I'm not going to give in and cancel the project, so it seems I have no choice.\"  However, rather than doing what you had anticipated, and remove her panties, she instead picks up her blouse, and proceeds to put it on and button it through, and so covering her breasts. \"Right then.\" she says, and grabs either side of her panties, pulls them down her legs, and then sits down, holding her legs tight together. She then holds her panties out towards you. \"If it's a swap you want, a swap you'll get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK. so the pressure is back on you then. You take the panties from Rachael, and before you stop to think about it  pull down your boxers, and as rapidly as you can you pull on the satin panties instead. Years of practice changing quickly in the boys changing room has enabled you to complete the whole change within about 3 seconds, and the girls would have had to have been damn sharp to have seen much. Once you have the panties on you let out a little sigh of relief, knowing that at least the worst is now over. They actually fit quite well, They are elasticated around the waistband, so despite you having a slightly slimmer waist that Rachael, they are quite snug, but there is ample room to accommodate everything inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you are now in matching purple satin bra and briefs instead of your boxers, which you hold out for Rachael. Whilst you are tempted to look at your reflection in a mirror, you decide that can wait until you're home, so you put on your shirt, and pull on your pants. Meanwhile Rachael also manages to pull on your boxers and, as you had predicted, they are very snug around her upper thighs, and you feel the waistband is stretching more than when you were wearing them. Rachael also gets dressed again so that visibly you both look as you did before, albeit Rachael not having quite the fullness of her breast that she did previously, and her breasts showing definite signs of wobbling as she moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your own feeling are sort of mixed - a bit of intrigue and excitement at getting a piercing, but also a bit of concern at what you mates may say - or even your mom. However, it would nearly always be hidden under a shirt, so she'd never see it anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the five of you make your way to the studio, which is only about half a mile from school. As you walk along you are quite conscious of Rachael's satin panties, as they are more elasticated than your boxers, and you can feel them pulling slightly as you walk. Inevitably you are also aware of the bra, or rather the straps over your shoulders and across your back, and the cups are effectively empty. Not quite what you ever had in mind when fantasizing about wearing girls undies - walking along with four girls, including one wearing <i>your</i> boxers and no bra!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the studio. This not only caters for piercings of all types, but also tattoos, and they have a shop front with a huge variety of body decorations. Louise confirms the request for two navel piercing, and Rachael and you are both asked to lie on two adjacent beds, and loosen your clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl in her early twenties approaches. \"Hi guys. So you both want navel piercings then, yeah? OK so what you want - BCR, barbell or banana? We always use titanium for these. Oh, and you'll get an aftercare kit to keep it clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief debate the agreement is for barbells. The girl sits down, and lays out a number of tools on the desk beside the beds. \"OK, who's first?\" Well, she's actually sitting next to you, so you volunteer. \"OK, could you loosen your belt please and just undo your waist band?\" You do so, which inevitably then reveals the top of Rachael's purple satin panties underneath. You lie as still as you can, although it is actually a couple of minutes before she actually gets the needle ready, and after a sharp sting you realize it's all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, just stay put for a few minutes, and I'll do your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can do matching tattoos as well if you're really that keen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to protect again when Louise indicates to you to shut up. \"Just let her get on with Rachael's piercing before she backs out.\" she says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it may be prudent to shut up, and indeed the assitant starts attending to Rachael, and you watch as she repeats the same process that you had, and within a couple more minutes Rachael has a matching barbell in her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are. A nice matching pair. Make sure you keep them clean. Anything else you want, you know where we are. Oh, and try to keep your clothes loose over them for a couple of days.

For the first time you reach you hand up to feel the breasts. Blimey, they're really quite soft to touch, and they do actually fill out Rachael's bra quite well. OK, perhaps they may be alright to use later in the project if you ever decide to go all the way with this cross dressing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, back to the present.

Well this is stupid - you came in wearing your school uniform, so surely it must still be here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to look around until the assistant has finished, and all of the girls are now sporting barbells in their navels. \"Looks like a nice matching set of girlfriends then.\" the assistant says.

Whilst certainly not ideal, you didn't fancy the idea of wearing a skirt. You then grab your backpack from the floor just before being ejected through the door, and within moments you're standing outside the studio with the four girls, and the assistant has locked up the studio and legged it towards the bus stop. You look down at yourself and realize that perhaps this wasn't the best choice - the cropped top is padded out nicely by Rachael's bra and the false breasts, and then cuts off mid way down your stomach leaving your navel - and your new barbell -  in plain sight.  The jeans - you have now decided white really isn't your color - are tight even on you and definitely more suited to a girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Rachael says, \"I must admit that I hadn't anticipated that you'd end up dressed as a girl quite so quickly. Something of a strange twist of events there I'm afraid. What are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Go home I suppose, and get out of this stuff. Not sure what my mom will say about me turning up dressed entirely as a girl mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd offer to let you come back to my place to change, but I've only got girls clothes there, so guess that wouldn't actually help much.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all start walking away from the piercing studio, and you catch sight of your reflection in a window. Oh blimey. From the next down you could probably be mistaken for a girl, but your hair is too short and definitely not in a girl's style, so the combination looks a bit odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Amy asks as she notices your expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope nobody I know sees me like this. I couldn't pretend to be either a boy or a girl at the moment - I just look like the wrong bits of each stuck together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could do something about your hair if you want, to make it look more girlie, and with a touch of makeup you could probably pass as a girl. May make you a bit less self conscious until you get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then I end up at home dressed as a girl AND wearing makeup. I'm not sure if that's an improvement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either than or you don't go home tonight but stay with one of us.\" Susan says. \"You wouldn't need to worry about your mom seeing you then - and you could go home tomorrow during the day to get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that could be a brilliant idea!\" Rachael interjects. \"You could hang out with us this evening and get used to the clothes, and then get back to normal tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. I'd have to tell her I'm staying out, and not sure if she'd trust me staying with a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly. You don't have to tell her you're staying with one of us - it could be one of your mates. She's not likely to check, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what will you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Perhaps the conversation may be a bit different! Tell you what - why don't we get you really looking like a girl now - then none of your friends would recognize you, and you might feel a bit less less self conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where - you can't do anything here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, silly, there's a coffee shop just around the corner. It's quiet this time in the afternoon, so we shouldn't be disturbed. Then we can tidy your hair up, and get a bit of make up on you. On the way you can think of what you'll say to your mom.

You just want to blend in, and to be honest don't really mind if you blend in as a boy or a girl, provided nobody notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the coffee shop, and drop your backpack by a table. You open the side pocket and pull out your phone, and call you mom.  \"Hi mom. Look, I won't be coming home tonight, I'll be staying over with a friend...  Yeah, it's all to do with a new project with the Humanities Department...    No, I'll be staying with one of the project group tonight...

They sort everything out, and then Louise and Susan set to work on your hair while Rachael goes to get some drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start by combing through your hair then applying some of the lotions, then spraying different bits. \"OK, that's probably OK for now.\" Susan says. \"May not be ideal but at least it's definitely not a boy's style.

Your hair is now not only styled, but has streaks of color, and lightly brushed across then sprayed into place. Meanwhile your face has been transformed with eye shadow,  darkened and significantly fatter eyelashes, blusher, and lipstick.

This is from Rachael, suggesting you meet up at lunchtime to review the project scope, although to your surprise she has proposed meeting in the bookshop in the mall, rather than in the school.  No doubt wants a quieter surroundings to think out the options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning passes, and finally the bell chimes for lunch break, so you gather up your books, stuff them in your locker, and head across the road towards the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the bookshop and go inside, and are a little surprised that none of the girls are there. OK, guess you got there quite promptly, so you reckon they're all slauntering there a bit slower than you had. The man behind the counter asks if you're looking for anything in particular, and you explain that you're waiting for someone, so only browsing at the moment. However, rather than letting you wander around the shop he seems intent of keeping your attention and starts talking about the different books they stock, and that he is interested in clocks and watches, and then wants to show you some of his collection. First he shows you the big grandfather clock in the corner of the shop,, and then pulls out a pocket watch from his waistcoat pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at the intricate metal work on this. It's really exquisite.\" Well, you try to look, but he keeps jiggling it about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you just keep it still for a minute so that I can see it?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, my lad. Hang on there.\" He then holds it dangling by the chain. Whilst it's swinging gently, at least you are able to focus on the watch and try to study and appreciate the details he seems so excited about. Funny thing is that you do find it quite interesting and are desperately trying to follow the watch with your eyes. Meanwhile you're aware he's saying something to you, but you really cannot make out what, and somehow it's getting harder and harder maintaining your focus and concentration on the watch. If only he'd keep it still. You open your mouth to say something, but you cannot think what you want to say, and then your mind seems to stop working, and you become oblivious to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the bookstore owner is talking to you, but your consciousness hears nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches into a pocket for his phone, makes a short call, and puts it away again. A few minutes later the door at the rear of the bookshop opens, and Rachael walks in. \"Hi Uncle Harry! Wow, it really worked - you have Tony completely hypnotized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but as I said you need to be sensible about what you want him to do or it really won't work. It's like getting someone to give up smoking - it really only works if they want to. The hypnosis just reinforces what the persons wants. So you won't be able to get Tony to do anything that he really hates, but it can help push him towards something he might want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rings in the store. \"Excuse me, I'd better take that. Now, he's all yours, just remember to click your fingers for him to wake up once your done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Uncle Harry. I did help you when we hypnotized my ex-boyfriend last year, so I remember what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I hope you won't repeat that chicken fiasco again. I wasn't surprised he dumped you after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael turns to you, as you remain motionless and mentally blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then Tony.

Over the course of the next week you will gradually but increasingly come to belieive that you are not a boy, but a girl born into a boy's body, and you will change your behaviors to reflect your belief that you are really a girl, and your desire to fully become what you know you are inside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I click my fingers you will awake. You will remember coming to the bookshop and meeting with me here, and you will remember me saying that we accept your reluctance to take part in the project, but will keep the option open to you if you change your mind in the future. You will want to remain part of the project group and will feel able to confide totally with all of the group. You will return to school, happy and contented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if you ever hear me say the word 'disassociate' then you will immediately return to the same hypnotic trace that you are in now, and await for any further instructions. If you ever hear me say the phrase 'clean sweep' then you will revert to your normal state of mind, and no longer have any thoughts that you are a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rachael snaps her fingers, and within an instant your consciousness returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without a pause for breath Rachael continues, but this time in her normal conversational speech. \"I hope you're OK with that Tony. It's a shame, but we can appreciate your point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind seems a bit sluggish, although you can remember having a conversation with Rachael about the project. \"Um, yeah, right.

Susan pipes up with her observation on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure how we are going to be able to make a worthwhile compilation of behavioral reactions given this turn of events. The original concept was to measure impacts on a person living as the opposite gender, which involved us having a boy dressing and living as a girl. If we continue with Tony - sorry, Antonia dressing as a girl when he, um she, believes herself to be a girl, it sort of negates the whole concept. I'm not really sure how well our project would stand up to scrutiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, surely we can still adapt the scope to match the situation?\" Rachael responds, clearly not expecting any adverse feedback to her plan. \"After all, we are still looking for Antonia to be dressing completely differently to before, so he, um she, will still be potentially acting differently based on the clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no. As a boy he dressed as a boy.  Now that he believes he's a girl, he wants to dress as a girl, so there's no adverse behaviors to compare, and certainly trying to determine if a boy would start behaving as a girl by being dressed as a girl would be impossible, as he already thinks he is a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry if I've changed since we last discussed this, but as I recall we only had one shot at putting together the project scope which you all agreed matched the brief. I just want to carry on with the project now. Can't we somehow adapt the rules?\" you ask, looking your best to look vulnerable and incite some sympathy. The thought that they may deny you the chance to borrow some of their clothes is something you don't even want to consider. \"Pleeeeease!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, with a bit of effort you get them on, struggling a little with the rear zipper, but then complete the task. The satin top is simplicity itself by comparison. You emerge from the changing room to face Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is delectable. It suits you perfectly!\" she says, boosting your confidence no end. She really is a brilliant friend. She continues. \"Why don't you try on some different shoes - there's a nice pair of sandal here that could match.

Obviously their shape necessitates them to wear bras, but why is girls' stuff always softer and smoother and tighter fitting, and somehow sexier, um no, nicer?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you happen to be outside a shop that could well start to answer some of these questions, and you realize that you're quite interested in finding out. Actually you realize you're<i> incredibly</i> interested in finding out more about girls' clothes, which you know is a bit odd, but you reckon your subconscious is trying to work out an alternative scope for the project - obviously avoiding you having to cross-dress - so you're happy enough to run with the feeling for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you step inside and have a look around. Despite being promoted as a swimwear shop there is quite a range of different clothing inside, ranging from swimsuits and bikinis, halter tops and shorts, beach dresses and romper suits, all the way through to a range of footwear and jewelery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the female section - actually the bigger part of the store - and start to browse around, feeling some of the materials and admiring the colors and patterns, and increasingly wonder what some of these things would feel like when worn. You assume the softer material would be equally soft on the skin, although you know that merely feeling with your fingers is not a true reflection of how something would feel for real. You're also a bit fascinated by bras. Not why girls wear them, as that's obvious, but what it feels like having something wrapped around just your chest, which seems a bit weird really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes looking around you look up to find one of the shop assistants in front of you. She's in her late teens and you notice she's wearing a purple tee shirt with the store's logo over a pair of sporty gray leggings, with the store's name and logo emblazoned down the side, and a pair of flat sandals.You can just make out the outline of her bra strap through the material of the tee and wonder what color bra she's wearing, and if she has matching panties...  You suddenly stop, and are instantly horrified by what you've just be thinking.What the heck are you doing? Why do you care what color underwear she has? What has gotten into you? You try to pull your thoughts together and hope she didn't notice you scanning her clothes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you, and ask you a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. Can I help you at all? Is there anything particular you're looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. You can't say you're just suddenly interested in looking at girls clothes. That would be just pervy.  You'll have to come up with something a bit more viable, and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi. No, not really, thanks.

Um, everything I can really...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. So I'm not sure if looking around here will really help that much.

You can see the same assistant serving a customer at the checkout. You wait for a few minutes until she is free, glancing around the store. There are only a couple of people browsing around, and subconsciously you study their clothes. There's a mother with a young child. She's wearing a blue dress with a daisy pattern. It has short sleeves with white cuffs, and reaches just above her knees. There's also a teenage girl wearing a red tee and gray shorts, with leather ankle boots, which you feel aren't really appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what you're doing, and again have to stop yourself, and try to work out why you're checking out their clothing. You have anything against checking out girls, but you seemed to be more closely focused on their clothes.

On the top is a sheet of paper with the store's header and what appears to be a handwritten checklist, and an invoice with everything marked with their original retail prices, but with an equivalent discount giving a total due of zero. Nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking through this you can see dozens of items listed covering the breadth of what the store sells, and with their original retail prices listed totaling several hundred dollars. Blimey. Lets just hope this is of use in determining a new project scope, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig down into the bag and start pulling things out. A couple of things have labels attached, which you scan. Hmm, one item has a missing button, another has something missing, so potentially faulty. Others have nothing attached, so presumably just surplus stock. OK, what have you got? A range of swimsuits and bikinis, some shorts and tops, a couple of jumpsuits, some underwear (you hadn't even noticed they sold that in the store), and even some jewelry \u2013 albeit costume jewelry suitable for the beach, so quite chunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take out each item you look it over and feel it carefully, without realizing it almost caressing it, and you're finding the whole experience quite exhilarating. You sort everything into different piles, based on the type of clothing, and sizes. Some is definitely for younger girls, but the majority of stuff sized for teenagers or above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so now that you've gone through this all, how will this be able to recalibrate the project scope? Hmm, you're struggling to work out a solution to that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever,  a thought strikes you...</span></div></div>",

Not that you're particularly large, but certainly needing more capacity than a girl would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a swimsuit that seems to have a bit of a skirt as part of the design. Well, even if it hasn't any greater capacity in the crotch area, it may look at bit better. Maybe that will do for starters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/bd/1c/e2bd1c0129d7655dcc81007394265f68.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/bd/1c/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the size, which you think is OK, although it does look a bit on the small size crumpled up in your hand... Oh well, there's only one way to find out. You strip off what you're wearing, dumping everything in a pile on the floor. Then you put on the swimsuit, although find it's totally different to anything you own, or have tried on before. You put your feet in first and pull the swimsuit all the way up around your body, and then loop the neck-strap around your neck. Well, whilst it was a bit snug pulling it up, it seems quite stretchy, and once on it does seem big enough and isn't uncomfortable at all, although perhaps a little tighter than you're used to around the crotch, and a bit weird covering your chest with a lot of your back left bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if this is typical of girlswear, or just swimwear, but it does feel quite soft, and the material is quite flexible. Whilst clearly designed for a girl with boobs it actually seems to fit you OK without surplus material at the front, which you'd half expected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your reflection in the mirror. OK, not quite as stupid as you'd thought. A bit like a short dress really. So, a couple of points to note here... You are actually more impressed by the swimsuit than your expected, and it really does seem softer and definitely more elastic and flexible than your clothes. It also reconfirms your view that you won't be cross-dressing for the project. You look like a boy in a dress, or rather a boy in a swimsuit. To look like a girl you'd have to be a different shape for a start \u2013 even the flattest of the girls in your year have a significantly more prominent chest than you have. Mind you, you're marginally impressed that your legs don't look too stupid, as the short skirt of the swimsuit seems to make your legs look quite long and slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so test one completed, and the result is that there is a definite and distinct difference between boys' and girls' swimwear \u2013 well, based on a sample of one, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now? You still can't work out how this could enable you to alter the project scope based on the materials used and how the clothes feel. May be there could be something in the way they make you look \u2013 would a different outfit also make your legs look slimmer? Hmm. Guess you could try something different, and see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the clothing strewn around you. OK, so there is a playsuit there, which is definitely a different material to the swimsuit, or a short sun dress. Either of those could be contenders... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She apologizes for not seeing you at lunchtime. Something cropped up, apparently. Hmm. She tells you she's been looking for options to change the scope of the project to suit you better, but so far hasn't found a viable alternative. Before you have a chance to reiterate your objection to the existing scope she does at least ask if you've had any better luck, so at least she's not yet ruling out a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm working on an idea I had.\u201d you explain. \u201cI think we're stuck with a scope that involves genders and clothing, but I was wondering if we could change the scope to look at why girls and boys clothes are made of different materials and constructed and styled differently, and potentially what impacts that might have on someone wearing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, OK.\u201d Rachael replies, and you notice the skepticism in her voice. \u201cSo have you worked out how this would work as a project yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d you respond, \u201cI've only just starting comparing different materials and styles, and so far I haven't worked out how that could evolve into a project scope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Well, you don't need to do this all on your own, you know. We have the group of us ready to start, so we could all pool ideas and try to develop this idea with you... I think it would be good if we all got together. It sounds like you may have something we could work with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at your reflection in the mirror again, and decide that getting together with the others in the group involved at this precise moment would not be a good idea, as if they saw you now they'd immediate stick with their original idea of you cross-dressing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.

Oh, yes, you were considering either the playsuit or the beach dress. Guess with either of them you'd better put on underwear first. You undo the neck strap of the swimsuit, and pull this down, realizing that you almost have to unpeel it to get it off your body. Well, you'll never had to do this with anything before, perhaps with the exception of a wet suit once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the beach dress. That really ought be worn with underwear, unlike the swimsuit. You reach for your boxers again to put them back on, but stop and think. It would really be a bit silly putting on your own underwear to assess the feel of the dress \u2013 you really should put on girls underwear - despite this being contrary to everything you'd been saying to Rachael.  Never mind. You need to complete this comparison to see if you can change the scope of the project, and, besides, you're really quite interested in checking out these different materials and styles. You look around to where you'd put the underwear from the store to select something to try. Actually, you want to put on a bra. You're not sure why, but you really want to try on a bra. Now. As soon as you set your eyes on a bra you have an almost desperate urge to put it on. You grab the bra on top of the pile, which (fortunately) you'd previously checked for sizing and pull it on. It's a slip on type, so putting it on is as easy as pulling on a tee. You notice it doesn't really have much shaping as you'd expected, and sits comfortably on your chest. It seems you'd selected a girls sports bra with no defined cups, designed primarily for overall support. Whilst feeling a bit weird its actually really comfortable, and you suddenly feel a lot happier. You then select the matching panties and pull them on.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/a1/06/b5a106d4264f39ccdec572a9b50e5a6b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/a1/06/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you're actually getting a bit of a buzz out of this, and have to check out your reflection again. OK, a bit weird definitely. A bit tighter or snugger fitting than your own clothes, so they do feel different - but really comfortable. So, why do some women complain at wearing a bra? This feels really quite good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drag your thoughts back to the task in hand \u2013 trying on the dress. You pick up the beach dress, and put this on like a long tee shirt, head first, then arms, and let it drop down around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/83/e8/be83e822f7be015c60884ba1a8729ad8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/83/e8/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material seem to float rather than fall down, and where it touches your skin it feels soft and silky. Wow. This really is getting somewhere. Yes, based on your limited, um, research, you are definitely concluding there are significant differences between boys and girls clothing, and girls clothes do have nicer clothes and they feel nicer to wear. But how does this fit in to the project? You're still not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance again at your reflection, but this time are a bit more taken by what you see. Whilst the bra was quite snug the dress seems to have given you a bit more of what you'd consider a girls shape. It has definite styling, pulling in slightly at the waist, then giving the impression of slightly wider hips and a slight shape to the chest. And you realize the silky material of the dress is really quite, um, sexy. Well, the underwear is really comfortable, and the dress is, you have to admit, really nice, so if you were a girl you know what you'd want to wear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what now? You still have a stack of clothes here to do something with, and somehow need to review and amend the project scope so that you don't have to spend the rest of the semester dressed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have a final look in the mirror before you pull off the mermaid beach dress, and fold it, dropping it on the end of your bed. Then you reach down to pull off the panties when a thought occurs to you. Actually the bra and panties are incredibly comfortable and you see no reason why you can't keep them on for now. For some reason you like wearing the bra, and want to keep it on. So you just pull on a shirt and shorts over the top of them. There. No visible sign, and you feel really happy that you still have the bra on, although you know that's a bit silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the clothing you load up into the drawers in your closet, where you know they'll be safe.

But now you need to get ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the bathroom and have a shower, and then pad back wrapped in a towel to sort out what you'll wear for school. You pull open a couple of drawers in your closet revealing some of the girls underwear laid on top of your own. Well, technically its just underwear, so its as good there as anywhere... You rummage down to find a pair of your boxers, but pull out a pair of panties by mistake. Hmm, if you can find the matching bra, that might be a goer, you contemplate, getting a bit of a buzz remembering how they were so comfortable yesterday. Actually, against your better judgment, you feel you'd like to wear a bra again. It really did feel nice, and, well, under your clothes nobody would ever know. You know you shouldn't, and know it contravenes what you consider to be your highest principles, but you continue to find the matching bra to the panties nevertheless, and put them both on.

True to her word, the other girls are there too (Susan, Amy and Louise), so that you can share your idea for the change to the project scope. So you start to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so my understanding is that we need a topic related to either sociological or psychological attitudes or behaviors. Because of what was suggested at the beginning of the week we seem to be stuck with something related to clothes. What I'm thinking is we look at the differences in the materials used, and the styles of clothing for the different genders, and why they are different, in other words why the types of clothes and their styles are so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Susan chips in, \"I get that, but it doesn't cover off the key requirement which is looking at the sociological or psychological impacts. The, um, previous scope was for one person to take the role of the opposite gender to seen what the impacts are.  How do you propose we assess the impacts of the historic development of clothing for different genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, I must admit I got a bit stuck there, but I thought we may be able to incorporate some styling changes into the school uniform, and see how the changes are accepted, or not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So potentially we get the school to sponsor a wholesale design change to the school uniform, incorporating gender specific elements, and then assess who like the changes?  Somehow I can't see the Head agreeing to that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you really hadn't thought this through terribly well is starting to worry you now. It seemed quite straightforward as you considered it last night. But you hadn't reckoned on them arguing about it..  You attempt to continue.  \"Well, not exactly changing the design, but changing some of the uniform rules so that gender specific items are no longer mandatory, or maybe different items are made mandatory instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I'm getting it.\" Rachael says. \"So the rules changes, so girls don't have to wear a black skirt and white knee high socks, but could wear pants instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it!\" you reply, relieved that perhaps this idea may work. \"So not redesigning the uniform, just changing how it's used...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so which rules do you suggest are changed? They're got to be gender specific ones to fit your scope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise now chips in \"Oh, so you mean any rule specifically targeted on one or the other gender could be up for grabs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, potentially yes,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it wouldn't really work if it was optional, would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, everyone knows how reluctant people are to change, so given a choice of sticking to the existing gender specific rules, or optionally changing to something else, the vast majority would stay with what they know. That's a fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rachael says, \"you mean this would only work if the changes were mandatory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yes.\" Louise responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't go so far as to swap uniforms entirely.\u201d Rachael replies. \u201cThere are some boys I would definitely not want to see wearing a skirt and knee high socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't thinking about a total swap!\" you jump in. You realize that would be even worse than the original scope, by making the entire school cross-dress, with you doubtless getting the blame for it. Besides, it would definitely not be accepted by the school.  \"I was thinking we would only impose small changes and then assess how well they're accepted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK. I see.\" Rachael replies. \"So we start by introducing a mandatory uniform change that, I don't know, all girl must wear boy's boxer shorts instead of panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, that's the sort of thing, I guess.\" you respond, not really sure if that's what you meant or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if that works OK,\" Rachael continues, \"the next rule could be that all boys must wear a bra. I'm not sure how well that would go down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe....\" You're well aware that you're wearing a bra now. Whilst you clearly don't want to admit that to the girls, it's so comfortable that you can't see why any boys wouldn't want to wear one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so I think this will need a bit more work before we can realistically present it for approval. We'll need to draw up a list of gender specific rules first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like boys aren't allowed to have their hair reaching their shoulders?\" Amy asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or wear make-up.\" Louise says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so our time is up for now.\" Rachael says, clearly trying to bring the meeting to a close. Let's all work on Tony's idea and meet up again later and see if we can work out a clearer scope?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agrees, and you get set to leave. \"Oh, Tony, just before you go,\" Rachael says, \"could I just have a quick word?\"  The other girls leave, with only Rachael and you remaining. She starts speaking.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well Tony, I'm glad you've been thinking about the scope, although I'm not yet convinced this idea would be accepted by the school. I think the idea is for us to manage everything within the team, rather than involving the whole school, so I could see we could have a challenge there... What would you feel about reducing the scope to include just the team, rather than the whole school?  I do think you may have hit on a good idea and I'm sure we could make it work with a bit of tweaking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so Rachael is basically agreeing to a change to the scope so that you're not forced to cross-dress. OK, you know the revised scope you've basically cobbled together isn't perfect, but you've managed to persuade them to adopt a change so you won't be forced to wear girls clothes - although to be honest your view on that has been changed a bit after you tried on the bra and panties yesterday and found them so comfortable. But you're only wearing them now because you want to, not because you're being told to. There's a difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that would make sense,\u201d you reply. \u201cI guess it was a bit ambitious thinking we could get the whole school involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo based on what you suggested earlier we could introduce mandatory rules for specific members of the team, so for starters that the girls wear boxers instead of panties...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... \u201c you reply, temporarily imagining Rachael wearing boxers under her school uniform skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues. \u201cSo, Susan would need to observe and record any impacts, so how the person involved feels about it, and how this affects them and anyone around them. OK, so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo after that we move onto a different change, so for example the boys in the team have to wear a bra.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm, right. \u201cYeah, that's basically what we said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you're OK with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d You are suddenly very conscious of the bra that you have on under your uniform, although confident that it cannot be seen. Are you OK with wearing a bra - well, yes. Despite all of your previous prejudices and worries about wearing girls clothes, you really like wearing the bra - but you're clearly not going to tell Rachael that...  \u201cI guess if its part of what we agree then I wouldn't have an issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so from the original scope that we discussed what was your primary issue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, me having to cross-dress and pretend to be a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're OK if we select specific items to swap or change for members of the team, like the boxers or bra, or perhaps other thing gender related things we agree on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the girls in the project team wearing boxers, or possibly going without a bra, seems like a positive move for you. And for you to have to wear a bra? Well, you are already, and somehow it doesn't seem such a big deal now, so potentially its a no-brainer...  \u201cYes, that sounds OK.\u201d        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then. Thanks. I just wanted to be sure I understood your idea for the project...   By the way...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've often wondered about make-up, and wonder what it would be like to have on. Now that its your project scope, you want to take the lead role, so whatever change is agreed you'll want to try it first. Oh, and each time a new change is suggested you'll get a buzz, and want to include it in scope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicks her fingers to bring you back to consciousness again, and as you wake up, she finishes the sentence that she hadn't really started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I'm proud of you, and glad I'm on the same team as you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're aware that you were somehow not quite listening to Rachael, but not why, and assume you had just tuned out momentarily.  \u201cUm, yeah, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo catch up later on, OK?\u201d Rachael says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah, sure. Um, just one thing...\u201d You know there's something you want to say, but cannot quite grasp it. Oh yes, someone mentioned make-up earlier, which was a bit beyond what you'd been considering for the project, being primarily focused on clothing. You've never really thought about make-up but now that the subject has been raised, you are suddenly quite interested in what it's like to wear. \u201cSomeone mentioned other, um, gender related rules aside from clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I think Louise mentioned something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I see no reason why we need to limit the scope to just clothes, so guess we can add some other things.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's your scope now, so if you want to include other things then I guess you can.\u201d  Rachael picks up her bag. \u201cSo, perhaps we could include make-up as one of the gender related rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel weirdly excited about what Rachael has just suggested. \"Yes, definitely!\" you reply without hesitation, realizing this fits in with what you were just thinking yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later then.\u201d And with that Rachael leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school you decide not to go straight home, but instead head to the mall. After your success yesterday in the swimwear store, and what you think is your new idea to extend the scope beyond just clothing, you're keen to look for any new options and maybe investigate a bit more about what make-up is. You know you could ask your mom, but somehow that doesn't feel right. After all she's older so wouldn't understand what you're trying to do. You wonder around and notice a beauty salon. Hmm, not the sort of place you would ever have considered even looking at before, but somehow you're drawn to it. It's quite empty \u2013 guess you've hit on a quiet time of day, or something... Well, you decide to go in and see what you can find out - and if you manage to get a couple of samples, then all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of entering the salon you are approached by a girl who you estimate to be in her mid-twenties who asks if you need any help. Deciding that the open and honest approach is probably the best you explain that you're from the high school and involved in a project, and you're trying to find out a bit more about make up \u2013 admitting that as a boy you have no knowledge of the subject at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant looks around, and realizing the salon is actually totally empty of clients, she invites you to sit at one of the manicure desks. For the next 3 or 4 minutes she explains to you the key components of make-up, what they're for and when they're used. Despite your past indifference to the subject you are now quite fascinated and hang on to her every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shows you a few of the powders and lotions they use in the salon, applying small amounts to the back of your hand, so you can see the effect that each of them would have. However she also explains that some make-up is virtually invisible, and can act as a protective layer for the skin hardly changing the appearance at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you use lip balm in the summer?\u201d She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, yes, of course...\u201d you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you're already using make-up! It's just that that one is invisible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. You hadn't even considered that.  So, technically you're already using make-up? OK, so you're even more interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ever use a moisturizer on your face, that's also technically make-up \u2013 although that is a bit different as it's absorbed by the skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you reply. \u201cI'd never thought of it like that. I always thought it was what girls put on to cover their spots and blemishes and, well, make them look prettier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there's that side of it as well, of course. Mind you, it isn't only girls who wear make up \u2013 some men do as well, although not so much.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, OK. But not proper men \u2013 you mean, um...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I do mean proper men. Yes, there are some bisexuals and so on, but even straight normal guys do sometimes wear make-up \u2013 just not the same stuff as girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues. \"Look, it's gone pretty quiet here now. Would it be helpful if....\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For some reason you're getting quite a buzz of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes, that would be great. If its no trouble of course... although, can you stick to the invisible stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries.\u201d She indicates another chair, facing a mirror on the wall \u2013 to your mind a bit like a barber's chair. \u201cCome and sit over here, then you can see what I'm doing.\u201d You move across and sit down again. She then pulls a cape over you, covering your clothes up to your neck, exactly as if you were having a hair cut. You then notice they do hair styling here as well. Perhaps not the time to ask about that though. Let's just take this one step at a time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant cleans you face, and carefully cleans around your eyes, applies what she refers to as BB cream to your face, and a different balm under your eyes, gently blending each in with a little sponge. This is followed by CC, which she explains is color correcting \u2013 although with a color that matches your natural skin tone, which effectively makes it invisible, or modifying your natural color to one that is better.  You then realize that some spots on your face  have disappeared, and the redness around your eyes has reduced. Actually you're quite impressed. She finishes off with eye liner and a balm on your lips. You realize that you don't suddenly look like a girl or anything, but you still look like you, only somehow cleaner and you have to admit  actually nicer. Actually this is quite good, and you're feeling really quite buoyant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou express your appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo worries. Happy to help. As I said it's dead in here now, so happy to keep busy doing something anyway, and this makes a change from doing manicures and pedicures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's like putting on nail varnish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and no.\u201d she replies. \u201cYou really don't know much about it, do you? No, it's not just putting on nail varnish, but the whole process of cleaning, filing, buffing and clipping to have near perfect condition nails, and then adding a base coat, neutral polish, three layers of color polish and two layers of topcoat - which is an additional layer more than other salons. After that they're not only shiny and beautiful, but chip resistant and long lasting...   Oh, sorry. I got a bit carried away there. Obviously the color and shiny finish would be for girls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes. Right.\u201d you reply, trying to dispel the thought of you having your finger nails treated in that way. Hmm, maybe a clear non-shiny option would be preferable if you were ever to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide its probably time to go - potentially before you end up having anything more done to you - although you must admit the make-up does look far better than you'd ever expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, thanks for your time and help.\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, no worries.\" Then, after a short pause, the girl continues. \"Before you leave...\" </span></div></div>",

Checking your watch you realize you should be heading home now, so despite wanting to stay in the mall and try to check out any other stores that may provide some insight or information to help with the project, you reluctantly head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way you give some thought to what's been happening. It was only three days ago you were put into the humanities project team and subjected to the embarrassment of the suggestion that you'd be the focus of the project and have to cross-dress and pretend to be a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then you've managed to change the focus of the project to cover the entire team, or at least some of the team, but at least you no longer have to cross-dress. Instead both you and the girls (although you realize you're not entirely sure which ones are actually being included...) will try wearing different gender related items of clothes or other things \u2013 like the make-up, to determine the gender related differences, and breaking the accepted gender rules makes you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the back of this you've progressed your research well. You've determined there are distinct material and styling differences between boys and girls clothing, and that girls clothes are (so far at least) softer and nicer than boys clothes, and despite your original perceptions, bras are <i>really</i> nice to wear. You know that doesn't really make sense, but that's what you now know. At least when it comes to you needing to wear girls underwear as one of the project requirements, you know that it wouldn't be an issue. Also, you now know make-up isn't just for making girls look prettier, but serves a sound purpose, and contrary to your original feelings you're actually really happy wearing make-up on - albeit that it's virtually invisible. Yes, somehow your perceptions appear to be changing a bit. Maybe this project isn't all bad then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at home. Your mom is home already and cooking the evening meal. You head for your bedroom, and empty out the bag from the salon onto your bed. Ouch. Yes, the assistant has given you a number of samples, but not just the 'invisible' ones, but a stack of different powders and lotions, and little cylinders, which when you look more closely range from lipsticks to eye liner brushes and mascara wands. Basically she seems to have grabbed a random few handfuls of stuff and thrown them in. Oh well, you could perhaps use the neutral color stuff. The rest you guess you could give to one or more of the girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change out of your school clothes, and put on a tee shirt and pair of shorts, although keeping on the bra and panties, which you are reluctant to give up.

I don't want to pre-judge you or jump to any incorrect assumptions, so perhaps you'll like to tell me whose these are, and why they were in your washing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know full well the options here aren't good. (a) you've had a girlfriend in your room who stripped off and forgot to get dressed again (obviously pretty unlikely as you don't have a girlfriend), or (b) a random girl got changed in your room and left her underwear behind (even less likely) or (c) they're yours  - well, technically true but not really what you want to admit to your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on your past experience of your mom being able to sniff out a lie at 10 paces, you know whatever you say will need to be at least close to the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, those, yes.\u201d you try to say an nonchalantly as possible, \u201cThey're to do with the new humanities project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom gives you a very quizzical look, and you know you'll need to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor humanities we were put into groups and have a project for the semester.

Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we look at any gender related uniform rules that apply at school, make small changes to them and assess how well any changes are accepted.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you're not talking about the whole school here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. Just the project team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so let me guess. You swapped underwear with one of the girls in the project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! We haven't swapped anything. We haven't got as far as that. Those were surplus stock ones that I, we, got from a store in the mall to study.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when were you going to tell me about the project?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to...

Um, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I get the feeling that there's more to this than you're saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't!\" you exclaim. \"It's just a humanities project looking at clothing and its effect on people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said gender related, so basically swapping clothes to see what effects there are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Not swapping. Trying different things to test some of the accepted gender related rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which could include underwear?\"  she wiggles the underwear in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. Potentially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And anything else that could be considered gender specific?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long before you come home dressed entirely as a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" you respond immediately. \"That is not going to happen! This is limited changes only. I'm not going to dress as a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom instantly knows she's struck a raw nerve. \"OK, so who suggested you might?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you're not going to get away without telling her pretty much everything, so you decide to own up to the original scope where they proposed you cross-dressed and pretended to be a girl.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"However, I refused point blank when I realized what they wanted me to do. But by that time the project outline was already submitted based on gender related clothing, so I persuaded them to change the scope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK. Well, good on you for standing your ground. Bet that was hard. I'm not sure how much you've changed the scope though... How many of you are involved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five. Um, there's Rachael, Susan, Louise, Amy, and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. And are you all going to participate in making the changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So how may will be? I guess the project leader won't, and you'll have someone to monitor and record the outcomes..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, I guess. I'm not actually sure of the exact number....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mom smiles her all-knowing smile, and you get the feeling she understands something that you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you happy with the project now, and what you'll be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Now we've ditched the cross-dressing bit it's quite cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mom sighs. OK, interrogation over young man. Next time talk to me sooner. I may have been able to help, although I guess there are some things you'll just need to find out for yourself.\u201d Oh, and someone did a good job with your make-up - nice and subtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh blimey, you'd forgotten about that. \"Um, right., um. Someone offered so I could see what was involved. I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I get the idea Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom reaches out, and pulls you into a hug. \u201cOK. I'll stop now, and let you sort this out for yourself. I can see what's going on. Just make sure you stick with things you're comfortable with, and don't do anything too stupid, and and I won't ask about anything that turns up in your wash basket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that needs a response... \"Um, right. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Dinner time. Dad won't be home 'til later so it's just you and me sweetie.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've now worn both of the trainer bra sets in your size, so are slightly flummoxed. Do you stick with the same style but in a smaller size or swap to a different style. There's something in your size but the bra seems a bit thicker and more shaped, with more distinct straps. You look at the label. Its says its a padded bra. What the heck's that? You're tempted to put it one, but you're a bit concerned the extra thickness may be visible underneath your school uniform. Alternatively you could stick with the trainer bra style, but a bit tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you could revert to wearing just your boxer shorts as you used to - although you're not sure if you'd cope with that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you chose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You opt for the padded bra, and pull it on. This one takes a bit more work as it has a clasp at the back that you need to do up. Actually there isn't a lot of padding. You'd initially assumed it would be padded to give the impression of bigger boobs, but the reality is it's just sufficient to smooth out and hide any bumps - like your nipples, and so you reckon it all lies flat enough not to be noticeable. The matching panties are a bit shorter than the previous ones, so a bit less like shorts and more like, well, like panties. However you notice the material is different - these feel even smoother and silkier. You check yourself in your mirror to make sure everything looks right before putting on your shirt and pants, and getting ready. At no point does it occur to you that there's anything odd about what you're wearing - purely that it's really comfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night you'd sorted out the samples from the beauty salon, and kept out a tiny pot of each of the BB and CC lotions, and a little applicator sponge. Whilst originally you weren't intending to put any on, you reckon a tiny bit could help cover your spots so make you feel a bit more confident when talking to the girls - well, Rachael in particular, who you find a bit bossy. You limit the amount you apply, so you can barely notice it, but nevertheless it now feels like you have a sort of force field in place, so you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the kitchen to grab some breakfast. You mom says good morning, and gives you a swift look over. She tells you she'll be doing some shopping later on, and asks if there's anything you'd like her to get for you. You shrug, and, give her an expression that says you haven't a clue what she's really talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, no problem. I'll just use my own judgment then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a slightly confused state you leave home and head for school. At least today is the last school day of the week, so you can have a lie in tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way you receive a message from Rachael.  Seems the girls have had a few more ideas and want to run them past you. Well, at least they now recognize you're a key player in the project and want to consult you. There's a humanities class later in the day, so you message her back to agree to talk then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progresses you pretty much forget about the underwear you have on. In time the humanities class comes around, and you immediately break into your project groups to discuss progress and next steps. The five of you sit in a group, and Rachael, who you consider the self proclaimed project leader, starts to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she outlines that the girls have been considering the revised scope, and have a few ideas for specific gender related changes that could be included in scope - subject to your agreement. She explains that as it was you who revised the project scope, they felt you should have the final word on what is included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks how you're getting on, knowing that you were previously looking at the different materials and styles used for different genders clothing, and whether you'd be able to identify how this could work in the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have started comparing some the materials used in some different types of clothes, and realized this could have an impact on the wearer, and their perceptions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, that's interesting,\u201d Susan chips in. \u201cSo you think that the clothes themselves might have an impact on the person wearing them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that's right.\u201d your reply. You recall that Susan had studied sociology before, and was supposed to have been the project's observer, logging the results - so would be interested in anything you'd found out. \u201cI've been talking to a few people who work in the industry, and yes, I'm sure that what people wear does have an affect on them, by making them more comfortable and more confident in what they can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so could we develop some specific tests to prove that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, not sure what you'd mean by proof, but certainly we could probably develop a questionnaire for the people involved, to see how they feel about any clothing changes, and how they feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK, so like a 'before' and 'after' confidence level assessment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael chips in at this point. \u201cOK Susan, that sounds like something you could work on \u2013 but make sure you keep Tony closely involved, as he seems to have worked out a good basis for this. She then looks around the group. \u201cSo,have we come up with any specific gender rules that we should try to include in scope? Louise \u2013 do you have our base list we can add to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure do,\u201d Louise replies. \u201cWe previously agreed that the scope could be anything gender related school uniform rules. We'd impose small changes at first to see how they're accepted, and with Tony's new idea we could conduct a 'before and after' review.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael speaks again. \u201cOK, so Tony and I agreed it doesn't need to be limited to clothes, but any gender related rules. That right Tony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling the discussion, and specifically that it could include make-up, you confirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then continues. \u201cOK, so can we have some specifics to include then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes around the girls in turn, and Louise notes down the suggestions made. As each suggestion is made you get a little buzz inside, and in their own way each idea seems fair and logical, and so you have no worries about them being included in the project scope. Rachael then asks Louise to read back the list, so you can all argue or agree the extended scope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so this outlines the project scope so far... we contain this to within the team, so only the designated people will be making changes, it's not limited to clothing, but can include other gender related rules, and we verify a satisfaction level with the subjects for each change. What we propose be included would be any items of visible uniform, so boys shirt versus girls blouse, pants versus shirt, boys short gray socks versus the girls knee high white socks, underwear, and shoes. Then we have make-up, hair styles, and jewelry. OK so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mentioned each item you got a buzz, and accepted each suggestion without question. Everyone including you nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, we have a couple more. The inclusion of traditionally gender based sports and other activities.\" Everyone nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then just a couple more.\u201d She looks at you. \u201cSo Tony, it has been suggested that as part of the project we include name changes, so for example switching between boys and girls names.\u201d The combination of the words 'change' and 'suggestion' make you blank out for the briefest of moments, and your subconscious programming kicks in, after which you realize this make perfect sense. It's definitely gender related and whilst not a uniform rule, its one of those clear gender differentiations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, whilst we're talking about school uniform and school related activities, the suggestion is that the changes need to extend beyond just school time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, why?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so if the participants need to wear, I don't know, the opposite gender's underwear, for example, it wouldn't make sense to have to come to school, and change back before you leave school. It would be far easier to do that at home, realistically at a time that suits the individual, not dictated by the school clock. So, the suggestion is that the changes extend to include home time as well as school, so the situation is covered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, your subconscious registers this as a suitable definition to meet your hypnotic programming, and you cannot help but agree. \u201cOK, when you put it that way, it makes perfect sense. So the changes can include at home as well as at school...\u201d  Actually you realize that's good, as it means you could justifiably wear your girls underwear at home - but blame it on the project.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd finally,\u201d Louise says, \u201cthe suggestion that the changes are not limited to just school related gender rules, but include any gender related expectations and assumptions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorry, what does that mean?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, for example, the types of movies different genders would watch, or different books they might read, or maybe sports they might play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are we agreed that the scope should include all of these changes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone around the circle verbally confirms they agree to extending the scope as Louise has outlined. you can't see any reason to object, so also agree. You realize your adrenaline is really pumping, and you're keen to start. For some reason the prospect of trying some of these new gender related items is giving you quite a buzz, which you know is really odd. After all, the thought of cross-dressing was originally quite abhorrent to you, but now that its been mentioned, the thought of trying on a girls skirt, or knee high white socks is making you quite excited. Even better, could you try both together? They sort of go together, don't they?  However, you know you can't start until the scope has been documented, the 'before and after' assessments have been developed, and you work out who is going to be taking part. So, lots to do first. Shame, you can't wait to get going...</span></div></div>",

If we're limiting the  uniform changes, sorry, um, gender rules changes, to within the team, could I ask who will actually be doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Rachael replies, \"I think you appreciate we can't all take part, as there are jobs that need to be done impartially. So, Susan is our observer and record keeper, so can't be directly involved, and I'm the project leader, so the formal comms channel with the school. Louise is on research, and Amy is the archivist and librarian, so they're both a bit tied up in preparatory work at the moment. However, I'm expecting the workload to ease once we get everything defined and documented properly, so some of us should be able to get involved then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK. So long as its not just me, that's fine...\u201d You consider what she said for a moment. \u201cSo, what you're saying is we can't start until Louise and Amy have completed the prep work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, possibly yes,\u201d Rachael replies, a little tentatively. \u201cWhy? Is that an issue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not an issue, but I'm quite keen to get things underway. Maybe I could start first, and they can catch up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael silently breathes a sigh of relief, as she realizes the hypnotism sessions appeared to have worked.  \"Well, that should be OK, although we'll need to define the scope a bit better, sort out any clothes or other things needed, set out a schedule, and so on. So, you'll need to hold fire a bit if we're going to adhere strictly to your revised plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, guess you're right.\u201d Somehow you feel a quite crestfallen, and unwittingly your face reflects your disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your reaction, she continues. \u201cOf course, there's no reason why you couldn't try a few things on beforehand. I mean, you'd need to know how to put things on properly, and we'll need to get the right size stuff for you. Tell you what \u2013 I can measure you up now and we can see what we all might have that could fit you. Then you'd be ready to try a few things for size...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're keen to do this, but then remember you're wearing the bra and panties. You really don't want them knowing about them. They may decide that breaks one of the tests, and might then put underwear out of scope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, OK, but I'm not undressing for you to measure me \u2013 you can do it clothes and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries.\u201d Rachael says, and pulls out a tape measure from her bag. \u201cI only need rough measurements now. Accurate measurements probably wouldn't matter yet, as we don't know what we've all got at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and she runs the measure around your chest and waist, then takes a measurement from your shoulder down to your waist, your waist to your knees, and your total height. As far as you're aware, she shouldn't have been able to detect anything about your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, got that. We can work out trying to find some stuff for you to try out for size, so you'd be ready to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the bell chimes for the end of the lesson, so you break up, and head your separate ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the room, unaware that the girls remain behind for a few minutes longer...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get changed out of your school uniform, dumping it all in your wash basket, and pull on a tee shirt and shorts, again keeping on your bra and panties underneath, as you remain extremely reluctant to take them off... You tell yourself its probably just the novelty value of wearing something different, although you still can't get over how comfortable they are to wear, so struggle a bit to see why you wouldn't want to wear them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom is home already, so you say hi \u2013 as much as anything else because you want to know what you'll be eating for tea. However, she then tries to pull you into a conversation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello sweetie,\u201d she says as you enter the kitchen, \u201cHow's your day been? Do you have much homework? Any plans for the weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, not a lot, no...Some maths to finish off, and got to write up a science experiment.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Anything more on your humanities project?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah. We've added a few changes to the scope. Oh, and I won't be doing it alone. Louise and Amy will be taking part as well once they finished the preparatory project stuff. So, I'll probably just start without them, and they can catch up later.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are the changes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing major. Just a few things to make it more sensible. So, allowing multiple changes where it makes sense, including some non-uniform clothing, and adding non-clothing gender related things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the inquisitive expression on your mom's face, and add \u201cUm, like the make-up, or trying a different sport or interest. Nothing extreme.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.\u201d your mom replies. \u201cAt least you seem committed to this, and it keeps you off your console, so guess I can't complain too much. What's your next step?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Rachael said they'd try to pull together some of their spare uniform stuff that might fit me, so I'd have the basics at least. Guess I should do a bit more research into gender specific sports and interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK. We may need to see what they come up with \u2013 you may still need some new stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a noise from your bedroom \u2013 your phone is ringing. You excuse yourself and rush to answer it. It's Rachael. She tells you that the girls have all had a look at home and found a number of things that they think could fit you, and she'll bring it by later this evening to leave with you. You ask her if you should try to find any of your spare stuff for Louise and Amy, but she says not to worry about it yet. She asks if you've told you mom about the project yet, and you confirm you have. She then adds, almost as an afterthought, the comment that you shouldn't be disillusioned at all, knowing full well that this would put you back into the hypnotized state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony? Can you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can hear you.\u201d you respond in your sub-conscious monotone voice.<br>\r\n\u201cOK. So, we've had a conversation. You decided you want to try on the girls clothes over the weekend to see how well they fit you. After putting on each item of girls clothes you don't want to switch back to the boy equivalent. Instead you want to try another item of girls clothes until you're fully dressed as a girl. Then you will want to add anything else to make you look and feel more like a girl.  You won't feel self conscious about anything you're wearing, but will accept it as normal. You will explain to your mom that you're just trying things so you can understand how everything goes together and how everything would be worn by a girl, but actually you'll get an adrenaline rush for every girlie thing you put on. On Monday you'll want to come to school dressed as, looking like, and acting like a girl. You'll tell you mom it's to prove to us that you can do it, but really it's because you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ends the session and you return to consciousness again, not realizing anything has happened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of hours later there's a ring on the door. A moment later your mom calls to you. Rachael has arrived with two heavy suitcases. You take them to your room whilst she talks to your mom. Being a bit inquisitive you open them up to see what they've put in them \u2013 after all, a few items of school uniform shouldn't weigh that much. You realize they've thrown in pretty much anything and everything from their wardrobes \u2013 not only school clothing but seemingly anything and everything else. There are jumpers and jackets, dresses and skirts, shoes and socks, and pretty much everything else. You realize there's probably enough here for a complete outfit every day for a week or more \u2013 although you consider that some things won't be seeing the light of day \u2013 like the dresses and skirts. Not sure why they even put those in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to where Rachael is still chatting to your mom. Then she turns towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've told you mom that we hope you'll try on a few things over the weekend to make sure we've got the sizing right, and let you work out how things are supposed to be worn. Shall I show you what we've put in, and then you can have a look through it all later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure.\u201d you reply, and lead Rachael to your room, where both cases are sat on the floor with their lids flung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you've had a quick peek already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was trying to work out why they were so heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we all basically grabbed any spare stuff that we thought might fit you. Some you almost certainly won't want, but it was easier just to chuck it in. I can help you sort through it, if you'd like?\u201d She pulls a couple of items from one of the cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no, it's ok. It'll take me a while to work out where to put it anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could at least work out what won't fit you. Anything too big or too small I can take away again, so you're not left with too much stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can appreciate the logic in that, so agree. \u201cOK,\u201d Rachael continues, \u201clets start with some tops.\u201d She holds out a white school uniform blouse. You take it from her, and realize that you've effectively just agreed to try it on. Oh well. You pull off your tee shirt, revealing the padded bra underneath, but after the last hypnosis session you don't even give it a thought that you're wearing it, or that Rachael can see it. You pull on the blouse and start to button it up. Wow, the material is so much softer than your own school shirt. It seems to shimmer and slide gently against your skin, and buttoning it up seems to be almost a sensual experience leaving your skin tingling. Why did you think dressing in girls stuff could be a bad idea? More a case of why didn't you try this before? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael notices your expression, and asks \u201cYou OK? How does it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it's good.\u201d you reply, not wishing to tell her it's the best feeling you've ever had whilst pulling on an item of clothing.  \u201cUm, how does it look?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks good. To be perfectly honest I'd say it would help if you had boobs to fill it out a bit, but otherwise it looks a pretty good fit.\u201d She waits for a few seconds, and then asks. \u201cCan't say it goes too well with your shorts, mind... How about trying something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What does she offer you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, you have a blouse on already, so why would you want to try on a different top? Something is telling you that you want to try on something <i>as well</i> as the blouse, and especially something that complements it. Despite your negative thoughts about skirts a few minutes ago, you have a real longing to try this one on, and have a hard job not grabbing it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/a7/a7/2ca7a78691dae560249788acb1cfdf19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/a7/a7/...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's part of the summer uniform, so a fairly short red and black tartan plaid. You have an almost lustful desire to try it on, although hesitate slightly, not wanting to appear overly keen. \u201cUm, I might try that one next,\u201d you say to Rachael, \u201cif you'd perhaps look the other way for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands the skirt to you, and spins around to face the door. \u201cJust let me know when you're done.\u201d she says. You're not concerned about Rachael seeing you wearing panties, as your last hypnotic programming remove any inhibitions about wearing girls clothes. Whilst knowing full well they're girls panties, you now consider them perfectly normal and natural for you to wear. However, it's just you'd prefer not to strip to your underwear in front of a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou undo your shorts and drop them to the floor. You pull on the skirt, which Rachael (unnoticed by you) had previously checked was the right size for you. You feel an almost electric thrill as it touches your legs. As you pull it up over your thighs you're buzzing with adrenaline, and by the time you have it in place around your waist you realize you have a firm erection. Wow, this skirt is just, well, hot. Do girls feel like this when they pull on their school skirts? Wow, no wonder they like wearing them!  You try to rearrange and flatten your erection, so it's not obvious to Rachael, and look in your mirror. OMG! What was it you had against skirts? It looks really good. Like your shorts, but shorter, and smoother, and, um, sexier. That's just weird but it does look sexy, even on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, it's on.\u201d you tell Rachael. She spins back and looks you over. \u201cOh, that does look good. It's a near perfect fit. It really suits you. You have slim legs that go brilliantly with the pleats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm quite surprised how good it looks too.\u201d you reply, quite truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow's the fit \u2013 does it feel OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt fits OK, and it feels, um, fine.\u201d You can feel yourself blushing slightly as rather than the skirt merely feeling fine, you're actually feeling really turned on. You desperately hope Rachael doesn't notice. \u201cYes, it's OK...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think its a shame you didn't want to stick with the original scope, you know? You seem to have quite a natural affinity with these things...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh well, I think I made my views quite clear on that. There's no way I will be cross-dressing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, well that's your choice.\u201d She digs into the clothes in the suitcase again, and pulls out a few different things. \"How about trying something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat catches your eye?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You pull off your own short gray socks and pull on the long black socks that are part of the girls summer uniform, again feeling an electric tingle as you pull them up your legs. They're not quite what you expected. You'd often thought long socks were silly in the summer, but they're really thin and smooth, and cool to your legs. The pumps are almost an afterthought, and you seriously doubt they'll fit your feet, but incredibly they do. You tie the laces and have another look in the mirror. Jeepers. You realize that by angling yourself to exclude your head, you could actually pass a being a girl. That's silly of course, as you won't be cross-dressing, but the thought gives you a weird flutter of excitement.  And you realize Rachael is right \u2013 your legs are skinny enough to look good in this skirt, and even better with the long socks on.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7b/75/22/7b752261ece4b16c36218766516c54bd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7b/75/22/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael offers you a couple more things from the case, but weirdly you are no longer that interested.. Something is driving you to consider other things instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what else have you got besides clothes? These all fit fine, so guess I could just try other things later on. But do you have anything else, um, that would, um..\u201d You find yourself struggling with, and almost fighting the words that seem to be forming themselves in your mouth... \u201c...anything that would make me look more like a girl...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHang on, that's not what you wanted to say... was it? you quickly try to correct what you'd said. \"I mean, um... anything else a girl might wear that I should try on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, now you've gone this far, you feel quite an intense desire to carry on until you really look like a girl. You look back at the mirror, stepping back to include your head in the view, and the illusion is somewhat shattered. OK, you'd have a bit of work to do there... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this is just silly, you think. Time to stop this nonsense and get changed back to normal... like into your own clothes. You remember the sensation you felt pulling on the blouse and the skirt, and how soft the material feels. You realize the prospect of changing back into your tee and shorts is actually quite unpalatable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rachael is replying to your question... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so is there anything else here you could try? Yes, make-up for starters. Some hair clips and bands, and a few bits of jewelry. If you're really serious about looking more like a girl, then I think Louise put a few, um, special things in one of the cases. But that was something she got based on the original project scope, so not something that would interest you now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d you agree, although her comment has whetted your interest, if only to see what special things they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael continues.  \u201cI can show you if you'd like, but I'd guess you're not really interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then another smaller box and a bag. She opens the first box. It contains a make-up set, with a range of blushers and eye shadows and lipsticks. \"Ah, well, this might actually be useful. You'll remember we agreed that make-up could be included,\" Rachael says, \"so this may be useful for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps,\" you acknowledge, eying up the contents, and taken back a bit by the vibrancy of some of the eye shadow and lipstick. \"They are a bit bright though, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe. But that's what girls like to wear, so that's what Louise popped in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Fair enough...\" Actually you quite like some of the shades. Even with your newly discovered liking for a little make-up, you cannot see yourself wearing anything that colorful. They're very bold colors, rather than the subtle shades you have tried so far, and the concept of lipstick is still unknown to you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael opens the next box. You can't immediately see what it inside. Then she lifts out the contents.It's two false boobs. They're clearly quite soft and pliable and pale skin toned, so not too far from your coloring. You are equally horrified and fascinated. Horrified to think that Louise had assumed you'd agreed to the original scope and got hold of them, but equally eager to understand how they could be used... \"So, asking purely academically, how would they be used?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, easy. You can get strap on ones that you wear a bit like a bra. Trouble with those is you'd have two straps for the breasts and another two for the bra so not so discrete. Or you can get ones like these. They either slip inside your bra cups, so they hold in place by the bra, or you apply skin adhesive and stick them on. Then the bra would just support them like... well like real breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did Louise get them? I mean, even with the original scope surely I wouldn't have needed<i> them</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, I've got to disagree there. Girls clothes only really look right on a body that's the right shape. That blouse you're wearing now is designed to fit a girl, so it would look at its best over boobs. Think I suggested that to you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something inside you wants to try them on. You know that's just daft, but the thought they could make your clothes fit better seems to outweigh your reluctance, and besides they could make you look more like a girl. No, you didn't mean that. Did you? You're a bit confused... again. Why do you keep wanted to look more like a girl. That's just... Well, for some reason, that just the way it is. You realize you do actually want to look <i>more</i> like a girl. No, not <i>more like</i>... you want to<i> look like a girl</i>, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot understand why you're feeling like this, but know that it's not really something optional, but some almost instinctive desire that is now surfacing. But you don't want to do anything about it now. Not now, not here, and certainly not with Rachael here... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you resist? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You admit to her that you not only would like to dress as a girl, but look like a girl... in every respect. You hold back on telling her its becoming an overwhelming obsession that's starting to take over your every thought, but that's what its starting to feel like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael seems a bit taken aback. Well, you guess it's a bit of a shock to her really. You've been quite negative towards the idea up until now, so she's probably got to come to terms with your change of heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want to look like a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Think I just said that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn every way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.

What then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, what do you mean, what then? That's it. Once I'm a girl... I mean once I look like a girl, then that's it. That's the way I'll stay. I want to be a.. I mean I want to look like a girl. Period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael realizes that her hypnosis has worked better and faster than she'd expected, and possibly to a more extreme extent. She considers her options, and decides that for the moment she'll not do anything to modify the hypnotic programming, but just be friendly and supportive to you, and see how far things go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so I'd suggest you just slip the breasts inside your bra for now, and we can see how they fit size-wise...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that they can be glued onto you has a definite appeal, as you really want everything to be as permanent as possible, but you realize it makes sense to try them for size first. Once they're glued, you wouldn't be able to change them for a different size \u2013 not that you're aware if there are any more in the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unbutton the blouse and take it off, then with a bit of guidance from Rachael you pull each of the bra cups away from your chest and insert the breast forms. Rachael helps adjust the bra straps to accommodate the additional bulk. You put the school uniform blouse back on, and button it down again. You turn to the mirror and consider your reflection again. You feel a warm glow of satisfaction seeing the bulges in the blouse, and knowing they are 'your' breasts \u2013 even if technically falsies. The size seems about right. Realistic. Not too big.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d you say to Rachael.  You seem to have calmed down slightly, and have a bit more self control again. \u201cThat does look, um, closer to looking like a girl.

You look expectantly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's like this... um... You remember what our original scope was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, obviously. Everyone ganging up on me, trying to convince me to spend the rest of the semester dressed as a girl. Yeah, I remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, when we said we'd go along with your idea to change the scope of the project, we, um..., didn't tell you everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok, yes. We lied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you actually planned to stick to the original scope?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm a bit confused. We haven't stuck to the original scope, so what's the issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we are. There never was a new scope. We were just, um, trying to keep you happy, whilst, um, you accepted that you did actually want to dress as a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I do want to dress as a gi...\" you start, but don't quite finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... so our strategy worked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just because... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I hypnotised you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT???!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I hypnotized you into liking girls clothes, and wanting to try them on, and wanting to look like a girl... Only it's worked a bit too well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what you've saying is I'm dressed like this,\" you wave your hands down to indicate the entire girls summer school uniform on your body, \"because you hypnotized me to want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly. Well, actually, yes, exactly... The question is what do we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were supposed to come around to our way of thinking, and by Monday want to come to school dressed as a girl to prove to us that you could, but you seem to have become obsessed with turning yourself into a girl as rapidly as you can... I feel a bit guilty, and I'm sure your mom won't be at all happy if she finds out what we've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you reply, \"I'm struggling to see what the problem is. I <u>do</u> want to dress as a girl. Therefore your issue is non-existent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael is a bit dumbfounded. Technically you're right. You do want to dress as a girl, and therefore she shouldn't be worried. However, she also knows that your mom definitely won't be happy, and when she (eventually) releases you from the hypnotic programming she's equally sure you won't be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, after school we all meet at the mall. Agreed?\" Rachel told everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day was uneventful. Well, if never hearing your real name and automatically responding to \"Tina\" could be considered such. It wasn't until after last period that you realized that one teacher had even called you Tina, and no one in class has reacted to that, at least none that you noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grabbed your pack and homework and were about to head to the mall, you sensed a shadow loom over you. <i>Oh great,</i> you thought. <i>One of the bullies has decided to try again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you turned around, you came face-to-chest with someone wearing a school letter jacket. Looking up, you were shocked. It was Tad Johnson, upperclassman standout of the basketball team, and reason for causing many sighs from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" you squeaked in surprise. \"Just . . .\" You tried to clear your throat but everything kept coming out an octave higher than normal. \"Just a new look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" He stared blankly silent as if thinking, and you stood waiting since he had you blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tad was a flash on the court, he wasn't exactly swift between the ears. Between the ears was a solid face and deep blue eyes, almost curtained by his blond hair that swept across his forehead left to right. It puffed full on the sides His nose seemed a bit flat at this distance which was maybe upwards a foot away. It gave a look almost like a lion. Much better looking than you, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's a nice look. You need help with that?\" he offered and took your pack before you knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he backed and turned toward the door, you fell in beside walking with him without thinking. It was an auto-panic reaction. Then a shiver went through you as you realized that he was flirting with you. Of course, he wouldn't know you from Tony - you mean the guy you really are - since he's not in your level. But what about your boy-clothes, er, regular clothes? Isn't that a giveaway? Then again the way some girls dress, maybe not . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can you do? It's not fair to deceive and make him part of the project, or would it be? Maybe you should play along. But what happens when he finds out? He wouldn't hit a girl probably, but you just <i>look</i> like one! Perhaps he took the same class last year and would understand if you explained, maybe, if he could process the data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could end up very bad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tomorrow you'll go to class, go home, do homework, play video games, then do the whole thing over again. Not very exciting. All of a sudden your mind flashes back to Rachael spanking you, the look on her face, the loss of control. You realize you're hard. You reach for your phone and text Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachael, my mom isn't letting me drop the class so I guess I have to do that dumb project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Rachael texts back, \"Sorry, we really aren't comfortable having you in our group anymore. By the way I hope that tushy of yours has healed.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncomfortable? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Amy is really offended that you wouldn't wear her thong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take it anymore, you really don't want this to end. \"Please let me in your group! Come on, my mom will kill me if I drop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insulted me. Why would I let you back in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make up for it!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will huh... Well you can be back in the group, but we have to make sure you don't turn on us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a school night!\" she yells back. You put on a jacket because it's getting a bit nippy out, and head over to Rachael's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ring the bell. Rachael opens the door and smiles at you but you sense a bit of the devil in that smile. You decide to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Tony\" she says. \"I'm glad you decided to come to your senses. I didn't think you'd want to fail the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Rachael, I don't. My mom would kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tony, here's the deal. You have to wear girl's clothes until the project ends. I have some clothes that Amy sent along and you can wear these home. Your mother knows what the project is about, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not entirely. She knows it's a social project thing and that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll probably want you to explain it when you get home.\" she said, handing you a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the bag. In it, you find Amy's gym clothes - a pullover top, a netball skirt, socks and a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to give me your shorts, Tony. Amy offered to switch with you earlier and you refused. She sent these along and this is what you'll wear home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Rachael, there's no underwear here. I thought she wanted me to wear her thong? I can't walk home in a short skirt and no underwear! It's cold out! How will I explain this to my mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good questions and maybe you should have thought of that earlier. We don't have all night, so strip, put your clothes in the bag and put these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Rachael, can't I keep my underwear at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't. It's only a couple of blocks and if it's not windy, no one will see your bits. How's your ass? btw? Still sore?\"  She patted your bottom and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-i-it's fine\" you stammer. You pull away from her touch but she grabs your belt. You try and slap her hands away but she manages to undo your belt &amp; pants and unzip you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step out of these. Now!\" She pulled your pants and shorts down below your knees and smacks your ass hard. You slide your sneakers off and do as she says. You're now naked from the waist down and wearing nothing but a T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a cute look on you. But here, step into this.\" She holds out the netball skirt. You step into the skirt. From all of Rachael's touching you you've started to become hard. Rachael frowns at you as she walks behind you to zip up the skirt in the back. \"Hands up\" she says, and pulls your shirt off. From behind you, she slips bra straps over your arms and clips the bra in the back. Your socks get stuffed into the bra cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see what we have. Turn.\" You turn to face her. She laughs a bit and tries unsuccessfully to smooth down the front of the skirt - now held up by your erection. \"See Tony? If you had listened to us earlier, you'd have underwear which would help keep your, um, weenie, in place. You'll just have to deal as we walk you home.\" She snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael picks up a suitcase as she tells you to put on your sneakers. You feel very self conscious as you sit on her bed in a skirt with no underwear. You get your sneakers back on and stand carefully, trying not to let her look up your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head out of the house and walk towards yours. You're carrying the suitcase and the two of walk along talking about school and the project. A little breeze kicks up now and again and blows under the skirt. You instinctively try and hold in down in the back which makes Rachael laugh. \"Here, let me get that for you.\" she says, and puts her hand on your bottom. Having a pretty girl hold your skirt down as you walk along with her is pretty embarrassing, but you find yourself getting hard again. Rachael smiles at you and caresses your bottom a bit. When she reaches under the skirt and runs her finger up your crack, the front of the skirt lifts almost completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" she says. \"Did I do that?\" She laughs and you find yourself totally unable to speak. Silently you walk the rest of the way home with her. You already feel like the girlfriend in this relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get home, you realize that your mother is going to ask a million questions. Fortunately Rachael has stopped teasing you and your erection has gone down. At least you won't have to expose yourself to your mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. Tony's mother.\" says Rachael as you enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Rachael, Tony. Tony? What the... Is this part of your school project? You better start explaining why you're dressed like that.\" You explain the project to her and say that you went over to Rachael's to pick up some clothes. Your mother gives you an odd look and says she'll talk to you about it later. She heads out to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rachael go to your room where she proceeds to unpack the suitcase. She hands you skirts and dresses to hang in your closet while she takes all of your clothes and puts them in the suitcase. After you get the dresses hung up, you see that she's taken your underwear out of your dresser drawers and replaced them with girls' underwear. \"See Tony? I'm not heartless. I left you underwear and most of it is granny panties. Amy's thong is in there too and you might want to wear it tomorrow - it will make her happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember I said that you aren't going to back out again? I've got your clothes and you don't have much choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops and gives you a big hug. \"Tony, you're handling this very well and I think this project is going to go well.\" Her right hand was no longer on your back but was moving the skirt aside and cupping one of your bottom cheeks. Her touch gets you hard again. She gives you a little love pat on your bare cheek and now you're fully hard, poking her in the stomach. \"Wow Tony, this really excites you! That's good to know. Tell me, is my kind of dominating you the reason you changed your mind and decided to cooperate?\" </span></div></div>",

I can sue you for saying that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! What is going on?!\" Taken back, Rachael demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Not here...\" Whispering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael sighed and pulled you into a closet of the classroom and closed the door. \"Tell me.\" Serious, she ordered. \"I have to say something after dragging you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a rare genetic condition called Y-chromosome deficiency.\" Tearing up, you explained. \"Basically, my body does not have enough Y-chromosomes to push my body through puberty so its relying only on my X-chromosomes, reversing my gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael's eyes widened; she was clearly stunned by the news. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, you pulled out a piece of paper and handed it to Rachael. It was a letter from your doctor, explaining your condition. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are all inherently female at the fetal state. One just needs the X chromosome introduced at a certain level of development to make one male.However, in rare cases, not enough is introduced and the person reverts back to the female state.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" Shocked, Rachael whispered. \"So, you are really slowly becoming a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I was hoping to wait with dealing with girl's clothing and such after summer vacation when my family plans to move to another state where no one knows me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough, Jon.\" Wincing, Rachael said. Then, after a thought, she smiled. \"Still, I think we can help you get ready for this transition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Stunned, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're an open minded school!\" Smiling, Rachael said. \"We can help you adjust to this change and you will not have to spend all summer trying to learn how to be a girl. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, you could utter your response, Rachael dragged you out of the closet to face the class. \"If you don't tell them, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This started as soon as you sat down on the bus, and the lady beside you moved her handbag to her other side, and seemed to shift away from you slightly in her seat. Was that because she didn't know you, or was she worried you might snatch her bag? Then an old man boarded, and even you could tell he hadn't washed for ages, and people around him clearly tried to distance themselves from him. Then a young woman boarded the bus wearing a tight blouse over close fitting leggings, between them leaving little to the imagination, and you could see the men on the bus sneaking a look at her (as to be fair you did yourself).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK so perhaps there may be something in this behavioral thing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the Mall.

So you agreed to follow their protocol, and after a few minutes there you end up with a little swipe card with your photo and name on it, and a pamphlet outlining their rules of conduct for staff and visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been thinking about the project, and how you're supposed to be watching and ideally influencing behaviors. Based on your limited observations on the bus it seems like a good idea if you could somehow take on different roles, as peoples' reactions seem to vary based on who they think you are - not that you could ever hope (or want) to dress (or smell) like the elderly gentleman on the bus, and clearly couldn't even contemplate being able to simulate the young women in her figure hugging clothes. Nevertheless if you could perhaps take on the role of a security guard, cleaner, shop worker, etc., you may be able to determine how people react to you taking on this role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mention this as a possibility whilst you're in the Admin office, outlining your idea.

It's unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. My father is a car nut. He specifically looked for a woman named Portia when he married. Instead, he met a woman named Alexis. He started calling her Lexis and when they started a family, he wanted to name me with a car name as well. My mother said I was almost named 'The Thing' after the ugly old Volkswagen but fortunately she changed his mind. So 'Camry' it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the name. It's nice to have an unusual name. 'Tony' is so boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little brother Avalon probably wouldn't agree with you, but I know what you mean. So if a janitor isn't your cup of tea, maybe this?\" She held out a mall cop uniform. \"It's from a special promotional period we had a while ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the jacket. It's not bad, although the big gold braids on the epaulet are a bit much. The hat though, is a deal breaker. \"What's with the hat, Camry? It's one of those old fashioned, tall round-top Keystone Cops hats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", she said, shaking her head. \" It was the 100th anniversary of the Keystone Cops and the mall theater was having special showings of the old films. We thought it would be fun if the security dressed like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it? Fun, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the mall officers didn't think so. This uniform is hardly worn at all - I think the guy quit because it looked so ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not for me then either. Is that all you could find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it for staff uniforms Tony, but one of the stores had a suggestion. They offered you a uniform if you were willing to stand around in the center of the mall and help promote their services. They'll even pay you which is a pretty sweet deal. You'll get paid for doing your school project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"I like the idea Camry. Who is it, what will I be promoting and what is the uniform? Whatever it is I'll take it - anything has to be better than a dopey Keystone Cop uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamry picked up a bag from the floor and placed it on the counter. \"It's a travel agency. They want you to steer people towards their office and make them think of tropical vacations and then come in and book them. They're offering $15/hr AND a commission on any sales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou like the idea of making some serious cash. You had a dream once of being roped into acting as a airline stewardess for a school project and was very glad that dream, er, nightmare wasn't becoming real. Then it dawned on you that she said 'tropical' vacations.  \"Er, Camry, that bag wouldn't happen to have a grass skirt and coconut shells in it, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamry laughed. She pictured you in a grass skirt doing a hula. \"No, silly boy. Nothing like that. It's a cruise ship officer's uniform. Very tasteful if you ask me.\" She pulled it out of the bag. Neatly folded you could see strips on the sleeve of the jacket and a very cool captain's hat. She was right - it looked tasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's a deal. I'll take this one. When do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away. I'll call over there and tell them you're changing and are on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the uniform and head to the back room to change. Camry is giving you a strange smirky sort of smile but you pay it no mind. Closing the door behind you, you set down the parcel and begin to take off your clothes. You strip to your underwear and socks and then unfold the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a woman's dress. When you hold it up to your shoulders it comes to just above your knees. Along with the uniform, Camry was kind enough to include a pair of nylons, panties and a bra. You open the door a crack, stick your head out and ask \"Hey Camry, why didn't you tell me this was a woman's uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, don't you want to get your assignment done? That's all I could find for you. I can call them back and say you're not interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it, then realize that if you don't do this, you'll get an F on the project and fail the course. No, you'll have to go along with it. \"N-no, I don't want to fail the course. I'll do it. I'm not wearing the stockings though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are. Do you need help getting dressed?\" She asked. \"I assumed you didn't know how to put that stuff on, so I've got someone to cover the desk while I help you.\" She picked up a bag of supplies from CVS and headed your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're standing behind the door in just your underwear with your head sticking out watching this pretty girl head towards you.</span></div></div>",

Then into the phone , \"Hi this is Abigail from the mall office. Yes, the student is here and well, I think you'll have to explain the project yourself.\" She looked you up and down as she spoke. \"He's, well, he's a good looking boy but perhaps a little slight for what you were looking for. Still, why don't you come over, see for yourself and explain the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail hung up the phone and waved you to a chair. \"Amie from Lacey's is on her way over to explain how this works. May I offer you a soda or a water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you.\" Despite Abigail's kind demeanor you can't help but feel apprehensive about this whole thing. Why can't you just get a name tag and walk around the mall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie arrived rolling a suitcase behind her. She started reaching for the door and you jumped to your feet to open it for her. \"My, what a kind boy you are. Are you the student with the project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so polite too. Your mother must be proud. You get good grades in school I suppose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am. I work hard at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this won't be any real work at all. As you know, this month is national sports month. The owner of Lacey's owns both the area NFL and NBA teams. The store is developed their own line of uniform-inspired fashions to celebrate the occasion. I have here some samples of the clothing. We're asking young people to participate in a small fashion show, then simply walk around the store and the mall wearing the clothes. You get $10/hr and get to keep the clothes. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it sounds like fun. $10/hr you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Yes, you will get paid for your help.\"  She opened the bag and pulled out a nylon jersey in Lacey's store colors. She held it up and shook her head. I'm afraid that we may have a problem. The boy's clothes I brought are all L and XL, and you look to be what, a small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", you counter, puffing up your chest. \"I wear mediums sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter. Maybe we can try this then.\" She reached under a few layers and pulled out a striped referee's shirt. It looked rather long and was unmistakably a referee shirt in spite of it being in Lacey's colors rather than black and white. She held it up to you. She looked at Abigail who nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could wear that.\" you started to say. \"With a pair of black or some other solid pants...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dress Tony, not a shirt. It should fit you fine after we help with some, um, embellishments and you'd look rather cute in it. If this isn't your style, then this? (holding up a cheerleading skirt in Lacey's store colors) or these? (holding up a brightly colored women's basketball uniform)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People will think I'm, well, they'll talk. I can't wear those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they'll talk about how cute you look and then head to the store to buy the clothes for themselves. You'll do great. I understand you need this project to pass a course, isn't that right?\" asked Amie?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nonplussed, she continued. \"We're going to be best friends, you and I so we might as well hug.\" She wrapped her arms around you and you weakly returned the gesture. She smelled of cinnamon, flowers and girl sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you and Amie pick for your item in the show?\" she asked. With shaking hands you opened the suitcase and pulled out the cheerleader skirt. \"Oh, nice choice, that's going to be adorable on you!\".

She gives you a smock as partial cover so you at least you don't feel quite so naked.  For the next 15 minutes, Stella plucks, brushes, smooths, paints, plumps and who knows what else. Your face is a canvas and Stella - the artist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare open those eyes Tony.\" she says, walking away for a moment. When she returns, she puts her hands on your head and smooths all of your hair down. She pulls what feel like a swimming cap over your head. She then proceeds to pick and tease at the wig she had just put on you. Finally, she spins the chair to face a mirror that had been behind you. \"Okay Tony. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. In front of you is a stunning girl.  She has blond hair that just falls to her shoulders, dirty blond eyebrows, full lashes, slightly pink lips... In the mirror you see a girl who would both stand out in any crowd and yet go unnoticed. When you move your mouth or eyes, this girl does the same. You spend what feels like hours just making this girl do your bidding, although in reality it was just about 30 seconds with you making goofy faces in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony\" exclaimed Stella, \"that's enough. You're going to ruin the makeup and you have to get dressed.\" She picks up a package of nylon cheer briefs and hands them to you. \"You need to slip out of your underwear and put these on. Then I'll help you get dressed for the show. I have to help some other kids with their clothes so change and I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the briefs. They're smooth, silky and very stretchy. You look around and the room. It's empty,  so you quickly take off your own underwear and then start to step into these. Which is the front? Boys underwear it at least obvious, but these have no tag so you can't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold them by the waistband. See how the leg openings slope this way? That's the front.\" You look up and see Julie the intern who was stacking boxes earlier. At first Julie thought it was one of the girl volunteers, but without your underwear it was obvious to her you were a guy. \"Oh, it's you!\" she laughs. \"Honestly I'd never have recognized you. Stella did a wonderful job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked from the waist down is not the way to meet pretty girls, you think. Quickly you step into the briefs and pull them up. Julie snugs them up at the back for you and suggests that you might want to tuck in front. \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, putting your boy parts in between your legs. I can show you what I mean if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Was Julie a boy too? Was 'she' going to show me how she tucks her parts in? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's hand deftly slides into the front of your briefs, and she nudges the panties down for a moment, gently arranges your boy parts and then pulls the panties back up. You couldn't have been more embarrassed and Julie has a grin on her face that was wider than her head. \"There you go Tony. That should help.\" She gives you a little pat on the bottom. \"Stay here while I go get your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was suddenly chilly in the room, and you're basically naked from the waist down with freshly waxed legs. However, in a moment, Julie returned. On a hanger was white short sleeved blouse, the skirt you had seen earlier and a button front sweater. They're in Lacey's store colors. Both the sweater and the skirt have appliqu\u00e9 \"L\"s on them, presumably for \"Lacey\". This was the store's new self-identified branding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait!\" said Julie.\" I have to get you some shoes. What size are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7 I guess\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at your feet. \"7? Oh, a men's 7. We'll try a 9 on you. I'll see what I can find.\" She turned and heads off again.

You don't really expect to be met by the Airport Manager, as indeed you aren't. Instead it's a smartly dressed women in her twenties who meets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Tony Jackson. I'm from Hill Crest School. I was told to report here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK. Hi Tony...\" She seems a bit taken aback. \"So, have you swapped places with Lucy?  It's just that we were told that Lucy would be coming, so we've got an access pass printed for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry no. I was selected to come here, so I guess maybe there was a mix up by the tutor or school secretary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that causes us a bit of a problem. We can only get access passes printed once a day as it needs the COO's authority, so I can't get a new one for you until tomorrow. Looks like it's been a wasted journey for you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, surely there's something I can see today without the pass? I'm keen to get started with the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Sounds like an interesting project, and we're glad to be able to support the local educational authority...  However, the bulk of the people are actually air-side, and I understand you want to study mass behaviors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes...that's right.\" you agree, not really being sure what you're supposed to be studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way we could let you do anything now would be if you just happened to look exactly like Lucy. This is a photo pass you see, so it's got the photo the school sent through.\" She picks up the access pass and looks at the thumbnail image printed on the front. \"Oh, that's interesting.\" She turns the card towards you, letting you see the image. It's a photo of you, but with Lucy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we can do something today...\" She seems to consider things for a few moments.  \"OK, it's like this. We were obviously expecting a female, and you can see this big F printed on the card. And of course the card is in Lucy's name.

The manager, whose name tag says \"Alice\" in large black letters, unzips the garment back. She removes a blue wool dress and jacket. Your immediate thought is that is seems to have a lot of sleeve and not very much skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you think? It's authentic vintage 70s.\" She holds it up, then holds it up to you. The skirt is indeed short and falls a few inches above your knees. \"I think it's adorable and will look so cute on you.\" She laughs and you wonder what you've agreed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, okay if this is what you could find. Do you think I'll pass as a stewardess for - how to you pronounce that? Verpletteren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tony, uh Lucy. I'm sure this will work fine.\" She lays the dress over a chair, and sets down a bag containing panties, a girdle, stockings, bra, and a pair of black pumps. \"Do you need help with this?

Let's start with that, then do something about your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair is a bit longer than it generally is. Alice steps behind you and tries arranging your locks in different ways. She finally picks a style, pulls some hairpins out of a box and pins your hair into a neat up-do. \"Not very 70s, but it's the best we can do for now. The salon in the airport could give you a quite stylish cut if you decide to stick with this outfit for your project.\" You wonder how you could ever explain to you parents that you're dressing as a stewardess to mingle with passengers, much less getting your hair cut in a 70's pageboy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Lucy, you need to get out of Tony's clothes.\" She stands there and waits, tapping her foot. It reminds you of how your mother acted when she was annoyed with you, just before she sent you to your room. \"Come on, don't make me spank you young lady. Out of the clothes, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat catches your attention, and you immediately start undoing your belt buckle. Would she really spank you? You wonder about that, but decide to cooperate instead. You undo your pants button, remove your shirt, then step out of your pants. Alice smiles. She seems to be enjoying the position that you have put her in. You turn to pick up the dress and feel a sharp smack on your bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, young lady. You can't wear that underwear. I have some appropriate things for you and you'll have to put them on first.\" She steps behind you and in one tug pulls your undershirt up over his head. \"Put your arms forward\" she orders, and slips a bra over your extended arms. In another few seconds, it's snug against your chest and Alice is clipping it behind you.  \"Okay, now off with those tighty whities and put these on\" she says, handing you the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's going too far!\" you argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to start your project today?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you mumble in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what?\" asks Alice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am?\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better. Then we need to get on with this. So off with those...\" she says pointing to your underpants. \"Don't worry - you don't have anything I haven't seen before.\" You grimace, make sure to turn away from her and step out of your underwear. You quickly step into the panties and pull them up. Then Alice pulls on the waistband and snuggles them up your hips, then pats your pantied bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now for the girdle. You loosen it by unzipping this, then pull it up to your waist and we zip you in.\" You're not sure that you understand, but manage pull the garment up to your waist and Alice, after telling you to suck in your tummy, deftly zips the zipper. It snaps in place with a little click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the stockings. You put those on by wadding them up, putting them over your toe and rolling them up your leg. The tops clip into these little clips at the bottom of the girdle. Like this...\" As she says this, she pulls the hem of her skirt up enough to show you that she too is wearing garter stockings.  You're a bit pie-eyed at the sight and despite your emabarrassment, you're getting excited too, with a growing bulge in your panties giving you away. Alice smiles, lets her hem down and asks if you're okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am, I'm fine\" you say, fiddling with the panties. Somehow you manage to tuck yourself in and hope it will stay there. At Alice's instruction, you then sit on a chair and with her help, got the stockings on. Then comes the dress. That's easy - you unbutton the back, unzip it and step in. Alice helps by zipping up the back and redoing the button. \"How the hell do you get out of this thing yourself?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice chuckles. \"Clothes have changed over the years. Back in the day, women's clothes were always like this. She holds up the  jacket and you slip your arms in. A squat hat neatly pinned on your head and the wicked looking pumps on your feet and you're set to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not quite. You just about fall over and have no idea how to walk in heels. Alice gives some pointers and then, now looking more like Lucy than Tony, you teeter around the room for a few minutes. You seem to pick it up fairly quickly and decide if you walk carefully, you could manage without falling on your face. More than once you find  yourself pulling at the hem of the skirt, wishing it were a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Lucy\", Alice says, hanging the name tag around your neck, \"let's take you down to the terminal. I've already told the staff what you're doing and they'll be as helpful as they can without letting anyone know you're not really a stewardess. Just act like you belong there and have authority, and let the uniform do the rest.\"</span></div></div>",

Alice takes you to the Verpletteren check-in desk, so that they are aware that you're in the terminal and  recognizable as being associated with their airline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now finding walking in the heels a little easier by slowing down and shortening each step, and angling your foot downwards in line with the heel. However, you are aware that this more conscious placing of each step results in your hips swaying in time with your footfalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the Verpletteren desk, and realize that whilst they may be a foreign carrier, they are not a major airline, with only two desks, and only a handful of personnel. Alice has a word with someone who seems to be in charge to explain why you're there. Meanwhile you introduce yourself to the girl at the desk, remembering of course that you are now Lucy. However, you are perplexed by the response from the check-in clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goedemorgen. Ik neem je te ontmoeten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm sorry?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my apologies,\" the response came back as quick as a flash. \"I just assumed from your name that you may have been a native?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you didn't realize that Lucy was a foreign name, so for any instant you're dumbstruck. Then it occurs to you that you have no idea what Lucy's surname is - and therefore what's on your ID pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, sorry, I'm all American.\" you reply, and as deftly as possible glance down at your ID pass so that you can see it. It reads Lucy Vanderhoek. Oh heck. Now you can see why she may have thought you were of foreign descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK. There aren't a lot of Dutch people over here, so guess I was just hoping... Oh, I'm Luna, by the way. As I said before, I'm very pleased to meet you.\"  You smile and acknowledge her remarks. Then she continues:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're our new trainee stewardess then Lucy? That's excellent! I was told someone was starting soon. They've certainly done a good job with your uniform. However, I think a little make up would help. You are looking a bit pale, and we do like our staff to set a fairly glamorous image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I...\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, don't worry. You can borrow my make-up. We have you looking like a true Verpletteren in a jiffy.\" She turns and glances behind her. \"Come here a second.\" and beckons you behind the check in desk. You step around the side, noticing that Alice has now left, and the clerk she had been talking with is busy. Luna has already got her make up ready. \"Stand still, and I'll add a bit of color to you.\" You stand and follow Luna's instructions to close your eyes, and pucker your lips. As she works, Luna mutter quietly. \"Hmm, you have quite boyish features, and I'd guess you don't use make-up much. Bit of a tomboy when you were younger, eh?\" After a couple of minutes and she is finished. \"Allemaal gedaan - all done. Here, have a look.\" She passes you a small mirror. Looking at your reflection you can see your eye lashes are somehow thicker and more prominent, you have blue eye shadow and eye liner, blusher on your cheeks, and quite bright red lips. As you are looking Luna reaches into her bag, and sprays something at your neck. \"A little eau de toilette wouldn't harm. It does help put the male passengers a little more at ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are then Lucy. I know you're young, and maybe haven't been paying much attention to making yourself look too feminine, but it wouldn't harm to shape your eyebrows, and I'd suggest you may like to pad your bra out slightly. We like our stewardess to look as attractive as possible,  and to be honest you don't seem to have a lot there. Don't worry now, but maybe for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you manage to squeeze out, before Luna continues. \"Right, we have a flight departing in a couple of hours, so we really should get the desk ready. We could do with some help here - and yes, stewardesses do sometime help at check-in, and it will give you a better understanding the whole process. It's not all about the planes in the air - there's a lot of other stuff that needs doing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.    </span></div></div>",

After all, observing other employees as well as the passengers is going to go a long way to getting you an A in your assignment. \"Okay Luna, I'm ready to do whatever. How can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiles at you. \"Excellent. The first thing we should do is get this second display terminal started up. You'll be checking people's tickets and you'll need the computer.\" She guides you towards the display monitor. It's dark, but you can see your reflection in the glass. Well not yours, but Lucy's. What you see staring back at you is a pretty girl with luscious lips and pools for eyes that look deep enough to swan dive into. You can help but stare for a moment. This can't be you, can it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is there a problem?\" Luna asks. She gives you a little smack on the bottom to get your attention. You startle, reflexively put your hand to your bottom and look at her. \"Uh, no ma'am. I'm fine.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" Luna chuckles. \"Well, I'm hardly a ma'am, am I? And aren't you well behaved. Such impeccable manners.\" You see her making mental notes. \"You seem into this and you're not even turned on yet.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" you ask, stammering and blushing in a way that makes the expertly applied rouge on your face rather superfluous. Luna laughed. \"I mean, the computer isn't even turned on yet and you're studying it like you're looking at a computer for the first time ever.\" She reaches around you, brushing against your arm as she does so, and flips on a switch on the side of the monitor. There's a whir and buzz as the electrons come to life and light the two of you in an eerie green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the computer is up and runnng, Luna shows you how to log in by entering your password and then how to access the flight information screens. \"Passengers will often ask about flight delays\" she says, \"and you can get the current flight information here.\" You try to pay attention and see how she got these screens to come up. As hard as you try, you are still focused on how you got here today. This morning you were plain old Tony but now you're glamorous Lucy Vanderhoek, a tall (thanks to your heels) pretty Dutch stewardess in a uniform that doesn't even come close to covering your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Earth to Lucy. Come in, Lucy\" Luna jokes. \"Am I going to have to smack you bottom to get your attention again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am. I've got this\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. This button here brings up flight manifests. You enter a flight number here, or a passenger's name and it automatically locates the \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ad\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 \u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ac\u03c6\u03b9\u03be\u03b7\u03c2...\"  It was like she was speaking greek, but you tried your best to keep up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes, she asked \"Okay, you got this? I'm going to take care of something at the loading ramp. Passengers should start coming in soon for a flight leaving in about 30 minutes, so just do what you can and if you can't help, just be polite. I'll be back in 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, I'll do my best.\" you say. Luna looks at you quizzically. \"I'm sure you will.\" she proffers. Before she steps away, she tugs gently at the hem of your jacket to straighten it. \"You also have a bit of a sag in your stocking there.\" she says pointing at your left leg. \"You'll want to fix that.\" With that, she turned and heads off across the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you just know that the best way to snug up your stocking is to grab the top and pull up gently. Grabbing the stocking top through the skirt doesn't work, so, looking around, you pull up your skirt hem, place your fingers in the stocking top and scoot it up. Smoothing the skirt back down, you reach into the waistband and snug up the garter belt to keep it from creeping back down. Finally, you run your hands down your skirt again to make sure it's back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your uniform, sweetie\" says a passenger who has walked up to the podium. \"Will the flight attendants on the flight be wearing those too?\" he asks. You look up to see a tall man in his 30s smiling at you. As you look up, you also notice a security camera you hadn't noticed before. It's pointed right at you with a single LED blinking slowly. That wasn't there earlier, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the whole airline is using them. It's a retro thing to help give you a feel for the full Verpletteren experience from days gone by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A feel?\" he asks. \"Hmm. Well, what I'd like to know is whether I could be moved from coach up to first class. I find the seats up there more shapely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well, let me...\" you start to say, then realize what his question was.  \"I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch the last part of your question.\" Without realizing it, you reach down, tug on your skirt and smooth it both front and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I said I find the first class seats to be a lot more comfortable than the ones in coach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tony, get your head into the game' you think to yourself. You can do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I'm sure we can do something for you.\" You take his name and enter it in the computer. The software was easy to manage, and in a minute or so you had put the man on a waiting list for a free upgrade. \"Check back 15 minutes before boarding sir, and I can tell you if the seat is available. I can offer it to you for free if it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Thank you miss\" he says, and heads to the waiting area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew. You did that well Tony, er, Lucy. You can do this.</span></div></div>",

You wave at Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but Mrs...\" (you look at her ticket) \"Aardappel has a bag that's too large to fit under seat. I don't know how to check it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy. Here.\" says Luna. Her fingers deftly move across the keyboard. A sticker pops out of the printer in the center of the podium. \"We stick this on the bag and take it over there -&gt;\" Luna says, pointing across the way. You pick up the bag, apply the sticker and carry the bag the 15 or 20 steps to where Luna is pointing. The uniform has a way of walking by itself, and you realize you're swinging your hips suggestively as you walk the short distance. You realize that people are watching you because you misstepped slightly (still not used to the heels) and heard a few women gasp and someone behind you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back after dropping off the bag, the men in line are smiling at you.</span></div></div>",

We can't fly with only three in the cabin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'll happen?\" you ask, fully aware that you have been checking in passengers for that flight.  \"Will the flight be cancelled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can't find another stewardess in the next 15 minutes, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, don't you have backups you can call on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, and we're trying, but we can't use anyone who has just flown in, as they've been on the go for the past 10 hours, and the only other one is out of town, so can't get here in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We use one of our ground staff from the airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, that's OK then.

The male passengers in the area are watching you too, although as you have your back to them, you're unaware of the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Luna,\" you say, \"one of us has to go - I understand that. I've flown on flights as a passenger before, but would it be okay with the other girls if a complete novice takes the shift?\"  You said 'other girls' without even realizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lucy, it will be fine. Lindsay is the shift leader. She's used to new girls and once we explain the situation, she'll be fine with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Luna. I think it will be a fun experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it will Lucy. You'll need a change of clothes though. You have an overnight stop - your uniform will be fine for the trip back of course, but do you have extra underwear &amp; stockings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, no Luna. I don't. All I have is the stuff I came to the airport in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed. \"That's what I thought. The hotel they'll put you up in is right next door to a Victoria's Secret. After you land, I suggest you head over there and get yourself something fresh for the trip back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of walking into a sexy women's underwear store scared the crap out of you. But still, would you be better off trying to figure out the complexity of the airline's computer system without Luna's help? No, you'd be better off in the plane serving drinks. No biggie.  \"Okay Luna, I think that's best option. Otherwise I'd probably send all these nice people to some god-awful place by mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Luna agreed. \"Lucy, I know you probably don't have any credit cards with you, so here's some cash to take care of expenses while you're on the ground.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You only have a few minutes before the flight is ready to board, so Luna takes your station by the computer. You pick up your bag of clothes. Really? Living the glamorous life of a stewardess with some boy's sweats and underwear in your ratty old backpack? You pick it up and Luna can tell by the look on your face that you see the same problem she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy\", she starts, \"would you like to borrow a bag for the flight? The airline gave us these funky old retro bags and I won't be needing it at the moment. I'll want it back, but you're free to borrow it for the flight if you'd like to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Luna!\" You haven't seen one of those round, flat bags since the ones in your sister's box of Barbie dolls. It seems awkward but it's better than a ragged pack you got at the clearance rack at REI. \"Is there some place I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish your sentence, Luna says \"Sure, you can leave your stuff in a locker in the bathroom. Over there.\" pointing to the employee's lounge. Thanking her, you take the two bags and head over there. Without thinking you head for the men's bathroom and push the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, what do you think you're doing?\" asks a tall man with stripes on his sleeves and an old fashioned leather aviator's cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. While Tony may have used this bathroom, Lucy certainly wouldn't be. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I have the wrong door.\" The man looks you over head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say cutie, the airline really has outdone themselves with the vintage stewardess uniforms. Unlike the ones they gave us.\" He made the face you'd expect from someone who had just eaten liverwurst ice cream and pointed to the leather aviator's hat. \"I think the suits are trying to mess with us. Pilots in the 70s would have worn proper hats, not these, these barnstorming chew toys.\" He looks at your name tag. \"Lucy is it? It's a pleasure meeting you. I'm Hank, Hank Krankzinnig, the pilot on flight 314.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh in spite of yourself. This handsome man is clearly undressing you with his eyes as you're making excuses for entering the men's room. \"Oh, um, hi Hank. Lucy Vanderhoek. I'll be on that flight, filling in. I guess I'm a little nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", you reply, \"I've been nervous lots of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank laughed. \"Yeah, that's one of my favorite movies too. And don't worry, I won't call you Shirley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, you had no idea what he's talking about. You turn away from the door and walk with him in the direction of the ladies' room. When you get there, you thank him for his kindness.  \"Oh it's okay Lucy\" he says. \"Always happy to meet one of the new girls.\"  As before when the uniform showed you how to walk like a girl, somehow it knows how to curtsey. You do, and Hank laughs. \"I like you Lucy, you have a marvelous sense of humor.\" And with that he turns and heads off towards the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, you open the ladies' room and walk in. There's a redhead not much older than you struggling with the zipper on her vintage dress. \"Oh, excuse me\" you say and divert your eyes. Then you realize that it's okay, you're wearing that same dress.  \"Can I get some help?\" she asks. Your mother always taught you to be helpful, so you head over to her. \"Here, let me get that\" you offer, and pull the zipper up for her. She thanks you and you try not to notice as she hikes up her dress and fastens the tops of her stockings. \"Thanks honey\", she coos. \"I don't think we've met. Are you new?\" You explain that you were ground crew and got an emergency assignment to the flight. \"Oh, then I hope we have to talk and get acquainted while we're in the air. Hey, thanks for the zip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and find the lockers. You stuff your backpack in the back of one and then head out towards the gates carrying Luna's airline bag. Luna waves you on and buzzes the door to let you on to the plane. As you walk by, Luna tells you to look for Lindsay, winks at you and wishes you luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready onboard is Hank, another man with the silly vintage helmet, a tall brunette with a tag that says 'Lindsay' and another girl. Lindsay comes up to you. \"Hello Lucy, thanks for helping out on short notice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's okay. Did Luna tell you that I haven't done this before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't had a chance to talk with her. It's no problem though. This flight is like any other. I assume you've flown this flight before - Hank recognized you as you were walking onboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Lindsay. I only just met Hank in the men's room, er, I mean I accidentally walked into the men's room and bumped into him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay scowls at you but then smiles. \"Oh, I see. Well, what you do on your time is your business Lucy.\" Then whispering, \"I want to hear all about it later\".  Hank is smiling at you from the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes are somewhat of a blur. Lindsay addresses the passengers with instructions. You follow her lead and fold down a jump seat as she does and try to act like you know what you're doing. Then Hank gets on the PA, tells you all about the weather and the plane begins to head down the runway. A few minutes later you're airborne. Lindsay unbuckles her belt, stands and folds up her seat. You do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, we're going to begin our complimentary snack and beverage service. Please remain seated while the cart is in the aisle. Thank you, and we'll be with you shortly.\" Lindsay motions you towards the back of the plane while she heads forward. You thought walking on those heels was tough on earth -- with the slight buffeting of the plane it was near impossible to keep your balance. You manage though, and get to the back. The other girl is already unfastening the cart from stowage.  A good thing too, as you would have never figured that out for yourself.</span></div></div>",

Her name is Jennifer, and she's a stunner - really feminine and always in a short skirt and heels. You'd happily walk over burning coals for her. Trouble is you know full well that you're not the pick of the bunch when it comes to boys.

She's really attractive and really girlie, but you've rarely seen her anywhere near a boy, most of the time accompanied by at least one other girl. When you asked a girl (that you'd tried dating previously) about Jennifer,  she just said that Jennifer's a lipstick, and left it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days you decide to approach her, but get a very pleasant but firm brush off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're not one to turn down a challenge, so you decide that you're going to get to know Jennifer, whether she likes it or not!

A picture of a quite attractive looking girl fills the computer screen. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/25/f3/58/25f358184856fd54d109d1b4dc9c8763.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/25/f3/58/25f35...</a> <br>\r\nAs you stop spinning, all you can do is gape at your revealed secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha, I knew it, you've got a crush on Kirsty!\" Amy exclaims triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty (the girl in the picture) is a year older than you at your school and one of your sister's oldest friends. You've had a crush on her forever but never really spoken to her. The past year has been hard for you since all your friends have got girlfriends and never seem to want to hang out, leaving you alone most of the time and the loneliness you felt only served to increase your longing for Kirsty. As far as you know she's never had a boyfriend which both encouraged you regarding her character but also discouraging you from asking her out as she (as far as you know) would almost certainly say no. Physically she's around 5 inches taller than you at 5ft 7 with an attractive but fairly unremarkable body. You get the impression she is kind hearted and funny from what your sister has told you about her and she always seems to wear more conservative clothes than most other girls at your school. Nevertheless you think she's the prettiest and coolest girl in school.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, its not what it looks like.\" you say regaining your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you were just stalking her account is that it? Just wait till I tell mom.\" she starts for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAIT!\" you yell. She stops and looks over her shoulder smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeees?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breathe, knowing you have to reveal you crush. \"Okay its true, I do have a crush on Kirsty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister spins round. \"Awww that's so cute. My little bro has a crush on one of my friends. I shouldn't so surprised I guess, this must be something every big sister has to go through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay you got me but please, you can't tell Kirsty.\" you say pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ever not?\" Amy laughs \"Its going to be the first thing I say to her tomorrow at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo please don't\" you say almost begging now. \"She'll think I'm a loser with you telling her but if I ask her she might...\" you trail off as in your nervousness you may have overshared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might say yes?\" she continues \"So you were planning on asking her out as well as drooling over her picture. Ooo, this is too good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no.\" you say again, tears starting to well up. \"I really like her and don't want you to ruin it, please sis\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's smile disappears at this and she looks at you with sympathy now rather than amusement. \"Alright Tony I won't ruin your chances with Kirsty.\" she says soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" you ask with a slight sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm not that cruel, if you really like her and you're not being a creepy weirdo for once in your life, I won't try and stop it - although if she says yes, she may have wished I had.\" She gives you a grin and a playful nudge at this which you return with a grateful smile. \"Anyway, family bonding over, mom sent me up to get you down for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just let me shut down.\" You carefully logout of facebook, ensuring that there is no way you could get caught while out of your room, and then head down with Amy for dinner filled with both great relief and hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy didn't tell you to leave Kirsty alone, or that she was out of your league which she has done with girls you've liked previously, which fills you with hope that she might think that Kirsty may like you too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before going in you made Amy swear again that she wouldn't try and sabotage things between you and Kirsty to put your mind at ease. You wait at the gates and meet a couple of your friends to see if they want to hang out or even walk home with you, but no such luck. Each of them in turn apologizes and then leaves with their respective girlfriend, leaving you to walk home alone. You would have felt insulted but it's happened so often that you don't even care anymore, so you trudge home alone. You decide to take the scenic route through the old church yard to clear your head. You have frequented this spot more and more in the last year. It gives you some seclusion and time alone with your thoughts. On reaching the church, you sit in your usual spot against the wall and close your eyes and sigh heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of dozing you hear crunching through the fallen leaves nearby. At first you ignore it thinking it a squirrel or something but the crunching gets louder and it soon becomes clear its too heavy for a critter and belongs to a person. The crunching gets closer seemingly metres away. Your eyes snap open in search of the source of the noise, weary that it may be a mugger or another sort of unsavory character considering your location. You look to the direction of the noise expecting to see a tramp or hobo but are shocked to see Kirsty, your crush, standing not 5 metres away from you, looking down at you while holding a leaf close to her face.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say, lost for words for two reasons. One that its your crush in front of you and another wondering what she is doing here in your quiet place. You watch her waiting for her to act first and she obliges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you just love Autumn?\" she says while taking a small sniff of the leaf she is holding before tossing it away. \"All the leaves are so pretty and the smell is like nature coming to life.\" She smiles down at you waiting for you to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah, I guess I never really noticed it before.\" you almost stammer, still in shock that you are actually having this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" She says undeterred and gestures to the spot next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. If you want to.\" you say not believing this is happening. You dig your thumb nail into one of your fingers discretely, just to make sure you aren't day dreaming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty walks over, takes off her bag and slumps down next to you. You squirm slightly at her closeness but luckily she doesn't notice. Your heart is racing. This is like one of your fantasies come true, you can't blow it. She turns to you \"So, what you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I come here sometimes to clear my head and think. How about you? What are you doing here?.... That is if you don't mind me asking.\" You add the end trying not to be too forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I came here looking for you.\" she says boldly with a smile. You choke slightly at this. \"Yeah, your sister told me this is where you would most likely be and after the things she told me, I thought it would be good if we talked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoom and dread fill you as well as anger. After all she said, she still ruined it. She was going to get it when you got home. \"Ermm... I'm er sorry I didn't mean to... I mean I was only...\" You stutter trying to make excuses to save face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only laughs at your inability to string a sentence. \"Don't worry. It was all good what she told me, which is why I'm here. I was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's as if time freezes. You have gone from furiously back peddling to being asked on a date. What did your sister say to her. \"Why?\" is the only thing you can think of saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your sister told me you were a nice guy and if a sister says that it must be true. Besides I think you're cute.\" This last part causes you to blush noticeably and a goofy grin to spread across your face. Kirsty just laughs again at this. \"So do want to go a date or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you say much too enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Kirsty says standing up. \"I was thinking the movies, how does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me\" you say, not caring at all about the venue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, let's get you up.\" she extends her hand to you, offering to help you up. You gratefully accept and let her help you on your feet. As you stand the height difference between you two becomes apparent - Kirsty is around five inches taller than you. Stopping your thoughts in their tracks, Kirsty takes hold of your hand in hers and starts to walk. \"Come on, let's get going.\" she says brightly, leading you by the hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're a bit overwhelmed by what's happening. Far from you asking Kirsty out - which you realize would probably never have happened - she's now asked you out, and you're off to see a movie with her.  Somehow you don't really care what film you see - it could be a kiddies cartoon or the soppiest girlie flick for all you care. You're just well pleased that at last you're going out with your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way you text you mom to tell her you're be late home. A minute later she sends a text back to tell you she already knew - Amy had told her earlier. Hmm, maybe a word with your sister later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the cinema and Kirsty pays for both tickets, refusing your offer to pay for yours. She then buys drinks and a huge box of popcorn, and leads you in. The lights are already down for the trailers, although you can see it's actually quite quiet. Kirsty selects a row near the back which has nobody sitting anywhere close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the trailers finish. \"Don't forget to turn your phone off.\" Kirsty says, just before the prompt comes up on the screen. \"Oh, yeah. Thanks.\" you reply and reach into your bag, pull out your phone and press the power button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie starts, and for a few minutes you watch the screen trying to establish what it is you're watching, and let the introduction to the storyline unfold. Then you feel Kirsty's hand reach out and gently grasp yours, and which point you loose interest in the storyline, and just feel happy to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie progresses, and you go back to following the story again. Over the course of around twenty minutes Kirsty moved on from holding your hand to wrapping one arm around yours, and then putting one arm around your shoulders. On screen there's a bit of suspense in the action, with the movie's female lead suddenly in danger. As if on cue, you find yourself being gently pulled in closer to Kirsty, as if she's a bit frightened and in need of someone to hold... or maybe she thinks you may want to be held a bit tighter. Either way, you find that your head is resting against her shoulder, and then she gives you a gentle kiss on your forehead. You want to pinch yourself, as surely this cannot really be happening. It's like you've won the lottery - the girl of your dreams has just kissed you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to ruin everything, so you cuddle into her rather than kissing her back, and decide to let things progress at Kirsty's pace. After a few minutes you're aware of something at the side of your neck. Then you feel a kiss there, and another.  The thought occurs to you that surely it should be you taking the lead if there's any amorous activity going on, not letting the girl take over. You raise your head slightly and look up into Kirsty's face. You open your mouth slightly to say something, but realize that you don't really know what to say. By the time your brain has decided not to say anything Kirsty has locked her lips to your, and started kissing you. It lasts for only a few seconds, and she pulls back. \"You OK?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Is she kidding? You're on cloud 9, kissing the girls of your dreams, and she's asking if you're OK?  In reality you smile your slightly goofy smile at her and nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be what she wanted, and her lips instantly re-attach to yours, but this time you can feel her tongue probing and then reaching into your month. Oh crap, she's French kissing you! You try to reciprocate although you've never done this before, so you're not really sure how well you're doing. Well, she's not complaining, and she hasn't backed off, so hopefully OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kirsty next breaks off (which you're actually quite pleased about as it gives you a chance to breathe!) you realize why Kirsty wanted to sit where you did. Everyone else in the theater is seated in front of you, and it's actually quite dark at the back. So, is this what she had planned? Not that you're complaining. You just wish it had been you who'd thought to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face Kirsty and pucker up again as you lift your head to hers. Her lips meet yours again, but as well as kissing you, you can feel her hands gently caressing your shoulders and neck, and then making their way down your torso. Then you can feel her hands inside your shirt. Crap, she's one step ahead of you again! Then her hands reach your nipples and you can feel her fingers circling each of them, and every so often squeezing them. You realize at this point that Kirsty has the upper hand here, and for some reason you're conscious of the developing lump in your pants, and hoping that Kirsty won't find it somehow offensive. Again you try to copy what she's done. You feel around her body with your hands, trying to work out how to get inside her top - but without success. Then you feel one of her hands gently grasp yours, pull it to the bottom button of her shirt, and place your fingers around the button.  You don't need any more guidance and gradually undo each button from the bottom upwards until you can reach inside comfortably and caress her skin.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 </span></div></div>",

You can feel the gentle curve of her breasts, but before you reach her nipples she shifts her position slightly, making her breasts just out of your reach. Instead you can run one hand up and down her back, and from the slightly more relaxed posture you reckon she likes that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you are aware that this is not quite so intimate, so you're not sure if you've done something wrong, or at least not quite to Kirsty's liking. Then she gently stops you. \"This is nice,\" she says, \"but I think that's probably enough for our first date.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst a bit disappointed, you must admit that it had far exceeded any expectations you may have had for a first date, so decide not to say anything out of place. You both re-button your shirts, tuck them in, and watch the remainder of the movie, with Kirsty holding your hand. Yes, she's definitely holding your hand, not the other way around. You don't really follow what's happening in the film, as you'd missed chunks of it, and are still buzzing in a combination of excitement and happiness. Soon afterwards the movie comes to an end. You are at least glad it wasn't one you wanted to see, as pretty much all you saw of it was the beginning and the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both leave the cinema, and you wonder if you should offer to take Kirsty somewhere else, maybe for something to eat.  Before you actually decide on what to do Kirsty grabs your hand, and starts leading you forwards. \"You fancy something to eat?\" she asks.\"Pizza do you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, sure...\" you reply, somewhat taken back by Kirsty again being ahead of you in taking the initiative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls you towards the food court, scans around, and then heads for an empty table. \"You sit here and save the table for us. I'll be right back.\" And with that she makes a beeline for the pizza vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you're a bit frustrated that Kirsty is somehow in control, and you're playing catch up. It's not what you'd planned. Well, actually you hadn't planned anything. Up to this afternoon you had fantasized a bit about Kirsty, and tried to imagine what it might be like to kiss her, but that was pretty much it. Not what you'd do on a date. You decide that for today you'll just let Kirsty lead, as she seems to know what she's doing, and next time (well, assuming there is a next time...) you'll do a better job of planning something, and show her you can be a bit more dominant and in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty returns with a large slice of pepperoni pizza and a drink each.  \"Hope you're OK with pepperoni?\" she says. <br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fine, thanks.\" you respond.                  <br>\r\n\"Good, thought it would be better if we both have the same topping. I hate mixing flavors when I kiss someone.\"<br>\r\nIt take you a second or two to work out what she means, and as you look at her she gives you a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the meal Kirsty asks you questions about yourself, and gives you a bit of background about her too, and you spend quite a while chatting away, feeling quite comfortable, telling her a bit more about yourself than you had told most of your friends. Meanwhile you find out that she loves nature, is very competitive, likes outdoor sports, doesn't have any brothers or sisters, and thinks you're nice. You could almost imagine that she'd said cute, but don't think she did. Just something gives you that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you glance at your watch, and realize you've been here for nearly two hours! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty notices what you did, and your slightly surprised expression. \"Oh, I'm sorry!\" she says, \"I think we lost track of time a bit. Maybe we should be getting you home now. Don't want to keep you out too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no that's OK.\" you reply, a bit flustered. \"It's not that late. Besides, it's the weekend, so I don't have to get up early tomorrow. And I don't have to get home yet, anyway.\" Oh crap. you realize you're starting to gabble, so decide to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Tony. Amy told me your mom wants you home by 10, and there's still plenty of time, so no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not worried!\" you retort back. I was just checking what the time was, that was all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize though that the mood seems to have changed, and there's no way you'll be able to carry on the conversation as it was. Kirsty clearly thinks the same. She clears the plates and cups from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably time to go anyway.\" she says. \"Do you need the rest room before we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no I'm... well, actually yeah, I do.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Me too. We may as well go together then.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" you reply, not entirely understanding her meaning.<br>\r\n\"We could both go at the same time, rather than hogging the table. Just need to take ours bags with us.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah. OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your bag, and you both leave the table together, and head to the rest rooms. Five minutes later you are both ready to leave the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you leave the mall you try to work out what will happen next. You know that being on a date with a girl you really should offer to walk her home, but recent experience suggests that you may receive a very pleasant rebuttal and have the entire situation reversed. So instead you decide to stick with the tenuous plan you worked out earlier, which was to do nothing and let Kirsty take the lead. You feel a bit guilty about doing do, but reckon that she is a year older than you, so doesn't need you to protect or guide her. Besides, she seems a bit more clued up that you are anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're outside the mall, rather than stopping to make any offers for walking anyone home, Kirsty grabs hold of your hand, and starts leading you down the road, in the direction of your home. You then realize that you don't actually know where Kirsty lives. Good job you hadn't offered to walk her home without knowing how far away she lives, or in which direction. That could have been a late night if you weren't careful!  Unfortunately what she's said earlier was true - your mom had set a curfew of 10 o'clock - that's the standing arrangement she has for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk along Kirsty points out and remarks about some of the places you go past, and it's clear she knows a lot more about your neighborhood than you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing over the weekend?\" she then asks you. Your heart seems to skip a beat...  <br>\r\n\"Um, nothing planned.\" you reply, wondering what will come next.   <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kirsty replies, \"I just wondered if you'd like to go out with me again? I thought we could perhaps go to the wilderness reserve or something. That is, if you'd like that?\" For the first time all evening you can detect an underlying uncertainty in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" you exclaim without realizing it. \"Um, I mean, yes, that would be nice. I'd like that. Thank you.\"  you can feel yourself blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty smiles, and she seems just a little more relaxed now. \"OK. I'll come over and collect you in the morning. May be around 10?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" You reply, realizing that Kirsty is now taking the initiative for tomorrow as well as today. You'd better do something, say something, that could give you a bit more control over what you're going to do tomorrow. \"I'll bring...\" you start, but are a bit unsure what you'll bring, so pause for a second, and within that instant Kirsty jumps in. \"You just bring yourself, Tony, and let me sort out everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, foiled again. Another chance missed.  You then realize that you've reach your road, so this evening is about to come to an end. \"Um, do you want to...\" you start, intending to suggest that Kirsty may want to come inside (after all it's not as if she's a stranger to the family). However, Kirsty clear has a different thought. \"Oh, there's an offer I cannot refuse.\" she says and immediately clamps her lips to yours and wraps her arms around you. You can feel your body relax into her hold and almost go limp as you enjoy another embrace, and can again feel Kirsty's tongue exploring your mouth.  This time you decide that you'll just enjoy the experience rather than trying to match anything she's doing. After a couple of very enjoyable minutes she breaks free, gives you a few final kisses, and tells you it's probably time to say goodnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are somewhere between a very happy and very sad place as she says that. Happy because you have been enjoying yourself more than ever before, and sad because its coming to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really time I wasn't here now, but I'll come back for you in the morning sweetie. Have a good night's sleep.\" She kisses you again, and you separate. You head up the drive to your house, and turn to find Kirsty still at the bottom of the drive. She blows a kiss, and waves.  You wave back, then head inside, feeling really happy again.     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

But eventually you settle down and sleep through to the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awoken by Amy opening the blinds in your room. <br>\r\n\"What you do that for?\" you ask, bleary eyed.  <br>\r\n\"Well, I believe things went quite well last night for my little brother, and you have another date today?  Well, We want you to have a chance to wash properly, tidy up your hair, and be presentable to your new girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n\"She's not my girlfriend. I just went on a date with her, that's all!\" you retort. <br>\r\n\"OK. If that's what you're saying. According to Kirsty's Facebook page it's a bit more serious than that!\"  Well, that wakes you up. You know Kirsty's Facebook page very well. After all, it was your sister finding you looking at it that actually lead to you having the date. It takes you a matter of seconds to flip open your computer, and navigate to the page, and check her relationship status. Ah, it says she's in a relationship. Well, two days ago it said 'single'. You know that for a fact as you had checked it then, as you had pretty much every time you'd accessed her Facebook page for the past couple of months or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it doesn't say it's me.\" you say. Oh crap. what if she's now in a relationship with someone else, and last night was just a favor to Amy. \"It could be a relationship with anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Amy replies. \"Status updated at around 10.30 last night. Last post at the same time. Think its a safe bet who she's referring to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check her last post. \"Spent a lovely evening with my new sweetie. Looking forward to more of the same over the weekend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing over the weekend then?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\nYou blush slightly. Then realizing she'd just ask Kirsty if you don't tell her, you say \"We're going to the wilderness reserve.\"  Somehow that doesn't seem enough. \"Um, to watch the animals, and do some walking.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK. And the birds?\" <br>\r\n\"Um, well, yes, or course.\"<br>\r\n\"And the bees?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, not really. Maybe the butterfli.. oh.  Shut up Amy. We're just going to have a day out, that's all.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm only kidding!  You lovebirds go and enjoy yourselves however you want.\"<br>\r\nThe look on your face tells Amy that she's starting to push just a little too hard, and perhaps it's time for a swift exit. She heads for the door, and as she leaves she turns her head back to you, saying\" Oh, mom says have a shower and wash your hair. Forecast is good, so a Tee should be fine, and shorts unless you're trekking up the valley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she's gone. <i>Thank goodness</i>, you say to yourself. Well, you were intending to have a shower anyway. You don't need your mom telling you to do that. As for your hair, besides needing a wash, it could really do with a cut. You've been putting it off for a while, but over the past few days it seems to have had a bit of a growing spurt of its own. Not much you can really do about it this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the bathroom, and emerge 15 minutes later as clean as a pin, with a mop of clean but straggly long hair. You return to your bedroom, and dig out a Tee that you think may be appropriate to wear. Well the only one really relevant to the great outdoors was one you brought back from vacation last year, with \"Fort Wilderness\" emblazoned across the front. It's a touch tighter fit than it had been when you got it, but you reckon it's OK. You have a mental debate about whether to wear jeans or shorts, but decide to opt for the shorts, as it does look like it'll be a pretty warm day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you head for the kitchen for some breakfast. Both Amy and your mom are there. Amy doesn't say a word, but she does wink at you. Your mom looks at you, and then...      <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

I'd look like a girl! Besides, my hair isn't that long.\"<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ. It's plenty long enough for a boy. If you insist on letting it grow any longer I'll start calling you Antonia instead of Anthony. But if you're going to be fussy about it I'll put it into a knot instead.\" You can feel you hair being pulled back again as your mom pulls it through a hairband, and then twists your ponytail back, securing it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, all done. That should keep it tidier during the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you weren't bothered about tidying your hair up, a quick glance in a mirror does actually confirm it looks a lot better pulled back, and it keeps the long strands out of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, is that better?\" your mom asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes mom. Thanks mom.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. The weather should be sunny today so you'd better take a hat with you. Now, is there anything else you'd need?\"<br>\r\nYou can see Amy mouthing something behind your mom that looks suspiciously like <i>rubba</i>, but you can't quite work out what. You decide to ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your mom has picked up a bottle of sunscreen and is slapping some on your forehead and cheeks. Then she insists on applying a sunscreen lip balm for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at the time! Kirsty will be here any minute. Have you got your phone and money, and a clean hankie? And you'd better take some water with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this won't all fit in your pockets you grab a small backpack from the coat rack, and load everything in to it. You also grab a baseball hat. It'll give you a bit of shade but also hide the knot your mom has put in your hair. OK, so fingers crossed you're now ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

It's one minute to ten, so you reckon it must be Kirsty. \"I'll answer it.\" you say, to nobody in particular, and head rapidly to the door, as your heart rate increases a little. You open the door. The daylight shining in is partially eclipsed by the shape of the new love of your life.  <br>\r\n\"Morning sweetie. How are you today?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Um, morning, um, Kirsty.\" you utter in response. How come she can call you sweetie as easily and smoothly as anything, but you can't think of anything appropriate to call her - well, apart from her actual name. You look at her, and take in what she looks like when not in school uniform. She's wearing a blue hiking hat, a long sleeved mid blue tee shirt under a short sleeved blue and white checked button down shirt and blue leggings, finished off with hiking shoes and ribbed mid-calf length socks. You've got to admit she looks really good, and eminently more suited to a hike in the wilderness reserve that you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just about ready to go?\" she asks, enthusiastically. \"Thought we might ride there...  you have got a bike, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, of course.\" you reply. <br>\r\n\"Great, then let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around to the garage door, pull it open, and pull out your bike. You slip your arms through the straps on the backpack so its secure on your back, pull down the baseball hat on your head, and reckon you're ready to go.  By this time Kirsty has mounted her bike, and is waiting at the foot of your drive. \"You OK off-road?\" she asks. You nod in response. \"OK, race you to the reserve...\" and she's off, first a short distance down the road but then veering off onto the dirt track leading towards the reserve. You're caught slightly off guard but soon jump on your bike and chase after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later you reach the perimeter fence to the reserve where Kirsty is waiting for you, having reached there ahead of you, despite you best attempts to catch her up. You both go through the gate, and park your bikes inside. From here on you have to walk, which to be honest suits you a bit better. Whilst you didn't mind the rear view of Kirsty as she was cycling along, you would much prefer walking alongside her, which strikes you of more the sort of thing you ought to do on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lock your bike. Kirsty has already secured hers, and is waiting with her hand outstretched towards you. \"You OK sweetie?\" she asks. \"I didn't go too fast for you did I?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Good, as we could have a fair bit of walking now - although that depends on what you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you had assumed you were going to walk around the reserve looking for any birds or animals and maybe sit in the meadow area. \"Um, what had you in mind?\" you ask.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are three immediate options I can think of...\" Kirsty says. \"If you remembered to bring your binoculars we could head to the hides and try to spot some birds. Mind you, if the hides are as quiet as usual then I could probably take advantage of you in the dark there. Or we could go to the marshy area looking for wading birds. The reeds would act as a good shield, so nobody would notice us when we get down and dirty... Or we could just go to the meadow and lie in the long grass at the top of the hill away from everyone else.\" She pauses for a couple of seconds, and then continues..  \"Its not overlooked there, so nobody would notice me stripping your clothes off you... The choice is yours really...\" she looks at you most sweetly waiting for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK. so not quite what you'd anticipated for the day out, but certainly quite an appealing choice... You struggle to decide but finally opt to... <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Besides, they're not what you'd call private, as you can't tell if someone's about to come in until, well, until they're in.  The meadow is similarly not what you'd call secluded or private. It's probably the busiest part of the reserve, and whilst not bustling, it does have several visitors.  Hmm, the marshes are actually the least visited part. There are a couple of hides by the lake, but otherwise to your knowledge nobody really ever goes there.  So, based on what Kirsty appears to be considering - a continuation of what you did last night in the cinema - then the marshes would be best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Kirsty that, having consider each of the options, down and dirty sounds good - although without really knowing what she had in mind when she phrased that option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sounds good to me.\" Kirsty replies. She pulls her backpack onto one shoulder, and for the first time you realize how big it is - easily around 3 times bigger than your bag. You briefly wonder what she has in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head off together towards the lake, then along the shoreline to the hides, passing behind these and carrying on until you're virtually out of sight of them. Kirsty then directs you off the gravel path, and you see a little clearing in the reeds. Wow, you'd never have noticed this had it not been pointed out to you. Off the path the ground is softer, in fact quite spongy, and there are little waterways all around.  You head into the clearing. It seems to be lined with reeds, or rather a number of the reeds have been cut down or fallen over, and become flattened across the floor. \"OK, cool.\" you say, and immediate sit down on the reed floor. Kirsty is standing at the entrance to the clearing fiddling with her backpack, trying to pull something out from it. Within a couple of seconds you realize you'd made a bit of a mistake. The ground is soft and spongy for a reason - its barely above water level and quite saturated, and the reeds on the ground do little to stop the dampness  - you can feel that your shorts are damp already where you sat down. \"Oh crap.\" you mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty notices that you said something and looks up from her bag towards you. \"Do you want to help me lay out the groundsheet before we sit down? Although you seem to have pre-empted that slightly. Isn't it a bit damp down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now you come to mention it...\" You stand up, and she can see the damp patch on your backside. <br>\r\n\"Ah, a moment too late.\" she says. \"Here, grab that edge.\" Between you you lay out the groundsheet on the reeds. \"Now we can sit down in the dry...\" Kirsty says, \"although its clearly of no real benefit to you now. Hmm, you know you shouldn't sit around in damp clothes, don't you? Hasn't your mom told you that?  I really think it would be best to get you out of those shorts as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's keeping an absolutely straight face so you're not entirely sure if she is being serious about the damp shorts, or actually teasing you.  Whilst the thought of one or both of you ending up removing items of clothing had occurred to you as a possible outcome during the day, you'd vaguely hoped Kirsty would be the first to remove something, and possibly not quite so quickly as this anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, they're not bad. \" you reply. \"Besides, they'll dry in the sunshine soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty sighs and seems to shrug. \"Shucks, fell at the first hurdle. I'd have to work harder on my persuasive skills.\" She gives you a sly wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, lifts a small pair of binoculars to her eyes and scans around. \"Lets see what's going on around here then.\" Standing she is just tall enough to see over most of the reeds, so can see all around you. After a minute or so, she drops them from her eyes. \"Couple of waders out on the lake. Other than that its pretty much dead around here. So, what do you fancy doing? You could borrow these and have a scan if you'd like,\" indicating her binoculars, \"we could sit quietly waiting for something to head closer to us, or you could do what you know you should for the sake of your health and well being and get out of those wet shorts...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel that the dampness is not confined to just your shorts, but has seeped through to the back of your boxers, so if you take one off then you'd probably have to take both off, and you're really not sure if you're ready to strip quite so early in the relationship with your new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, OK, so what do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Knowing you're luck you'd tell her you spotted something that only visits seasonally, and if she didn't realize you're sure Amy would point out the anomaly to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, here you go.\" Kirsty passes the binoculars to you. The reeds are blocking the view a bit whilst you're sat down, so you stand up to scan a bit further afield. You put the binoculars to your eyes, pull the eyepieces together slightly, and start looking around. As you turn to look across the lake Kirsty ducks out of your way, and ends up standing behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's this?\" Kirsty asks, and you feel her lifting the back of your baseball hat. Oh grief, you'd forgotten about the bun your mom had tied your hair back in. <br>\r\n\"It's nothing. It's just to keep my hair tidy. It's got a bit long, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nothing. It's sacrilege!

You can tell she'd done something but you're not entirely sure what.  \"That's better. It you have enough hair for a ponytail, then have a ponytail, don't double knot it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach a hand behind your head, and realize what she's done. She's undone the bun, and passed the ponytail between the hat and the strap, which emphasises the length of it even more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I carry on looking now?\" you ask, returning the binoculars to your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done anything to stop you... You carry on, and just ignore me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scan around, and can see a couple of moorhens, and some ducks, but no wading birds at all, or any buntings or other birds that may hang around in the reeds. You know Kirsty is behind you but you're trying to blot her our for a minute - plenty of time later. Then you realize... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

So, you're standing in the little clearing in the reeds with a pair of binoculars to your eyes scanning the distance to see what birds or wildlife may be lurking around, accepting that you're temporarily trying to ignore perhaps the primary reason you're here. Well, not ignoring, but choosing to focus your attention on something else for the moment despite the intense longing to put everything else on hold and grab Kirsty. After releasing your ponytail you suspect (hope) she is still looking at you, which makes you straighten your back a little, making you perhaps an inch taller - although still noticeably shorter than Kirsty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything interesting happening?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, a couple of ducks out on the lake, but otherwise not a lot.\" you respond. Whilst you were already aware she was fairly close behind you, you can now feel her getting even closer and making contact with your back, then her hands reach around either side of you, coming to rest over you chest.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OK, any interesting now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well there's definitely some activity now, but its quite subtle so I might have to ignore it.\"  With that her fingers start to caress your nipples through your tee shirt, and you feel her kissing the back of your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh. Yes, definitely some activity now,\" you continue, \"but still what you might call background activity...\"  With that each of Kirsty's hands swiftly retract, only to locate the bottom edge of your tee shirt, and then return to their position<i> inside</i> your tee, again fingering your nipples, and with a lot more vigor. You can also feel Kirsty pulling you gently backwards against her body, and starts kissing behind one of your ears. Hmm, probably as well you're this way around, you consider. If you were <i>behind</i> Kirsty the growing bulge in your shorts would potentially get in the way of contact against her smooth contours. Well, at least you imagine it would.  You're unsure whether to carry on the (now pretense) of trying to bird watch through the binoculars, or to turn and embrance Kirsty. A little tweak on one of your nipples has the result of you uttering a verbal sigh, and your resolve to stand tall wavers slightly, and you feel yourself sinking slightly more into the contours of Kirsty's body behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel one of Kirsty's hands running down your tummy and realize that holding the binoculars is putting you at a very significant disadvantage, as you have no free hands, but Kirsty has both free. You then feel her gently grasping your crutch, and you decide that your time bird watching has definitely reached its end for now. However, rather than being able to do much yourself, you realize that Kirsty has you in quite a firm, albeit very comfortable, position, and without tearing yourself free of her, there's actually not much you can do at the moment - well, other than enjoy it. Both of her hands are now running up and down your tummy and chest, alternately tickling your nipples or clutching your bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You suddenly find your legs are very wobbly, and you reach your arms out towards Kirsty, wrapping around her waist.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Kirsty continues in her quite mellow tone. \"Despite your best endeavors to do so I don't think wearing damp shorts is a good idea...\" With a smooth swift motion she reaches down, undoes the button on the waist of your shorts, and a swift yank results in them being deposited on the floor around your ankles. \"You really should have listened to me earlier.\" Her hands return to their previous position clutching your buttocks. \"Hmm, not wishing to point out the obvious but these are a bit on the damp side too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that in a few seconds you will be totally naked whilst Kirsty remains fully dressed hits you, and you feel this is getting distinctly one-sided, and verging on her taking unfair advantage of you. You instantly move your hands to clamp the sides of your boxers to prevent them heading the same way as your shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can live with them for the moment.\" you reply. However, now you're stuck. You want to undo the buttons on Kirsty's shirt, or at least undo or open something to even things up a bit, but you'll need to release hold of your boxers to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the end you decide the only way is to challenge her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're taking unfair advantage here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. That's a bit harsh.\" Kirsty retorts, and you have a sudden concern that maybe you've said the wrong thing. \"I would never take <i>unfair</i> advantage of anyone!  Taking <i>full</i> advantage of opportunities presented, perhaps. If you feel there's a slight imbalance, then that's your issue.\" She pauses for a second or two, as if considering something. \"OK. So I think it took about 15 seconds to get your shirt and shorts off. So to be totally fair to you, I've give you double that time to try to even things up.\" She winks at you, then steps back a couple of inches and hangs her arms loosely by her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so that strategy worked. You immediately target her button down shirt, and rather than doing what you had originally considered (unbuttoning it) you grab the bottom edge and pull it upwards. She allows her arms to lift with the material and you pull it off of her. You then repeat the same action with her tee shirt revealing a dusty blue bra over her nicely bronzed torso. Now its a question of what next - the bra or leggings? You decide the bra would be easier done later on, but the leggings could be more complicated to remove so you target them next.  Logic suggests you start at the waist band, so you ease your fingers around the edge and try to work them down over her hips. To your surprise the material is very and pliable and you are able to pull Kirsty's leggings down far easier than you had anticipated, now revealing <i>her </i>underwear - a pair of boy shorts the same color as her bra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Time's up I think.\" she says, \"I'd suggest that before we trip over our our feet we disentangle things from around our ankles, and then perhaps sit down?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift one foot from your shorts, and then the other, thinking you must look pretty stupid in just your red and white striped jersey boxers plus socks and trainers. You then look at Kirsty, who lowered herself to a seated position before fully removing her leggings, which inevitably also meant she had to remove her hiking socks and boots. You decide that she looks anything but stupid in just her underwear.  You sit down beside her, your eyes now drawn to her bra - not because she has a huge breasts, but pretty much the opposite. She's far from well endowed, and her bra is actually padded. Somehow this makes you feel a bit better. The thought that she is somehow not 'perfect' is actually a bit of a relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny for your thoughts?\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I mean I wasn't really thinking.\" You can feel yourself starting to blush. \"OK, I was thinking, but I wasn't thinking of anything...\"  You realize you're at risk of digging yourself into a hole. \"I like your underwear.\" you finally blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kirsty replies. \"You're welcome to borrow it any time if you'd like.\"  She seems to have her poker face on again, and you can feel yourself blushing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean I like your underwear on you. The color suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually you immediate realize you'd said the wrong thing, as you'd really prefer for her underwear <i>not</i> to be on her. OK, possibly best not to verbalize that thought quite yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she responds. \"If we're sharing compliments than I think your boxers are cute too, but to be honest I think I'd prefer you without them.\"  Oh crap. She's done it again. Said what you're afraid to, for fear of overstepping your imaginary boundaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, me too...\" you respond, and immediately realize what you've said. \"I mean, I'd prefer you without them. Um, your underwear, I mean, not my boxers.  Oh crap. I think I'd better just shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty is smiling at you, clearing amused by your embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a kiss...\" she says, puckering up to you. OK, that you can cope with, and are happy to comply.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact you start talking to each other much more than you have so far, telling each other about yourselves, your likes and dislikes, and stories from when you were younger. One thing you notice is that Kirsty doesn't mention any previous boyfriends, although you'd pretty sure she must have had some... However, you are also loathe to admit your previous relationships.. well, relationship. It was serious in so far as it was a definite boyfriend / girlfriend relationship, although you were only about 13, it lasted less than a month, and the furthest you got was French kissing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also doesn't mention anything about her fairly underdeveloped chest - although on considering that point why would she? After all, it's only your preconception that all sexy girls would have bigger tits. Now that you're getting to know Kirsty, it doesn't seem a big deal any more. She's really pretty as she is, and having bigger tits would somehow distract from that prettiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour lying in the sun, cuddling and kissing and talking, Kirsty sits up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, that was an oversight. I guess you didn't put any suncream on your shoulders or back, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. Mom, I mean, I, only put some on my face and forehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. My fault. I should have thought of it sooner.

Mind you, you'd have to stop cuddling for a while until it soaks in, plus you're worried the current easy going mood would somehow dissipate...  You have to admit the thought of putting on Kirsty's tee does have a strange appeal - not that you have any particular fetish for girls clothes, but just because it's hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, OK,\" you tell her. \"Maybe I could cover up a bit, and if your tee is on offer I'll take it.\" Then you realize that if you need to cover up, surely Kirsty should as well. \"But don't you need it yourself?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. This time of year I rub in a once-a-day formula first thing, so I'm good for the day. You're welcome to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up her long sleeved tee and pull it on over your head and pull it down. You notice two things. First how soft it is against your skin compared to your own shirts, and secondly that it has a subtle perfume smell to it, which you find quite nice. You make a comment to Kirsty about the softness, but decide not to mention the perfume. It also seems to fit really well, which is pretty weird. Kirsty is obviously a little bigger than you - well, taller anyway,  and definitely a different shape, but there's no obvious spare capacity at the front. You cast a glance at her, trying to assess how much bigger her breasts are compared to your chest. Well, truth be told, not much bigger, but there must be a difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you thinking now?\" Kirsty asks, having noticed your glances and thoughtful expression. After last time when you got yourself into a right state explaining what you weren't thinking you decide to come clean this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Don't laugh. I was just thinking that your tee shirt fits you but it also fits me, although we're, um, different sizes.  I was just sort of comparing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the size of our respective lumps and bumps?\" Kirsty continues, completing the sentence. \"You'd be surprised how little difference there is between us. If I'd brought a tape measure I could show you - I reckon there's only a couple of inches difference.\" She seems to sigh and her shoulders drop ever so slightly. \"Look, I don't want to shatter any illusions you may have, but under this,\" she indicates her bra, \"there isn't much to write home about.\" Your eyes are inevitably drawn to her bra, and, ok, perhaps not huge, you can clearly see the curved bulges of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Tony. I'm up here....\" You pull your focus from Kirsty's bra and look back up to her face. \"Hello, again.\" she says, as she sees she has your attention back.  \"I really don't get the fascination boys have staring at bras. It's not as if you can see anything. I could understand it more if I wasn't wearing one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if it would make you feel better, I'd be happy if you take it off....\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I'll think about that... Anyway, the point I was trying to make was that there's not a lot of difference in size between us. The bra adds a bit, but it's mostly illusionary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" you ask, not entirely sure what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bra pushes everything up a bit at bit which gives the illusion of the cleavage, and it's padded with gel which gives it more substance. It could even make you look like you've got breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression indicates a sense of disbelief. OK, she might not be big, but you can clearly see her cleavage, and the shape of her breasts, so what is she on about? She has boobs; you don't. That's pretty much it, surely? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so you're not convinced. Maybe, hmm. OK, here's a proposition for you...\"  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Am I going too fast for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're not going to admit that she is, even if she is. But you don't need more than a second to work out that Kirsty will take her bra off, but wants you to put it on instead. You've got to admit its a roundabout way of proving a point, but the end result would be that as long as you have her bra, she won't, which to your reckoning seems a good move.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" you say. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Take my tee off again.\" As you do that, Kirsty unclasps the buckle at the back of her bra, and pulls the straps over her arms, leaving her breasts exposed, and holding out her bra towards you in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no real choice but to stare at her breasts. OK, so she's right, they are quite small, two gentle mounds each topped with a perky nipple. However, regardless of their size you reckon they are really gorgeous and you are quite entranced by the sight of them. After a minute Kirsty decides that you've ogled long enough, and repeats her previous \"Ahem.\" to get your attention.  She wiggles her bra in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a hand if you'd like. The buckle's hell to do up if you don't know what your doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, the other part of the deal. You take the bra from her, and put one arm through a strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, silly.

She adjusts the straps slightly, then stands back. \"There, all done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and are surprised that the bra does seem to have lifted your chest slightly, and the gel does seem to be giving the impression of a shape that certainly wasn't there before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now put the tee back on,\" Kirsty instructs, \"and we'll see if it still fits you OK.\" You comply.  \"So, how does it fit now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you have to admit it seems to fit as well now as before, although now (as Kirsty had suggested) it does look like you've got boobs, albeit quite modest. \"OK, guess you're right...  about everything...\" you add, before she starts looking for anything more detailed. \"It <i>isn't</i> a magic shirt, the bra <i>does</i> make things looks different, we <i>are</i> about the same size, and you have a lovely chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, don't think I suggested that one, but thank you.  So, how's the bra? I can loosen it a bit if its too tight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually apart from the sensation of the straps over your shoulders it seems quite comfortable. \"No, its good. Just a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so now that we have that little question resolved satisfactorily, what would you like to do?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh? Did she really ask that? She's sitting beside you, now wearing only her little blue boy short style panties, seemingly enjoying you looking at her breasts, and she's asking what you'd like to do?     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're not sure what you're going to say to Kirsty, but what you'd really like to do now would be...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

So, you're feeling quite pleased with yourself. You've managed to turn the previous situation around, and instead of Kirsty being in control, you now feel you have the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, perhaps it wasn't actually your intention to end up wearing Kirsty's bra and tee, but it's actually cool to be wearing her stuff, and besides if you're wearing it then she can't... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how do you now persuade her to remove her panties?  This could be more complex. What was it she said earlier, about comparing lumps and bumps.  Her little bumps, well, actually her nipples, are now jiggling in front of you. How can you... Um, how can you  persuade her.... Um... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kirsty says, interrupting your deliberations, \"If you can't decide what you'd like to do, maybe I should give you some suggestions...\" With that she pushes you from your seated position onto your back. She then sits astride you, and leans down so that her breasts (which suddenly seem a lot fuller than before) are hanging over your chest. You silently curse to yourself, as you would much rather she'd done that before you put on her bra and tee shirt. She moves herself further up your torso so she's sat astride your tummy, which means when she leans forward now her breasts are pretty much level with your face. Instinct seem to cut in and you cannot help yourself from reaching out with your mouth, and kissing and sucking her nipples. OK, maybe this isn't so bad after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she says, \"It seems I'm now the vulnerable one, and I'm sure I could accuse <i>you</i> of taking unfair advantage of me!\"  You splutter an attempt at a rebuttal, but Kirsty appears not to be listening, and continues speaking, despite not moving out of reach in the slightest. \"You've stolen my clothes, and you're now taking advantage of my semi naked state for your own gratification.\" You are about to argue that you hadn't stolen anything, and she pretty much threw herself at you, but she continues. \"I'm now really worried at your intentions. You've commandeered my bra and tee so that I can't hide my two little friends away,\" with which she wiggles her torso so that her nipples bounce in front of your face again, \"and I have the feeling that you'd have my shorts off me as well if you could. Well that isn't going to happen. The only way these little shorts would go <i>anywhere</i> would be as a swapsie, but I feel safe, 'cos you wouldn't dare do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK. she's stopped. God, what did she say? You realize you should try to respond to her accusations - although to be fair she doesn't actually seem upset at all, and is still jiggling her nipples in front of your face, and you're sure you can detect a twinkle in her eye (although your eyes aren't really looking that far up).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't steal anything! You offered your tee, and I took your bra merely to prove a point.\" Her last comment has now reached your conscious musings. \"What do you mean, a swapsie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, trying to take advantage of me again!\" she replies, although you are now sure that there's a bit of a grin on her face as she says it. \"What sort of gentleman forces a girl to remove her last item of clothing without offering something in return, to allow her to retain a tiny fragment of modesty? The least you could do would be agree that if I remove my sweet little boy shorts for you to have, that you'd let me have your boxers instead. After all, we are in a public place, so I really would need to have something on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, so a swapsie would be just that. So not really what you want, as she'd still be covered up, albeit by your red and white striped jersey boxers, and you'd have her dusty blue boy shorts. OK, perhaps not the end of the World. And it would mean she's have to get changed, which mean's she'd be naked, be it fairly briefly. But then again, you'd have to take off your boxers too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, I wouldn't dare?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that. You have the upper hand now, but you don't have the guts to force me to swap these for your boxers, so I'm safe in my dusky blue. Now, if you're not going to force me to make the swap, I'll need to think how I can get back some control over you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

I'm sure that it comes as second nature to you, and I'm almost embarrassed to ask, but seeing as we've gone this far, would you mind if we actually complete the swap? It's just that I've always wondered what it would be like to dress as a boy, and this seems the ideal opportunity, so could we just dress as each other for a little while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What!!!

Whilst you're a bit taken aback by the change of outfit on top of the fairly odd request, you hadn't really fancied pulling on leggings, and a skirt was always your favorite item of Amy's to try on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colorful floral top has ties which you knot together under your bra, leaving your belly exposed. The skirt is high waisted pleated, and in a soft metallic blue material that shimmers as the light catches it. You were sold on the outfit the instant you saw the skirt. A different league to what Amy had ever left lying around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel yourself getting hard under the skirt. Yes, this is actually quite fun.

But does she really think you look like, or could look like a girl? Whenever you've slipped on one of Amy's skirts you've always looked like, well, you in a skirt. Would you actually want to look like a girl?  Well, yes, probably. Whenever you've put on any of Amy's things you sort of fantasised about being a girl, so if you're going to dress in Kirsty's clothes for a while now, then you may as well look like a girl rather than a boy wearing girls clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you mean? What could you do to make me look like a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously the clothes help a lot, but I think if we brush your hair differently, add a touch of make up, and perhaps a few embellishments, then you'd be pretty much there.

Ah, a chunky necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd paint your nails too, but that will take a bit longer. They'd definitely need a base coat first, so it would take several minutes to dry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about it, you tell her that you have plenty of time - it's not as if you're in a hurry to go anywhere. Before you have a chance to consider, or reconsider what you've just said, she has her nail file at work on your finger nails, and minutes later is applying the first clear coat of varnish. You hadn't actually realized there was so much to it, but after the forth coat, you have dusky blue nails that perfectly complement your skirt, and quite spookily your bra and boy shorts...  Lucky she happened to have just that color in her bag, you think. And the primer as well, of course. No wonder girls' bags are so heavy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only got the mirror in my compact, so you can't really see what you look like properly. Maybe we should take a walk to the information center? They've got decent mirrors in their restrooms, so you can appreciate how good you look.

We can't do much about your trainers, but perhaps you could change your socks to something a little more in keeping...\"  With that she hands you a pair of socks. You can't really see what the difference is until you pull them on, and realize they have pink and blue hearts on them, plus a lace top and bow on the side.

Then you realize that things are a bit different wearing a skirt rather than shorts, so potentially a bit easier. However, you notice the gap under the sides of the cubicle and realize it may not be the best plan to stand and pee, just in case anyone comes into the restroom. So you pull down the boy shorts, hike up the skirt around your waist, and sit to relieve yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConscious that you are in borrowed clothes, you tear off a sheet of tissue and dab little Tony before you pull up the boy shorts, and then smooth down the skirt. You double check everything is back in the right place before you flush and open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you had hoped, there are mirrors above the wash basins, and as you walk towards them over you are quite taken aback by your reflection. You barely recognize yourself, and to be fair to Kirsty you really do look like a girl, with your hair pulled into pigtails held in place with sparkly bands, fairly subtle make up but somehow more prominent lips, the shape of boobs (the gel filled bra), the cropped top and sexy metallic skirt, over your seemingly long legs, which makes no sense as they're the same length that they were earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so maybe Kirsty was right, you are a natural... but a natural what you're not quite sure.

This has certainly boosted your confidence that this switch would work OK, and  you look sufficiently like a girl that nobody would think otherwise. However, you're less confident about Kirsty. Maybe she's done something about removing her makeup. That may help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check over your reflection one last time, and head out of the door to rejoin Kirsty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

My nipples kept showing through the shirt, my body shape really wasn't working with your shorts, and removing my make up just made me look like a girl without make up. I'm really sorry to have let you down, but I'm afraid I just don't have your inherent ability to blend in and become whatever you want. I decided the best thing was to change back so I don't look stupid and show you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you reply, \"I'm sorry it didn't work for you. Guess I'd better get changed back as well then.\" You realize you're actually a bit disappointed. You were quite looking forward to spending a bit of time in Kirsty's clothes, and especially the little metallic blue skirt, which you quite like... Oh, well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for that! Just because I'm a failure doesn't mean you have to swap back yet. As I said, you're a natural. You look like a girl. I don't think anyone would even consider the possibility that you're not. However, I just didn't cut it as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts.\" Kirsty cuts you off. \"Today was all about having a bit of fun. You've proven yourself far more adept than me, and I feel I've let you down. I don't want to spoil the day totally for you, so you really must stay as you are. If you change back now the day will be ruined for both of us... There's lots we could do... \"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

The make up has all gone, her lips seem very plain and, well, less plump than they were, and you could swear she now has some acne spots that we're there before. Her hair now appears shorter, presumably tucked under the baseball cap she's now sporting, and her chest seems as flat as, well, yours was before you put on her bra. You know full well she has breasts, be it not the fullest going, but there's no sign of them now. You are effectively confronted by a boy. Despite your confusion as to what's going on, you're actually quite impressed by how she's done it, and tell her so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems please you noticed, and in turn compliments your appearance, and you get the feeling she's trying to turn the conversation away from her, but unsure why.  Then you notice something. Before she went into the restroom she was wearing your tee, but now shes seems to have something on underneath. On asking about it, she just says it was something she found in her bag, just to hide her nipples from being visible thought the shirt. You're not sure if that was just a lucky find, or... Well, guess it must have been a lucky find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway the end result is that Kirsty now has the absolute appearance of a boy, and you are similarly the embodiment of the female form. Well, unless anyone looks too closely anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? We hang out together of course. You get the opportunity to spend the day in my clothes and you can see everything from the girl's perspective. And later I might be able to take advantage of your amenable nature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm, OK, that stops you in your tracks. you're not entirely sure what Kirsty means by that, but you have an idea. Or at least think you have, although are prepared to be wrong, as you have been about most things today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could a bit of fun as well, of course. I can do the things you would do, and you can do everything I'd do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a few things I could think of beyond the novelty of playing each others roles. We could go shopping. I could try on a suit, and you could try on some dresses. You could spend as long as you want in the lingerie department and touch anything without anyone batting an eyelid. How about trying on some new shoes? You could have a manicure. Or have your hair done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" you retort. We've only swapped for the day to see what it's like. I don't think I really need my hair done for the sake of an afternoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so getting your ears pierced may wait until another day then...\" She winks. \" I was merely thinking of examples of things you could do as a girl that you couldn't or wouldn't want to as a boy.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.\" she continues. \"Let's have something to drink in the cafe first. Then I have an idea.\" You both head into the visitors center where there is a small cafe area, and Kirsty orders two drinks. You sit at a table together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Well, you certainly don't want to give her the idea that you've tried on girls' clothes before - even though you have. Whilst you can feel yourself blushing as you speak, you strenuously deny any history of dressing as a girl - which you tell yourself is technically true. After all, you've never previously dared to dress <i>fully</i> in Amy's clothes, and you've never worn makeup before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty carries on, either not noticing or choosing to ignore your blushes. \"OK, so it must be in your genes then. You do have a bit of a girly streak in you!  Now I realize why you were trying to swap clothes with me earlier. I thought it was a bit strange, but now it makes sense and I forgive you!\" she gives you a kiss on your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're trying to catch up with what she's saying, and get even more confused. But it wasn't you trying to swap clothes! Wasn't that her idea? You open your mouth to argue the point... \"But I didn't...\" and get instantly cut off by Kirsty as she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I know you didn't mean any harm by it, and I guess you were a bit uncertain asking, but it all worked out OK. It's quite fun being dressed as you, and you look fantastic dressed as me, so you really don't need to apologize.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues. \"Now I understand this all a bit better, I think I may be able to anticipate what you'd like to do next.

Well, you guess that technically you're already boyfriend and girlfriend as you're going out together, but that's sort of unofficial. The fact she's suggested defining yourselves as boyfriend and girlfriend makes you feel really chuffed. You haven't had a girlfriend for ages and it didn't work very well at all, so the prospect of formalizing your relationship with Kirsty is an offer you really don't want to refuse, even though you've got off to a pretty weird start with her. You're still a bit confused about what's been going on, and what prompted her to ask this question now. But all things considered you're out with the girl of your dreams having a weird but fun day, and rather than driving her away she wants to firm up your relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'd really like that.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! In that case we are now officially girlfriend and boyfriend. Give your new boyfriend a kiss to cement the deal.\"  and she leans in towards you and puckers up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean towards her and complete the symbolic union of your lips in the kiss, although with a slight niggle in the back of your mind. Was she talking to herself, or was it just a slip of the tongue. Surely she meant for you to give your new <i>girlfriend</i> a kiss. You decide to log it down to another element of confusion around pretty much each conversation you've had with Kirsty and just enjoy the moment, which continues with Kirsty French kissing you, and you then feel her grasping your buttocks and pulling you toward her. As she rhythmically clutches and releases you butt you can feel yourself getting harder and harder whilst just wallowing in her kissing. Yes, you decide just to enjoy the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty releases the pressure on your lips, which is a slight relief as you realize you were barely breathing, and speaks. \"OK, mi chica, what would you like to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're now really uncertain who suggested swapping clothes, but apparently it may have been you, you've got a girl's DNA, and you look fantastic in a skirt. Or something like that at least... You reckon you must actually be dreaming, as real life cannot be as weird as this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you do know is you're living a proper fantasy - dressed in sexy girls' clothing, being kissed by the girl you've had a crush on for ages, and when Kirsty kisses you and pulls you tight, you really don't care much about anything else. You mumble a reply, basically agreeing to whatever Kirsty's suggesting, knowing you'd have little control over it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, mi peque\u00f1a ni\u00f1a. Bueno.\" she replies, with a satisfied smile to herself. \"I think we shall buy you a little present, something for you to remember today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reckon you won't forget today in a hurry, but can't be bothered to argue. She gives your butt a final squeeze, then smacks it gently. \"And I think I know what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tempted to ask, but reckon you'd either not understand the answer, or it would change by the time you get it, so merely reply \"I'm sure it will be perfect then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we head off, there's something we need to sort out.\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise you eyebrows and peer towards her. \"Um, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What are we going to call each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, have I missed something? We already have names...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but they were our names before we swapped roles. We can't use them now! We need new names to suit who we are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You can't really call your boyfriend Kirsty, although I may get away with calling you Toni, but to be honest I don't think it would be ideal. You don't really look like a Toni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you need something more feminine than that. Maybe something flowery. I think I'd like my girlfriend to be Daisy or Jasmin, or maybe Ayanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not your <i>girlfriend</i>!\" you exclaim. \"I'm your <i>boy</i>...\" but Kirsty swiftly interrupts, drowning you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I beg to differ. I don't think anyone seeing us now wouldn't agree that <i>I'm</i> the boyfriend and <i>you're</i> the girlfriend! Besides, you were happy enough to sign it off earlier with a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I thought...\" you start, but then falter and stop, realizing that once again you seem to be have been out manoeuvred. Oh crap. So because you're the one dressed as a girl, you must be the girlfriend. Is that it?  This is getting even weirder. OK, so that's why she was saying about kissing your boyfriend. So, whilst you're dressed in her clothes, you're supposed to be taking the role of the girl? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you accept the situation or argue?     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Certainly to all external appearances Kirsty appears to be a boy, and you appear to be a girl, so on that basis she has  a fair point. You aren't really too sure about the hows and whys any more, but have to accept that Kirsty has won this particular argument, and there's not much you can do about it, other than walk away. However, that's something you're not keen to do for a couple of very good reasons. Firstly, she's your girl, um, whatever friend, and you still have an overriding crush on her. Strictly speaking that's reason enough, but also she's wearing your clothes, so if you walk away, you'd walk away as a girl, and you're not sure how you'd explain that to your mom when you arrive home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, whatever you might think, you really can't see a better alternative than to accept the situation as Kirsty outlined it, and try to enjoy the experience. Then later on, when you swap clothes back again, you'll take the boyfriend role back again, and everything will get hopefully back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm sorry,\" you say to her. \"I got a bit confused.

Hmm, it may be prudent for us not to be seen half dressed if he's heading this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it seems he is heading towards you, so perhaps Kirsty is right. Mind you, you're not just half dressed - you're half dressed in Kirsty's clothes, and her in yours. Whilst it seemed a bit of fun at the time, you clearly can't be seen like this by anyone else, so you start taking off Kirsty's shirt to change back into your own clothes. However, Kirsty is swift to stop you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tony, we don't have time to switch back now. He'll reach us in about a minute. Best bet is just to get dressed as we are.\" She picks up her leggings and throws them at you, then grabs your shorts and starts putting them on herself. You have little choice but to pull on her leggings, all the time thinking that it's bad enough being caught by the warden partly dressed, but what will he do when he finds a boy and girl in each other's clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up the leggings and despite being a tighter fit overall  than you are used to, they do seem to fit OK. Kirsty thrusts the binoculars back into you hand.  \"Have another go now and see if there's any bird-life to report.\" You raise the binoculars to your eyes and scan out into the lake. Actually there are a few more birds there now, and you mentally log the species and numbers. No harm in actually knowing what's there, especially if the warden asks. You're still rather worried about your current appearance, although keeping the binoculars in front of your eyes not only blocks you view of anything else, but seems to distance you from the 'real' world around you, and you hope the warden will just walk past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a voice, and you instantly know he's reached you and is trying to start a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning guys. Lovely morning. See you're doing a spot of twitching. Seen anything interesting Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so he's clearly started a conversation with Kirsty, so you can try to ignore him, and hopefully he'll go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be something good. It's got her full attention there...\" the voice continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're wondering who he's talking to, as that doesn't make sense. Then you hear Kirsty reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, when she get those binoculars to her eyes she blocks out everything else. Toni... Toni sweetie...\"  You lower the binoculars a little and look at Kirsty, now somewhat confused. She continues. \"The warden was interested to know what you can see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are tempted to ask why she referred to you as 'she', but decide just to reel off the list of birds you've just counted off, aware that your voice is reflecting your nervousness, so you're stuttering a bit, and you can feel yourself flushing. You decide to keep facing away from the warden, partly so he can't see you blushing, but also as you're not sure how tight the leggings are over your crutch, and whether anything inappropriate may be detectable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, very good. You clearly know your stuff. Do you know we had a couple of Northern Shovelers and a Cinnamon Teal spotted at the northern end of the lake yesterday?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually you realize that the Cinnamon Teal is quite uncommon here, so it does pique your interest a bit.  \"Really?\" you reply. \"They're quite rare here, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we get a handful of them every year, but everyone wants to catch a view of them when they're around. The Brokenshall Hide is probably your best option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, thanks.\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. I'm heading that way, so may catch you later. You guys have a good time.\" He gives you a mock salute, nods at Kirsty, and carries on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize you knew your birds so well.\" Kirsty says, as you slump down onto the ground, shaking very slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my hidden talents...\" you reply. Then you remember what had been said a minute ago, and are about to ask Kirsty what the heck was going on, when you actually look at her, and are rather taken back by what you see. In the few seconds between her giving you the binoculars, and the warden arriving, she'd combed her hair, which is actually quite a bit shorter than yours, pulled on her button up shirt, and to be honest if you didn't know better you'd have a hard time not believing she's a boy. Oh crap. It then dawns on you that you have a ponytail, you're wearing Kirsty's gel filled bra giving the illusion of a bust, and you're dressed in figure hugging girl's clothes. Guess that from a distance you probably <i>both</i> give the appearance of being the opposite genders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he think I was a girl?\" you exclaim, vocalizing your realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not unreasonably, to be fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you didn't say anything to correct him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, like telling him we'd just swapped our entire outfits, or introducing you as my boyfriend who likes to dress up as a girl?  I think we were better off letting him draw his own conclusions. I just didn't contradict him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I really look that much like a girl?\" you ask, now looking down at yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sufficiently so that he thought so from a dozen feet away, but you'd have to work on it a bit more to really be convincing closer to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as a girl you'd probably plait your ponytail, you'd have some foundation to cover those spots, and have some make-up, definitely some jewelery - earrings at least, and maybe a necklace, and different shoes. If you were serious, then probably a cropped top showing your belly button, and some flounces, bows or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK. So I don't look that much like a girl then. Phew!\" You stop to consider what she's just said. \"But,\" you continue, \"you are a girl, so why don't you look like one now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subterfuge.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as I saw him coming I combed my hair flatter and took out one of my earring studs. You've got my bra, so wearing your looser tee shirt plus the over shirt, you can't see my bumps. Your baggy shorts helped confirm the suggestion of me being a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That was quick thinking...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quite impressed but also a tad confused. Over the past several minutes you're sure you'd had the upper hand, and have managed to get Kirsty removing various items of her clothing, but now you have managed to end up dressed entirely in <i>her</i> clothes with a total stranger thinking you're a girl. That certainly wasn't what you'd expected, but Kirsty seems quite comfortable dressed as you, or rather dressed in your clothes. She clearly couldn't have planned for that to have happened. However, you have a distinct feeling that you haven't been as much in control as you may have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what shall we do now?\" Kirsty asks. \"Would you prefer to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

If you take the initiative and get her to go look for it, maybe you can get yourself more in charge. So you immediately tell Kristy that you're heading out and start gathering your small bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, little Birder,\" Kristy cautions. \"Before you go flying off, we really do need to get something on your face to help protect against the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I could put on a hat, so ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a hat doesn't cover your nose or stop the UV rays that can bounce off the leaves, and gravel and lake. It's bright today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know Kristy is right, and the last thing you want is to get sunburned. That would not be healthy nor smart to ignore Kristy's suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat. I've got something here I can use on your face. That's the most sensitive and can always use a little perking up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down without complaint, you watch Kristy unzip a pocket on her backpack and pull out a first aid kit and then another similar sized kit. You should have thought to bring some yourself, but you were too anxious about your date. At least Kristy has been nice about all this and not thought you a real goof even as you got dressed in her clothes. You wonder what she meant by 'perking up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Close your eyes, and I'll get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you close your eyes, you wonder why she wants you to close them. You could just put it on yourself. It's not like you haven't done that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let me. It's easier this way with this stuff. So just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no need to make a big issue about it. If she wants to do your face, why not. It's such a nice day with sounds and smells of the reeds and trees and lake. You try to imagine what each fragrance and sound may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she starts to gently apply it to your forehead, it feels really good. And it doesn't feel all greasy as she massages it into your temples. It's very relaxing as her fingers lightly swirl over your cheeks and then nose and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done,\" she explains. You're really enjoying this and are fine for however long it takes. She lightly brushes something over your eyes and under your eyebrows, then draws something once across on each eyelid. She pats your cheeks with something soft, and a whiff of flowers blows by.  \" OK, all done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see her packing the kits away, so you grab your dusty red pack and sling it over your shoulder. Helping with the tarp, it's folded so the wet side doesn't get on the dry. She adds it all the her much larger pack and begins to hoist it up. Being gentlemanly, you offer to take it, but she says since it's hers that she'll carry it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out of the blind toward the main path, Kristy takes your hand and gives it a light squeeze. You squeeze back and smile at each other. It isn't until you're on the gravel trail that you remember that you're wearing her clothes - they fit so comfortably. But what if someone sees?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a wonderful day, sunny with a hint of a breeze. Everything Kirsty has said and suggested has actually turned out fine, so you quickly forget about the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a Cinnamon Teal before,\" you offer excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. This will be our first, so we should take our time and enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she squeezes your hand and winks, you can't help but wonder if Kirsty's words had another meaning. After all, you've already both removed your clothes once, although not done anything more than have a few peeks. You were too self-conscious for anything anyway. Eventually, you'll have to swap back. Perhaps you and Kirsty might do a little more then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk along talking in spurts about this and that. About half-way there, the sun is starting to feel very warm, and you're glad Kirsty did your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's warming up,\" you mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's stop here in the shade a bit and see what we can do with that.\" You chuckle at her phrasing but follow her over beneath a small tree. \"Viscum album,\" she states pointing up into the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat isn't a bird's name, you're sure. So it must be the red berries and green pointed leaves hanging on one branch. It's interesting, but you don't know why, so you just say, \"Oh, OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes Kirsty chuckle as she pulls you next to her, face-to-face. As you look up into her eyes, they sparkle, and you get a warm feeling all over. She runs her fingers through your hair before leaning in to kiss you. That warmth grows as does a tingling through your body as you press lips together. Your eyes remain closed with the wonderful sensations and you almost stumble backwards when she lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistletoe,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That would explain the magic I felt.\" Immediately you blush at the lame phrasing and turn your glance down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That would be the natural part of you coming through now that you're more comfortable in how you should be.\" You don't know what to say or exactly what she means. Fortunately, she continues before you have to. \"We should hydrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty pulls a small red bottle from her pack and hands it to you before she takes a blue one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You take a big swig and then another. It's cool and refreshing water with just a hint of mint or something. You want to chug the whole bottle. Kirsty raises her eyebrow obviously noticing your thirsty guzzling. \"I didn't realize I was so thirsty, although this does taste nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Kirsty offers. \"We can refill at the fountain later.\" You take another swig before closing the bottle while she rummages again in her pack. \"You should put something on your lips to keep them from drying. Pucker up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you present your lips in an exaggerated way, smacking them a few times. Instead of a kiss though, Kirsty twists a tiny cylinder and applies something to them. When she's done, you purse them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Strawberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't lick it off. It's to keep you moist and protected from the sun as well. Here, you can keep this one. I have another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trade the bottle for the little cylinder and start to put it in your pocket before you remember that Kirsty's leggings don't have pockets. You had completely forgotten that you were wearing her clothes and she yours. That freezes you for a moment until Kirsty, seeing you motionless staring at the lip ointment, suggests that you put it in the bag you have slung over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get going before the birds go into their mid-day rest out of sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Kirsty as you tuck the cylinder in your bag and decide . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You debate whether to go inside or stop outside, and decide the latter. This time you help Kirsty put down the tarp instead of getting you bum sopping. You definitely don't want to get her leggings and boy shorts wet. Actually, until just then, you had not thought about wearing them or what anyone would think. Being with Kirsty was all that occupied you, and that felt good. You decide that you won't bring this back up and just enjoy your time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty hands you the binoculars, and you start scanning the lake. Still not much to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look carefully along the edges,\" she instructs you. After a few moments you feel her hands in your hair. It's nice especially when she starts brushing it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait. What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to lower the binoculars and ask, Kirsty explains. \"It's sort of messy the way it was, we did it so quickly. You watch out for the Cinnamon Teal, and I'll just straighten this up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, OK. It feels good, and you feel good that Kirsty is taking such an interest in you. You concentrate on viewing and think about what it will be like sharing the Cinnamon Teal experience with Kirsty and how you two might celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kirsty has finished, so you lower the binoculars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn,\" you suggest and offer the binoculars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you for several moments before leaning in for a little kiss. You tingle all over as she releases you and winks. You watch her start scanning the lake when you realize that part of the tingling is your body telling you that you have to use the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I, um, need to use the facilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning around, Kirsty informs you, \"There's a portable a short way down the trail through the forest, or a nicer building a little further away along the lake trail. I'll stay here and watch our stuff. You go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still dressed in Kirsty's clothes, so it feels a little odd going off by yourself. Maybe you should go towards the forest since it's closer, but more people walk the forest trail. Besides, using a portable is kind of creepy and often smelly. It will take you a lot longer and that could lead to encountering more people if you go to the facilities building - but there doesn't seem to be anyone around today. At least you haven't met anyone yet. That could actually mean that you could duck into the bushes and empty out close by. That would take less time, and less chance of you being spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You push open the door and step inside. Empty. Phew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose a cubicle, step inside and shut the door.  Then you realize that unlike your own shorts with their zip fly, leggings are not designed for a quick pee, so you'll need to pull them down. Noticing the gap under the sides of the cubicle you realize it would probably not be best to stand and pee, just in case anyone comes into the restroom. So you pull down the boy shorts as well, and sit to relieve yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConscious that you are in borrowed clothes, you tear off a sheet of tissue and dab little Tony before you pull up the boy shorts again, and then pull up the leggings.  OK, you double check everything is back in the right place before you flush and open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you had hoped, there are mirrors over the wash basins, and as you walk over you are quite taken aback by your reflection, as you barely recognize yourself. You must admit you do look like a girl. Now you realize what Kirsty was doing earlier. She wasn't <br>\r\n just putting sun-cream on your face. She was styling your hair, and applying makeup! And the last thing - the strawberry moisturizer for your lips - well it may well be moisturizing, but it's also pink! Looking down at your body you can see the shape of the gel filled bra, or rather you can see a couple of mounds on your chest that you know are caused by the gel filled bra, but guess to anyone else it would suggest the shape of breasts. Looking down further you realize you were a bit paranoid over any bulge showing in the front of the leggings, as the tee shirt actually comes down just below that level, so any bulge is hidden, and all you can see is the shape of your legs, be it their entire length from just below your crutch. Actually you're quite relieved the tee is as long as it is, as you feel quite exposed without shorts or pants. You twist around slightly and can see the shape of your butt - not something you normally expect to be quite so visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wash your hands, and as you're drying them you look at your fingernail, thinking they should really be colored as well to be more authentic, either pink to match your lips or maybe blue to match your leggings...  Then you stop, remembering that it's you that you're referring to, and that actually you don't want your nails any color at all, thank you very much. This is all temporary, and whilst it was a bit of fun originally, it's now overstepped the mark a bit, and you now just want to swap back into your clothes again - although maybe a bit slower and without the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your bag, and a thought occurs to you. You open the top and reach inside, grabbing your cellphone.  Then you open the camera function and take a few shots of yourself in the mirror. Hmm, they don't really look right. OK, maybe you need to pose differently. You do it again, but this time trying to look at bit more alluring, with a bit of a pout, and one hand on you hip, which seems to show off your breasts a bit more.  OK, not shots for sharing, but a memento for yourself of probably the weirdest day you'll ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, long enough spent in here. Time to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

It was a bit of fun while you were with Kirsty, but on your own you're now feeling a bit self conscious, and despite the fact that you do actually seem to look sufficiently like a girl that nobody is likely to say anything, you'll only really be happy once you're changed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you come out from the restroom, your immediate focus is distracted as the warden who had seen you earlier was just entering the main door, heading into the information center. He notices you, then pauses his stride, and turns towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning again, Miss. I'm about to mark this morning's observations on the board, but you may like to know we've had a sighting of a Cinnamon Teal just a few minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, not the rarest of birds, but you are sufficiently interested to stop and thank him for telling you, and ask him where it was. He tells you that the sighting was made from the Brokenshall Hide, so realistically that would be the best place to start looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you know you're not entirely sure what one looks like - you saw a picture of one in a book some months ago, but you're not at all sure if you'd recognise one if you saw it.  You own up to your lack of certainty, and he suggests you follow him into the information center where they have some pictures.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, rather than heading out, you head further into the building.  Here there are some more people, although only totalling around half a dozen, including a couple of wardens.  the one you followed in points you towards a display where they are drawings and photographs of different ducks. You thank him and walk over.  Once you've assessed the main characteristics of the Cinnamon Teal you look around at the other displays. Then... </span></div></div>",

She certainly hasn't come to see the birds - she's never had the slightly inclination towards ornithology. That means she's either her because she needs to find out something - presumably a school project or something - or maybe she's come to meet someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that ducking behind the display board is a good thing as she can't see you, but conversely you can't see her, so you can't tell where she's heading or what she's up to.  Maybe it's a new boyfriend she's meeting here - if you're careful maybe you can take a look. It'll make a change spying on her and knowing a bit about her love life. It may make up a bit for the fact that she's known pretty much everything about each and every girl you've ever had an interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy your reckoning, unless she stopped as soon as she came through the door (pretty unlikely) she's now in the area of the information desk where the wardens are, so if you walk behind the display heading towards the door, you should be able to look around the other end with minimal risk of Amy seeing you...

The thing is I was a bit worried for you, so I wanted to make sure you were OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have calmed down a bit, but are now wondering what Amy is twittering on about. Why the hell was she worried about you - that's got to be a first for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you had a crush on Kirsty, and I didn't want to disillusion you, and I didn't really think you'd get much beyond your first date. The thing is, well, she has a bit of a reputation. Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits. She's a brilliant friend and as honest as they come, but she has one tiny little eccentricity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're guessing this might have something to do with you being dressed as a girl, but you can't quite work out what. The amazing thing is that Amy hasn't said anything about the way you're dressed, but is just going on about Kirsty, so what's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to clear your throat, and ask, \"So, what eccentricity exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I sort of assumed that was obvious. She likes to swap roles with her boyfriends, so she'll dress as a boy and get her boyfriend to dress like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHang on, that can't be right. Kirsty didn't make you dress up as a girl! It was all just a way of getting her to take off her clothes. It was your idea that she.. um, that you... ah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say though that you do look quite convincing, if that's any consolation...\" Amy finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to work out what to say. You want to say that Kirsty didn't make you dress up as a girl, but that would imply you somehow persuaded Kirsty to give you all of her clothes because <b><i>you</i></b> wanted to dress up as a girl.  Which you hadn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, so she's done this before?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a couple of times...  which is why it wasn't a total surprise.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so was it really you who managed to persuade Kirsty to disrobe, or was she just playing with you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy can see you thinking, and comes to a conclusion (pretty accurately) about your thoughts. She continues speaking. \"But there's one thing you do need to know. If she has gone as far as this so quickly, it means she's really smitten by you. She doesn't do it for fun. She does it for love.. albeit a bit odd to my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that means (you think) that Kirsty <i>does</i> love you. But does she love you as yourself, or you as a girl? Um, does it matter?  Well, yes, it does really, as you want her to love you for you, not as a substitute for a girl. But Kirsty doesn't date girls, so she does prefer boys, but...  You realize you're just getting confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't you angry that I'm now dressed like a girl?\" you ask, deciding to bite the bullet and challenge Amy on the one thing that has been niggling away in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have to admit that, aside from being a bit weird, it is actually a bit of a turn on, and having now dressed as a girl you could see it could be fun... but only occasionally.  If you were to carry on with Kirsty would she expect you to dress as a girl every time you went out with her, or maybe all the time?  What about at school?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly reluctantly you decide that the ribbing you'd take from your friends if they found out, plus the hassle you'd get from your mom really wouldn't be worth your while. So you're mind is therefore set that you'll get changed back into your own clothes again, and try to remain friends with Kirsty - although recognizing that this could be the end of a very short relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your sister at the reserve's information center and head back to the Brokenshall Hide where you'd left Kirsty earlier.  She's still there, lying spread eagled in the sunshine next to the hide \u2013 still dressed in your tee shirt and shorts and looking every bit a boy, which for an instant is disconcerting until you remember you still look every bit a girl, so somehow that's OK. You sit down beside here, and she glances toward you. \u201cHello sweetie,\u201d she says. \u201cYou were a bit longer than I'd expected. Everything OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm fine,\u201d you reply, \u201c...but.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that there's something clearly not entirely right, Kirsty sits up, turns to face you, and grasps your hand. \u201cBut what, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your intentions of confronting Kirsty, you remain somewhat reluctant to do so. You also don't really want to mention that you'd been talking to Amy, as that could upset their relationship. So, rather than blurting out what you had intended, you end up rather more reticent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it's just that I'm not really that comfortable in these...\u201d indicating Kirsty's clothes that you're wearing. \u201cI think I'd prefer to get back into my stuff, if you don't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. I understand. I'm sorry if I pushed you too far there. I know I can sometimes get a bit carried away with things. Was the make-up a bit too much for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sort of. I thought I was a bit more in control of things than I was... and then seeing myself in the mirror...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know.\u201c she replies. \u201cJust answer me one thing first, and then you can get changed. When you looked at yourself in the mirror, did you like what you saw?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, well. I was a bit surprised. I thought I'd look like me wearing your clothes, but I didn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did you like what you saw, or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, I guess.\u201d you reply. This, to be honest was the truth. You had liked what you'd seen \u2013 a nice looking girl who looked a lot like you, which was why you took the selfies. But that doesn't change the fact that you feel you've been manipulated, don't want to dress like this all the time, and really would like your own clothes back now... you're just struggling to actually tell this to Kirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d she replies. \u201cI wouldn't be able to live with myself if you hadn't liked what you saw. I take a bit of pride in my handiwork with a make-up brush - although you're a good subject, so didn't need much work at all, to be honest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues speaking. \u201cLook, I reckon we're pretty good together.\u201d She reaches over and rests one hand on your leg, and gently caresses you thigh through the leggings. \u201cIf you're really not happy with this, then I'm sure we can work out something that suits better. I'd hate to think I've frightened you off. I do really like you..\u201d  and with that she leans forward and gives you a smacker of a kiss on your lips that takes your breath away.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe you had misjudged her. That certainly didn't sound like someone quite as obsessed as Amy had suggested, so just perhaps there may be hope of keeping your relationship going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest I don't think sitting right next to a hide full of twitchers watching the ducks is the best place to start undressing, so would you be OK if we stay like this just a little longer? Kirsty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reasoning makes sense, so you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" she continues, \"Did you find out where the teals are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd pretty much forgotten about them, but then recall what the warden had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, they were last seen at the Brokenshall Hide - um, that's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, tell you what. Shall we go up into the hide, see if there are any teals about, and then go somewhere to get changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you cannot argue with that, so willingly agree.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You locate the little island, and the geese, and.. . there's something there, but is it a... yes, you recognize the coloring from the display board in the information center \u2013 a Cinnamon Teal. You unwittingly give a little squeal of delight. Studying the bird you are aware of someone moving around behind you in the hide, but it's not affecting you, so you ignore it. Then you hear Kirsty whispering close to your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do I take it you've spotted it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, do you want a look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that's fine.

You keep your eyes focused on the lake through the binoculars but in reality you're just waiting to see what she does next. You don't have long to wait. You can feel her pulling in tighter behind you, and then you feel one of her hands on your thigh, gently stroking upwards. That is enough for you to loose any remaining focus on the lake. Weirdly, feeling her caressing you through the material of the leggings seem to accentuate rather that diminish the sensation, and you're suddenly very turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel Kirsty's other hand reaching around you, and clutching at one of your breasts, but on the outside of your clothes, so actually clutching at the gel filled bra cup, which you do find odd \u2013 although recalling what Amy had said earlier, maybe this is what Kirsty likes \u2013 pretending to be the boy, in which case that's the sort of thing that could well happen... well, fondling a girls breasts through their clothing, not having a gel filled bra... Contrary to everything you felt and thought earlier, you do find it strangely exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you also feel that you're getting trapped again, with no opportunity to do anything but sit and, well, enjoy it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you think to yourself...</span></div></div>",

You turn to see if the group of twitchers are still engrossed in watching the teal, or instead watching the shenanigans going on inside the hide.  To your surprise the hide is now empty apart from the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with you?\" Kirsty asks. \"Well, aside from the obvious, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd they go?\" indicating the empty space at the end of the hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made faces at them 'til they got up and left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You didn't...? Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly. They'd obviously had enough duck for one day and decided to go. Surprised you didn't hear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I heard something, but didn't realize what it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now you do.\" She pauses for a couple of seconds, as if waiting for a response from you, which you don't provide.  \"So you can carry on watching your duck now. I was just in the middle of doing something...\" She gently releases her hand from yours, and repositions it on the front of your leggings over your crotch, and starts caressing you there. You realize that the Cinnamon Teal won't be getting much more attention for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you mentioned earlier about wanting to get changed?\" Kirsty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, yes. You'd forgotten about that, although to be honest at the moment you're a lot less bothered than you had been earlier. However you know you need to acknowledge the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, right. I guess I might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now we've got this place to ourselves, we can get changed now if that's what you want.\"  OK, so you suddenly feel quite deflated and to be honest disappointed.

It's really up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, anything interesting?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do hope so. A bit of deviate behavior counterbalanced by sexual gratification, overshadowed by a background hint of danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you get the gist of what she said - or at least you got the words 'sexual gratification' which is sufficient for you to utter your response \"OK...\" with little regard for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kirsty...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, and take off the leggings... OK?\" and she thrusts a garment into your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you readily agree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty goes to the door, opens it and flips over a sign on the outside, then shuts the door again. \"That should give us a bit of privacy - it's a 'temporarily closed for cleaning' sign. Even the wardens generally abide by that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you look at what she's given you to put on. Somehow you're not really surprised it's a dress, and despite your earlier concerns you really don't mind putting it on now. You gather it up like a tee shirt and put your head through the head hole,  your arms through the sleeves, and let it drop down over your body. It's a fairly short length dress, in a silky material, with a colorful bohemian pattern.  <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/614459942888596420/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/61445994...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull down the leggings, but then need to remove your trainers to get them off. Something tells you that keeping your socks on would just be silly, so you remove them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty has meanwhile laid a blanket on the floor of the hide (and you wonder what else she has hidden away in her bag!), and invites to you sit down on it. She kneels facing you, reaches towards you and gently pushes you backwards until you have no choice but to topple backwards, so you're lying on the blanket. Kirstly then pushes your legs flat, and moves forward, sitting herself astride your legs.  Bugger! You have another sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. You're (again) no longer in control - as if you ever were - and Kirsty is now most definitely on top of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smooths down the dress over your shoulders and tops of your arms, and you realize you can feel every touch of her fingers through the material. When she repeats the action on your thighs you feel ready to burst. Meanwhile you are frantically kissing her whilst trying to loosen her clothes. You get your hands inside her tee, and immediately realize one clear advantage of swapping clothes \u2013 she has no bra on, so you're able to reach and caress her nipples easily. Her body swiftly responds with a shudder, and her hands grip you tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that loosening her shorts will not be so easy, but remember she's wearing <i>your</i> shorts, and you know precisely how to get them undone. However, Kirsty clearly has a similar strategy, and you suddenly realize that the blue panties that you were wearing are apparently no longer where they were. Guess that's one of the potential problems of wearing a dress?  This intrigues you for a second, but is soon forgotten as you endeavor to undo the front of Kirsty's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The following few minutes have little to do with the prevailing storyline, and would definitely necessitate censoring of the story, needless to say that afterwards your views on certain deviant behaviors have changed. I will let your own imagination fill in any details you may wish to include.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty suggests you both get dressed again, in case you get interrupted by anyone wishing to use the hide for it's intended purpose. <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting dressing is not the first thing on your mind, but you appreciate it makes a lot of sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty has already tidied herself, and is still wearing your \"Fort Wilderness\" tee and shorts, so you realize that despite the past few minutes when you were at least physically the boy in the relationship (albeit whilst wearing make-up, a padded bra and a dress), you're now back to being the girl again. You spot the blue panties lying beside you, and pull them back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider putting the leggings back on again, either under or instead of the dress. Well, they don't really go with the dress \u2013 but then again neither do your trainers and socks. So, its either keep the dress or change back into Kirsty's long sleeved tee and the leggings, although it seems the tee has now disappeared. Um, looks like you'll stick with the dress then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually you're not bothered either way.  You're in a buoyant and quite joyous state, and would happily do anything Kirsty asks - including staying in this dress forever... Well, maybe not forever, but for now definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind really is all over the place. Previously your most advanced sexual interaction with a girl had been French kissing and a bit of groping. Now, wow, you're a fully fledged, um, something. What do you call someone who's no longer a virgin?   You know one thing for sure. Despite your abortive efforts to be control, you know that if Kirsty hadn't been so dominant, the outcome would not have been so good. She had lead and directed you, making you pause every so often, and letting you run rampant at the end. Whilst it was your first time, it was clearly not her's. You must admit that despite everything your sister had suggested about Kirsty, you have absolutely no complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty has finished repacking things in her backpack, opened the door to the hide, and flipped the sign over again. You're quite relieved there isn't a queue of irate people wanting to come in. She looks at you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you OK my little sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\nYou find that you haven't lost your voice and respond. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you. That was tremendous. Thank you!\u201d As a slight after thought, and considering you're total lack of experience you decide to add, \u201cI hope it was OK for you. I know I wasn't very controlled...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you were fine. I quite like the na\u00efve approach, although I'm sure we can work on improving some of your techniques.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, just before we finish here, and you decide what you want to do next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you'd taken a few selfies earlier on. In fact it would be nice to have something to sort of remember the day with, so you agree. You'd assumed Kirsty would just take a hand held selfie, but she opens a side pocket on her backpack and pulls out a mini tripod, and attaches her phone to it. She puts it on the shelf under the window, sets the timer, and pulls you over in front of it. \u201cIt's a bit of a faff doing it this was, as I need to reset the timer each time, but the results are far better. Now smile when the red light stops flashing... now!\u201d She resets it again, and again, and within a couple of minutes she's taken several photo of the two of you smiling, kissing, and goofing, and some of you on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you some of them, and for an instant you don't recognize yourself, and realizing you hadn't really taken that much notice of the dress before. You do quite like the color and the pattern, but realize its quite short...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, how about lunch?\" Kirsty asks, \"I'm starving.\u201d  You realize you are too, so readily agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go to the cafe in the Information Center, although they only do snacks there. Or we could leave the reserve and go somewhere a bit nicer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only real knowledge of the cafe at the Information Center was from earlier, and you have a (you suspect unrealistic) concern that Amy might still be there waiting to pounce again, and quiz you on why you're still wearing Kirsty's clothes. Or actually, different clothes... but still Kirsty's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomewhere else sounds good.\u201d you reply, although to be honest you're unsure where any other diners are nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, that's settled then. Now are you all ready to go?\u201d She notices your trainers. \u201cOh dear. They're OK for here, I guess, but they don't really go with the dress, and I think I'd prefer my girlfriend to look more, well, um, co-ordinated. You get the feeling that's not what she was going to say, and have the distinct feeling she was intending to say 'girlie'. Somehow you're not really bothered, as you'd already considered pretty much the same thing about your footwear yourself. Well, perhaps all apart from wanting to look more girlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you also picked up that she'd referred to you as her girlfriend. Whilst not exactly what you'd originally hoped, you realize it's possibly as good as you'll get for the time being, and certainly seems to confirm you and Kirsty are now in a proper relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, so are we, um, girlfriend and boyfriend now then?\u201d you ask, rather tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. Well, if you're happy with that, of course...\u201d  Your smile confirms to her that you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I'm your, um, ...?\u201d you start, a little tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..girlfriend,\" Kirsty continues for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then you must be my ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...boyfriend. Yep, that's right.\u201d Kirsty finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u201cBut... shouldn't that, um, technically be the other way around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no... OK, maybe it's slightly complicated, but really don't worry about it. I really would like you to be my girlfriend. You can't be my boyfriend as I don't do boyfriends. So you can only be my girlfriend. But you can only be my girlfriend if you're a girl. but I'm not gay, so you can't be a real girl. So you can only be a boy  dressed as a girl. Similarly I can only be your boyfriend if I'm a boy, but technically I'm not a boy, so I can only be your boyfriend if I'm dressed as a boy. Otherwise the whole thing obviously wouldn't work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when I'm dressed as a boy, and you're dressed as a girl, what are we then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest friends, of course.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not boyfriend and girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no! Duh! How can you be my girlfriend if you're a boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what you'd meant, but you realize that somehow Kirsty cannot understand how you could possibly be her boyfriend, but only her girlfriend. You cast your mind back to what Amy had said earlier about Kirsty liking to swap roles with he boyfriends so she'll dress as the boy, and get her boyfriends to dress like a girl. So it looks like Amy was right, but it's not just a bit of role play where you swap clothes for a quick bonk, which you'd sort of imagined, but something more, um, serious, deep within her psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, when you're at school, you're a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, obviously! Technically I am a girl, you know. I think you found that out earlier...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are certain times when you don't have control over what you are able to do. At school I am forced to adhere to so called normal conventions. Besides, if I dressed like a boy at school people would assume I'm gay, which I'm not. So, at school it's just easier to be a girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, at school, why can't you have a boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Arrogant, selfish, and little on their minds beyond football and video games. Wanting to be in charge all the time, and with the dress sense of a slob.  You are kidding, aren't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you, um, asked me out? I'm a boy \u2013 or at least I was then...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes. I thought you were cute...\u201d <i> ...and would make a nice new girlfriend for me</i>, you finish the sentence as you suspect she may have been thinking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so there's something in her makeup that seems to fundamentally abhor boys per se, although likes them in role reversal. That's got to be a medical condition, surely? Or at least a psychological condition? Bottom line seems to be that in this relationship Kirsty will definitely always wear the pants, and you will always be the slightly submissive and you suspect quite a girlie girl. At least you're starting to understand what's going on now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just need to decide if that is the sort of weird relationship you want... oh, and somehow keeping it secret from everyone, as you could image what everyone at school would think if they knew you were cross dressing in your free time. Actually, that's not really such a big deal now. You remember your have a couple of boys at school who claim they're really girls trapped in boys bodies, and are having transitional therapy (or at least you assume they are). They're already dressing as girls, so guess it wouldn't be so bad if you did the same...  There are another couple of, um, students, who you're really unsure what their gender is. You certainly can't tell from their appearance.  But they're committed to whatever their ultimate target gender as a whole life choice, not just your first proper relationship. If everyone found out you dress up as a girl at weekends, then what would happen if you split with Kirsty? You'd never get a 'normal' girlfriend again... No, best to keep it secret.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you hadn't really thought about whether you wanted to carry on with the relationship, but instead what people might think about it. So, subconsciously at least you seem to be happy with it? Hmm, so realistically you're not naturally dominant, aren't that keen on football, and consider you've got a reasonable dress sense. Whilst you'd never say you didn't fit in with the boys at school, you always seemed to be the one left out, the misfit, the one.. the one who couldn't keep a girlfriend.  Maybe Kirsty has a point... You could actually get quite comfortable being in the more submissive role, and added to this you're getting a buzz being dressed in girls clothes. And of course someone likes you. Like this. Quite a lot. And then there's the sex and promise of more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, you realize that its really a no brainer. So looks like you're going to stick with it for a while - and at least so you can see how it goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, so...\u201d you ask...  </span></div></div>",

I'm Kieran.\" You cannot help but be a little impressed, and say so. You'd half expected something closely aligned to Kirsty's 'real' name, like Chris, or maybe Kris, but Kieran obviously took a bit more contemplation, and oddly you feel it suits her, um, him, um, her as him,,quite well.. Grief this is getting confusing... OK, so you run through potential names in your head. You start with Toni, but instantly realize that's effectively your real name, so someone overhearing it being spoken could draw the wrong conclusion. How about, um, Lotti, or Susan, or Babs, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep the same initial letter, it sometimes helps - especially signing your name.\" Kirsty / Kieran suggests.   OK, so Taylor - no, that could easily be a boy's name... Tracy - no, that sound like you'd had an overdose of Thunderbirds...Um, Terrie. Humph, no. You want something definitely female, and guess something a bit girlie to be sure Kieran is happy with it too. Maybe...Tatianna, or is that a bit Russian?  Um, Trudy, or Teagan. Hmm, Teagan. Can't confuse that with a boy's name. Yes, that might do..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you fancy your girlfriend being called Teagan?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nice. Yes, I like that... Hello Teagan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Hello Kieran.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Teagan Marshall, shall we go and have some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr Kieran... um, I don't know your last name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Griffin. Kieran Griffin, and I'm delighted to make your acquaintance, Miss Marshall.\" spoken with a graceful bow. You feel you should curtsy in return, and despite not really being sure how to, you have a go nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so formal introductions out of the way. I shall still call you my little sweetie though.\" Kieran says, and kisses you firmly on your lips, puts a hand on each of your buttocks, and pulls you close, prising your mouth open with her tongue and French kissing you. Somehow it makes you feel good, a bit weird, but definitely good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's go,\" Kieran says, breaking off the kiss, \"otherwise I may be tempted to have you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have a chance to reply, as he's, um, <i>she's</i>, um, <i>he's</i> grabbed the backpack and is clearly getting ready to go. You decide that as Kirsty clearly wants to behave and be treated as a boy when dressed as such, you may as well accept it. So when dressed as a boy, she's Kieran, and therefore a boy.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be glad you've kept the trainers now. We've got a bike ride ahead of us now, and cycling isn't s easy in sandals.\" Kieran holds the door open for you, and you leave the hide. It's still sunny and quite hot, and as you walk back to the bike stands by the reserve entrance you notice two key things about wearing a dress. First its quite short and can get caught by the breeze quite easily, so you're quite conscious of it moving around you thighs, and potentially exposing more than you'd like, but also you discover that wearing a dress is cooler in this hot weather than your long shorts. Guess you win some and lose some...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the bikes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grief, you suddenly realize that riding your bike wearing a dress could be a bit of a challenge - particularly as you have a crossbar, and you're increasingly aware your dress is actually quite short, showing quite a lot of your legs already, without the risk of the breeze catching it. You express your concern to Kieran - although notice for the first time that he also has a crossbar - so what would be considered a boys bike. Of course you remember that as Kirsty earlier this morning he / she had been wearing leggings rather than a dress or skirt, so hadn't faced this particular problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really I wouldn't worry Teagan, sweetie. The worst be will be getting on and off, as you'll have to swing one leg over. Once you're on, try to keep your knees pointing slightly inward. It'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, well, here goes nothing. You swing one leg over the saddle and sit down, realizing that your thighs and panties are now in contact with the saddle, not the dress. Is that right? Should you be sitting on the dress? Who knows... you decide to ignore it, in the hope it will all work out OK. Meanwhile Kieran has got onto his bike, but you're still not sure where you're going. You gesture to Kieran to indicate your uncertainty as to where to go, but he misinterprets this as you being unsure about riding in the dress, which is barely reaching halfway down your thighs at the front, and is loose behind the saddle at the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It may be a bit scary at first, but you'll soon forget about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, where are we going?\" your reply, slightly concerned that Kieran's referring to the route you're going to be taking, not your attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought we'd try the pub / diner by the airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't it be busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouldn't be too bad. After all its only plane spotters who really go there, and hopefully they're all down at the beach or by the river today enjoying the weather. But if we have to wait for a table, there's nobody I'd be happier waiting with than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to give a rude gesture, but remember that you're supposed to be acting as a girl, and you're suddenly not sure if a girl would take that as a compliment or someone being a bit smarmy. You decide to give him a finger anyway.  You may be a girl now (well, sort of...) but you're still you inside, so you're not going to change how you feel about sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lead,\" Kieran says, \"and I'll follow. That way if you have a problem at all, I won't leave you behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK.\" And so you set off. From the reserve it's only a couple of miles to the side of the local airport where the diner is, although generally uphill. To your awareness the dress didn't ride up much at the front, although on the uphill stretches you were more concerned at keeping your speed up, so were standing on your pedals much of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop outside the diner, and Kieran is just behind you. You disembark, again swinging one leg over the saddle before realizing that anyone looking out of the diner could have seen something you may not have wanted them to. Hmm, One of the downsides of wearing a dress, you guess... Maybe you'd better consider what you wear next time you cycle... or actually is this all a big mistake? Do you really want to do this? Is it really worth it? Wouldn't it be easier just to go back to being a boy again?  Your shoulders slump, and you start feeling confused and a bit of a fool. Have you been taken for a bit of a ride, and not of the cycling variety?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran notices that you've stopped and are clearly unhappy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" you stutter. \"..I'm just not sure if I can do this. I started out this morning hoping we'd have a usual boy / girl relationship, but it hasn't turned out how I'd expected. I'm just a bit confused and, well, not sure if I'm doing the right thing.\" You can feel a tear starting to well up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Lunch can wait. Let's sit down somewhere and talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk.\" You respond. \"I want to... I don't know what I want to do... I want to go home!\" Then you realize that dressed as you are you wouldn't dare go home, as you consider what your mom would say. \"I don't want to go home! Oh, crap!\" Then you cannot help yourself as you start blubbing with tears dribbling freely down your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran maneuvers you to a bench overlooking the runway in front of the diner, and sits you down, then pulls you into a hug. You try to pull away, but in the end give up and accept the hug, although it really doesn't help you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you calm down slightly, and Kirsty / Kieran says....  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He snakes a hand upwards to run it gently through your hair. \"I know this is all new and different for you. Its natural to feel like you do now and get emotional Teagan, especially after what we've done.\" His words were soothing like honey, and his eyes showed the deep care and concern that he had for you. Wrapped in his arms you stay silent, eyes wide and glistening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have doubts babydoll, but don't let that control you. I'm your boyfriend now and I promise I'll protect you and take care of you.\" He continued, still taking the role reversal seriously, even in your distress. \"And deep down, I know you want that.

If you didn't want this, we'd still be back watching birds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffle and wipe your eyes, ignoring the roar of a plane coming into land just a few hundred metres away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst you'd never seriously considered it before, you've never fitted in with the boys at school, and barely had any boy / girl relationships with girls \u2013 they always seemed to treat you as a 'friend', rather than a 'boyfriend'. You hadn't previously given it more than a passing thought. But maybe Kieran's right. It's not just about what gender you are physically, but how you perceive the World, and perhaps how the World perceives you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way on this planet you'd ever consider you were a girl born into a boy's body, but you can see that in some areas you could fit the psychological profile of a girl equally as well as a boy. You can certainly cry like a girl, you think to yourself, and the thought of someone willing to protect you does make you feel safe. You've always had a preference for growing you hair long, you prefer girl bands to boy bands (although you've always convinced yourself you like looking at the girls rather than enjoying their music), and you follow tennis and netball rather than football. Of course, you also got a definite buzz getting dressed as a girl today. Not that any of that proves anything, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, somehow things are starting to make more sense now. Maybe Kieran isn't so odd after all, but just adapting as best he can. So, Kieran is the person he considers to be his real self, whilst Kirsty is his sort of alter ego \u2013 the version of himself he needs to fit his physical body, and he swaps between them as necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you continue thinking, is it possible that you're really a girl inside, although physically a boy? No, you decide that's definitely a step too far. However you do recognize that you have a number of girlish characteristics. Perhaps adopting Teagan as your own alter ego could well be the way to focus these feminine strands of your psych into something more structured. Kieran seems to cope with swapping between his personalities easily enough, so it's clearly feasible to do. Surely it's a bit like character acting. You just immerse yourself completely in the character, the persona,  and then swap personas when you need to.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, having reached a tentative conclusion and decision, you clearly need to re-engage with Kieran, who's been patiently waiting, holding you tightly in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d you say, struggling to get your first word out after several minutes of  crying, \u201cI think I'm OK now. Thank you for being here for me, I do appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are you feeling? Have you decided anything?\u201d  You gaze up at Kieran and realize he's clearly quite worried and anxious about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have. I realize I've been deluding myself for a while, but you've helped see things in a different way. I think I'll need some help and guidance from you, but I think this could well be the right thing to do. I'm sorry I made such a fuss, but I needed to work it out in my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries my darling. And I'll gladly give you any help you need. So, do you feel up to doing anything yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at your watch, and realize that you'd effectively detached yourself from everything around you for over half an hour, feeling sorry for yourself and then contemplating your situation. You give it a few seconds thought. You know it would be impossible to try to be both Tony and Teagan at the same time, so you'll need to  focus on being your alter ego for a while, and potentially give in to anything and everything you previously considered to have been girlish, and try to live your new persona. Actually, that could be quite a relief, not being worried that anything you do could be considered as un-boyish. OK, decision made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think I need the bathroom first. My make-up is probably shot to pieces so I'll need to do something about that, and then something to eat. I'm famished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're on. Let's go inside. I'll check for a table, and you can head for the bathroom. You can borrow Kirsty's make-up bag. If you can't manage anything, I'll help later. I'd suggest you wash your face first though. You are a bit streaky from the tears.\u201d He holds your hand as he leads to the the main entrance to the diner, then holds the door open for you. You go inside and see the sign for the restrooms. You turn to Kieran, who's gesturing you to go on. \u201dSee you in a couple of minutes. Take as long as you need. I'm not going anywhere sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into the Ladies rest room, this time without hesitation or the slightly bit of anxiety. You don't really need a pee, but decide to have one anyway. Then as you come out from the stall, you head for the washbasins, and have a look at yourself in the mirror. Ouch. Yes, the make-up that Kieran applied for you earlier couldn't cope with your tears, and your eyes and cheeks are a bit of a mess. With hot water and soap you wash your face over to remove the streaks, and inevitably most of the remaining make-up as well. You pat your face dry, then consider what to put on first. From recalling what Kirsty, or was it Kieran, had done earlier it was effectively top down, so you tackle your eyes first, then some make-up on your cheeks, and finish with a little lip stick. Whilst you're not entirely happy with the outcome, its understated rather than excessive, which you decide is preferable. As you're working on your make-up you're talking to yourself, reminding yourself that you're now Teagan, and you're a girl, and anything to do with Tony, your boy persona, needs to be pushed to the back of your mind for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, you look at yourself in the mirror again, a little more critically. You reckon you could do with some jewelry, perhaps earrings and something around your neck. You like the material of the dress, but in all honesty don't think blue suits you best, and whilst appreciating that any semblance of breasts is technically an illusion, what you have seem a bit on the small side. You look down at yourself and decide whilst they're practical, the trainers will need to be replaced at some point by something more, well, more feminine. And your hands look, well, like hands. Not girl's hands. Why? Ah, yes, the nails \u2013 cut short and basically plain. Hmm, nothing you can do now, but something to consider for the future. You've decided that Teagan is going to be quite a girlie girl, and subconsciously that gives you another little buzz of excitement inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back out into the diner, and look around for Kieran. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kieran is still standing in the lobby area waiting for you. As you approach he smiles, and you feel your heart flutter slightly. He holds one hand out to you, which you take, and he leads you into the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've managed to get us a table by the window,\u201d he says, \u201cso we can watch anything happening on the runway.\u201d He winks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach your table you also realize that it's probably the most secluded in the entire place, a couple of steps down from the main dining area, and beside a large urn with what looks like a small tree in it, effectively hiding it from the majority of other tables. You do actually appreciate the privacy - you didn't really want to inadvertently be the center of attention. Kieran holds your seat out for you to sit down. You remember you need to smooth down the back of your dress before you sit down, and Kieran then gently pushes your chair in, before taking his own seat. He picks up the menu, and passes it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scan down the choice, and notice the prices, which are a bit beyond the small amount of cash you'd brought with you. So you start scouring the menu for the cheaper items... the cheapest items. Ouch. That's still going to be a bit of an issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to panic and admit you haven't enough cash, Kieran leans towards you. \u201cAs it was my suggestion we came here, I think it's only fair I pick up the tab today. OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washes over you, although now you feel a bit guilty, not paying for your share. \u201cUm, are you sure? I don't want you to... um, well OK... But only this time...  Thanks.\u201d          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time server arrives at your table you've had a chance to revisit the menu, and made your selection, although still keeping as budget conscious as you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilly as it seems, this is one of the first times you're actually sat facing Kieran, and able to scrutinize his appearance properly. Clearly his face is the same as Kirsty's (and that's what gave you the collywobbles about her in the first place, so you're happy that hasn't changed) - although any make-up Kirsty may have had on earlier has been removed. He's still wearing one ear stud, but with his hair actually quite a bit shorter than yours, he could easily pass for either gender. His tee shirt (well, actually it had been your tee shirt earlier) is quite thin and the absence of any indication of bra straps, and his fairly flat chest certainly suggests a boy, although you realize its mostly perception. It wouldn't take a lot to suggest a girl instead, and certainly this morning as Kirsty she was definitely a girl. Now as Kieran he's definitely a boy, but you really can't work out what makes the difference. On looking more closely you can make out the shape of his nipples through the material of the shirt, and to be honest you feel they're a bit more pronounced than you'd expect for a boy. Hmm, there's an opportunity to be taken another time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the meal you exchange small talk. You reckon Kieran could be holding back to give you the chance to recover, although you've pretty much got over that  and you're mentally trying to construct some details of your new persona, so happy to have time to think. However, you decide you need a more more guidance on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, would you mind if I ask a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not! Why should I mind. Ask away!\u201d Kieran replies with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. So what is your relationship to Kirsty? I mean you obviously look similar, so does anyone mistake you for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she's my cousin, so there's obviously a family likeness. As cousins we tend to visit each other, so sometimes can be seen at the other's home. We do get mistaken, but only rarely. To be honest I always hoped she'd turn out a bit more feminine than she is, which would help, but she seems a bit reluctant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I assumed you sort of lived with Kirsty. You have a different home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're right. We do live together, yes. But that's obviously not common knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, who knows? I mean who knows about, um, you know... Kirsty and you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my mom. Some of my best friends. My ex-girlfriends obviously. Actually your sister knows as well. But they're all very discreet about it. Which is why you didn't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind catches up with what Kieran's saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, when you say ex-girlfriends, you mean, ex, um, girlfriends...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sod it. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be insensitive. Yes, I've had a couple of girlfriends before. We separated on good terms, but they are exes now. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess nobody I'd know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiscretion works both ways, so I'd rather not say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tempted to wonder if any of Kieran's ex-girlfriends have reverted to being a boy full time or... Hmm. Maybe a thought for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're mom's OK with it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Well, basically I was a bit of a rebel a couple of years back. Nobody could understand my point of view and everyone jumped to their own conclusions without bothering to talk to me. Eventually my therapist worked it out, and suggested a solution. Since then I've been much happier, and my mom is totally relieved that everything is stable again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's when Kirsty and you... um, separated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We decided to live more independently of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes, so that's what started it off. You realize its very much like you worked out for yourself, so why couldn't anyone else have seen that? So, Kieran almost seems to treat Kirsty as a separate person, so your idea about different personas seems spot on. However you realize that convincing your own mom might not be so easy. After all you aren't a rebel, haven't needed therapy, and as far as anyone knows have never had any desire to cross dress. Well, not seriously, anyway. So telling mom could be an issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about Kieran's home situation, you wonder if he has different bedrooms depending on if he's Kieran or Kirsty, but then realize he'd definitely have to have two complete sets of outfits, one for each of them, or rather one for each persona, so it would be impossible keeping it completely secret... So you know you'd never be able to keep Teagan a secret from your mom. Especially if Amy knows, which she obviously does, or at least to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish the meal, and Kieran settles the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be honest you're not that active on social media and you're not really that chummy with anyone, but you do occasionally get texts. OK, mostly from mom, occasionally from Amy, and infrequently from anyone else. You pull your phone from your bag. There are a couple of unread messages, so you open them up. As you expected there's one from mom, asking how the day's going, and if you're enjoying to trip to the nature reserve. You can't help but smirk slightly to yourself. The other message, equally predictably is from Amy. Hmm, her message is in a similar vein, but rather more direct, and obviously with a better understanding of what's going on. She asks if you've made a decision yet about carrying on seeing Kirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you decide you may as well tell her, although clearly telling you mom is a different proposition. So you text Amy back.  <i>Yes, decided to carry on. Not sure how it'll work out yet though. Will be a problem telling mom, so am a bit worried. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nWell, they say a problem shared is a problem halved. So if Amy knows, then well, you'll still worry but she may come up with a bright idea how keep it a secret, or, well, or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou text your mom back too, to tell her you're having a good day, and that you saw a Cimmamon Teal, knowing she won't have a clue what that is. You decide not to say anything else. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so messages checked and actioned, so you put your phone away again. You realize you've gone a bit withdrawn again, as you're now worrying about what you mom will say about you cross dressing. Then you realize that today you'll need to swap clothes back again before you go home. All the make-up can be washed off , so actually by the time you get home there'll be nothing to see, so nothing to tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for this afternoon there's actually no reason why you need to worry. You can just enjoy yourself. Or rather, Teagan can enjoy herself, and then you can switch back to being Tony before you go home. That's so obvious to you now, you can't imagine why that hadn't occurred to you earlier. You may have to tell mom in due course, but that can wait until another day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you think, what would Teagan like to do this afternoon? No, hang on. You are Teagan. What would you like to do this afternoon?  Maybe something that Tony would never do... Something, well, something more girlie. Hmm, perhaps not so easy as you're obviously with Kieran... Then you realize it doesn't really matter what you may want to do; being with Kieran eclipses all other options anyway. So long as you're with him, you don't really care what you do. Ouch. Did you really just think that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to leave Teagan, sweetie?\" Kieran says, interrupting your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes.\" you reply. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought we'd hop over the fence, run to the nearest plane flying to a desert island, and spend the weekend on an isolated beach, just you and me.\" Your mind follows this scenario without question for a couple of seconds until the absurdity of the idea hits you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that would be nice, but I haven't got my swimming trunks with me. Oh, I mean, my swimming <i>costume</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, definitely a bikini for you sweetie, to show off your figure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not too sure how you'd fit into a bikini, at least without a inappropriate lump showing. But if you're in a bikini, then surely Kieran would need to be in trunks, so topless. Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game if you are.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps another day.  Hmm, I have another idea.\"  You look quizzically at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you fancy...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wonder what they'd sell there that Kieran would want to buy for you. Whilst in the moment as Teagan you can think of a few things that could be nice, you still have the underlying fear of telling you mom, so having your ears pierced, for instance, would be a definite no no. At least for now. Maybe another day. Or preferably another year...  What else do jewelers sell?  Um, jewelry. You have a sudden but very brief fear that maybe Kieran could be thinking of proposing and wanting to get an engagement ring, but you discount this as soon as you think of it. Definitely too soon for that sort of thing. So back to um, jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're conscious of Kieran waiting for you, so you snap out of your contemplations, and grab your bike. This time you look around first to try to ensure nobody is looking your way, then swing one leg over the saddle, and try to smooth down the back of your dress before you sit down. You realize that you're still not sitting on the dress, but again feel your thighs and panties in contact with the saddle, with the dress falling around the back of the saddle. Oh well. You tuck the front slightly between your legs, remember that you need to keep your knees pointing slightly inwards, and set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the journey is easier, mostly downhill away from the airport. Some of the way Kieran rides beside and sometimes behind  you (particularly where you need to pedal a bit harder, or in traffic.) Within 10 minutes you arrive at the shops, and lock your bikes at the bike rack. Whilst you know you haven't mastered the technique of mounting and dismounting your bike in the best way, you're at least feeling more aware of what you're doing, and trying to limit any potential exposure of your underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now quite intrigued by what Kieran is thinking of buying for you. As Teagan you're exited, but you also know that as Tony you're a bit worried. Is it something you would only be able to wear as Teagan? If so, what do you do with it the rest of the time? What if your mom finds it and asks? (Ouch, that issue is still gnawing away inside you, isn't it?)  Would you be expected to buy something for Kieran in exchange? Or maybe as Tony for Kirsty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Kieran says, \u201dI can't wait to see what you think...\u201d He opens to door to the jeweler's shop and beckons you inside. He follows you in. As you make your way into the store one of the shop's assistants seems to materialize from behind a cabinet, smiles at you both, and introduces herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I'm Trudy. Welcome to Silversmith Jewelry. Is there anything I can help you guys with?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Trudy\u201d Kieran replies. \u201cYes, there is. I'm after an engraved heart pendant for my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm positive we can help with that. Let me show you what we've got.\u201d Trudy then leads you to a display cabinet with a number of different pendants. Kieran then points to one, which Trudy removes from the display, places on a velvet pad, and presents to you. You've got to admit it looks nice, but you're not entirely sure what you're supposed to do now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to try it on?\u201d she asks. Well, you guess that's probably the best way to see if you like it, so you respond accordingly. Trudy places the chain around your neck. \u201cThere, all done. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourselves in the mirror on the counter top. You had initially thought the pendant looked a bit big, but now, hung on the silver chain around your neck, it actually looks really nice and not disproportionate at all. It's silver, heart shaped, with a scalloped edging all around, and you must admit sufficiently girlie that as Teagan you love it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Trudy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teagan.\" you reply without a moment's hesitation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a lovely name. Yes, that would look nice on that. It's quite short, so we could keep the lettering quite large if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like it?\" Kieran asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it!\" you reply, suddenly very excited. You're not sure why. May be because somebody's buying something for you because they <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">love</span>... <i>like you</i>. May be because you've never had any jewelry before. May be because it's something a bit girlie, and you've never acknowledged you quite like that sort of thing. Whatever the reason, you realize you're actually quite happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to wait, or call back in a few minutes? It should only take about ten minutes for the engraving.\" Trudy asks Kieran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. If it's OK, we'll call back in a few minutes. There's somewhere else we need to call in.\" He pays for the pendant, confirms the spelling and font for the engraving, and then takes you by the hand and leads you out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk past a couple of other stores, clearly towards a destination that Kieran has in mind, you feel him squeezing your hand a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really like the pendant? I was hoping you would...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do. I can't wait to put it on. You have good taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's obvious. I have you as my girlfriend, so I must have good taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a gentle dig in his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, looking at you trying on the pendant made me notice something, so I hope you're up for something else...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you've stopped walking, and are now standing outside a different store. Oh crap. It's a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou're not serious?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, most definitely. I saw the way you were looking at yourself in the mirror back there. A heart shaped pendant looks best when it reflects the contours of its setting, and I know you don't really have much shape there at the moment. Whilst you've got Kirsty's bra on now, your starting point is a little different. You need your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still notice and can't quite get over how Kieran always seems to refer to Kirsty as if a completely different person... So, is he right? Do you actually need your own bra? Would it help give you a better, um, shape? Do you want to go that far \u2013 having your own girl clothes?  Well, you did decide earlier that you needed to bury Tony and let Teagan have control for a while, and as Teagan you're saying yes please... although what will happen when you need to switch back later on....? You decide you really must live for the moment. You'll deal with anything else later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so exactly what are you thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat we get you measured up properly for your own bra. Here they do gel filled bras, silicone pads, push ups, and, well, just about anything and everything to make a girl look her best. And I think you deserve to look your best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst the concept does seem interesting, if a bit worrying about what you could end up with, one thought does come to your mind. \u201cYes, but I haven't got much money with me, and I guess these things don't come cheap...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you worrying about nothing again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not nothing... It's, well, that's the problem, I don't know how much it is. But I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry. The people who run this place are family friends, and my mom has an account here - not that they ever charge her full price for anything. All you need to do is give it a go, and decide if you like what they can offer you... OK...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... Oh...  OK then.\u201d You decide giving in under pressure is probably the better option. You must admit that trying to give the impression of being a girl wearing Kirsty's padded bra is a bit of a challenge. Whilst it has given you two bumps in the right places, they are relatively, um, modest, and if Teagan is going to be more of a girlie girl, then potentially a bit more prominence up top wouldn't be a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go inside, where Kieran is immediate recognized and welcomed with a hug by the owner, a short stocky women called Mrs Longbottom. You reckon she's about you mom's age. You are introduced to her by Kieran's as his new girlfriend, and your purpose for being there is explained. In a matter of seconds a tape measure is pulled from a pocket, and wrapped around different parts of your body, including your waist and inside leg, which you find particularly odd. You give Kieran a quizzical look, but he just shrugs and waves his hand as if to say just go with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should be able to provide you with something that better suits your needs, my dear.\u201d Mrs Longbottom says. \u201cDo you have a particular color in mind, or type of material?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, not really.\u201d You respond, realizing that once again you are floundering out of your depth in a conversation about things that previously had little interest for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Not to worry. If you go into one of our changing booths, I'll bring something in to you in just a couple of minutes.\u201d She points towards the back of the store, and you head off there. Kieran follows behind, but waits outside when you go in. As she had suggested, it is only a couple of minutes before she bustles in, with a number of things laid over one arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can leave these here for you to try yourself, or give you a hand, whichever you prefer.\u201d she says. You realize you probably look a bit like a rabbit caught in car headlights, and feel equally perplexed. Mrs Longbottom seems to recognize your reaction, and continues. \u201cSo, you're only just starting out with bras then, dear? I think a little bit of guidance may be best then, don't you?\u201d You half nod, not really too sure either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you'll need to take your dress off, or slip it down around your waist, whichever you find easier.\u201d Well, easier would be taking it off, but that isn't going to happen in front of a total stranger, so you mange to slip you arms from the sleeves, and drop the dress so it hangs around your waist, revealing Kirsty's blue padded bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so probably not the ideal choice for you, but at least it's soft and provides a bit of shape. I think we can do a little better though.  Why don't you try this one instead, and we'll take it from there...\u201d she says whilst holding a bra out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, OK.\u201c you manage to reply, but realize you have no idea how to take off the bra you're wearing, let alone put the other one on. You can feel yourself starting to get a bit hot, and realize you're getting flushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I make a suggestion, um, Teagan, dear?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her. \u201cUhu...\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I could give you a bit of help. Don't worry, I've know Kieran since he was a little girl, so nothing much surprises me. Now, lets take this off first.\u201d She reaches behind you and unclasps the bra strap, and pulls it down and away from you. Weirdly you feel like you're showing something you shouldn't be, and are almost tempted to cover your nipples, but logic prevails and you don't. Mrs Longbottom then tries a new bra on you, slipping the strap into place, and adjusting it to fit. Clearly not to her liking, she whips that one off again, and tries another. You can feel this one a bit more, pulling a little tighter, although not uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's more like it. Have a look in the mirror.\u201d  You turn to the full length mirror and can immediately see that the impression is now of a bigger breast size, and also that you somehow have cleavage. \u201cIt's a combination of silicone inserts with powerlift push up, and adds around two cup sizes. It also looks good. Each insert even has a nipple, so everything looks right.\u201d You realize she's right. Kirsty's bra looked, well, ok... but this one looks, well, real. Or rather, if you didn't know better you'd really believe you have breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that's good.., um, nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Are you OK with the color?\u201d It's green, and broadly similar to the base color of your dress, which you are increasingly feeling comfortable in, so yes, you're actually quite happy, and you respond accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, this one comes as part of a set, so you'll have the panties as well. Now, these are specially designed for girls like you who need to hide things and keep everything flat. This one is medium compression, so should be fine. You won't need to tuck anything away with these, but take your time, and make sure everything is comfortable. Would you like to try them on now?\u201d You look at Mrs Longbottom as if to say Not a chance with you in the room!  She smiles. \u201cDon't worry \u2013 I'll leave you alone for that bit.\u201d Just let me know if they're the wrong size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she leaves, pulling the curtain closed behind her. You remove the dress entirely now, and then pull down Kirsty's blue panties, and pull on the new ones. What the heck did she mean by tucking everything away? You're not really sure, so you just make everything as flat and tidy as you can before pulling the panties up. It is fairly comfortable, although yes a bit of, what did she call it, compression. Once on, they seem to hide everything incredibly well, so there's no bumps showing that a girl shouldn't have. So was that what Mrs Longbottom was on about? Panties <i>specially designed for girls like you... </i>  Hmm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror again, and are actually surprised that you can't see anything that would signify you're a boy. OK, so it looks like they do cater for all, um, types of girl here then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your reflection, and ponder... Well Teagan, what do you think?  You give yourself the thumbs up. Looking good girl. You realize Teagan is starting to develop almost an independent personality.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you could change back into Kirsty's underwear now, or... no, these are yours, they're on your body, they are starting to make you more comfortable as being Teagan, so you're keeping hold of them. You're half tempted to get Kieran in to have a look, seeing as he's effectively paying for it, but decide you might keep it as a bit of a surprise for him. You pull the dress back on over your new underwear, fold the original underwear up, and head back out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll good then dear?\u201d Mrs Longbottom asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices what you have in your hand. \u201cI'll let you have a little carrier for that then.\u201d and smiles. \u201cI'll also write down the brand and size of what you've got, so if you need any more you know what to ask for. They do a nice range of colors in the same style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran then thanks her also, and you leave the store with your little carrier containing Kirsty's underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kieran pulls you back towards the jewelers again, but stops just before you go in. He faces you, and looks you down, noticing your new cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" you reply. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have a better look later on... just to make sure I'm getting my money's worth.\" He winks.  \"Now, let's see if your heart is ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go back into the jewelers store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, Teagan, what would you like to do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch and realize that it's already half way through the afternoon. Cripes, where has the time gone? You try to push back the little niggling voice reminding you that you'll have to go home soon, which means changing back into Tony's, um, or rather into your <i>boy</i> clothes, um, your clothes... Hmm, this is starting to get a bit more complex than you'd initially expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to do something, um..\" You realize you'll have to think about this one.  Something really girlie? Something that Tony would never do? Something that further builds your confidence as being Teagan? Well, you've been doing all of them already. Something... um...  \"You know what?\" you finally announce. \"I'd really love an ice cream. It's really hot this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds a pretty good idea to me!\" Kieran replies. \"There's a kiosk just along the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk along, and as you reach the kiosk you decide that this has got be your treat, and tell Kieran. This time he accepts, so you join the short queue. When the server finishing the order ahead of you, you do not respond as quickly as you should have when he asked \"What would you like Miss?\", but after the realization he's talking to you, all is well. You return to Kieran who's waiting on a bench overlooking a small park area, and sit beside him.  He seems to be looking at something or someone in the park, so you try to follow his gaze. The only thing you can obviously see are two teenage girls sunbathing on the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! You lost interest in me already? Eying up your next catch?\" You ask, mostly in jest, although with a small amount of apprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing here that would even partially eclipse you. I was just wondering what color bikini would suit you best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I'd want to wear a bikini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did. Back at the airport. We were talking about swimwear for our trip to the desert island, remember? You said you'd opt for a bikini...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that was on the desert island, not here. Anyway, what color do you think would suit me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Nothing plain. I think you are a multi-colored sort of person, and to be honest the bohemian style seems to really suit you, so yes, multi colored, but in pastel shades. Not blue - too boyish, and probably not red - a bit too passionate. You're more subtle, perhaps ochre, or maybe teal. A bit like your bird earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you have got to admit he's not bad on his assessment, as you pretty much agree. However, you're still not planning on getting a bikini any time soon. No, correct that. Any time. Period. You look across to the girls in the park. Sunbathing. Wearing next to nothing and not caring, and looking really sexy. Ouch. You realize you are having a bit of a mental dilemma. The boy in your is definitely ogling these girls now, whilst the girl in you is trying to fight the lustful feelings - but not very successfully. So Tony is hetrosexual. You know that already. but if Teagan likes girls as well, does than make her gay? But you like Kieran, and he's... well, technically a girl. Oh crap. You're a straight boy, but a gay girl? Is that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a boy in the park too - topless in a pair of shorts. You look at him, and, well.. he's just a boy.  So is Teagan gay then? Does that even make sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are really nice looking, aren't they?\" you ask, a bit uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're OK, if you like girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like girls?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd been through that one earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sorry.\" Yes, actually you remember that discussion now. \"Um, what I meant was, as a boy, what are your feelings towards girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran seems to understand that you're no longer referring specifically to the girls in the park, and that there's clearly something troubling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. You've got the hots for one of them, and can't work out why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nothing like that!\" You can feel yourself blushing. \"I was just wondering if you, um, prefer girls or boys, or just... um, special girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean do I look at girls the same way you would as a boy, the answer is no. But I also don't look at boys the same way you do. I guess I look at girls 'cos they're nice to look at... not because I want to take them to bed. Present company excepted, of course. I guess I look at some boys as they look nice, some to check out what I could do to look better myself, and some admittedly as potential girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't get the hots for any boys then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, occasionally. There are some girls and some boys who'd turn just about anyone on, regardless of your gender or orientation. But not as the norm, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you can see their potential as a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not whilst I have a girlfriend, no! I think we clarified earlier than I'm currently in a relationship, and I'm not looking to replace you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but you might if the right boy came along.. you think to yourself. So watch your step or you may be replaced... Ouch...  Grief - a traditional boy / girl relationship would be easier to cope with mentally, that's for sure. But you also know that your success rate in a traditional boy / girl relationship is pretty much zero, as you just don't seem to hack it as a boy. So as Tony you like girls but get nowhere. As Teagan you also like girls, but mostly because you're really a boy, and there are some natural instincts you cannot subdue. But you like Kieran... although he's clearly a girl really, and you like him either way. Well, maybe not so much as boy - you like him because he's really a girl, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your head spinning a bit. Your Teagan persona has pretty much given up the ghost at this point, and you feel like the umpire at a tennis match with Tony on one side of the net and Teagan on the other, batting arguments and viewpoints from their respective sides. Actually you feel more like the tennis ball, as all of the arguments seem to be hitting you, and hurting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, ultimately you're a bit of a failure as a boy. Trying to be a girl instead isn't really working as you clearly still like girls, which is weird, isn't it? So, where do you go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are aware of a noise interrupting your thinking. Kieran is talking to you, or at least trying to get your attention. <br>\r\n\"Teagan... Hello... Earth to Teagan... Once he realizes you are actually focusing on him, he continues. \"You may be trying to overthink this. You've got to try to put normal conventions to one side, and consider what is right for you. If you have the hots for those girls, then I wouldn't be offended. If you decide our relationship isn't what you want, I wouldn't be offended. If you want to go back to your life as it was before, that's your choice, but I think you decided it wasn't working and you needed something different where you could express those parts of you that were stifled before. I know its been challenging and confusing for you today, but you've proven that you're incredibly strong inside, and I'm really proud of what you've achieved. Both of you. Tony for accepting that a change was needed, and being prepared to let go, and Teagan for stepping up and being able to express your suppressed emotions and desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so that makes you feel a bit better. A bit of confidence boosting goes a long way, and perhaps was what you needed. OK, so you have a get-out clause, so you're not tied into anything you don't want to do, but also reassured that what you've doing is right. Or at least right for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you are still trying to manage both perspectives \u2013 Tony and Teagan. Perhaps this is where you need to be at the moment. You're not entirely sure if you could really go back to just being Tony again. And Teagan, being the personification of those suppressed traits, is likely to get you into trouble if you're not careful. So, you'd need to give one or the other control at appropriate times, but effectively keep an eye on them... You... Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you say, \"I went off again, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in this situation you realize there is one thing you can pretty much rely on, which is Kieran.. or Kirsty, or, um, 'K'.  Yes, that's it!  It doesn't matter to you really which of her personas she's in as its the same person inside, so if you refer to her / him as K it could well be easier to focus on the person rather than the persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" you continue, \" I've been struggling all day to work out what to call you. You know, a nickname. I can't keep calling you Kieran all the time. I can't call you sweetie 'cos you call me that, and besides it wouldn't really fit. I can't call you, um, I don't know, honey, or hottie, or anything. What I can call you is 'K'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like in 'Men in Black'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, oh, yes.  Yes, just like that. My own agent K.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I quite like hottie,\" he winks, \"but guess I could live with K. Not sure they had an agent T though, so I may not be able to reciprocate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie's fine,\" you reply. \"Well, when I'm a girl anyway.\"  But you realize you may actually adopt 'T' as being your umpire perspective - your overview between Tony and Teagan. You recall there had been an agent T, but he was decommissioned. So, you could be the new T, in control of your two competing parts. Maybe, just maybe, this could work... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's my ringtone.\u201d You manage to reach into your backpack, pull out your phone and answer it. It's your mom. She asks how you are, and if you're having a good day, but you can tell that's not the reason she's calling. After a minute she explains that her sister has called, and needs your mom to visit her. Apparently she'll being having some minor surgery, but can't be left alone afterwards, so your mom will need to be away for a couple of nights to be with her. So Amy will be in charge, and you're not to get into trouble, and mom loves you, and that's pretty much that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK. You instantly realize all the pressure is off you for a while longer. You won't need to face your mom and explain anything for at least another couple of days. Without consciously realizing it, you've started imagining numerous options to delay swapping back, and staying as a girl a bit longer. Maybe going home as Teagan. Maybe not going home at all. Maybe going back to Kieran's home. Maybe more sex with him... um, her, um, K, or Kay..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, spill the beans...\u201d Kay says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry. That was my mom. She's got to go away for a couple of days, so it's just Amy and me at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, rightie. Are you OK with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. She's been away before and we've not burnt the house down yet. We'll manage OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any house rules?\" You give a quizzical look. \"You know - a curfew or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. If Mom's away Amy probably won't be home 'til late. She may technically be in charge, but she's unlikely to even be at home much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're free all evening then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess so yes. Did you have anything in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. When we were at Mrs Longbottom's I may have picked up something as a surprise for you. It may be the chance to try it on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK. Something for you, or me? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not telling. That would spoil the surprise, wouldn't it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so you cannot fail to be interested. On the basis it was a lingerie store, then realistically it must be underwear of some sort, but what? You half hope its something really sexy for Kirsty to wear, but suspect it's more likely something sexy for Teagan, which is almost as exciting. You decide to message Amy asking her what she's doing, and try to work out if she'll be going home later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: <i>Just heard from mom. You at home or out? Any plans for later?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: <i>Yeah. Bummer. Home now. Out later. How you getting on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: <i>Good. Sticking around with Kirsty. You be cooking tea later?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: <i>U kidding? B gone B4 then. On ur own with that. B back around 12. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  U still playing swapsies? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: <i>Yep</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: <i>OK. No worries. Don't say I didn't warn you. Just leave my stuff alone. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: <i><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/pthb.png\" alt=\"*Pthb*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Pthb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Amy will be out before teatime and not back until midnight, so an empty house all evening. What the heck did she mean about her stuff? You feel a bit annoyed that she'd even think you might want to try on anything of hers. It's not as if... well, if you're really honest with yourself you had previously sneaked in to her room and tried on a couple of things, but only to see what they felt like... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so maybe she has a point. She knows all about Kirsty's preferences, and knows you've swapped clothes with her, so perhaps it's not an unreasonable assumption that you may want to try on other things.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou update Kay. \u201cAmy will be out later, so we could head back to my place later.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds promising. We could drop in at my place on the way. I could drop off my backpack, have a shower, pick up a few bits, and change into something more suitable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't quite work out what would be more suitable that a tee shirt and shorts seeing the weather is so warm, but decide not to challenge it. You walk back to your bikes, ready to go, and as you mount your bike you're no longer worried about anyone seeing your panties as you swing you leg over the saddle, knowing nobody would see anything that wouldn't look perfectly normal for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you both set off on your bikes.</span></div></div>",

Kay opens up the garage door and you park your bikes inside. He then leads you into the house, and shows you around. You notice that everything is very tidy and organised, and Kay's bedroom puts yours to shame. You notice it's not particularly aligned to either gender specifically, but more neutral. He has his own en-suite bathroom, and a closet that you reckon is even bigger than his bathroom, with rails and racks of clothing laid out in two distinct sections \u2013 the left side for girl clothes and the right side for boy clothes - almost if a brother and sister shared the closet, keeping everything separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself scanning across the dresses, shirts, blouses and skirts hanging there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKirsty doesn't really wear much of that lot anymore.\u201d Kay says. \u201cFor the most part she sticks to her school uniform, as she's not really around much otherwise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're well aware of her school uniform, and to be honest you've always considered her really attractive, verging on sexy, wearing it. Which all things considered doesn't make sense. Surely she'd play down that side of her as clearly she really wants to be a boy. So, how come she looks so good as a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask something?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should know the answer to that one by now. Of course you can.\" Kay looks at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you, um, when Kirsty comes to school, she looks very, um, pretty, I mean, um, nice...  um, girly.\" You know you're blushing a little, but realize you can't stop now. \"How does she look so... Erm, why does she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. I get the gist of what you're asking. How does Kirsty manage to be the most attractive girl at school, despite having no boobs?\" He winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By committing to being Kirsty.\"   You return a confused and quizzical look.  Kay continues \"OK. so, when it's a school day Kirsty is in charge, and I go to sleep for the day. Kirsty takes care of school, and does everything to make herself feel good. Whatever she wants to do, that's up to her. When she comes home we generally swap, so she goes to sleep and I take over. That's the agreement we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generally?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. Depends if she has homework to do, in which case she's welcome to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. OK. So, how does she manage to look so... erm... good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! You mean I don't?\" Kay asks, with a mock shocked expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. But you don't look sexy, I mean, um, girly sexy, like Kirsty does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay seems to consider something for a second or two before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Kirsty and I decided to separate we agreed the only way we could really live independently was to give the other total control when it was their time. I'm perhaps not the most macho boy in the World, but Kirsty is quite girlie. So if she wants to look her best as a girl then I don't have an issue with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay holds you gently by each shoulder and looks directly into your eyes. \"Commitment. Absolute and total commitment. No half measures. No doubts and wondering what the other might say. Each has got to trust the other implicitly and let them do whatever they need to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, you can almost feel the words hitting you consciousness, and you know he's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues. \"At school you reckon Kirsty is sexy, eh?  Well, if you'd commit yourself fully to Teagan, and I mean commit absolutely, then I reckon we could get you looking equally sexy, and you'd feel like it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you'd previously decided to let Teagan run the show for a while, but this is one step further. Could you actually shut Tony out completely for a while? Do you want to shut Tony out?  In your mind you picture yourself as the tennis umpire again... Tee.  With Tony on one side and Teagan on the other.  You realize as the umpire it's your call, but you try to sense your feeling from both sides. Tony is a bit apprehensive, but Teagan is really excited. <i>OK, let's work this out. Mom's away for two nights. It's the weekend. Amy knows and she's unfazed. We won't get another chance like this so it's now or never. If it really doesn't work out then nobody can say we didn't try. So, Teagan will have 100% control for the next 24 hours unless there's a crisis. OK?</i> Both of your mental selves agree, albeit one more reservedly than the other. You visualize a door to a bedroom, and gently push Tony through, shutting the door behind him - but consciously not locking it. Then you turn to Teagan. <i>You up for this?</i>  You can feel the positivity.  <i>OK, be good. Off you go...</i> You mentally swap places, and feel the umpire Tee evaporate away, leaving you as Teagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK, so who are you? <b>Teagan.</b>   What are you?  <b>A bloody girl, that's what!</b>   What do you want to do? <b>Anything, so long as it's really girlie.</b><br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThis dialogue in your mind has only actually taken a couple of seconds. You look back at Kieran, and realize that actually he does look quite sexy. You're not sure why you hadn't thought that before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for it!\" you say. \"Where do I start?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd say the first priorities should be getting you looking and feeling as feminine as you can, so silky smooth skin, trimmed and styled hair, trim and treat your nails, good make-up, and the right outfit. The rest of it will be attitude and behaviors, and we can refine them later on. We can start here and now if you want \u2013 I've got pretty much everything here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Teagan you're now eager, so have no hesitation in agreeing. Kay takes you back into the bathroom, shows you where everything is, and suggests you apply a liberal covering of Veet all over your body first, have a soak in the tub (with a generous glug of lavender bubble bath), then moisturize thoroughly. In the meantime he says he'll get everything ready for the next stages afterwards.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you spend the next hour pampering yourself, or at least spending a lot more attention on your skin and appearance than you ever have before. You then find yourself wrapped in a silky dressing gown with Kay trimming and styling your hair, conscious that he's not letting you see what it's looking like yet.

Mind you, it would be nice to show you off on our first night as a couple, so maybe we could go somewhere. I promise to get you home safely afterwards though.\u201d  He thinks for a moment and then continues. \u201cI think one of these should fit the bill just about right \u2013 which one would you prefer?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're slightly put back that after suggesting you choose an outfit he seems to have pretty much made the choice for you, but at least you'll have the final say. He's holding up two outfits \u2013 one a V neck dress, basically white with fairly delicate splashes of color, and whilst showing quite a lot of leg, is reasonable conservative. The other is a halter neck top, and a pair of denim shorts, which you'd imagine would barely even cover your panties, and would leave pretty much the entirety of your legs exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will you opt for?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>OK Tony. It's like this. Mom and I have been a bit worried about you for a while. We know you're not happy about everything - particularly not having any real mates, and not being able to get a girlfriend. With your looks Mom always reckoned you would have been better off if you'd been born a girl anyway. Then the other week I noticed some of my clothes had been, um, moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast your mind back. Oh crap. Yes, you'd sneaked into Amy's room one evening when she was out a few weeks ago. But only to look at some of her clothes 'cos they looked, well, nice, and to be honest you did try a couple of things on... but you'd left everything as it was before, so she can't be certain it was you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before you summon up the courage to try to argue the point, she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before you try to deny it, it's not the first time I'd noticed. However, I'm open minded enough not to stop you. Anyway, we reckoned that if there was an opportunity for you to have a go properly, then you could find out which you really prefer. Then I remembered Kirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. So Amy's open minded enough not to say anything to you, but she told mom!  But what has this to do with Kirsty? You look quizzically at her, almost afraid to open your mouth in case the wrong thing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kirsty and I are old friends. The thing is she has a secret. She's straight, but she doesn't like boys much... unless they're dressed as girls. She likes to swap roles with her boyfriends. Sometimes she'll dress as a boy and get her boyfriend to dress like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. did she really just say that?  \"Surely she couldn't, um, wouldn't, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so she does tend to stick with the, shall we say, more cute boys rather than sports jocks. Anyway, she reckoned that she could get you fully dressed as a girl by lunchtime, and looks like she was right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" You retort. \"She didn't... I mean, I... \" You realize that either you go along with what Amy is suggesting, or admit that swapping clothes with Kirsty was your idea, neither of which was true. How can you say it just happened?  Of course that wouldn't explain the makeup, which was definitely intentional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to find your voice. \"You mean Kirsty's had boyfriends before who, um, she's dressed up as girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Well, obviously not forced them to, but basically yes.   So, our idea was that once you're properly dressed as a girl you can seen what it's really like, rather than just playing dress up in my bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to ignore that last dig, party because of the element of truth in it. \"So, this was all a fix? I thought Kirsty liked me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does, and it wasn't a fix. When I realized you had a crush on her the idea just came together. As soon as I mentioned to her that you fancied her she wanted to have a date. She thinks you're really cute, and that stuff about her being in a new relationship is true enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just failed to mention that she likes cute boys dressed as girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might not have happened. You could have said no... Anyway, I came over to see how things were going, and to let you know that whatever you decide to do is OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I wasn't planning to stay like this!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's your choice. All I'm saying is if you decide you like it, then there really wouldn't be an issue.\" She grasps one of your hands. \"Look, don't worry about how or why. You look really nice as a girl, so enjoy yourself for now. If you come home as yourself that's fine, but if you decide to come home as my little sister Antonia, that would be OK too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gives you a peck on your cheek, gets up and leaves. And that's that.  You're a bit shell-shocked by the whole thing now. So Amy was in on it. Oh, and mom. And this was all just an elaborate ploy to get you dressed this way to see if you feel better as a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit in the cafe area and consider your position for a few minutes. You're torn between anger and acute embarrassment, and feel like a total idiot. In the end you decide there's no point lingering here, but you should go back to Kirsty. Somehow you know you should feel angry towards here too, but you can't quite work out how she could have done it all anyway. Surely it was you who'd been trying to get her undressed, and all she'd done was suggest a couple of swaps for what seemed like valid reasons. Weren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything, Amy did actually have a good point. You had previously tried on some of her clothes in what you thought was the privacy of her bedroom to see how they looked and felt on you. You had no intentions of actually staying dressed as a girl, but you did enjoy the feeling, and reckoned you looked OK in some of her stuff, and half imagined what it might be like as a girl, looking at your reflection in the mirror. You took the selfies earlier for the same reason \u2013 you reckoned you looked quite good, and wanted to remember it. But that's a far cry from going home dressed like this, or wanting to be known as Antonia. That's just ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go back to Kirsty, and, well... Actually you realize that nobody has batted an eyelid about you being dressed as you are, as they all genuinely seem to think you are a girl, so given that it's been a bit of a secret desire to dress as a girl, it really wouldn't harm to spend a bit longer like this before changing back \u2013 especially as your secret is apparently common knowledge. Despite Amy's interference you reckon you may as well make the most of the opportunity whilst you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, tuck the chair under the table, dispose of the empty drinks breaker, and head out from the information center.  On the way back to the hide you carry on thinking about what you're going to say to Kirsty, wondering if you should tell her that Amy's spoken to you, how much she's told Kirsty about your secret, and in fact how much mom knows (or thinks she knows) and above all whether or not Kirsty actually likes you, or if it was all a ploy to support Amy's ambition to get you dressed up as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the hide Kirsty is still there, lying spread eagled in the sunshine near the hide \u2013 still dressed in your tee shirt and shorts. You sit down beside here, and she glances toward you. \u201cHello sweetie,\u201d she says.\u201cYou were a long time having a pee. Everything OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm fine,\u201d you reply, \u201c...but.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kirsty sits up, faces you, and grasps your hand. \u201cBut what, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still haven't decided exactly how to confront her, but being challenged like this, you finally succumb to what you've been valiantly trying to avoid, and burst into tears. You feel Kirsty's arms wrap around you, and find her shoulder just where your head can bury in to hide from the World, and you have a good sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe soothes you and after a couple of minutes you calm down a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. I don't think that was a reaction to the quality of the restroom, so I'd guess there's something more. Could I guess you were a bit surprised by something you saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, still not daring to try to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is that all, or anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I see. Well, then I guess there's not a lot I can really say until you're up to telling me a bit more.\u201d She kisses you lightly on your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is a bit of a jumble, not knowing what to ask first, but eventually you manage to spit out a few blubbery words. \u201cI saw Amy....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK, I see. And being the loving and caring big sister she is, she told you everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you're wondering about your entire lifetime's worth of perceptions, whether you've been living a lie all this time, and how best to move forward with your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d you reply, and after clearing your throat, continue, albeit in a slightly faltering voice. \u201cNo, I just wondered if you really like me, or if you're only seeing me because Amy talked to you...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK, rewind a bit then. Ignore my last question...\u201d To be honest you didn't quite understand what she said anyway, so it won't be difficult to forget. Kirsty continues speaking. \u201dYes, I really like you. Amy mentioned a couple of evenings ago that you've a bit of a crush on me, which I thought was really sweet. To be honest I thought you'd make a nice catch for the right person, but until Amy mentioned it, I hadn't really thought that might be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, is it true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I like you? Um, yes... Think I just covered that one.  I suspect you've moved on to something else?  Is what true sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you don't like boys unless they're girls? I mean, dressed as girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot entirely true, but there's certainly an element of truth there, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don't like girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well. Probably not in the way you're thinking. I'm straight, if that's what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, why do you like boys dressed as girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause... well its a bit of a long story, but I'll try to keep it short. I discovered that boys are self centered arrogant idiots with single or at best twin tracked minds, and decided they don't warrant much consideration for, well, anything at all really. However, I'm not into girls, so wasn't going anywhere and realized there was a certain physical aspect that drew me towards boys. It was the mental side that seemed to be the root of the problem. Then I found there were some boys who were a bit more, um, more open minded with a more sensitive disposition, and not wholly driven by their testosterone. They tended to be a bit less domineering and forthright, which was OK, so I ended up taking the lead at times. This got me a reputation as a control freak. Seems that's OK for a boy, but I was just perceived as a bossy girl. The logical step was for me to take on the boy's role a bit more fully, which of course necessitated my boyfriend taking on the girl's role. So, there we are...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sort of makes sense, although there seemed to be some critical bits left out.  \u201cSo, if I'm going to be your boyfriend, then am I actually going to be your girlfriend?\u201d You look down at yourself, dressed in Kirsty's clothes, and realize that if you stick with her you could be dressing like this a lot more. You're uncertain whether you're worried or excited by the prospect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that would be the option that would work best for me.  I guess I'm attracted to boys with more of a girl's perception and outlook, and somehow they don't need much persuading for them to dress as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't want to dress as a girl all the time!\u201d you reply, a bit concerned of the potential implications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Beside, there's hardly anyone here anyway, and probably nobody you know, so there a better than even chance nobody would recognize you, in which case you'd never win the bet.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty continues, \"OK, I'll make it easier for you. If while you're wearing my clothes we come across anyone who isn't clearly quite convinced you're a girl, then my offer will stand, and I'll do anything you ask me to...  <i>Anything...</i> \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quite sure you don't look that convincing as a girl, regardless that the warden seeming to think you were. So, you're quite sure that someone will realize the truth. That would mean you'll get humiliated. However, the upside is that Kirsty will then have to follow through on her side of the bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, thinking this through you realize there could only be a choice of two outcomes. Either the impossible will happen and Kirsty is right, nobody will think you're anything but a girl, and the afternoon will pass relatively quietly, or Kirsty is wrong, you will get found out, be embarrassed for a while, but she'll then do anything you ask of her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. You're on.\" you spurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahah. Just when I was beginning to doubt you a little. Good.  So there are a couple of conditions, just to give me a fighting chance - but nothing too draconian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK.\" You respond, getting a little suspicious. \"And they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, firstly you can't call me Kirsty. You'll have to call me by a boy's name instead. Maybe, um, Chris. That should be close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a minute.\" you jump in, \"You're not going to make me respond to Lucy Lou or any silly girl's name, are you. That's not on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't do <i>that</i> to you!  I wasn't intending to call you anything different than Toni...  well, not unless you wanted me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, good.\" you reply, for a moment distracted from the first part of the condition. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you mustn't do anything to make it obvious you aren't a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean like shouting out 'I'm a boy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that. No overly boyish behavior. If you just try to pretend you are a girl that'll be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. OK, I guess.\" you reply.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, one last thing. Before we go I just want to put a little moisturizer on your face.\" Kirsty picks up a little tub. \"Your face is drying out in this sunshine. This is rehydration cream.\" She picks out a little cylinder. \"This is a hydrating lip balm. You haven't brought sunglasses, so I think you'd better have some protection around your eyes as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. That is <i>just</i> moisturizer, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because it looks like make-up doesn't mean it is. Fundamentally a lot of make-up is just moisturizers, cleansers, and something to hide spots or blemishes. The proportion of make-up to pure moisturizer in these things is really next to nothing. Now, stand still, shut your eyes, and let me get this moisturiser on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really noticing that she hadn't actually answered your question, you comply, letting Kirsty apply the cream to your face, gently rubbing it in, and then running a finger gently across each of your closed eyes, and it feels weirdly like she's drawing along each eyelid. After being chastised earlier you decide not to challenge her, but stay still. Then she asks you to purse your lips, and she applies the lip balm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, all done.\" Kirsty says. \"That will help protect your skin a bit better and help your complexion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you.\" you reply, still feeling a bit subdued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Give me a hand with the groundsheet and we'll be ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Kirsty fold it up, and she returns it into her bag again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, are you ready to go for a walk now Toni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes I think so, um, Chris...\" God, that sounds so weird.

Kirsty nods and confirmed she will. \"OK, so have you got any make-up I could borrow?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" She pulls a small bag out from her backpack, and hands it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK. And could you perhaps help me put some on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I guess you haven't used any before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not! I've seen Amy putting some on, but that's all.

Stand still, shut your eyes, and give me a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply, letting Kirsty rub various things in to you face and forehead, running her fingers gently across each of your closed eyes, then doing something with your eyelids and pulling them to do something with your eyelashes, or at least so it feels. She asks you to purse your lips, and she applies something to them, you assume lip balm or lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, all done.\" Kirsty says. \"I could do better with more time, but you'll pass rudimentary inspection.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you.\" you reply.

You are taking this seriously, aren't you? I think I may have misjudged you. You are really determined to see this through.\"  Unbeknown to you she gently punches the air with one fist, and grins to herself. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. There are two reasons. I don't want to be caught out. That could be a bit humiliating. I'm also keen to hold you to the bet.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. I'd completely forgotten about that.\" Kirsty says, with a shocked look on her face. \"Oh dear. Had I remembered that I don't think I would have possibly agreed to do your make-up...Oh well, can't take it off now.\" She smiles at you. You feel its a bit odd that despite what she's saying she remains upbeat and cheerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold the groundsheet up between you, and Kirsty returns it to her backpack.  So, you're ready to head off.</span></div></div>",

It seems the reeds that you're standing on are not actually on the bank of the lake at all, but clearly over water, and clearly no longer able to support your weight.

The girls almost feel like they're leaping for freedom with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemurely, at the bottom, you try to control the heat flooding your cheeks. The fear of falling out, too humiliating to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Misayo, I've done my part.\" her voice firm, proud, \"Now, with this excellent base, you have your part of the assignment.\" Her hand waving up and down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your true identity is only known within the class, and for you to pass, you must convince people that you truly are an exchange student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisayo's face fell, even now with this demeaning body she wasn't assured to even pass. The idea of being stuck like this for the whole semester a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep the solvent, so you don't chicken out.\" Rachel's tone not even a question. \"Are you happy with that?\" Even now, her glare defied her to say anything other than \"Yes, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank me for these too.\" she told Misayo. Rachel's finger jabbing towards her enormous breasts. Only just stopping short of contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these, the boys will barely notice that you have a head or a face.\"</span></div></div>",

Putting on the gaffe yourself, you glue gets everywhere, almost sticking your legs together. But you show your work to her, walking back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixing the fake breasts in place, you're relieved that they're not bigger or too obvious. The extra padding added to your rump feels a little unnecessary, but Rachel insists. The seams where the faux flesh merges with your own is a shift in skin tone, a touch uneven. But once you're clothed, it'll vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing you a towel, some soap, and a long haired wig, she tells you to go for a shower. Your question about whether you can wash with them on, dies in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must be clear in your eyes, as she taps the bottle of remover. Drumming her fingernails over the cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you make a convincing woman, your small stature working in your favour, and your lack of muscles and sporting prowess helping too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower is warmly welcoming, and the soap lathers quickly. A vague prickle runs over your skin, and a worry about whether you're allergic to something in it quickly surfaces, and vanishes. The itching eases as if you've washed it away. The long hair feels like it's attached to your head, as you  work the shampoo in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxuriating in the heat, feels so good you don't want to leave. However, Rachel starts knocking on the door, lewd suggestions, and questions fired at you through the closed door. Blushing and agitated you get out and towel yourself dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin feels alive, more sensitive than before, and you pull on one of your own shirts. Almost instantly, you want to tear it off, as you catch your reflection in the fogged mirror. Your skin is perfect, with no trace of the seams you spotted before, no hint that anything is fake or applied. Running your fingers over you can't find any trace. Hell, you can't even be sure that's where you remembered it being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, still swimming in your shirt you exit the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/83/db/a483db40134c9c50fc1152f972bfdab4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/83/db/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel takes you in with fresh eyes. The look of appreciation on her face feels mixed in with a hint of jealousy. Both the appreciative gaze, and the jealousness adds to your nervousness. Unsure which is worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like you've been reborn in that shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u5a3c\u5987\", \"Chang Fu\", \"That'll be your name now.\" Rachel announces.</span></div></div>",

She sits on the bed beside you, and caresses a lock of hair aside. Brushing it back over your shoulder and out of the way. The soft touch is soothing, her voice feels like treacle, warm and smothering. As you surrender to her, you feel your eyes become heavy and droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're a good Chinese Girl.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself nodding, you do make a good Chinese girl.

At the back of your mind, deep inside, a sense of wrongness passes over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Chang Fu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaureen's hand pats your shoulder, and you bat your eyelashes as if waking, and look around the lovely room.
