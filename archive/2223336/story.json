Once you check your body, you would find that you are relatively unharmed, though you feel like you've ran a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning you would quickly do a head shoulders knees and toes to check your vitals and to make sure all parts were still attached.

When you say you look over the wreckage, you mean you look over the tiny pieces of shrapnel that once was your bike. Anything that would have been usable had long since gone up in flames or had been warped beyond all recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting you would curse your luck, \"Of all the ways to start a day....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after tediously searching for any useful item you would have to give way to the fact that there was nothing usable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one thing left to do then...\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn your attention back to the cobblestone road, you would notice that it runs East to West. North of the cobblestone road there is a Forest that could probably provide you with nuts and berries. To the South, as far as the eye can see there is Plains. You know you have to pick a direction, but which way do you go?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

There was a slight breeze blowing and the temperature was around seventy-five degrees, perfect for light stroll. You noted that it was mid-morning, and slightly cloudy, though it didn't feel humid, so rain was out of the question.

Their metal armor shines in the sunlight with a freshly polished glint. You would also notice that these guards were all women. The blue and white banner sigil is emblazoned upon their breastplates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were within earshot, one of these female guards would shout out to you, \"Halt, who goes there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
