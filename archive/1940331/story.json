            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Earth, the third planet of the Sol system, is a bluish-green planet teeming with life.  This planet is home to an industrious species known as humanity.  Their competitiveness and fiercely independent spirit would one day be legendary throughout the known galaxy.  Many who try to destroy them discover that humanity has the uncanny ability to adapt and overcome in any situation.  Even in the face of certain annihilation they display unwavering determination not to be ruled.  If only they ever ceased fighting amongst themselves could they achieve true greatness.  Humanity is an intriguing race capable of achieving impossible feats of kindness or unleashing unspeakable evil across the cosmos.  Whatever their choice, it is safe to say that their future will be one to be closely observed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8 July 2109<br>\r\n1152 GMT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash of white light disturbs the otherwise serene emptiness of space surrounding Earth.  A large, dark object could be observed tumbling through space once the glow finally fades away.  This object clearly was of alien design.  The silhouette of the object was obscured by the planet eclipsing the sunlight.  A distant observer could discern the object was circular in shape with the width incredibly narrow at the outer edges while widening to become almost spherical towards the center due to the tumbling motion.  The object clearly lacked the bulky lumps of a rogue asteroid or meteor.  Closer observation revealed that the center of the object was a perfect sphere with several outer rings that were perfectly aligned at the moment.  The surface of the entire object was designed to be flawless but there were numerous areas that looked as if they had been struck by an incredible amount of force.  Whatever the object was, the flash appeared to have brought the strange artifact that was now heading directly for the planet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump achieved with sixty-three percent accuracy.\u201d  A male voice said in the darkness.  The voice was synthesized by the computer of the ship that was now flying through Earth\u2019s space.  Falling actually was a much more accurate statement.  The ship had been severely damaged in multiple areas that the pilot was made painfully aware of by the numerous screens populating his helmet HUD in the dark cockpit.  Red sections, symbols, and numbers flashed annoyingly in his face while he initiated the reboot sequence for the cockpit display.  This task was incredibly difficult because most of his efforts were being diverted to simply staying awake.  Whatever inflicted the damage upon the pilot\u2019s ship inflicted the same amount of damage upon the pilot himself and the loss of blood was taking its toll.  He would have been dead already had it not been for the ship\u2019s A.I. auto-correcting the ship\u2019s last jump leading him to this place.  The ship could have found itself deflecting off of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, warp in to an asteroid belt, phasing through the center of a star, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting the cockpit display up and running, the pilot could see how bad his situation really was.  He first used the thrusters to prevent his ship from spinning on a third axis that made him appear to be rolling through space.  Next he tried to correct the ship\u2019s trajectory for descent but found his controls unresponsive.  \u201cNu\u2026\u201d  He said weakly to the ship\u2019s artificial intelligence as blood trickled down the side of his mouth.  It would take the ship\u2019s computer only a moment to respond.  \u201cThe primary sub-light engines and grave drive are non-responsive Noel; we will have to switch to thrusters.\u201d  Nu, the artificial intelligence who had guided the ship, awaited a response from the pilot but did not receive one.  Noel had expended all of his energy remaining conscious up until this point and could hold on no longer.  He felt himself slipping away from consciousness despite his best efforts.  Nu said something about his vitals dropping to try and stimulate a response from Noel with little success.  The next few moments passed in a haze for the wounded pilot.  All he could see was a familiar metallic sphere that seemed to swim through the cockpit before plugging itself into the neural interface controlling the ship.  Nu mentioned initiating an emergency protocol before a semi-transparent film encased what was left of Noel\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdentifying suitable impact area,\u201d  Nu began to say while his metallic avatar took control of the falling ship.  He was searching for a highly populated area with the highest readings of technology while ensuring the impact of a crash landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuitable location determined, scanning the immediate area for a suitable host.\u201d  Nu now began searching for a host for Noel.  He was specifically looking for one that had the closest physiological similarity as Noel, neural compatibility with Noel, and would be able to handle a psychic implant with minimal side-effects like insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHost identified\u2026\u201d  Were the last words that Noel remembered hearing before his haze finally faded completely to black.  His body felt like it was melting away before becoming completely numb and detached.  Then there was nothing, no thoughts, no dreams, nothing but a dark emptiness.  Noel did not feel like a physical creature anymore.  He was not attached to the material world.  It was like his spirit was shedding his physical form in preparation for the next big step into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, almost disappointingly, Noel could feel his soul being pulled back in to the material realm as his physical senses returned to him.  First a numb, tingling sensation spread throughout his body as it adjusted to the new muscles and their positioning.  As his center of gravity adjusted, he could tell he was lying on his back.  Next he could feel air being inhaled to nourish his new muscles through the nose as his nose detected the distinct smell of flowers.  Then a feint white noise that his ears must have picked up grew into muffled sounds that his ears began to pick up.  Finally, the dark emptiness that Noel had become familiar faded away as he opened his unfocused eyes to view the world around him with.</span></div></div>",

A few blinks to adjust to the dim lighting and he would see why he was having difficulties.  The only source of light in the room was a television that was set on what must have been the news channel.  A female news anchor was talking while images words streamed at the bottom of the screen and images of weapons appeared behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel quickly diverted his attention to the rest of the room to see what he could discover about his new location.  The first thing he noticed was how small and Spartan the room was.  The room was big enough for a twin sized bed, a dresser situated under the bed, and a locker at the foot of the bed.  Next to the head of the bed was a nightstand that held a vase full of flowers with several framed pictures hard to see in this light.  Across the tiny room was a desk pressed up against the wall with a comfortable looking chair and a flat screen TV mounted above it on the wall.  Past the desk was a cabinet that had about half of its surface occupied by a sink and a mirror above the sink.  The room reminded him of the compact rooms on capital ships where space was a premium, even the one window on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Window!\u2019  Noel thought to himself excitedly as he immediately shot up from his bed to get a better view.  That window would provide him with critical information about the world around him before he ever ventured into the unknown.  He quickly noticed the night sky when he sat upright but his attention pulled to a suddenly more pressing matter.  Noel\u2019s quick movements made him realize something so terrible that his froze in place while his eyes grew wide with fear.  The sudden movement caused him to notice the unusual amount of weight placed upon his chest, a weight that was a part of his new body, soft, not taught like muscle, and incredibly sensitive, like a ticklish spot he had when growing up except twice as sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had a fairly good idea of what the weight upon his chest must be but couldn\u2019t bring himself to look.  He was too terrified to confront what he knew was true just yet.  Instead, he Noel would raise his left hand to be sure he wasn\u2019t going crazy.  His hand wouldn\u2019t stop trembling as it slowly approached the area of concern.  When Noel\u2019s hand finally pressed against his chest, he grimaced as his horrors came true.  His chest was far larger, more sensitive, and softer than it should be.  The only logical conclusion was that his chest belonged to a female host.  \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He whispered to himself while tightly shutting his eyes.  He refused to believe the Nu would do such a thing to him while his new ears confirmed that his voice was far more effeminate than a man\u2019s voice.  Noel barely opened his eyes to peek down and saw what he feared all along.  He had a pair of voluptuous breasts attached to his host\u2019s body.  \u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel jumped out of his bed, practically falling over because he was still getting acclimated with his new body\u2019s muscles and the unusual center of gravity that came with being a female.  \u201cNu,\u201d He called out to his ship\u2019s AI while looking out the window.  There was a scowl on his face as he pointed up towards the sky.  \u201cI swear to GOD that I will deactivate you if you don\u2019t change me right now!\u201d  It was clear in his voice, even though it wasn\u2019t his own, that a line had been crossed and an uncontrollable amount of rage was building up inside him.  He knew that Nu knew it too because the two were psychically linked.  \u201cDo you hear me Nu?\u201d  Noel said once more when he did not get a response back from the ship\u2019s AI.  \u201cI will end you\u2026\u201d  His voice trailed off as his face shifted from anger to horror.  The pilot could see a ball of fire in the sky falling rapidly towards Earth.  It was his ship, he could feel it.  Nu was doing his best to slow the descent, which is why the ship hadn\u2019t reached terminal velocity, but the ship was still falling fast enough to look like a meteor getting ready to crash into the planet.  \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d  The man watched as his ship fell from the sky in a brilliant ball of flames, crashing somewhere in the distant horizon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noel sat down on the bed in the Spartan room, resting his foreign elbows upon foreign knees before burying his new face in his new hands.  \u201cThis is all wrong\u2026\u201d  He said to himself in an unfamiliar voice.  Noel looked up from his slender hands and a set of pictures on the nightstand caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of girl is this?\u201d  Noel wondered aloud and allowed the remark to hang in the air for a moment.  He was a little hesitant to find out but decided it must be done.  He needed to know whom he was occupying and, if necessary, imitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, the man reached over for the nearest picture and saw what appeared to be a family portrait.  He could see an older man standing up with three other older looking women while nearly a dozen children were huddled around the feet of the adults.  Every single one of the children was a girl save for one.  The picture was an interesting choice for a portrait but everyone appeared to be happy and Noel assumed his host was among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the picture, Noel looked at the other pictures on the nightstand.  A single girl appeared to be the theme of the collection of photos.  The first photo was of the girl wearing a single piece swimsuit that had the number 18 on it while holding up a medal.  The second photo was of the same girl running in what appeared to be a marathon with the actual medal itself draped around the picture frame.  The third photo was of the girl flanked by a girl on either side wearing something of a uniform while resting a sword on her shoulder.  The fourth picture was of the girl wearing a leotard in what Noel assumed was a dance recital.  A fifth picture was of the girl in a gymnastics uninform twirling in mid-air while the sixth picture was of her in black leather standing next to a red and black motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even more pictures on the second shelf of the nightstand.  One of the same girl at the shooting range with the man from the portrait.  Another picture was of the girl wearing a white tank top and boxer shorts with a pair of glove dangling around her neck while holding up her finger indicating she was number one.  There was yet another picture of the girl wearing what looked like a medical uniform in the driver\u2019s seat of a medical vehicle.  The final photograph was of the same person, only now slightly older, in uniform wearing a beret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly what I was expecting\u2026\u201d  Noel finally said to himself as he set the last picture down.  He assumed that the girl\u2019s father was absent most of the time so she spent most of her time trying to please him while he was there.  That meant she shaped her activities and goals around what she thought her father would approve of.  This was all speculative but what else would make sense about a girl who appeared to act like a guy in most of her photos.  The girl played with swords, boxed, and joined the military.  What else would drive a normal woman to such extremes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d  Noel said as he looked over to the mirror he saw in the room earlier.  He needed to see just how much the woman has changed since those last photos he saw.  \u201cTime to meet her face to face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel stood up and walked over to the mirror to see who would be staring back at him.  What he saw was breath taking for multiple reasons.  The woman staring back at him appeared to be in her early twenties and was an incredible sight to behold.  She had black, silk-like hair that complimented her thin, shapely eyebrows.  Her eyes were emerald green and contrasted beautifully with her tanned skin color that many of Mediterranean descent shared.  Her nose was petite and her red lips were full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking down the neck, Noel saw an incredibly toned yet slender body.  He suspected that all of the girl\u2019s physical activities would have made her bulk up even more had she not run marathons or swam.  Now the woman had an hourglass figure instead of bulking up like a man, though he doubted any would mistake her for one because of how voluptuous she was.  That seemed to be the only trace of fat on her body as her stomach was completely cut and only flared out to show off her very shapely gluts.  Long, smooth legs stretched to the floor where barefeet now touched the cool tile floor.  All in all, this girl was quite a physical specimen and was nowhere near the worst of what could have happened to Noel.  Still, this body was a female\u2019s and he was incredibly uncomfortable occupying it and controlling it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lamenting once more at the fact he was now in a female's body, Noel hung his head in shame at his predicament only to notice the irrefutable evidence that he was in fact in a female's body once more.  He shook his head in disgust at himself and tried to avert his eyes only to notice two sets of doors by the sink.  The first door was clearly marked bathroom while the second was a two panel door that was vented.  He assumed that this door must be a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel opened the door of the closet and could not suppress his smile from what he saw.  In front of him was a full bodysuit colored black.  The suit was made out of thin, lightweight fiber with the strength of steel similar to that of spider-silk with small ceramic paints protecting vital areas.  Retractable claws overhang the fingers on the suit's gloves that would be useful for climbing or close quarters combat.  The left arm also had what appeared to be a spike launcher attached to a cord for climbing.  The right arm had a wrist mounted most likely used for cutting through obstacles whether living or inanimate.  Meanwhile the head has a fully contained environmental facemask and some sort of optics device to see in various spectrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\"  Noel chuckled in delight as he stepped into the closet to get a better look at the suit.  He noticed that there was a sheath on the back of the suit with a high-frequency blade.  The very sight of the blade seemed impractical to Noel but he did see a picture of this girl in something of a sword fighting club.  Perahps his host was skilled with a blade and utilized it greatly in combination with stealth.  That would put make her work distinguished and play a psycological factor in some cases.  Regardless, this suit was going to provide him with stealth, mobility, protection, and firewpower.  It was even silky smooth to te touch.  \"Now this is what I'm talking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile was still on 'Noel's' face as he looked over to the mirror to try and picture himself in the suit.  That was when he remembered that he was still in the female's body and going to have to do something uncomfortable for him.  He took off the pink tank top with spaghetti straps so his female host was down to nothing but her black braw and black boyshorts.  Then he wrestled with the full bodysuit to gear up.  He found getting the suit past his wide hips and large chest particularly challenging.  Even then, he had the difficult of adjust the straps underneath the suit to make his sensitive chest comfortable.  The suit ended up being formfitting in the end with the ceramic plates being padded fortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough horsing around,\"  The time traveller said to himself as he did a quick diagnostic on the suit with his wrist computer to ensure everything was functioning properly.  \"Time to get things started.\"</span></div></div>",

Still groggy, he halfheartedly lifted himself up from hit bed sheets to take another look at his surroundings. Aside from the small amount of clothes strewn around the floor, the room was immaculate: a desk neatly organized with a small laptop and blank sheets of paper, a black mesh swivel chair, a small built-in closet, on the window was a small potted plant and on the door was a body mirror. Looking at his reflection had him take a second look. His body was relatively unchanged though his hair seemed a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Noel whispered to himself as he opened the door leading to what looked like a living room. Based on the decor and the view from the window, Noel was able to infer that this was an apartment room for a bachelor given it's small size and bare decor though that didn't really explain why he was still himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel wandered the room until he heard the shattering of cup behind turning around quickly he saw a man in his late twenties with big 5 o'clock shadow watching stunned at the strange man leaving his room. Noel could see the man was starting to hyperventilate as slowing backed away before making a break for the front door. Not missing a beat, Noel rushed at the man, making a copy of himself at the door as it met his line of sight. This, however, only made the man panic as he nearly tripped at Noel appearing in front of him, obstructing his path like a monster in a horror movie. Before the man could make a move he found himself pinned to the floor by two, no, three sets hands. Looking up he could see the three Noels that were now staring back but a quick glance at the floor told him at least two others standing in his apartment as well as the one at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Noels flanked the now pinned tenant. He scanned their faces: a mix of annoyance and curiosity, flinching at the thought of what they might do to him. The silence soon broken by Noel's voice, \"Sir? Sir! Calm down. I know this may be strange but I need your help. I don't know how I got here and judging by your face, you don't either. If we all just sit down and catch out bearings, neither of us will have to worry.\" Noel calmly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Noel did his best, the situation was far too surreal for the man to calm down but he knew that his current situation didn't give him many options. \"O-O-OK, then let's head back to living room then and uh... talk, I guess?\" The man said, his voice still quivering from the adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the Noels slowly released the man and helped him up. The man watched closely the Noels as he made his way past each one slowly until he found the couch where he plopped down, clasping his hands together as he tried to calm down. The Noels positioned themselves sporadically throughout the room: a couple just standing, one near the kitchen, one sitting in a chair opposite the sofa while two sat on either side of the man with him. \"So, we are Noel and who are you where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flinched as Noel spoke, \"Um, well, my name is Martin Sloan and this my apartment in Boston.\" Martin responded nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's November 22nd, 2023.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. \" Noel pondered, before considering Martin's tension, he was not getting any closer to calming down, it seemed. Understanding this Noel got closer to him, \"Martin, do you like beautiful women?\" he asked with a decidedly straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what kind of question is that? I mean of course I do!\" Marin exclaimed taken aback by the strange question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel, however, was not concerned as he and his clones began shift. His now longer hair had begun to be stylized into a pixie cut as his hair turned a pinkish purple. The fabric that had originally covered his torso had begun to tear itself apart before remaking itself. His entire body had become much more slender and toned as two small breasts appeared and were swiftly covered by metallic yet fashionable looking bra set with similar looking metal collar appearing on his neck. The rest had become a long white jacket that went down to his calves, whose clothes had also begun to reshape.  What resembled leather was crawling up his legs right to the middle of his thighs, making nice cuts to show of skin as his heels grew taller and taller. A black thong with a garter belt formed the last of the ensemble. The Noels slender appearance belied their confident posturing. \"Let's wind things down a bit, to ease the mood.\" Noel said as he place his new manicured hand on Martin's thigh. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin took the hint and began to slowly feel him up occasionally pinching himself as if to make sure it was all real. He seemed to have had some experience pleasing a woman, because he knew where to put his hands to keep Noel moaning in euphoric pleasure: touching his soft soft skin just right or going right for the pussy and giving Noel oral sex. Noels clones began to jump in, taking turns with Martin or giving the original massage alongside him. Noel began pondering how nice this place was, conflict seemed less prevalent and companionship and information was in ready supply he could get used to this, he just does not have to draw attention to himself.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You (the reader) are the last of an artificially created race of psychics who can manipulate space-time on your own.  Being a fusion of plant and animal cells you have spent most of your existence fighting on the side of humanity in a war that they are losing, badly.  You created a signularity in a last ditch effort to rid the galaxy of the scourge known as the Mujaheed.  This selfless act required you to lure out the enemy fleet and your ship took massive damage during the battle, causing you to miscalculate the jump.  Your ship was on a collision course with the planet so Nu, the ship's A.I., inserted your mind into the nearest suitable candidate planetside.  But this is not the Earth you once knew.  This is an Earth that is not only in a different time, but probably a different dimension...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules:</b><br>\r\n1. No one line chapters, if you are going to contribute then CONTRIBUTE.<br>\r\n2. Use proper grammar and spelling, I understand the occasional slip up because I myself succumb to it as well, but if it hurts my eyes to read it then I will delete it.  It is not that hard to at least use spellcheck.<br>\r\n3. You may kill whomever you want, just know that Noel will not die.  His essence will be inserted into the nearest suitable candidate.  That s not to say that he won't have severe mental trauma/scarring.<br>\r\n4. The setting is similar to Rifts in that there will be Juicers, Combat Cyborgs, Mind Melters, Crazies, powerarmor, giant robots, and so forth.  However, this is planet that has not yet been torn apart by the leyline eruption.  So really this is a pre-Rifts setting that has psychics.  Magic has not yet been introduced and you can have the leylines erupt if you want.  Remember that this is a HUGE, CATASTROPHIC event that kills 95-99% of all humanitiy.<br>\r\n5. TG, Possession, GTS, FMG, and so on is acceptable and encouraged.  However this story is to focus on plot.  I'd like to see detail into how/why it happened as well as refrain from *Suddenly you are 500FT tall and killing everything!!*<br>\r\n6. Sexual content, same as above.  Acceptable but don't have it dominate the whole story.<br>\r\n7. Have fun</td>",
