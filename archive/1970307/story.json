            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had always liked humans. Your earliest memories are all of humans; humans looking at you through the strange invisible barrier sepersting you and them, looks of amazement of their faces; humans feeding you; a lone human arriving much earlier than the groups of humans to simply watch you, a small smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why humans enjoyed looking at you so much, but you tried to satiate their curiosity, running round your small dwelling, two powerful legs quickly carrying you in a circuit of your habitat. You didn't know it when you were young, but you were different from the other kangaroos, you could walk instead of bound, and as you began to mature, two bumps began to appear on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grew older, more and more humans came to watch you. You liked the attention, it was nice to have so many humans... admiring you? Over time, you had been able to learn a few words of the language the humans spoke, and one day, you heard two of the humans that fed you and the other animals talking to one another. Most of what they said was unintelligible, but you heard four words that would stay with you forever - literally forever, as you had stopped aging when you had become an adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kangaroos never stop growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, something awakened within you. At the time, you were just taller than most of the humans that came to see you... But to know that you would continue to grow, and grow, and grow? It felt amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that day, your growth rate increased dramatically, as if simply hearing those four words had kicked your body into overdrive. The day after you had heard those words, you had felt an urge to be close to the humans as they watched and adored you. Moving  as close to them as you could without touching the invisible barrier, you felt a tingly feeling race down your spine, and shuddered as you watched your body slowly grow, the humans fearfully shrinking back as they shrunk in comparison to you. The bumps on your chest, long since having grown into small globes, surged forth, increasing in mass as your growing hands were unable to cover them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, you had grown an entire foot taller, now looking far down at almost any human you saw. Now, the humans who watched you exhibited a far wider range of emotions; some were terrified of you and ready to run at the first sign of hostility; some were interested in your rapidly increasing height; and then, there were the rather odd ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese odd humans were completely enraptured by you, a small group arriving at certain times of each day to stare adoringly at you, wishing you would grow larger, stronger, and more powerful. As the days when you had been human sized became fading memories, this group swelled along with your body, one leader talking to them as the others chanted, whipping them into adoration with words you couldn't quite understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty quickly, you had reached the point where you were almost twice the size of the a drags human you saw. You knew you weren't going to stop growing, though - \"Kangaroos never stop growing.\" One dark night, several of the strange humans had managed to sneak into your habitat, dutifully and patiently waiting for you to wake. Awaking much earlier than usual, you had found the humans in your habitat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they wanted to play with you, rubbing themselves up against your massive body. You had returned the favour, easily grabbing them all in a massive, grateful hug, even as a hot, pulsing sensation ripped through your body as they adored and loved on you. Quickly swelling, your hide audibly groaning as it grew, you had hugged the humans to the soft globes on your chest, another series of growy pulses roaring through you as they pushed themselves into your breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one particular human in that group; one who was adorable, devoted, and utterly entranced by you. Even as your growth stopped, you now being so huge as to fill up most of your habitat, he had whispered a single word from where he lay on your body; one that would have even more of an affect on your growth than the time you had realised you were never you g to stop growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had called you a goddess. Keeping him warm as he peacefully slept, you realised that the odd humans weren't just watching you; they were worshipping you. The cult gained more and more members, you having been moved to a new habitat after your growth had destroyed your old one. But something bothered you. Weren't goddesses meant to do things? Not just sit around and outgrow everything in sight? Already, you were just cresting a hundred feet tall, growing several feet larger every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday, you had began to store your power for a titanic growth spurt, one that would surely more than guard hole your hundred foot size. You would grow during your sleep, bursting out of your habitat, and you would earn your title of goddess by playing with as many humans as you could find; their adoration combined would surely grant you some measure of power over the world, and you would be able to do whatever goddessly duties awaited you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was just one problem. You weren't really sure how humans played. The cultists had played with you, but you had seen smaller humans playing in a much more rough manner, chasing and hitting each other. What if you tried to play with them in the wrong way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you had decided on how to play with the humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would be...</span></div></div>",

Tonight, you were going to let loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night guard, having himself joined in the cultists' night games, made sure to leave your enclosure locked while on camera; he smiled and bid you goodnight, adding a wink as he leaves. The wink was still an odd gesture, though you now knew it meant he'd be back with your little friends, after he had turned off the cameras around your gigantic habitat. It was almost time! Your great, furred breasts groan and swell by teeny degrees as you played with them, flicking your ears in anticipatory delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your friends arrived, you would get right down to blowing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body nearly boomed as you heard the door to your enclosure open quietly, your entire body rendered electric, charged. Primed with unbridled want, you motioned them all in, smiling tenderly, as they all chanted away their usual stuff and began to clamber up and all around your form, snuggling in and stroking everywhere they possibly could. Many encircled your breasts, cuddling into the massive, plush globes, collectively sighing and nuzzling in as they expanded with your every soft breath. So many little hands, moving independently...so much adoration!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coaxed the little humans to quiet, and nestled down to sleep, warm and blanketed by a veneer of human wrappings. They expected you'll grow, surely, but deep down, you and you alone knew just how much of a ride they'd all be in for, as you lidded your giant eyes and sighed lowly, then closed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow would be a new day, indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, tonight had its own share of activity: as you slept, your hips began to bulge wider, your toes splaying and rubbing in and out against half a dozen very-happy humans, the balls of your humanoid feet spreading like silk across their tiny bodies as both digits began to grow and grow, pushing out and up to larger proportions against them, in so doing spreading them farther and farther apart. Those snoozing along the span of your belly half-awoke to find the sheer plane of your stomach stretching out before them, as well as behind; those on the 'before' view-point saw soft mountains growing to match the horizon of said belly plain, as your overloaded breasts billowed up, up and up, until they started to smish and press into the enclosure's high ceiling, dimpling flat at the tips, the firming nipples bulging and pressing out against the cracking glass. Its coolness made you coo in your sleep, shivers running up and down, crisscrossing recklessly through your growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n120 feet surged and spread to 130, your body pouring out over the enclosure's faux-habitat setup, hips bowling over frees and fake grass patches, your feet pushing insistently against the groaning walls, your plumped roo-rump damming the artificial waterfall over in the back corner. 150 feet...160 feet...170 feet...Your backside raced up along the opposing wall, your furred shoulders rolling sensuously as your breasts heaved out a relative size bigger; your tongue poked out from your muzzle as your face screwed up slightly in pleasure, the growth coming faster now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n200 feet...230 feet...260 feet! It was getting harder to control, but you found the realization thrilling! 400 feet trembled fitfully, blowing up to 500...600...Even in the sleep-addled recesses of your mind, pleasure-centers came under full assault, from every trembling inch of your swelling form; your knees bumped the ceiling, as your head and neck had already started crooking to the side, your breasts forming the most cracks as you finally filled the enclosure--all 800 feet of it! Your keepers must have known it wouldn't be enough, eventually--still, you figured they would be surprised just how fast you'd outgrown the thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the sound of an explosive rush, as your feet and arms and head flew out to their full extensions once again, shattered bits of glass glittering harmlessly over your fur and across the area. The humans already must have taken to fleeing, but you hardly minded. You knew full-well that they'd come running back when they saw your 860-foot self thudding along the city streets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered in glee, like a child on christmas morning--at last, it was playtime!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything felt reversed. Even while you were getting twice their size, the humans were still the ones on the outside. Now...now, it felt like you were observing them in their habitat--and you loved what you saw! You waved down at the sea of diverging reactions, smiling at the ones who were cheering for you, as you thundered along heavily, and grinning in the hopes of mollifying those who were frozen in shock and/or terror. This was it, time to try out the bits of speech you've picked up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, little humans!\" You forced the words out, only mucking up a little bit of your tone. \"I...erm...am...goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, the reactions relative to both sides of the spectrum increased drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour footfall stopped just shy of downtown, as you gently let your knees lower towards the streets, which you more than filled, your rear towering up in a gorgeous show-and-tell of exposed anus and sex to the onlookers far below. Nearly one-and-a-half city blocks of feminine kangaroo had knelt down close to humanity, half of which shrank away nervously as your shadow fell over them. Over the edge of two titanic breasts came that same loving grin, as you bat your eyes, and offer a massive, sleek finger to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Play...now?\" you asked, quivering with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the little ones--well, particularly little--stepped out from the sea of people: a little boy. You adored human children! They seemed the most prone to playing, rough or no. Your huge ears flickered happily as you beamed back at the boy, and opened your palm gently for him to climb onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...hand? Get on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nearly flipped in excitement, and clambered a bit clumsily onto your massive palm. Suddenly, others followed, as they seemed to process that you were not here to render harm, nor apocalyptic judgement, or the like. Your eyes widened in total, unfettered joy, as more and more climbed up, and began using your fingers for slides, whooping and cheering. You perked your ears as you felt dozens of others scaling your gigantic, soft feet, playing on the toes, climbing and sliding down the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, you were in heaven. You leaned back against a massive skyscraper, letting littles take palm-rides up to your head, where they formed a line, and took turns leaping from your monstrously huge muzzle, landing snugly and gently in your overgrown, booming, supply cleavage. It tickled so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your revelry at its zenith, you sigh and begin to feel the most deliciously warm, prolonged tingle racing around inside of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
