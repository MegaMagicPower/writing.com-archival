Teeth bared and glaring daggers she exuded pure rage as she floated over to the downed bug-type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-?\" As Mew hovered over Scyther the aura surrounding her intensified and became almost solid. The energy surrounding her focused itself around her paw \"don't kill her!\" Mew turns and looks at you, shocked \"m-mew?\"  \"Don't hurt her. She can't control herself right now.\" Hesitantly she lowered her hands and floated away from the still-reeling Scyther. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sc-yther?\" The bug type slowly got to its feet buzzing its wings agitatedly. \"Scy!\" She looked rather irritated that her mating had been interrupted.

Mew!\" She took a defensive posture in front of you. Scyther charged forward only to be yanked into the air and put to sleep with hypnosis.

She pressed her forehead to yours and you could feel what she did, and she felt sadness. An intense regret for allowing that to happen to you. Forgive her?</span></div></div>",

You are lost in the woods, you have no food, it's Pok\u00e9mon mating season, and your pants have been shredded.

I thought nothing of it at first because she had just been in a fight so it would make sense that she was out of breath.  However after about three minutes, her breathing so I turned to look at her and asked, \"Mew? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mew,\" she chirped out weakly.  This and the fact that she wouldn't look at me when she answered told me that she was lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure I mean you are breathing rather... heavily?\" I pressed but I noticed that Scyther was looking at me and breathing much in the same fashion.  That's when it hit me: Mew was being affected by the mating season!  \"Are you being aroused by me?\" I inquired of Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Mew's eyes widened immediately and she turned around trilling, \"Mew mew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around Mew,\" I ordered her.  Mew turned around slowly and one look at her face confirmed my suspicions.  Mew was blushing and looking at the ground ashamedly with tears in her eyes.  I softly lay Scyther on the ground so as to not hurt her and cupped Mew's chin to make her look me in the eyes.  \"You shouldn't be ashamed of something you can't control.  It's not your fault it's mating season.  You are very powerful Mew but nobody as far as I know can control time.  So stop being so sad,\" I consoled her.  Mew seemed to digest what I said before blinking away her tears, smiling and nodding.  I smiled back at her and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's and my hugging session was cut short when we heard Scyther moan, \"S-scyt-ther.\"  I turned to look at her and saw her holding her arms between her legs and a look of pain on her face.  Immediately I crouched down to see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scyther what's wrong?\" I asked forgetting that she couldn't answer.  Scyther looked at me and moved her arms to the side so I could see her slit.  It was gushing with her juices and throbbing.  I looked up at Scyther's face and saw looks of pain and pleading.  I realized that the only way the pain was going to go away would be if I were to mate with her.  I felt a tapping on my shoulder so I turned around and saw Mew with a pained look on her face and her other paw between her legs.  I took out my Pokedex pulled up the map of the region and saw I was only a sixteenth of a mile from the Poke Center.  This left me with two options.</span></div></div>",

I am what the others call a psychic, a human gifted with power over the sphere of the mind. I can Control..well, no not really, but i can Manipulate....well yes usually anyway, alright let's just say i can influence people and pokemon ok? Ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow my actual number of powerhouse in my team reach the fantastical quota of: 0.<br>\r\nI am not lying, i simple don't have a pokemon yet, it's just that i am thinking over it alright, no, i am talking to myself, it's not alright, sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter explain it, i am unable to control another being action, but i can influence how he/she will consider the matter at hand. For example i can <i>persuade</i> a bully to leave a child alone, <i>reminding</i> him the punishment for such action, making it more susceptible to further manipulation. Or i can influence a Pokemon behavior, make he/she believe that it's not hungry, or it's too risky to attack etc. However, trained pokemon and strong willed human can resist such manipulation, discard my little voice in their subconscious. You wouldn't believe however, on how many Rocket grunts this trick work, being them little more than moronic fools it's not surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow being the beautiful day that it is, i decided to get a stroll down the path, nothing dangerous really, simply a 5 km, rural touristic road, supposedly safe. As always, fate has a strange way of make you understand that Your concept worth shit. How was the famous phrase? Would like to make Arceus laugh? Tell him your plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i am over thinking, a thing that tend to happen often to me, i heard a scream, human one to be sure. My curiosity (damn it all) get the better of me and, being the Grand Master of Stealth that i am, noisily move off the road towards the noise. Crouching behind a big bush, i get my curios head just over it to try to understand what the fu..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shush</b>   <b>Shush</b> Something is there moving! What's that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my breath and a few moment later, a rare and powerful specimen of.....Bui! Bui! Da fac \"<b>IT'S THERE, GET HER!</b>\" Perhaps not.<br>\r\nNot a moment later, a rocket grunt appear from behind the trees, launching himself in a evident desperate attempt to catch the power..err, the pokemon. Now since when they are so desperate for a common Buizel? Something fishy here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scared, Buizel hide herself? just at the base of a tree not far from my position, however my attention get caught by a strange presence, something strong is near, a powerful psychic pokemon. Maybe it's that what they are after. So the Buizel it's just sport? Hunting her for sport! My anger cloud my vision, and i not rationalize that probably my assumption was incorrect, but i have stopped thinking rationally by now, it's time: Ass Whooping Mode, Activated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes and start focusing on the most moronic, empty headed fool that i can perceive, and sure enough 3 idiot appear on my whooper radar. It's Show Time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing again i start filling their empty buckets with doubts, doubts about their talents, doubts about their hunt, and of course doubts about their mothers as well. What? Work most of the time. Sure enough, i sense their empty head filled with doubts and idiocy, no i didn't add the idiocy, they have plenty already, and <i>persuade</i> them that this part of the forest it's not safe, that monster of tremendous strength hunt in this area, and that they will surely get themselves killed or worse, maimed trying if they pursue their attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, i may have forgotten to <i>told</i> them, that the biggest pokemon around is probably a strained Pachirisu, but they don't need to know all the details. After all, have you ever try to pet one? They are quite the nasty critter, shock anything they don't like, witch include nearly everything that moves, or don't. Ugh, don't remind me, little overcharged bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, after a very trough confabulation between themselves, they decide to run away, before the tremendous Pachirisus predator got them, they are carnivore after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly release my focus, and open my eyes. As always a slight throbbing headache tell me that i need more endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as i get up the Buizel appear before me, she look at me with a knowing smile, than she transform. A blinding light obscure my vision, second later it's done, and the powerful Mew stood before me. That's my powerful pokemon, at least my instinct was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitate and come closer to me, than at arm leght she stop and start talking telepathically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi Rukon! Thanks by the way, they where sooooo persistent</i>\" Her voice is sweet, melodic and playful, just as i have always expected to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am....therefore i, no wrong film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mew, it's a...pleasure to meet you ahh yeah that one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a light, playful chuckle coming from her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No need to be embarrassed, Rukon, i am thankful for the help!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubts, no! Idea! Why? \"Eh..forgive me Mew, but why didn't do it yourself'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother light chuckle \"<i>Isn't it obvious Rukon? I couldn't. They had a device on them that can block pokemon metal waves, they would have just traced me, i know i have try it </i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as i wanted to formulate more question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh i really must go, don't worry Rukon, i will see you soon, there is a matter to discuss</i>\" And with this she wink her eye, then vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having decided that remain here would be useless, and also pretty stupid, (Pachirisu are always in alert, damn rodent) i leave towards the road and my original destination. Peaceful day, my ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't yet know, but that was the last normal day i would ever get.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to find myself surrounded by Bulbasaur or Bayleef, just because it's has nothing better do do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my peaceful (yeah, sure), touristic morning, i decided that home would have been a good place to relax for a while. How wrong i was. Knowing what happened later, would have i done the same thing? Yes, i would have, so i am either a fool, or just smitten. No don't say both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the door of my unremarkable home just at the city limits, always liked the idea of having Pokemon around. When i decided that was time for me to live alone, i told my parents that they shouldn't have to worry about anything, nothing bad was gonna happen to me just because my backyard was so close to the forest edge. I was so serious when i have said that, man you should have heard me. Now i am still sure of my choice. I told you i was a little crazy no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started making the dishes, my laziness prevented me from doing it earlier, and i wasn't in the mood anyway. As often happen to me i was over thinking, even if this time, it's justified. I mean, i have just met one of the most famous legendary in existence, Mew, so you will excuse me i am a little absent minded at the moment. She told me that she has a matter to discuss with me. What could it be? An unremarkable trainer, with no pokemon, and limited psychic abilities need to help one of the greatest pokemon ever in a matter of critical importance? Well, at least i hope it's important, i hope she don't just want me to mow the lawn at her home or something, I know for sure that some trainer will give anything just for doing that. Some crazy trainer, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy line of thought got interrupted by a strong noise, an explosion in the distance. If i remember correctly there is a meteorological research station not far from here. The hell happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the dishes i get out of my home, and looking at the direction of the station. As expected a thick, black smoke it's raising from there, did someone dislike the forecast for tomorrow? I know that there was supposed to be the Pachirisu cuteness contest but damn. Their trainers are nuts, just like their damn Pachirisu, useless rodent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i am tempted to go to see whats happened, and maybe enjoy the look of some Pachirisu getting is ass handed to him, i decide to let the authorities sort this out, they are paid for this after all, why should trainers always solve their problem? Especially a pokeless one. Lazy tramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI return inside, and forget about the dishes completely, instead i turn on the TV and watch the news. Maybe they know something already about the accident. As i was about to seat, a presence, just like before let himself, herself? knew to me. Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI throw the remote on the couch and ran out in my backyard. Sure enough, as soon as i got there, in a flash the legendary appear before me, but something else is with her. It's has a humanoid shape, with purple and light gray skin. Wait, i recognize it! On Pokemon weakly (i know their name are lazy as their articles), the more powerful pokemon section. Mewtwo! Oh shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have the time to scare myself out that Mew talk to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rukon, i need you help!</i>\" I am stunned for a moment, but then i am not gonna pass for the campus fool and stay there frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" I get to her, so close i can smell her. I can recognize the smell of lilacs and colbur berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI help her bringing Mewtwo inside, it's seems unconscious for the moment. Still i am weary of it's presence, i know that a powerful pokemon like this one doesn't really lose consciousness, they just ignore their surroundings for a while. Maybe is in shock? I feel it trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to lift it up, but damn it's heavy, before i can make a fool of myself, Mew help me lowering it's weight using her powers. With her help i easily lift Mewtwo bridal style, and bring it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI deposit it on the couch, then turn to speak to Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The research station, it was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation she answer \"<i>Yes, but it wasn't a research station, it's was a Team Rocket facility, they where trying to replicate Mewtwo, and for what you can see, they succeeded.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWha! What?! Really! Oh man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They was doing what?! Sick bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes they are definitely sick, but to the matter at hand.</i>\" She then levitate near me and get over the Mewtwo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have saved her just in time, they was trying to implant her with something. A device capable of manipulating pokemon perception, i believe that they intended to use it for controlling her.\"</i> Her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes, Her. I can speculate that they thought it would be easier to control a female, knowing that their original, a male was far too aggressive.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, i mean no disrespect, but won't Team Rockets start searching for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light giggle <i>\"Don't worry, i have not exposed you to a direct risk, i uhh, \"convinced them\" that their subject was killed during the assault, they will know the truth but it will take time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod to her \"So you want me to hide her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile \"<i>Correct, for a brief period of time, until i can bring her to the council. I trust you Rukon, i know you are a good person, don't underestimate yourself</i>\" I have the trust of Mew?! But i did nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggle yet again \"<i>You helped me where others would have ignored or even taken advantage of my predicament earlier, beside i was observing you for while</i>\" Observing me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Of course, you are..</i>\" Mew stop, she turns and she seems trying to listen to a distant voice. Her fluffy tail delicately strike me on the nose, and i can smell her again. She is so..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn around to face again, and ignoring what just happened she say \"<i>I must go, keep her safe, don't worry just let her rest, i will explain everything to you as soon a possible</i>\" Don't even have the time to say bye, that she vanish once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk my day is gradually improving, first Team Rocket and Mew, now Mewtwo is taking a nap on my couch, then what? What have you in store for me fate, do you have a bone to pick with me or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, i take my leave from the couch and let Mewtwo sleep, she look like she need it badly anyway, and return to making dishes. I will never complain about boring day from now on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dishes how i hate you so. Would be possible to make auto-washable dishes? Maybe, i would buy them for sure. A dishwasher? Well, perhaps but they don't convince me much, last time i got to go to the <u>exhibition of technology</u>, new pokeball was presented, and among the other things a new device capable of storing 10 pokemon inside, without the need of balls. Impressive no? Then i got to the section dedicated to improving home living and i saw a dishwasher in action, i still have nightmare of it sometimes. How in the hell the water jets was able to strip and then throw the demonstrator <u>trough</u> the wall, maybe having taken a Milotic as a base design was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously it's utterly ridiculous, we can store and compress living matter and then restore it fully, we can transport limited quantity of mass at enormous distance without problem, but we can't make a functional dishwater?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless patience and discipline, the basic of most psychic discipline, easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly i feel a pressure at the base of my skull, it's not painful it's just like something it's try to drill straight trough it. Without even thinking i put up a mental barrier, a conditioned reflex when a psychic is involved. I have never felt a power such as this, it's wild, savage, simply try to resisting it drain me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the psychic field increase in strength, then suddenly it stop, i recognize the source or at least the origin of it, the sitting room, Mewtwo must have waked up. Shit Mew! Where are you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little scared i focus my will on remaining calm, i succeed, and now i can walk without stumble in my own legs. I cautiously move thought the kitchen and into the sitting room, where i found Mewtwo seemingly asleep. I know that it's just an appearance, and as expected she open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't describe what i feel,  terror, sadness, anger, all this emotion pass trough me like a river, i don't know if i can resist much longer. A few moment later the flow of emotions suddenly stop, and i found my hands gripping my still throbbing head, opening my eyes i see Mewtwo watching me intently. A strong prodding enter my mind and i lose my balance, only to find a strong but delicate kinetic field holding me afloat; Mewtwo has decided to study me, to know me. Being a person that liked pokemon, and never even thought of abusing them, i don't think that she will kill me painfully, at least. I remain afloat with this presence in my head, shifting, prodding at memory and emotion with complete disregard of privacy or care as i am disoriented and my sensory feedback it's all screwed, i close my eyes and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment later i fell the prodding lessening, and my sensory feedback returning to normal, just like a child that has looked to your private drawer and, saddened to have invaded your privacy put everything back in order. Truthfully i don't feel any regret coming from her, but at least my mind will remain intact from the ordeal, it's already something i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reopen my eyes and see that Mewtwo is looking at me intently again, her presence haven't left my mind, but it's not invasive anymore, she is very careful to do not mess up anything now; after a few more moments i feel something else, sensation and feeling that are alien to me, i think thats she is making a feedback system between our minds, why? Now i feel her thought pattern as well, she has no intention to kill me, she just wanted to know; know if i was the person she need to bind to. Bind? Where i have already heard of it, it think it's in the legend of the trainers of old, and how they where training their pokemon but i don't remember much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a strong, powerful, feminine voice let herself know in my head \"<i>You are acceptable, we will be create the bond, we will be as one</i>\" .....O...one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having spoked to me, she levitate me near the biggest couch, extend it, probably with telekinesis, and throw me on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off!\" I land ungraciously but unharmed and i try to get up, only to find my body restrained, she is pushing me down. \"What are doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering she pull down my pants and underwear in one swift motion, then she stare intently at my penis. She stop levitating and touch the ground, the she grip my organ with one of her three fingered hand and start stroking. I am more than a little bewildered looking at this, but i can't speak, and i am pinned. I start seeing erotic image in my head, memory i think, all of them flowing together from her. She has copied my memory? My porn! Oh, shit there are some.....image about pokemon there. Oh Shit she is trying to,,,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly found the she isn't trying anything, she is succeeding. My proud spire, all of my 7 inch and 1/2, stay at attention, and after staring at it for a more mere moment, she start levitating again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We will now bind, as it must be</i>\" She levitate herself and my eyes fall on her hips, there, i saw, Mewtwo, or at least this Mewtwo, is definitely female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not embarrassed to admit that i have always liked pokemon, and while i had the opportunities of some of my friends pokemon offering, some even blatantly presenting, i have always refused, i have wanted to keep myself, while not virgin, unspoiled; i didn't wanna wake up one day after a good, through screw to find out that i consider all female pokemon population nothing more then tools for sexual pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitate over me and place the lips of her pussy just over my tip, then without much ado, lower herself fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaa!\" Pleasure, pure and unrestrained. I have bottomed inside her even if there are still space, her wall hug my cock like no tomorrow, massaging, an inviting me to stay. She clench, Hard, nearly to the point of pain, a satisfied expression on her face. I feel the bond between us strengthening by the moment, while she rise and drop herself again. I can't do much but watch as she as noncons...no that would be a lie, i admit that i like her feminine form, her shape, and psychic type was always my oblivious favorite, so sexing up this pokemon it's like a dream come true, even if i have imagined things go a little differently, like a dinner or something. She doesn't stop, and slowly increase her pace, the voice in my mind speak once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We are bonding.....Rukon, not much longer now</i>\" I try to speak to her mind, even if the pleasure is eroding my focus pretty quickly; <br>\r\n\"<i>Mew..aha! Mewtwo, why me..?</i>\" She look at me with a condescending expression, like the answer was obvious and she ask why i didn't got it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to speak to her \"<i>It's Mew? She aha! She asked you to...</i>\" I got interrupted, i start feel some of her pleasure as well <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mew has nothing to do with this, you are my bound, the one i Must bind with, i know, and you know it too...</i>\" She has right i feel it, her emotion start to flow trough me, there is not love, nor real affection, but there is a strong, nearly unnatural attachment towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer peace increase even more and her wall start to tighten, massaging my tool with even more determination, she want me to cum inside her, she want, no Need, to feel me coming inside her, the bond is established this way. How i know this? She must be starting to share her knowledge as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe increase her pace even more and i hear in her physical voice a moan, strong and sensual, not long now. She stop levitating and place her hand on my chest, then she start bouncing madly while she stare directly in my eyes. I look at our connection, how her pussy is swallowing up my cock and our mixed fluid drop down on my hips. I can't resist anymore, she is smiling, she know what i am thinking, and i know that when i will came the bind will be unbreakable, for life. I found my hands capable of movement, the retraining no longer in place. I grip her by the hips and start pounding her like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head look at the roof while i mercifully, finally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaaaaaa!\" I scream! Fire! In my veins, in my head, it's like both my blood and my cum are on fire! I see her opening her mouth, her eyes wide, a drip o saliva slides down her chin. Her pussy milk me of my seed, it's like she want to drain me of it, and i oblige, interminable moment pass, an eternity frozen in a few moments, then nothing. I am empty and i slowly relax; Mewtwo relax as well, she look at me again, not with coldness like before, but with elation, satisfaction. The bond is made.</span></div></div>",

Why bounding then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with the same condescending expression as before \"<i>Because it was necessary, it will get us stronger, we must be bound</i>\"<br>\r\nI was getting annoyed of this, and she being bound to me notice \"<i>I wanted to bind with you, but it was also necessary, i am not using...</i>\" I interrupt her with my mind voice this time \"<i>Don't lie to me, i feel your thoughts as well, you wanted power, and Mew told you that this would have strengthen you</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems genuinely surprised by my answer, i feel that she didn't expect that i could read her mental pattern, before she could answer i continue \"<i>I also feel that there are more, but you are reluctant to tell me, why? Did you believe that i am just a tool for you to use?</i>\" I am angry right now, and i feel dejected, sad, i don't need to understand the bindings for knowing that everything happened too fast and definitely too soon, i wasn't lying before, i really like her form, her shape, i am not sure why, while i admit that her power entice me, it's not the reason of my emotion towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo look scared for a moment, she know what i think about all of this, she can hear my thoughts just as i can hear hers. I feel that she has never wanted to harm me, nor make me feel sad, but i can clearly see the seed of doubt creep inside her complex mind. She levitate herself off me, extracting me from inside her in the process, How was i able to keep my focus with her wall still intent on lightly squeeze my cock i will never know, still i look resolute as she turn back and stare at the wall, i fell that she don't want to meet my gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait for an answer, i think that she is trying to rationalize everything, but i believe i will be able to tip the balance in my favor, forcing her to confront her emotion, emotion that i know we now both share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mewtwo, look at me</i>\" she is ignoring me, Anger rise within me, i sense my throat release a growl, but i can't feel it, it's like my body has gone numb \"<i>Mewtwo! Look-At-Me!</i>\" i transfer my anger towards her, and she turn abruptly, i see fear and i felt the same emotion coming from her \"<i>It's all so confusing, maddening, but i Know and i believe You know it too, there is more than power or revenge at stake, i have feelings for you and i am sure that you have them as well, admit it</i>\" her fear diminish but it's still present \"<i>Admit it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear leave her, relief take it' s place, she answer me \"<i>I do</i>\" the unexpectedly with her physical voice \"I rly o\" I fell my anger flowing away, like a cold river has come to douse it's flame. I invite her in, she levitate towards me, and lay next to me, i embrace her and she do the same, new emotion flow from her mind to mine, i can distinguish gratitude and maybe affection, real affection. We will see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we lay down, she look me in the eyes, then gently close hers, she is not asleep, but accept that sometimes, even only trying to do a thing, worth it's effort, despise it's result. I fell her mind calm to a more sedated state, and with this image, i let my tiredness claim me, and finally fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleep is universally considered a lack of consciousness where or when the mind rest, restoring both your physical and mental attributes. Normally i would consider such claim, while incomplete, mostly accurate, however this time doesn't seems to be the case. While i think that i am lacking consciousness at the moment, my perception of the environment around me it's quite clear, it's like a am sleeping but i am not asleep. It doesn't make any sense, but it's true, like reality mostly. Human are quite the complex species, but most of the time, we do something so ridiculous and/or stupid, plain wrong, or simply pointless that the very concept of sharing time with just a member of the species, leave me with a bitter taste and a slimy feeling. Maybe my cynical part has taken the upper hand of my basic reasoning, or maybe i am just so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a disturbance, something that shouldn't be there, here in my home, it's an energy that i recognize. Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes, as the waking world make itself apparent in my vision, i notice a white flash not far from my chosen lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello Rukon! i have wanted to oh!</i>\" Awkward time. Mew has a sheepish grin on her small face, she seems more entertained that sincerely surprised.<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry, i didn't know....well</i>\" Surprising her, i reply mentally \"<i>Like i am gonna believe that, Mewtwo and i had...a constructive conversation about you, binding, and a good dose of mating could do</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew look genuinely embarrassed for a few moment, then \"<i>Alright i admit, i have hoped that you two would have...talked <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">hehehe</font></i>\" \"I heard you Mew\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Ops...</i>\" Mewtwo awaken looking quite content, despite the disturbance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo: \"<i>Mew, what a surprise, a visit just few minutes after the binding is complete, how unexpected</i>\" Sarcasm drip from every word<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>I just wanted to leave you two alone, and i had an emergency call, so...everything ok right?</i>\" Mewtwo: \"<i>Peachy</i>\" Peachy? Where she, ha, right, we share thought pattern now, funny, i think that we should make Mew sympathetic of our condition<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo face me, then nod, Mew got a strange expression, confused then  Mew :\"<i>What are you two eh? No! nononononononononon! Aaaaaaahh! Did she really..no! Ahaaaa! Not that ah! ah! aaaaaaaaah!</i>\" Mew collapse to the ground, slightly twitching \"We haven't broke her i hope\" I then notice a small dribble of clear fluid exit from her lower part. Oooooh strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew recover a few seconds later, levitating wobbly Mew: \"<i>Did...did you to rea....really had ...to..to...do..that?</i>\" Both me and Mewtwo face her \"<i>Yes</i>\"<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it Mew?\" Mew look at me with a mix between a funny and a pissed look than Mew: \"<i>Funny, really i appreciate it</i>\" While she tell us so, i notice that she is still leaking, my inner child leap with joy. \"Oh, come on Mew, after all this time, this should have been noting for you\" Mew look at me strangely, then she understand Mew:\"<i>Hey! I don't lay with the first male that i happen to find, i have very hight standard</i>\" She look annoyed now, but i can tell that she is enjoying our teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hight that you nearly never get laid?\" Mew look at me just like she would look to her own ghost \"<i>What?! How dare you!</i>\" Mewtwo: \"<i>We both know it's true Mew, stop this charade, you ....trapped us, hoping the we would have mated by your return, beside i know that you like Rukon as well</i>\" Now i turn to face Mewtwo and a very creepy smile shown on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>Wha..what...i...don..don't even</i>\" Mewtwo: \"<i>Stop lying Mew, we both know it's true, beside i approve, you are worthy of the binding</i>\" Mew eyes become big as saucer, then Mew: \"<i>No! What are you...i never...</i>\" I decide to intervene \"Look enough ok? Mew what did you have to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>Before bein rudely interrupted\"</i> She refer to our teasing <i>\"I have come to speak about bindings, how they generally work and why</i>\"<br>\r\n\"If you prefer a live show, you just have to ask\" Mew eyes become even bigger than before, then annoyed \"<i>Bah! Like i need Your show, beside i it was nothing special</i>\" she say in a dismissive tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Mewtwo surprise me Mewtwo:\"<i>In that case you wouldn't mind if i stimulate my bound no?</i>\" Now it's my turn to look like i have seen my own ghost<br>\r\n\"Wat?\" Mewtwo smile, again the creepy smile, and she start caressing my penis, while she ask that i stimulate her instead, i agree if nothing more because i feel she want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is genuinely scared now Mew: \"<i>Eh, no really it's not necessary, i know enough....</i>\" I reply \"Evidently not, don't stop mew, tell us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo start gripping my cock and rubbing it up and down while i caress her outer lips Mew: \"<i>Ehm, ok....well...we can start....</i>\" Mewtwo moan as i start spreading her lips apart \"<i>At...ho..no! When the pokeball didn't even exist..</i>\" Mewtwo start stroking faster and i penetrate her with two fingers, i feel her getting quite excited<br>\r\n\"<i>at that time...eh..time..a stron no! A few human had....wanted to...feel no!</i>\" Mewtwo bring her head down and start to suck on my tip, while i aggressively pump my three fingers inside her incredibly tight pussy, witch is leaking abundantly by now \"<i>Handler, thats h...how...t..trainer..was called at he time, they...handled me no! Handled pokemon and problem like mine no!</i>\" Metwo bob her head up and down while i decided that i have enough and ask Mewtwo if she wanted to...no need she feel my desire, and i feel hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>Ok enought i wanted to...apo...eeeek! What are you....!</i>\" Mewtwo put herself on the edge of the bed, and, on her stomach, raise her tail swishing it back and forth, giving me and Mew a full view of her Very aroused sex, i don't make her wait, and reaching behind her i place my cock at her entrance and sunk in. The effect is immediate, both me and Mewtwo moan loudly, me at her incredibly tight sex, and her at being spread again, we both love the feeling, i can feel it. We immediately start mating with gusto while Mew is watching us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to raise Mewtwo hips and she oblige me, bringing herself on all four, and i start pounding her with renewed vigor, i feel that she like the new sensation that this position brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i can't see it i can feel it, Mew is scared, but not of us, but of herself, what Mewtwo has said before it's true, Mew like me, and she do not trust herself to remain impassible while i mate in front of her very eyes. My thrust are getting desperate, Mewtwo pussy is just too tight, i feel that out shared pattern is accelerating the process. A few good, hard, push later, we both come. I feel my seed leaving me while my bond walls is milking me of everything i have, strangely i fell my body regenerating, while i am getting tired my seed reserve is already replenishing. Madness, this feeling is madness pure and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want More, and so Mewtwo, after having finished, remaining inside, i try to turn her and she oblige me once more, laying on her back, she bring her hind legs on my hips, and i start the whole process again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel that Mew emotion are in turmoil, she is resisting but something inside her broke, indifference, the will to ignore the finest aspect of the world while trying to save it, Mew emotion are returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to ram myself inside Mewtwo while she encourage me, not long after i release yet again, our bindings become stronger. When my flood is finished i am exhausted, i don't think that i will be able to perform for a while. Than Mewtwo, surprise me once more, she kiss me, with passion and i feel real love coming from her, after a moment of hesitation, i kiss her back. Not long after she release me from her embrace and i collase, removing myself from her, at her side. Mew is still here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is embarrassed beyond belief, aroused too, she is red all over, and i see that her leaking problem has increased. Mew: \"<i>I will....return ..later do clean up here....ok?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash she teleport herself away, both me and Mewtwo are satisfied, and we have embarrassed mew. This day is getting better and better.</span></div></div>",

This binding must be beautiful as it's terrible. Also i wonder why it's not common knowledge, after all while not exactly publicly practiced, only 3 trainers over the 14 i know don't have regular, or mostly regular intimate contact with at least 1 member of their team, well usually 1-2, but someone even it's whole team, and i think that at least 2 of them are lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy in-depth thinking is interrupted by a white, nearly noiseless flash, Mew. Finally some answer, and if she will  try to evade my question, i will show her some new moves that i and Mewtwo devised, i think she will found them....interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is shielding her cute little eyes: \"<i>Are you two decent? Can i look?</i>\" You teleport inside my home when i am lying with my love and then, afterward you remember to ask if we are decent? Did i have said love?...! I fell Mewtwo embrace tightening at my misused? word. She is breathing a little faster, and i would have swear to have felt a strong emotion flowing trough our link for a moment, it was overwhelming, soft, frail and....make me fell fuzzy.....i.....hope it's not just the aftermath of our session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing that you haven't already saw, beside...\" i add with a playful tone \"it's nothing that you didn't wanted to see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew remove her hands, uncovering her eyes: \"<i>What..ah!</i> She re-shield her eyes <i>\"I said clean up!</i>\" Ah no, you won't escape so easily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, look\" I feel that beside her hesitation there is some excitement as well \"I have said, look!\" She remove her paw, and look at the scene before her. Mewtwo embraced with me on the sofa bed, a small trail of clear fluid slowly descending on the sheet from her still slightly open sex, contentedness on her feature, while me with an arm behind her head and of course still without pants or underwear, showing my now inactive member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew look at us with evident interest, but she conceal it pretty quickly: \"<i>Can't you at least wear some pants? Please?</i>\" Thats worrying, the first thing that bother her in this little happy scene is the misplacement of my pants? Seems that Mewtwo was right, my guts telling me that i will somehow end up with Two very powerful Psychic pokemon sooner rater that later, but not today, at least i hope, i am still a little confused with this binding thing, i need answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mew, are you ready to explain now? And no, i will not put on anything\" I feel Mewtwo grip tightening for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sigh: \"<i>Fine, so be it</i>\" she levitate near us, maybe to hide our lower parts from her view \"<i>I need you to understand a few things first, so i may have to delve in history for a while, i hope to not bore you</i>\" Why she should? \"No Mew, i am interested in history, especially if it make me understand better the situation i am in now\" She looks pleased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew with a contagious smile : \"<i>Very well then, let's start with the binding process and how it's work, as you may have already....guessed</i>\" looking at Mewtwo still dripping vagina<i> \"The binding get sealed by mating with your mirror pokemon, this procedure is called acknowledgment because it require the consent of any other pokemon you are already binded with, along with yours of course, also the pokemon in question must have some sort of connection to the...person, yes person, after all you don't have to be a trainer for connecting with pokemon, physically or otherwise\"</i> Mirror?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have guessed my question Mew: \"<i>Yes mirror, you see, there must be a certain..affinity between the two for the procedure to work. Usually depend on both the pokemon and the human or half personality</i>\" Half? Half-pokemon?! \"You...mean half-pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with confusion for a moment, then clarity Mew: \"<i>Well, yes it's happened in the past, a lot</i>\"....??!!!!! A lot!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighs again: \"<i>Okay, let's start with the history lesson, do you know when pokeballs where officially invented?</i>\" Well yes \"Yeah, 30? no 35 years ago a certain..Sandovar?\" She nods \"<i>Yes, John Sandovar researcher of bindings and half-pokemon, i suppose that being one of the result of the bind process he wanted to know more</i>\" She look pensive for a few seconds \"<i>I believe that he return to his homeplane when he found his bound, ahhh Love</i>\" She said the last word with longing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, homeplane, half-pokemon, love, sex? Why in tartarus i have said sex!? \"Eh, ok, sort of, so....did this Sandovar discovered anything useful?\" Mew recover her focus, but her smile don't diminish: \"<i>Well of course, he discovered that only affine spirit can bind, and that legendary pokemon can bind with...curious result, maybe it's better if i explain</i>\"</span></div></div>",

As an example, Mewtwo is a psychic type and normally she is vulnerable to Bug, Dark and ghost type move</i>\" I nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>Well from now on her secondary vulnerability has gone and the main one is reduced, let me explain. Her weakness to Bug and Ghost type move are gone, not just that, but Ghost type move now treat her as a Normal type, in simple term completely ineffective</i>\" I look a little bewildered, she continue \"<i>Her weakness to Dark type move is reduced but still present, now instead of approximately double power, her weakness has lowered to....50% i think, while fight type moves are still 50% effective as before</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>She has just lost 1 weakness, gained an immunity and reduced her susceptibility to Dark moves</i>\" Mew look at me with a mischievous smile <i>\"Quite the improvement mmmh?\"</i> But what \"There is a drawback in this?\" Mew: \"<i>Not really no, but....well....ok one. The pokemon binded with you will remain so for the rest of your life, you can't just discard them or free them, well you can free them but they will still follow you anywhere, also the bound make so that emotions are shared between you and them, such as love, sadness and so on. As you may guess, removing them from your....how do you call the whole..ah! Active rooster, yes, removing them from you active rooster is practically impossible, unless you want to be depressed, sad, sexually frustrated and impeded at the same time</i>\" Well, quite the failsafe Mew continue:<i> \"Also there is a limit on how many pokemon you may bind\"</i> A limit? Less than 6 then? \"How many exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew make a negative motion with her cute head, Cute?: \"<i>I don't know, no one does, it depend from the person and his/her pokemon bound</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the other must accept that...\" Mew nod: \"<i>Yes, all the other binded must, i would approximate 2-3 for person tough, in some rare cases 4, but i don't think it's possible to have more, you see, pokemon are very....</i>\" She look at Mewtwo \"<i>Possessive of their bound, to the point of doing anything, and i do mean Anything, for them, the person is closely tied as well, although the human, or half, feel it a lot less, but the emotional bind it's still very strong</i>\" Yes i am feeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's possible to bound a legendary?\" Mew reply with a even bigger smile, how in tartarus she can smile..Mew:\"<i>Why yes, absolutely, but as i have said, legendary have some...peculiarity</i>\" Fine \"So you mentioned an history lesson..\" Mew look distracted, then: \"<i>Oh!

Peace!</i>\" Peace?......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these handler done everything? But how..\" Mew sighs once more: \"<i>Well you see, the human government concealed all information regarding the issue, you must know that many powerful individuals wanted to put and end to the binding process because They could not choose Who can and who can't got such power, after all only 15% of human population can bind with their pokemon, less considering that only some of them become trainer. They wanted to Control the process, who can bind with who, but it's impossible and in their infinite arrogance, they decided that if the process cannot be controlled, it must be destroyed. They failed of course, so...they just make everything on history book disappear, replacing it with lies about pure and innocent human and the trust they putted in their dangerous pokemon, sons of a worthless Arcanine...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk this is big, however i am pretty tired now \"Mew, can we continue this later?\" Mew: \"<i>Of course, you will understand everything in time anyway, for now i would like to ask a favor, can you two check something for me?</i>\" Like? \"What exactly?\" Mew: \"<i>Team Rocket has constructed a strange device, they used it to channel some temporal/spacial anomaly of some sort in an underground bunker not far from here, i can't get in, after my last..endeavor they shielded the place, luckily the automated system couldn't transfer my specific signature to other complex, however if you are not hasty...but you two should be able to get in without much problem, an i will change my signature, just in case</i>\" She can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew: \"<i>I can, but it take time, time we don't have</i>\" Ok \"Alright we depart as soon as able\" Mew nod: \"<i>I will see you soon!</i>\" And vanish once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats it, adventure!

Many question rumble in the back of my mind, and i feel that some of them bother Mewtwo greatly, so i decide to speak to her, it's not that the rucksack is gonna prepare itself, but certain obstacle must be removed if i want that our relationship to proceed unimpeded. Even if myself know little about it, after all, it's not exactly common to find Mew during a quite walk, nor is finding a clone of the second more powerful pokemon i existence in your living room, or mating to her afterward discovering that in doing so you are bonded for life. Also while Mew never told me why she was stalking me, i believe that such reason cleared themselves, of course that mean that Mew has planned this for some time.....I fell trapped, in a life that i don't recognize anymore, and with a burden that i don't know if i want to carry, or at least not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk toward Mewtwo, that at the moment is levitating in from of my TV, she is watching the news<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTV: And now an important announcement.

You literally throw me down on the sofa bed, and started riding me until i seeded you\" Mewtwo look at me strangely: \"<i>You wanted it Rukon, maybe not at the start, but you wanted me, i could feel it, and the precess won't have worked if you didn't wanted to bind with me.</i>\" She levitate close to me, face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo: \"<i>You wanted me just like i wanted you, for different reason at start, but not anymore</i>\" I step backwards, i fell her arousal mounting, until i feel on my ass, damn carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo levitate even nearer, then she put herself on a seated position and opening her legs, she show me her quite aroused sex: \"<i>Our bound do not only share thoughts, and feeling, but also emotion and lust is one of them</i>\" So if i..\"If i am aroused then you are too?\" She nods, then she land on her feet and walk away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo\"<i>I would like to satisfy my, our lust right now, but you are too distracted, and we have an objective to complete</i>\" Sure, change argument<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bounded with me only because i was the tool in which you could have taken your revenge?\" She feel sad, but still answer honestly: \"<i>At the start, yes, but i was foolish, you are much more than that, and i have felt the emotion inside you, you...liked me, and during our mating, when we embarrassed Mew, i felt love, a love that i now share</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSh then walk towards me, and when she is almost on me, she extend her hand, so i grab it and get up. Not even the time to speak that she kiss me, hard, with a passion that i would have never tough could exist. I feel it, she love me now, we where...fated, the binding only accelerated the process. I know now, that i could trust her, and that she could trust me. For life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe release each other, and i return to prepare the food and the other supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith our incomprehension cleared, we exit home and, following Mewtwo sense, we start to track down the disturbance, our journey just begun.</span></div></div>",

Mewtwo seems amused by my antics and she admit that it would be amusing seeing her suited in Jedy robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's good know that i am not alone anymore, and strange to have someone that could understand me fully, it's not that i am alienated or anything...just...different, being a psychic is not considered normal for a human even if it's a recognized ability, so i tend to remain isolated from others, i have never complained about it but now.....the future is unknown, i will deal with it when i am there i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo stop levitating in mid air, then she focus for a few seconds and release a psychic wave that slightly push me back, she remain focused on something, i feel that she is trying to read something, then she open her eyes and , without telling me anything start levitating forward. Curious about her behavior and her unresponsive status, i follow closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo continue for a few hundred meters before suddenly stopping, then she start focus her powers on a few pokemon not far ahead, the victim levitate in front of her, some of them are quite scared but most are strangely calm while she seems to examine them, most get released nearly immediately, others are kept in mid air around her. This strange carousel continue for a good 20 minutes before she let the 4 remaining pokemon on the ground, i notice that while they are not prisoner in mid air anymore, a pink field still surround their forms, i think that Mewtwo is keeping them still. When she seems satisfied, a Bayleef levitate toward me, rear first, with her tail raised and her sex in plain sight, she seems lightly aroused and she look at me with embarrassment, but also with...happiness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Mewtwo and ask her in a curious tone what the fu.. \"Mewtwo, what the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo look at me like the answer was the most oblivious thing in the world: \"<i>I am gathering support, we need more strength and adding member to our bind will do so</i>\" Wat? What!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you implying that i should mate them?\" Mewtwo nod: \"<i>Of course, they are willing to be added in our bound, so i am presenting you the best both in term of power and willingness, this 4 have accepted to try and are strong enough to be worthy companion</i>\" Ok i am freaked out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity make me ask something \"So the others was unwilling?\" She make a negation sign: \"<i>No, most of them was willing, but they are too weak to be worthy, if you are curios of the 54 candidates exterminated only 9 refused, all the others where quite eager to start</i>\" As soon as the word left her, the Bayleef is released gently to the ground, but despite being free, the grass type keep her posture and blatantly present herself, i notice that her sex is start to drip clear, sweet smelling fluid, she is ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the other 3: a Mienshao an Ampharos and surprisingly a Flygon, all female and look quite....interested. The hell a Flygon is doing here btw?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to distract myself from the presenting grass type i ask \"What do you mean by strong enough?\" I know what she means, i think, but our shared pattern doesn't share all, not really<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo: \"<i>Their individual capacity is quite higher then normal, also all of them are very....open, sexually speaking. They will be good companion both in battle and also in bed </i>\" I am astonished of what i am hearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...but..no! Pokemon are not tools! The...they aren't here just to be fucked and used in battle! You are treating them like slaves! No Mewtwo, release them immediately!\" Unexpectedly the 3 pokemon at Mewtwo side start smiling, a wide predatory smile, and while the psychic field release them, they don't move from their position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a little surprised i have thought that she...oh oh. The Flygon is literally flooding right now, a little puddle of crystal clear fluid is descending from her while her tail swish lightly from left to right, i also notice that both the Mienshao and the Ampharos are staring at me like i was a succulent piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bayyyyy bay bay\" The Bayleef is smiling as well, and shake her rump trying to encourage me to take her, she also has enchanted her submissive posture even more , clearly showing me her willingness. At this point i really don't know what to do...\"What if they can't bind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo: \"<i>They are willing to try, if it doesn't work it would be possible to try again later, or they may want to remain with you regardless, even if unbound, perhaps remaining at home or with you, in case you have some urge to....</i>\" Mewtwo! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mewtwo! What the...no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo with a sensual tone: \"<i>I feel you arousal Rukon, you are interested, also they are willing to be with you, even as sluts, a caring interesting male are quite rare in the wild, beside mating with a possible bound will increase their pleasure quite a bit</i>\" she pause, then:  \"<i>Or at least this is what they told me</i>\" Fuck!</span></div></div>",

I am different Rukon, different compared to when Mew rescued me from the cloning chamber i was in, i changed so much in so little time....it's no wonder that they want you Rukon, you are literally a....how do you human say it? A yes, a chick magnet now..</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said this to me with a mocking smile on her face, then with the same tone she add: \"<i>Just don't forget about me, Rukon, because if you do i Will remind you</i>\" Sure, like i could forget, the bind won't allow it, and i don't want either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bayyyyyy! bay bay\" The Bayleef is still in position, ready, a small puddle now under her. Her now very aroused sex is slightly parted, desperate for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just drop this and..\" All 4+1 pokemon scream something at me, i understand clearly only Mewtwo, but i am sure that also the other 4 said the same thing: \"<b>NO!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...fine let's start then....jeeze what a mess....<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni Remove my pants, and i see that the waiting trio are staring at me, like their lives depend on every movement i do, then i remove my underwear releasing my, admittedly, aroused tool. The trio is watching intently, an hungry expression on their face, i can nearly taste their need, the Flygon especially seems tempted to tackle me at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel behind the the quite ready Bayleef, and seeing at how arouses she is, and the constant reminding of Mewtwo to proceed, i will make her pay for that, i place my tool at her entrance, and gripping her side, i push myself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bayyyyy!\" Her walls grip me gently, encouraging me to go deeper, she is different from Mewtwo, her inside are far less tight, but very delicate, soft, they don't force you in, they ask you with a gentleness you can hardly refuse. I bottom at what probably is her inner mouth, and extracting slowly i focus on how soft and slick she is, the smell of her fluid leave me in a trance like state, that soon transform into eagerness, eager to breed the female under me, to give her what she so desperately want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thrust myself all the way in, enjoying her soft, velvets walls accompanied by her cries of pleasure. My motion continue, building itself in a rhythm that slowly speed up. Her walls are gripping me with more fervor now, while i lost control of my pelvis, it's like my body work in autopilot, i can feel and act, but it's unrequired. I continue to thrust inside the now screaming Bayleef, letting my wild side take over \"Bayyy! Bay! BAy! Bay! Bay! Bayyyyyyyyyy!\" Her soft velvet walls crush upon my embedded tool, gently coaxing the seed out of me, her hot lust fueling fluid drench my cock and balls, but i continue, thrusting hard, harder still, letting her ride her own orgasm, until when she nearly finish her frenzied motions, i came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself as far as i could go, i feel her cervix open slightly, then my balls contract and my seed spurt from my tip directly in her inner sanctum, uselessly trying to sire and incompatible womb. Her walls start contacting wildly once more, pleading me to give her everything i can spare, and i feel to have a lot to give, i feels strange, i should not have so much, i have never......my thoughts blank out while i reach the peak of my release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat i think is an eternity later, my mind restart itself, the pleasure still linger and i feel myself still lightly trusting inside the now exhausted and satisfied Bayleef. I don't feel any different, maybe it didn't work this time. I bet that she is more than willing to try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop moving, while her insides still try to make me give her a little more, i remove myself, slowly, savoring her hot slick walls, when finally out, i collapse on my ass, my now smelly and still cum covered dick still ready....da facq! How.....! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef is panting heavily, and keep her ready position, her love box didn't lost any of my donation, it must have all been sealed in her womb, talk about precious. She look at me with gratefulness and i fell that she is still aroused and willing. My feeling get confirmed when she start to shake her rump, inviting me for the second round, offering herself once more. I admit to be tempted, but as i look at the waiting trio, i notice that the Flygon is quickly advancing, she want her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering my second wind, i prepare myself for a rough ride. </span></div></div>",

You know how to use that tongue..\" I feel my tool bathed in her tongue, she is lapping me like a lollipop and spare no trick to reach her objective, it's no surprise that not even a minute later i am ready again...how can i satisfy other two beside her after this? I will definitely need a pause, badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly don't notice the Bayleef coming closer until she is practically on me, she is trying to make the Flygon give her some space so she could join......i am gonna get double teamed now? I hope that Mewtwo keep the other two away or this double will quickly become an orgy, i don't have the energy for that! The Flygon growl at the Bayleef in a clear sign of: stay out he is mine...barely knew her and she is already jealous, not good<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flygon, let her\" she look at me with an expression that say: No way! But i insist, if we bind she must understand that i am not a property and definitely not exclusive, considering Mewtwo and....maybe others? Later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my firm expression, and after a few seconds she relent \"Fly\" and let Bayleef get on my left side while she keep my right.<br>\r\nPerhaps i should have let Flygon have the exclusive, with both of them using their moves on me, i feel my release quickly approaching, far faster than i have hoped, Bayleef licking my base and Flygon the tip then exchanging position every few seconds, my sensitivity soar and i can't....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayleef get a mischievous smile and engulf my cock in one swift movement, cutting off a now quite pissed Flygon, but i can't hold it anymore and with a grunt, i let my seed flow in the grass type mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayleef suck greedily until Flygon bite her neck pulling the grass type away, only for her taking the place, my senses go haywire and i lose track of time. What i think it's a few seconds later, my senses return and i feel the ground type is still trying to milk what may have remained, forcing me to have jolts of pleasure/pain combined. Just when i am feeling myself passing out of exhaustion, a pleasant sensation pervade my tired body, and i feel my energy and presence of mind return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to understand, when looking in Mewtwo direction i notice that she is focusing on me, just like before she is using our bind to transfer energy to me...i think she is using recover. Feeling my hardness in her mouth, Flygon give me a last hard suck, before letting my penis slip out of her still withe pasted mouth. I see her gulping down, then without any more delay, she push me down forcing me to lay in the grass while she place her dripping sex over my erect cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlygon make me look at her needy hole before slowly impale herself down on me. Her insides are..dense, hard but not unpleasant, feel gelatinous? Not even time to pique my curiosity then her walls grip me with crushing strength, undulating and literary forcing me in \"slow down, i...eh.no need to..shit\" she is lost in pleasure, ignoring me completely, pushing her small clawed hands on my chest while she push herself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop only when my tip sloppily kiss her cervix, i never have thought that my tool is particularly long...so how<br>\r\nShe press herself down more, before looking straight to my eyes placing me just before her opening giving me a clear message, you are going in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlygon push herself up, her walls unrelenting in their grip, and when my tip exit from her, she push herself down, hard returning to her starting position \"Ach!\" she in not exactly a feather, ignoring my distress she insist continuing in her pattern, with every push she try to make me pierce her cervix while removing me less and less. Her hight pitched cries of passion are admittedly quite arousing, and despite her roughness my pleasure is rapidly increasing, perhaps she will have her wish granted soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe due to her already quite obvious aroused state, or maybe because of my past performance, she came only a few minutes after the start of our mating, and in a last attempt, she push herself down with enough strength to make me doubt my hip integrity for the future. I feel her walls convulsing madly, pretending my essence but i resist, mostly because her insides are gripping me to the point of pain, delaying my release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stand still, panting and still impaled on me, sadness in her feature. I do not know what has happened to me, but i feel a rush of strength like never before, adrenaline, lust maybe both. I grip Flygon flanks and pushing her to the side, i am able to topple her, she is surprised by this after all she weight a good 75 kg if not more. Pushing her down, while still inside her, i finally get over her there, i do something that even i don't know where it came from. I kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accept my affection while i place myself to continue our unfinished coupling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI distend her hind legs releasing the kiss, then i grab her flank and extract myself from her, nearly out, i push myself in as hard as i can, pushing all my weight behind this thrust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flyyy!\" I feel her already weakened cervix opening slightly, knowing that my goals are within reach i start to mate this Flygon properly, i don't know if the bind will work, but i will claim her as my own, no matter what<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thrust are helped by her quite plentiful lubrication, despite her gripping walls attempt to stop me, and taking advantage of my favorable leverage, i push myself in and out with fierce determination. I can hardly believe how tight and hot she is, i can finally appreciate it now that i am not crushed down, and i start to really enjoy her rough strong walls desperate attempt, and her willing counter push, hoping to drive me even more beastly that i already am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am close, i feel it, so close i can nearly touch it...\"Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Flyyyyyyyyy!\" with a last, heavy push, her cervix finally give up and open for me, closing itself tightly behind my head. There her rough hot walls, massage me with a frenzy that drive me nearly crazy with lust, and there i release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my cock trapped inside her womb, my seed splash directly on her uterine walls, drowning her incompatible eggs in my fertile gift, there everything go quite and i feel myself falling on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen i recover i fell my cock still hard and trapped in a now filled womb, with my partner insides still asking for more, i also feel my face tongued. Opening my eyes i look on how the Flygon is licking my face, with an happy satisfied expression. I try to feel for the binding, but while i have felt something, like a delicate tendril in the darkness, still no connection. I admit to be a little disappointed by this outcome, bu maybe next time....damn, i have become an horny bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to remove myself from her, but she immediately grip me tight, unwilling to let me go \"We have to go Flygon, please...\" she make a reluctant growl and let me go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally get up and try to look for my pants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel that something disturb Mewtwo greatly, and looking at her, i see her suddenly turn towards the forest: \"<i>The anomaly strength is increasing, we must make haste</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are telling me to make haste? Before i could speak she continue, turning to the two remaining candidates: \"<i>I am sorry, but there is no time, i have hoped that we had more, still i will transport you to Rukon home, we will discuss about your binding chances later</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nod, and in a moment all four of them vanish in a flash of light...home? Let's just hope that i still have one when i return..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo feel my distress: \"<i>Don't worry, they will keep their best behavior i am sure of it</i>\" Glad to see that someone has faith for us both<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo: \"<i>Let's get moving, this way</i>\" Hey! \"Wait dammit!, i need to dress first!\" I dress faster as possible, and curious about our destination and my sudden restoration earlier, i am sure that this afternoon will be quite interesting for us both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo not in that way you perv...damn whats happening to me.</span></div></div>",

I was quickly brought before him as he stood there and a slight look of disgust crossed his face.<br>\r\n\u201cAn imitator\u2026what brings you to my battlefield?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I tell you!?\u201d I barked only to be slugged in the gut by the and that had been holding the knife\u2026I saw now that he was a modern day ninja.<br>\r\n\u201cWatch what you say to the emperor boy!\u201d He hissed angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was unnecessary Yoshi,\u201d the emperor growled, \u201cNow let us start off formerly\u2026I\u2019m Emperor Masakage the third\u2026this is my comrade Yoshi\u2026we are Warriors of the nation of Ransei\u2026and what is your name imitator?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Rukou,\u201d I answered unsure of this man\u2026his aura of power was undeniable, \u201cWhat are you doing here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing the same thing as you,\u201d Masakage answered, \u201cWe\u2019re here at the behest of your government to eradicate your people\u2019s problem\u2026for a very large fee of course.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you just mercenaries for hire now?\u201d I inquired of these people.<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d he answered, \u201cthey\u2019ve promised us 10,000,000 poke and an ancient artifact of my people.\u201d<br>\r\nHe turned and walked away leaving e standing there as his soldiers moved with him towards the edge of the woods\u2026I quickly followed them to see a bunker fortified with barbed wire barricades, trenches and soldiers patrolled it.<br>\r\n\u201cClear us a path,\u201d Masakage stated into his gauntlet\u2026and seconds later artillery shells rained down upon the area slaughtering those not in the bunker or trenches and leaving the area above ground barren. But quickly more Rocket soldiers emerged but where now engaged by the Ransei soldiers in gray light body armor and were unable to advance far. The Rocket soldiers tried to swing around to the right only to be caught in an ambush by soldiers wearing red power armor and wielding flamethrowers and laser rifles. Fighting alongside them were dozens of fire based pokemon who were burning down the Rocket forces with extreme prejudice.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like the Ignis battalion has arrived to the fight,\u201d Yoshi stated readying his knives as Masakage moved to the front of the Soldiers in white power armor.<br>\r\n\u201cSoldiers of the supreme heaven\u2019s law\u2026I bring before you an offering of fools for you to cleanse,\u201d Masakage shouted turning to face the battlefield, \u201cNow soldiers of Aurora go to battle and win glory for the empire!\u201d<br>\r\nThe soldiers let out a cheer and charged forwards into the fray as tanks ripped through the trees and barreled down the battlefield their coaxial machineguns opened fire mowing down the opposing Rocket forces\u2026I realized that this attack was highly planned but\u2026the Ransei army was famous for being able to eradicate an enemy quickly but it seemed that their forward momentum had stalled\u2026I was wondering why\u2026and why would their emperor put himself in such danger.<br>\r\n\u201cHe is using himself as bait,\u201d Mewtwo stated over our link, \u201cHe\u2019s hoping to draw out something\u2026he probably knows more than we do\u2026I recommend joining the battle.\u201d<br>\r\nI was shocked\u2026how could I hope to not get in the way of these soldiers\u2026maybe it would be better to hang back and watch\u2026</span></div></div>",

In from of my eyes Risa seat and look at me with obvious challenge, and annoyance.<br>\r\nWell, i suppose that dragging her along on a trek on a snowy mountain wasn't the most wisest thing i could do, but after all, she is my Pokemon, and my best friend since i was....9? Well she was a lot smaller, and cute, and fluffy but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Risa, rock don't lift themselves..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine, nine tail\" I have the feeling..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should i ask you please?\" She still doesn't move, alright Risa you asked for this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, however i was just thinking about a certain Vaporeon..\" She look at me with confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the one we meet at the daycare, the one just entered when i come to get you out, he seems to like you, a lot\" Risa start looking scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i remember correctly you heat season start soon, sooo?\" She look angry now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NINE NINE NINE TAIL NINE!\" You sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Risa, i would never force you, however nature must run it's course, although there would be an alternative, like...you know it happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheek turn red, i can see this even with her fur, our \"adventure\" was a little forced on her side, not that i was complaining, i know she love me, or at least i think she does. Pokemon are a lot more free with affection than human, especially in certain condition. Not that this happen officially, but since when public official says the truth? Like when that Zapdos \"attacked\" Celestic Town, and a \"brave\" 26 year old trainer \"calmed \"Her\" down\". Lucky bastard. Is not that all Pokemon female are slut, it's just that their concept of species and acceptable mate varies a lot, natural all considered. Witch bring me to the present. Looking at myself for damage i see my dark red suit cover my form perfectly, just like my dark blue short, black hiking shoes, blue toned short hair, green eyes and a orange sleeves complete the picture, being 72 inches and by weighing 78 kg i consider myself pretty much in shape. Yep, fully healthy, no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Risa, will you help your...lov\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NINE!\" she immediately come and dig out the rock, or better say boulder that nearly got my foot, that instead ruined part of the backpack when it landed. Lucky once again then, okay i can live with that. I am not a fool that believe that my skill can get me out of anything, sometimes only the lady luck can help us. Sort of. Maybe. Risa don't like to speak of that particular event, even if i know she like when i pet her, or suggest something, maybe we will become more than friend, or maybe we are already. I have a really close bind with all my poke, my buddies, but with her is special, always has been. Will this change when i will meet a woman, a human woman, or not? Probably not, frankly.<br>\r\nOr another Pokemon, can i really love them, just like i love Risa? I really love Risa? I am not sure, i must think of this for a while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few second a small hole cleverly excavated near the boulder, make it roll off i finally i can check the damage. It landed just over the pokeball container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Hastily i check for anything salvageable, and it seems that Lady Luck favor me once more, at least in part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two Ultra Ball, better than nothing\" I had a Master ball too, o well i am alive and intact, Risa and the rest of team, are fine. Their ball in my belt are intact. I choose to bring only 3 Pokemon with me, why? Training, both mine and theirs, we need to strengthen or bounds, it's what make us strong. Common trainer and novice just can't understand how important, no fundamental this all is. A strong bond make your team stronger. I think that the link connect the vital energy of the Pokemon to their trainer is double-sided, both of us get advantage over it. How? No idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Risa, your \"free\" help is always appreciated\" Gesturing free with my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then, adventures awaits!\" I am sure to hear Risa say something. Turning to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine!\" She give me a nervous smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much further now!\" Finally the interminable caves end, light from the cave peak come down upon us, blinding and beautiful, fresh air too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpear Pillar, in all it's rocky glory. How many trainer come here just to have the chance of seeing the legendary, my Favorite legendary actually. Oh yes, Palkia and Dialga, the master of time and space. Or mistress? No, it's doesn't matter now.\"Onward!\" i say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisa follow behind me closely, she is tense i can see that, i feel it too. Since that night, i feel her, sort of, feel what she is feeling, not pain but, you know, sensation. She is nervous, something is here. Something watching us. Maybe them? So the legend it's true? Only one way to find out.<br>\r\nWalking warily we reach the central..ruin? Yes i suppose it can be called that way, and look at...emptiness actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know i always considered myself a smart guy, maybe not Alakazam smart, but smart nonetheless. But the nervousness coming from the link with Risa combined with my overeagerness to see MY Legendary, make me do something i know will NOT regret. Make sense right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga! Palkia! Come forth, i want to see you! To feel your presence! I Justin Frem, want to know what kind of \"god\" you really are! <b>If</b> you are a gods at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth start trembling beneath my feet, and in that moment i knew, i pissed off something quite powerful. Can't be more excited!<br>\r\nA flash appear before me, no wait TWO!? Fantastic i will see them both! Let's just hope that i will be able to tell the tale. Argh! Why mi mind shift so? My emotion, Risa? These are her emotion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have much time to ponder this as both the legend of time and space appear before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! they are screaming in my head! Can't you both tone it down, i am trying to watch in awe here for Arceus sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable, or perhaps not, they start watching ME in awe, at least for a moment then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well human, what do you wish? Why you summoned us?\" I think this is Palkia, but their voice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why i want to feel how is to stand in the presence of the incarnation of time and space, can't a trainer just try to relax from time to time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth look at me like i lost my mind, and i feel Risa emotion telling me something like, \"we are dead\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time is Dialga that decide to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, in our presence? What madness is this? Didn't you come here for challenging us like all the others?\" I have heard well the first time, their voice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course, beside i only have 2 balls with me, and only other 2 member of my team, i haven't come here to capture but to know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga say \"Know what?\" Expecting some deep and trough question about dimension or the nature of the universe i wager. Instead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the last time any of you two got relief?\" Risa look at me with a stare that leave no uncertainty on what she is thinking right now, that i am completely nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"deity\" look at me with wild eyes, uncertainty in their feature<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vacation, leisure walk, getting laid you know the usual\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia that screaming \"ARE YOU MOCKING US!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" then i add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany trainer has come here, to capture you, how many of them taunted both of you in match? On how many you answered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger leave their feature and Dialga say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many, only a few\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May i ask why, those few?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia answer \"They where worthy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why there where worthy? They saved the world? Helped Pokemon? Pure of Hearth? Or is something more?\" Accentuating the word more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at each other for a moment, then looking at me again, Dialga reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They where worthy\" unsatisfied with the answer i press forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why then you reply to my call?\" They look at each other again, but before they could speak i declare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because they <b>Loved</b> their Pokemon, right? <b>Really</b> loved them, so much to have a physical relation with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unthinkable happen, the question that plagued me since that night, finally is cured<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth reply \"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen i boldly say \"Don't you wish the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth answer \"Are you worthy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill both \"Waht make you so certain, you said to don't want our power, but still seek it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i want answer\" They look at me bewildered, then i add<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One i have already got, the other..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My legendary, i want you both!\" They look at me like i am has gone crazy, but then both speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove us that you deserve our answer, that you are our rightful other, or die here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it!\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as the Flamethrower hit Palkia it seemed like nothing happened, but Palkia acted that as if that was a critical hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!!\" Palkia said panting Risa is fighting both of them by herself too! They look tired but there's not even a scratch on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was wondering this Palkia used Water Pulse it moved too fast to dodge but when it got close it disintegrated into steam? \"Hah...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something is definitely wrong, 2 of the most powerful Pokemon in existence can't go down so easily. My guts are telling me that there are not really trying to win this match, it's seems like they are testing me, but testing what dammit! Based on their reaction and the few answer i extracted the before, they value the bond between pokemon and their master? nearly to the point of devotion. Was this means that pokemon and trainer are <b>supposed</b> to intermingle with each other? Even to the deepest physical level? If my assumption is correct, than there is only one way to prove that I Am this <u>other</u> they spoke me about, and as crazy as it sounds, it would implying mating with them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes, i know normally doing this in a battle, especially when your  opponents are so powerful would be the stupidest thing to do, yet, i focus on my inner thoughts, to that distant voice that i have heard, just after me and Risa mated for the first time. The feeling that nothing was wrong, despite what some overpaid public official say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and look at the scene before me, both Palkia and Dialga seems to be down, but i know that thats isn't true, that they haven't fought with even half their real strength, after all, who doesn't know of their famous signature moves: Palkia Spacial Rend, and Dialga Roar of Time. Also Palkia can shift in space, i saw it doing it during a match against a champion, it just shifted through the battlefield, no attack, not even Extremespeed was able to land a blow. Dialga, ha! Dialga can manipulate time, it's true that there are rules, that even it must respect, but i am sure that a slight bending, enough to deflect a blow can be done without much of an hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my conclusion are clear, they want to lose, they want to test if a am this <u>other</u>, very well then, let's start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palkia, Dialga! Enough of your playing, get up and test me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia say \"We was testing you, you won\" i then angered reply \"Lies! You are not facing a stupid cocky champion, convinced that every battle can be won with enough firepower\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause, with the corner of my eye i see that they are interested in my speech, so, this is your test? Part of it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True strength come from the bond between Trainer.......no, that's not true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause again, Risa look at me with concern, i feel her emotion, she is scared, scared for me, not herself, for me. Now i know the second answer that i have pursued for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True strength, come from the very soul, the emotion, the sweat, the passion that a person put for and with his own pokemon, his own partners, his true friends and sometimes, lover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then continue \"I am one them, they call me Trainer, truly i have learn more from Risa coming up here, that in all the tournament i have participated until now, i was ignorant, i was blind\" i then turn my face towards my exhausted Risa, she would have forsake her own life just to make My dream come true, sorry Risa that i haven't saw this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risa\" She look at me with a worried look, and i feel her emotion, her little secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was too blind to see it, i was consider you my best friend, but i was wrong\" I fell her emotion boiling, she is afraid \"You are much more to me\" i feel her fear turning to confusion \"You are my lover Risa, and i.....i do Love you Risa\" i finish my phrase looking straight in her eyes, at first nothing, but then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine! Ninetails nine!\" Elation, she is smiling, her feeling hidden is no more, she loves me, just like without knowing have always loved her, how if not, Ninetails take only 1 mate in their lives, no matter on how many pokemon they breed with. Yes i Was blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Palkia and Dialga again, and say \"So, satisfied? I have admitted my emotion, my bond, it's real meaning, will you finally stop whoring around and take me seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they could, i would have swear to have saw a smile on their feature, fuck they treated me like all the fools that have come up here till now. And just like with my Risa before, i will make them drop that smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up, where aren't done here yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Legendary raise, barely a few cuts on their thick skin, both smiling in a pretty scaring way, i didn't know that it was possible to have a smile that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga finally speak \"On the contrary dear Justin, the test is mostly over, and you passed\" I am officially scared now, since when they called me by name? Not a good sign<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pretty sure to have said, enough bullshit a few seconds ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"No more, we have nearly done testing you, you are a worthy trainer for us\" so what, nice being appreciated. Dialga \"But are you a worthy other?\" Here we go again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By other, do you mean...lover then?\" They smile, a smile that would scare the crap out of Giratina if he? No at this point it's pretty clear, she, near all legendary are she, thats why all the great legendary trainer....shit, doesn't surprise me now that Lance always look so tired, he fuck his own dragon! All of them, or at least some. Ha! Then Cynthia Garchomp....and her Lucario oh shit! Fuck! So thats why they never go to the breeding center, oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 two bringer of doom, or at least, the end of my sooo peaceful night, stand before me, smiling. Bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you are not my favorite anymore, can't i just leave? Please?\"  Then both together \"NO!\" Well, at least i have tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, how.....ehm....\" Their smile never fade, i feel sick, and Risa love doesn't help, sweet and puke don't mix well together. oh man here come diabetes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"Now, dearest doesn't concern about...details\" She doesn't even try to hide her voice anymore, it's clearly female, freaking deep, but still female.<br>\r\nDialga \"Indeed our other, worry not, everything will be alright, purrr\" Purr? Purr! What the fuck! I am leaving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as i try to leave, both of them appear before me, barring my only escape, Risa why don't thou have learned teleport? Ugh, because she can't, fuck my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"Now dear, come closer, please we don't bite\" I beg to differ. Dialga \"Really there is nothing to be scared about, haven't you have already.....\" Yeah, remind me of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are both fucking sluts! Do you realize that i wasn't even born when you two started masturbating! How many century ago btw, no don't answer that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"Dearest, it doesn't matter, but you are right, sometimes we are just sluts, but only for you\" She wink, oh Arceus my breakfast! Dialga \" And of course there are some other matter that has to be discussed, purrr\"Fuck, you are not a cat STOP PURRING! \"But if you want to start from the fucking part, no complain\" Oh Arceus WHY! No wait<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus! This is all your idea isn't it! You fucking pervert!\" Palkia \"Now, offending mother would help you not\" She is female too?! Dialga \"No it is not, power over creation, gender has no matter for...it,\" Evidently not the case for those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"We have spoken enought, for now, let's preceded with the binding\" With this they both start to shrink, becoming not much taller than Risa. The still smiling they turn around and their sexes is clearly visible now, ready for use. \"I am fucked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga \"Not yet, but in a few more moments....\"Me and my big mouth!<br>\r\nRisa simply laugh and leave(traitor!), leaving me alone with the MILF? Shit, this is so messed up.Palkia  \"So lover, from behind or on my back?\" Dialga \"maybe you prefer some stimulation first, i don't mind, or maybe you wish to be ridden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! I don't want two whores!\" Palkia \"We are not, dearest, we are just your final bond, your life-mates if you prefer, you can do whenever you want with us, we have waited so long...\" Dialga \"Now and forever, purrr and we i say forever, I mean Forever\" I admit that i am aroused now, more than i would have believed possible. Their pussy leak now, not in my dreams, or nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything? I mean...\" Both of them \"Anything....we are yours our bond\"</span></div></div>",

I feel sad, how can i... no it doesn't matter now, more answer are coming, but not before our binding is complete. Very well, if they want it so badly, i take them. My legendary, in the end, i still won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"Dear would you like.....\"  \"Shut up! Dialga present! Palkia entratain Risa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia \"Oww, i wanted you first......very well my lover\" Palkia walk toward my traitorus Ninetails, exposing her wet pussy all the time, slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga dosen't speak, just lower her front and rise her rear at my crotch level and watch me with a bemused expression, no foreplay, if they have waited so long.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discard my now useless pants and underwear, then i kneel at Dialga pussy, and spread her with my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, more please\" \"I have said shut it! You are mine, remember?\" She wine but stop speaking, i spread her even further, her aroma is strong, metallic. I suppose that being part steel.... I give it a lick, she wine even more, i decide that i like her metallic taste. Her pheromone make me so hard it hurt, i think that she has waited long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up, and point the tip of my cock at her entrance, she wine again, then i spread her lips apart and trust in in one motion. \"Aha!\" Mine. I don't even wait for her to be comfortable, and start thrusting immediately, her pussy is incredibly hot, and her muscle grip me with ferocity, pulling me in. I slow a little, savoring her clenching walls, it feels so right. A tingling sensation rise from my cock \"What...aha\"<br>\r\nDialga \"It's ok Justin i am adapting you\" Adapting? \"Yes i make you bigger and thicker, for enjoy us better\" What? \"But I'll never being able to..\" Dialga \"Mate with a human anymore?\" I nod \"Dear you won't mate with a human ever more, with Risa of course, maybe other pokemon on our journey, but nothing more, and for sure, no human\" So this is the price. Legendary bond, legendary price, fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cock swell even more, filling her cavity fully, until i fell my now speared? tip reach the entry or her sanctum. \"There is where you must release, claim us my bond\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more words, i remove myself from her, and spear myself in with force. \"Yes my bond! Take us! \" I decide to stop thinking and start thrusting like a madman, her slick wall seems to try to begs for my stay, and perhaps they do. I establish a strong rhythm holding myself on her, and trying to pierce her womb, my cock grow even longer, to ready itself for the task i wager, dynamic cock? Ever thought about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue my mad thrusting, enjoying the friction inside her, and battering at her entrance, my relentless barrage is rewarder by an incredible pleasure, her moaning and her cervix opening. Dialga \"Ahaaa, more just a little more!\" \"Shut it slut, down!\" i push her head down on the ground and thrust even deeper, we are there, soon she will be mine. She wine loudly, a wine that become a scream when i finally enter her womb, bottoming inside her deepest part and touching it's walls. She is gone, her mind leave her as her whole body power suck on my cock, collapsing on it, she has just come, and i enjoy the mouth of her womb stimulating my tip every time i ram it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga \"Ahaaaa m..more,,,ahh jsut al tlee mre\" I continue my motions, aiming at squeezing every last drip of pleasure from her, her muzzle in now on the ground, her tongue out in a small puddle of her own saliva. Life is good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am so close, so close. I remove myself from her desperate depths, after a few more moment i cram myself all in, straight in her womb, and release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaaaaa.....\" She is gone but her body respond nonetheless, massaging me in unimaginable way, drawing my seed directly from my balls, i keep myself hilted while my face contort in horrible pleasure. I have never released so much, i feel her womb filling up, while her cervix muscle close tight around my cock, i can't withdraw even if i have wanted to, not that i want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity later, my flood stop, i feel that her womb is completely full, her muscle release me, and finally i remove myself from her. As soon as my tip leave i am assaulted by our combined smell, and i see that my new cock it's actually speared, with the evident porpoise of penetrating deeply, it probably flare up during release, locking me in. I seat with my still monstrous cock dripping our combined juice, realization come to me. I have just bred Dialga. Marvelous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have to wait much for the binding to take effect. Energy, pure energy, lift me up from the ground, flowing through me, so much i think I'll explode, something is changed inside me, something important, then abruptly, stop, letting me fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am once again seated, different but without knowing how, Dialga is out like a lamp, not a drip o my seed has get out from her womb. She must have fallen down during the binding. Mouth open, tongue extended and out of her muzzle, a small puddle of saliva under it. Very dignifying, if would just have my camera now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine!\" Ha yes, those two. I have binded with My Dialga, now it's time to claim Palkia as well.</span></div></div>",

What am i, some candy boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with lust in her eyes, i can see it, despite her relatively calm appearance, she want me as bad as Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer\" She obey, walking near me, her stare never leave my form, eying my cock intensively \"Why do i have to pierce your womb?\" She answer without removing the stare off my tool Palkia:\"Actually it's not really necessary, but it help, releasing in our deepest sanctuary you land an undeniable claim upon us, we cannot be unbound, no matter what\" really now \"But why with a mortal?\" She raise her vision and look at me in a serious manner, no more games Palkia: \"Because, Justin you are not mortal anymore, not exactly\" Wat?! \"You just mated with what can be summarized as the essence of time, did you seriously believed that you would have come out unchanged? You my dear Justin, are not immortal, you can be killed, but time will never touch your feature again, forget white hair and wrinkles, rheumatism with old age and everything it bring, you will remain as you are, forever, well maybe a few improvements....\" Eyeing you cock once more \"and a few more change due to maturity, but essentially....\" Shit i am nearly immortal, WOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia: \"There is more to say, especially after our bonding will be complete, but our argument is over for now, there is Much to Do\" I look at her, she is serious, how much this will gonna cost me then? No more human, even if admittedly i don't lose that much, especially if age is not an issue anymore, but there are more, i guess it can't be helped, my favorites pokemon are literally begging for my love, and my seed, i was in this whole mess even before i stepped on this rocky mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On you back\" She grin and obey without hesitation, my Ninetails seems bothered by something, i know, she doesn't like sharing, sorry Risa, next time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia lay on her back with her hind legs spread, her light-pink belly and her very ready sex greet me, her scent is strong, and i want a taste. Palkia never stop watching me, while she give herself to me to do whenever i want, i will test that claim, later. I kneel and spread her lips apart Palkia:\"Mhrrr, yes, finally\" the scent is overpowering, even stronger that Dialga, but maybe thats just because she has waited longer. I give and experimental lick  Palkia:\"Mhrrr, please, don't, we need it\" her taste is richer in flavor but less powerful, a lightest tone, water type, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think to have teased her sufficiently for now, but i want to test something first, i press my digit inside her without regard Palkia:\"Aha!\" and take some fluid, then descending i found her anus, and spread it open with the same finger. Palkia:\"Ergh..waht are you..ha!\" i will make her like this as well, another time. Removing my hands i get up and place the tip of my now speared cock at the lips, without any warning sink it in fully. Palkia:\"Yessssssss!\" Her walls clench on me strongly has Dialga did, she is definitely more slick, even if her inner muscle control is evidently inferior, nonetheless a very pleasant feeling, with all this lubrication i have no trouble to find her inner mouth, and removing myself, until the tip is at her outer lips i cram myself in, Hard. Palkia:\"All of it, it's nece..ha there!\" Just like before over-thinking will just delay the what i too want, so, shutting off everything else, i start breeding my second legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy is literally contort itself on my spire, gripping me like i was her only savior, and i am, in a sense, what my thrust lack in speed, gain in depth, reaching her deeper barrier and extracting an heavy moan and a tingling feeling from her. I know she is changing me, like Dialga did, even if her interest seems more focus on my tool now, probably adding another improvement to my already monstrous cock, fin? no, rings she is adding foldable rings of flesh all over my dynamic cock, it's becoming incredibly sensitive and stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her i see that she is smirking between every moan, every thrust of my hips, no, nothing, not ever her will take me for fool. I double the strength behind every movement and go as fast as i can, i stop to nearly removing myself from her and instead, i continuously batter at her cervix. Palkia:\"Ahaaaaa, so good, more, more!\"<br>\r\nSlut! That what she is. My effort are rewarded when finally her inner mouth start opening, and with a mighty thrust i cram myself in Palkia:\" Ahaaa....\" Like her sister, shock on her muzzle, her body freeze, and her inner ring clamp down on my head, preventing my retreat, her inner muscle do an excellent job at milking me, and having obtained what i wanted, i release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferently from Dialga, she does not recover middle orgasm and her look remain vacant as i flood her inside, but just as her sister, saliva stream out her muzzle, making a small puddle beneath her head. Just like before an eternity pass before my flooding stop, and just like before, afterwards, the feel of energy entering me and changing my very core. Palkia do not release her muscle and i found myself still locked inside. When the energy finally left me, so her muscle relent. Palkia collapse on the ground, and i extract myself slowly from her, her inner walls still massaging me at every step, making my already sensible tool even more difficult to control, i have the continuous reflex of cramming myself in again, but i resist. As soon as my tip is out, her outer lips seal, as she was still unspoiled, even if her sex is clearly still visible, and bear sign of recent use. Just like a water creature, would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cock 2.5? retreat collapsing on itself, returning at a more bearable length, at least i will be able to wear underwear again, even if probably i would need a bigger size. Dynamic cock, screwdriver and cleaning liquid included, well, the liquid container is pretty big though, i will protest at the nearest marketing branch later, for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seat on the ground, Risa come closer and seat near me. \"Nine tail nine tail ninetails\" Yeah i put ourself in quite the mess this time uh? I look at both Dialga and Palkia both still out, and i remember my two remaining Ultraballs. Risa seems to read my mind, and nodding, she go and drag the backpack to me. I lazily get up tired but unable to rest, an unique feeling to be sure, and coming near Dialga, i caress her hard skin, far softer than expected, perhaps she can change her outer resilience? A question for later. I then lift the ball and touch her with it, she get captured in a moment not ever trying to resist, definitely willing. I repeat the same process with my new water squeezer, with similar result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen reaching for Risa again, i seat next to her, lay down, and petting her i say \"Thanks Risa, i wouldn't have have done this without you\" \"Nine\" She nods in agreement<br>\r\n\"Risa, i was serious, i love you, and this change nothing\" She look at me, then \"Nine!\" Nodding again, she lay herself over me with her muzzle near my mouth, and still petting, i kiss her.</span></div></div>",

That sounds like loooooooong time, i just hope that they are not gonna throw dishes at me when pissed. Nah, what am i saying, they will just probably lift an enormous sized boulder and annihilate the whole area i am in, then bring me back with the ability to manipulate time, and do it again.......ok that won't probably happen, but still, i can't help it but being worried, am i really up to par? Can i Really satisfy them? Well apparently i can, physically, but what about the rest, they will change some part of my mind, my personality too? Suiting their needs as they see fit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething, like a small nearly inaudible voice, tell me that they are never gonna do something like that, but.......i just need time to process this whole mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine!\" At least someone is happy at whole ordeal \"Risa, i took that you are satisfied with the outcome?\" She look at me while we clear the last part of this cave, the exit finally appear before us, her face betray some insecurity \"Nine, nine ne tail nine tail\" She is worried about the sharing, i can feel it, she don't want to have other to compete with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, i will not abandon you Risa, i never leave you hanging, and if the duo doesn't like it, well they can take someone else as bound then.\" I feel her happiness returning, she believe me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine, nine tails!\" Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally get out of that strange place, that mountain; since the binding, i feel a lot of energy surge from it, maybe they did stay here for a reason. Nonetheless our path is clear, and some rest is in order, now we just need a good patch of terrain for making camp, and then, rest......hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                          Approximately 1 hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, finding this place wasn't easy, i could have just reach the pokemon center but, well.....i don't trust the league, in fact as a rule, every pokemon Must be turned in for rejuvenation when the trainer desire to use the free bedding service, they usually give them back to you immediately after, but we are speaking about Palkia and Dialga here, i  am pretty certain that if i bring them in, they will not allow me to leave so easily, or at least not with them and i Will Not allow such thing. Strange, how i can be already so final about them? Is my pride as a trainer? Possible, but i would exclude it, i think that the binding, it's seems to make me feel strongly for them, maybe a protection pokemon-side a sort of failsafe; more i think about it more i believe in that possibility, it would make sense, they give themselves to you fully, some sort of feedback has to be expected, well i don't mind, i have always thought that my pokemon are more then just tools, they are family of a sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily this place is far enough from the road, for When, not if, when they are gonna start bothering me with.....i don't know, anything. I start unpacking the tent, no way Palkia or Dialga could fit inside, and prepare the campfire, i should be distant enough to not be noticed i hope, then  with Risa help, i start cooking our dinner, some chilli should be just what we need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to prepare food for Pal and Dial as well, damn i need a name for them mmmm i ask later, but then, epiphany, a smile start creeping on my face, sooooo you want to be mine? It's payback time, that fake battle ahhhh! If i think about it.......retribution, is at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explain my plan to Risa, it's simple really, we hide the food prepared for them and instead, i place two big cans of pokechow on the ground, where they will appear. I start to fell all giddy from the idea, i subconsciously start to rub my hands together like an evil mastermind planning world domination, oh their face are gonna be priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when i feel my evil laugh coming out, ready to strike fear in the hearth of any poor fools that even think trying to stop me, the balls of my chosen victims open, unexpectedly releasing Pal and Dial. All in all, i should have know that pokeballs can't really contain a legendary unless he/she are willing, they are just too strong, or at least some of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga \"Damn that those things are cramped, can't they add some more space, i can barely move in there!\" <br>\r\nPalkia \"Sis, they just can't, their knowledge of space compression is still in the early development, they will take years for perfecting it\" <br>\r\nDialga \"What are you saying, i saw those expansed pokeball sold at the....mart, yes they call it that way, and there are all comfort inside those\" Dialga make a disgruntled expression <br>\r\nPalkia make a confused expression \"Dear sis, what in tartarus are you talking about?\" <br>\r\nDialga \"What you mean what i am...the expansed balls the one with three striped......oh\" Her expression become confused, than \"Oh, i must have confused this with the other stream, sorry\" Wat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even bother asking, i probably don't want to know \"Have you two done?\" They look at me with a winning smile, the one you get when you found out that the above mentioned goldmine is deeper than expected. I am not sure if i should be scared or happy, i am both tough, i am happy. It's this i am feeling their happiness? Could very well be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, hungry? I have prepared out dinner and\" i can barely contain myself \"i hope you like......some nutritious food\" Well thats true enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at me with the same, now creepy smile, their tone become dripping with lust as well <br>\r\nDialga \"Of course that we are angry, an hunger so deep that only a Very Long <u>dinner</u> could satisfy\" <br>\r\nPalkia \"A Long and Hard dinner\" Ok, everything is alright, i just need to calm down, yes breath in, breath out, breath in.....<br>\r\nDialga \"Of course no dinner is complete without some dessert\" <br>\r\nPalkia \"Yes, some creamy dessert, our favorite\" Ok, everything is not alright, breath in, breath out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia with the same tone \"But maybe, our <u>Master</u> wish for some eye candy first, after all, you eat with your eyes as well\" She said, walking slowly toward me like a predator ready to strike <br>\r\nDialga \"Of course sis, <u>Master</u> deserve some relax, after all that we had put him trough\" She start to walk toward me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that i can remove the word relax from my dictionary, i don't think i will use it anymore anyway. I stay still, provoking dangerous predator is not that wisest thing you could do, then not more than a meter from me, Pakia turn around, giving me an unrestricted view of her already aroused sex, Dialga just do the same, i am shocked, can't i even have dinner now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am aroused i admit, but not now. \"No, stop it we will dinner like a family now, later, we'll see.\" I then walk away, with uncomfortable tightness in my underwear and an awakened lust, i should be able to calm tough, yes i will. I feel that Plakia and Dialga are not unhappy as i thought they would be, instead they are even more excited, i must bring some ice cold water with me from now on, being both dragon type maybe.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them \"Of course, <u>Master</u>, later\" Shit, can't even leave them to the daycare or something, they would probably just tear it down, and find me anyway, beside i don't want to leave them, nor now, nor ever. The bound again, could i really love them one day? Maybe i already do.</span></div></div>",

Focusing on the present, my giddiness return as i think once more to the plan now ready for deployment, i will teach them to not take me for a fool, i am Not a plaything, I Am their Trainer and Mate and.....mate, ok, alright, perfect...THE FUCK THEY DID TO ME?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hide my anger, burying it with all the unwanted memories recently resurfaced, after all i admit that i have always wanted them, although i am pretty sure that my plan didn't include the....bounding part. Damn, i am behaving like a child....maybe i am, compared those those two at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga: \"Sooo <u>Master</u>, when dessert will be served? I am eager to get a taste..\"<br>\r\nPalkia \"Sis, your impatience is annoying, just like your whining, patience, first dinner then dessert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are worse than a fifty something woman asking for a ride from a sixteen, depending on the situation...very creepy, or very... \"Nine! Ni nine nine!\" Risa is pissed, i can tell, i think that she didn't like their constant teasing, or maybe she is just jealous, she is not what you would call a sharing type individual<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga: \"Later? How amusing sis\" Funny how the ^essence of time^ is the most impatient of the two, or maybe she just want to play fast forward on the dvd she call stream, that would imply that she already knew the end tough, i...don't think that is really possible..to know all the details about the future i mean...maybe i should test it, or just ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, it's possible to know the future, every detail i mean\" she still bear that mischievous/winning smile: \"No, not really. Major Events can be foretold, perceived or as you human...eheh well not anymore...\" here we go again, she continue \"Still they can be expected, some at least, but the details...no not really. Some are literally written in stone and would require a ^Big Hammer^ to change them, of course that would provoke all kind of mishap in that stream and maybe others as well, after all a Big Hammer is anything but delicate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pause for a few moments, probably letting me absorb the information, then: \"Minor events are not...how to call it....planned, they happen as they go, the being living it can plan them and change them as his ability and equipment permit, but some degree on uncertainty always linger....sort of random, it's however possible to know the outcome of an even while is ^running^, perceiving the change that it will bring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it seems, i think i understand what she is saying, she continue: \"For example a game of dice may has been planned for years, or century before the player are even born...but the outcome in most case is not, not really anyway only the more probable or the more acting at the moment, it's hard to describe\" Ok maybe another time, but know the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i can..feel if i am gonna win or not?\" Dialga: \"Yes it's possible, the event may even be influenced by you belief as well\" If that's is true than i....somehow placed myself in this condition? I have willingly changed my fate to...it's too much for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so, hungry?\" Palkia: \"Definitely\" Dialga: \"I would prefer to skip to dessert...but okay, for now....\" She will drive me mad, still the plan, hihihi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, do take a seat around the fire, dinner is ready...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">you bet it is</font>\" Pal and Dia put themselves comfortable near the can of chow, while I and Risa grab a dish of chilli, our esteemed guest look at us with curiosity as asking: and us? I then point at the can of chow, observing with interest at their reaction......yes priceless. Their disdain for the thing is topped only by Dialga reaction, she extract her claw, a shimmering curved...i don't know some sort of  ^living blade^, and slash both thing in two. Wow her Metal Claw are scary, note to self: don't piss them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga then look at me with a serious/bothered expression: \"Really? Are you serious? You believe that we are Nothing More Than COMMON POKEMON!? SOMETHING FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH?!\" Her voice is strong, enough to to top down the tent and scaring any wildlife was in the vicinity, including my now flat hair, everything go silent..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia: \"Sis, you have no sense of humor whatsoever, don't have you noticed that Risa was smiling? It's was a joke, although a bad one....\" She said looking at me, damn prickly much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's better to clear this mess, i just hope that the enormous boulder not far from here will remain where it is \"Dialga, seriously i just have thought that you would have needed a good mix of food for powering yourself\" They look at me strangely \"Aren't you both capable of manipulating Time and Space?\" They nod \"Don't you require quite the amount of energy for doing so?\" They hesitate, but nod again \"The food you just...annihilated, was rich in protein, fiber, carbohydrates and anything you may ever need for a fast and complete recovery\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look dubious \"It's quite simple really, pokemon body require a lot of energy for powering their attacks, so we developed a specific diet so that they could use their ability at their maximum potential, you are what you eat, ever heard of it?\" Their face show realization now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga: \"Sooo, you wanted to..make us recover faster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEhhhh..nope? \"Of course, i realize that the chow doesn't exactly taste as good as a full fledged dinner..but it's a much better diet than...chilli\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga: \"..Sorry...we...all those years would be master has come trying to capture us....and for a moment.....sorry\" She is ashamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia with an inquisitive look: \"Why Risa is eating chilli then?\" Easy enough \"Because she has barely fought at all, you two ^surrendered^ nearly immediately, or did you have already forgot?\" I continue \"How much strength the bond took from you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at each other, then Both: \"Some\" Some uh? Aren't we prideful...\"You both dropped unconscious!' Both: \"Not really..\".....No, i Will Not ask That<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab two dishes, filled with our real dinner \"Want some?\" They both nod, and i place it at their feet and we all start eating together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.

This is getting awkward, but perhaps i can use this in my favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see that Plakia is starting to berate her sister, and i decide to intervene: \"Dialga, try to be a serious deity for at least five\" i show her my hand with five fingers \"minutes ok? Just five, and...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">i am gonna regret this</font>, IF you answer my question seriously and Tell me everything you can, i may..consider the dessert part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lower my hand, as Dialga smile become big enough to encompass all her muzzle, not unlike certain anime supervillain: \"Reeeallly now\" purr..SHE CAN PURR?! Oh yes she can, done this before, if she didn't have all that metal around her body and in the dark, you could exchange her for a big cat....no not really<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga continue with a seductive tone, while Palkia look at me bemused \"Of what kind of dessert we are talking, exactly?\" I see that she don't like to take chances, at least not with her ^prize^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, depending on the answer..\" Dialga start to slowly advancing towards me, i notice the she is trying to provoke a reaction by moving her back in rhythm with her walk, i don't think that she realize how my mate could be imposing by doing so, after all she is easily bigger then me   ..i have said mate again..fuck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDia reach me and gently push me down with her front right paw, she then place both forelegs at my side and lower her head to my face, despite the feeling of lust and affection coming from her i am still pretty scared i admit. Her muzzle come closer, and the metal surrounding it, liquefy, moving to other parts of her well toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion about her ability to control metal, her own or others as well, surge from my mind, but her hot breath forcefully bring me back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga place her mouth close to mine and with a low, nearly purring tone say: \"Depends..my love? From what? I you don't like my answer why don't you try to get them by force, hmm. Maybe forcing me to bend down for you and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisa intervene by trying to showing off Dial: \"NINE!

What in tartarus are you doing to our mate?!\" Dialga get up, the metal on her muzzle reform soundlessly, answering with a bored tone: \"I am just trying to get Our mate in the mood, that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalikia now pissed: \"IN THE MOOD!? You have SCARED the living spirit out of him, look at his face, you idiotic sister of mine, now we can forget tonight dessert\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am still a little shocked, still laying down, i know that Dialga didn't want to scare me but..she isn't exactly an Evee you know..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine, nine nine\" i feel Risa muzzle caress my cheeks, her tongue gently lick my face help me relax a little, while her concerned look persist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalika: \"Sister do you realize that you Cannot be so aggressive with our mate? He is not Rayquaza, you can't just push him around and expect who know what\"<br>\r\nDialga: \"Rayquaza? That wimp? He had the audacity to ask me, Me, to mate with him. You are right sister i should have not pushed him around, i should have crushed him where he stood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia with an exasperated tone: \"We are Not talking about that overgrown Seviper, sister, we are talking about Our lover, the same that you nearly forced..\" She is interrupted by Dia screaming: \"Forced?! I don't Need to force Our mate to do anything, he Loves us sister, why should he refuse my offering? I just wanted a different, more direct approach, but if You think that that was too aggressive i just present and wait for him to take me then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga start to come towards me again, but Risa would have none of it: \"NINE! Ninetales Nine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga: \"Ha! Like you could stop me, just get out while i..\" <b>Booooom</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud explosion deafen me for a few seconds, a column of smoke cover the area where Dia stood. I hear an elaborate breathing and turning, i notice that Palkia is the source, she doesn't seems tired, just pissed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalika: \"Sister i have just about enough of you, desist, this is not how it should and must be\" A deep menacing growl can be heard coming from the still fog of smoke, and sure enough Dialga jump out and assume a fighting position, ready for a battling her sister once again, after not so much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, i forcefully snap out of my stupor, and decide that this is enough. With a sudden adrenaline rush, i push myself to my feet, and walk determined between my bounded to stop this idiocy before it even start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" They both stop and look at me with a surprised expression \"I don't want to have Anything to do with the whiny, pestering children that you two evidently are! I will Not allow your stupidity!\" I point at them both, they lower their eyes to the ground, ashamed \"To cause another incident, you know at what i am referring to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause, recovering my breath: \"I don't care who started what or how...\" I lower my hands \"I do Not, want to see any of you two at least until tomorrow, did i have make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth raise their head, and looking at me they start to mumble something, but i don't care: \"No! I will not hear your whines or any of your excuses, now go, both of you\" They seems to want to say something, but i will not permit it: \"NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both look at the ground again, and without another word, vanish, maybe in their respective dimension..i don't know, i don't care now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly feeling myself chilling out, while i walk towards the downed tent. I silently rebuild the small structure, and promptly go in, Risa following closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay down on the bedroll, uncaring about getting inside. Risa immediately try to lay on my chest, partially succeeding. I gently grab the her soft fur on her head and stroke it, <br>\r\nletting her warmth lulling me to unconsciousness. I am tired now, mentally more then physically, and with the last glimpse of anger leaving me, i slowly fall in an uneasy asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every summer, you and your dad would head up to a private mountain home your old man owns for vacation and lodge there. It was a nice place. Pretty cozy, nice cool weather at night and provides a great view of the mountain side. There's a small town nearby where young rookie pokemon trainers hang out before making their dangerous trek up the mountain, so you werent very far away from civilization either.<br>\r\nAlthough you see plenty of folks socializing with one another as they make their way into the caves. Most of them are just the rookie trainers talking about how theyre gonna catch THIS pokemon or conquer THIS gym leader or face off against THOSE outlaws of Team Flare or Team Plasma or Team Socket or Team Snuggle or Team Wyattearp or whatever... and a few hikers you once overheard talking to each other about finding a crystal mine around these parts. You've been to this resort for a couple years and you've never seen or heard anything about a crystal mine around these parts outside of hiker gossip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a mystery of your own. How was your dad able to afford such a summer house? He'd never tell you, he was always quick to change the subject. You knew he was a truck driver, but not even truckers make THAT kind of money in their lifetime!<br>\r\nHeck, once every week at night during vacation he'd say he was gonna go off to see some 'associates' of his. You dont know who these 'associates' are and he wont tell you anything about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night he left to see those associates, you got bored. You had trouble sleeping and there wasnt anything on tv that peeked your interest. And since you forgot to bring your DS with you this summer, you had to resort to the last remaining option to seek entertainment: going outside.<br>\r\nYou stepped outside and locked the door before heading up a hill to cool down and gaze at the scenery. You didnt stray too far from the summer home cuz you were aware of the wild pokemon that come out this late and you didnt have a pokemon of your own to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was peaceful and relaxing. The stars lit up the night much clearer than back home. You could make out that little town in the distance with little little lit up houses that looked like fireflies.<br>\r\nThen just a couple yards away, you make out something real shiny and blue lying on the ground. Whatever it was, it shined awful bright in the darkness. Curiosity got the better of you and you walked over to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you got closer to it, thinking you might have an idea what it is and is stunned with disbelief. Could it really be what you think it is? You almost gasped as the vision of it got more and more clearer!<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped and your unbelievable guess was wrong! It's a gemstone! An actual raw gemstone as big as your hand! A couple more gasps later, you scoop it up off the ground and stare at it with awe and amaze! The little gemstone was bright and beautiful. With a good careful carving, it'd make some nice jewelry. Is it valuable? Is it worth something? Is it a rather convincing fake? You'll find out tomorrow morning when you take it to an appraiser. As soon as you stashed it in your pocket, you saw ANOTHER bright shiny blue object a little ways away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sure enough, that was a gemstone, too! Just as bright, just as beautiful. You stash that away too. And then you see ANOTHER bright shiny blue gemstone! Hate for it to go to waste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you were already far past the safe zone from wild pokemon attacks, but those gemstones were too tempting to pass up! Before you could even realize how lost you just made yourself, you turned your full attention to the rock on the ground with several little blue gemstones sticking out of it. You were obligated to pick it up!<br>\r\nIt was a rather odd looking rock. It had what looked like a puffy white collar. It felt all rubber-like when you poked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two bright blue eyes opened from the rock and peered up at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you flinched and dropped the rock creature on the ground! It's eyes still gazed up at you from the dirt. It wasnt a rock! A pokemon, perhaps? A friendly reminder that you strayed too far from the safe zone!<br>\r\nNot wanting to spook it cuz you had no idea what kind of attacks it was capable of, you slowly backed away from it. You didnt notice the hole behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAA!!\" you screamed as you fell and then tumbled down a dark sloping rocky tunnel. You rolled down it for a minute before you stopped with your face in the dirt! Now your lost, out of the safe zone, and in a dark creepy tunnel. But on the plus side, you werent alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, you had PLENTY of company! Lifting your head from the dirt, you see dozens of bright blue eyes gazing your direction. Each one of them looked like that rock pokemon you picked up earlier! Now youre lost, out of the safe zone, in a dark creepy tunnel, in the middle of a nesting ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did notice the alpha gemstone rock pokemon that stuck out above the rest who gazed at you with big shiny red eyes!<br>\r\nA grey feminine looking pokemon with what looked to be a headdress consisting of pink crystals and a pink diamond-cut in the center and wearing a white dress and a pink diamond necklace while her bottom half consisted completely of rock and raw pink gemstone! She seemed to be one of the more blingin' pokemon you've ever laid eyes on. Whatever that thing was she had on her head alone could probably buy you your own summer home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreed subsiding, you were heavily outnumbered by wild feral gemstone pokemon staring intently at you. You just tumbled down into their turf and they dont seem like theyre used to visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo options come to mind for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to communicate with them, hopefully assure to them you mean no harm and hope that they wont brutally attack you and stain their bright beautiful gems with their blood!<br>\r\nOr you could run. Surely you can outrun a bunch of living rocks, right?</span></div></div>",

So, in an attempt to clear the air between you before things soured, you nervously introduced yourself to the pokemon, going as far as to bow to what was probably pokemon royalty before you. In a continued show of faith, you pulled out the gemstones you had stashed in your pocket and showed them off to the pokemon, explaining that you just so happened to find them along the trail you were walking along and that you mistook one of them for more gemstones before accidentally stumbling down into their den. That was how you found yourself in their cave, and since the gemstones seemed to lead up to their cave you assumed that they belonged to the pokemon; as much as it pained you, you left the gemstones on the ground and announced your intent to leave the pokemon be. Before you could make your way out of the cave, the pink \"princess\" pokemon had stopped you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"Do you really wish to leave?\"</i></span> came a feminine voice that had to be from the \"princess\". <span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"Clearly you had planned to make use of the gemstones you have collected. Do you truly intend to leave them here like this?\"</i></span> You told her that the stones were likely theirs and you had no real right to take the stones from them. Again, before you leave, the pokemon had kept you from doing so, this time apparently giggling at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cppink\">\"My, but you are a gentleman,\"</span></i> the pokemon said. <span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"So, I have decided to let you keep them for whatever it is you wish to do with them. How does that sound?\"</i></span> You were confused as to why the pokemon would let you leave with such priceless gemstones, but just as you were about to bend down and make good on the pokemon's offer she spoke again. <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"I had almost forgotten, but I shall allow you to keep the gemstones and leave\u2026on one condition.\"</span></i> The pokemon had closed the distance between you and took her place levitating above your head. <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"You see, recently we have had predators accosting our kind in the night, and truth be told we had placed those gemstones leading toward our nesting ground in an attempt to lure out these fiends.\"</span></i> So that explained the gemstones leading you directly to this cave, but why would the pokemon want to lure anyone to their den? You voiced this to the \"princess\", and that was when you regretted asking her. Her eyes took on a hard look before she held her hand up high, and in an instant a brilliant pink sword materialized in her hand. Then she created a crude sculpture of a human bust out of the ground below, levitating it up to her before she tore through the sculpture's neck with her sword. Several of the other pokemon nearby then fired out light towards the fallen sculpture, encasing it in a hard diamond-like structure, and then the \"princess\" pokemon forced the diamond underground, burying it out of sight likely forever. You were super grateful that you decided to stay and explained yourself instead of running off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cppink\">\"I believe we can take on a fair amount of potential fiends looking to sell us off for a high price,\"</span></i> the pokemon spoke, <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"but if knowledge of our grounds became common knowledge among your people it would be much more difficult for us to defend ourselves, and so I ask you that you keep your silence regarding our home. Then, you may be allowed to leave with the gemstones.\"</span></i> It was a no-brainer that you would keep the location of the pokemon's cave a secret. That did beg another question though; you found the gemstones suspiciously close to where your summer home was located. While you didn't want to jump to any bad conclusions, there was a reason that the gemstones were placed so close to where your summer home was, and whatever that reason was you weren't sure you wanted to find out what it was. Either way, you promised the pokemon that your lips were sealed on the matter of her kind's nesting grounds. Hearing this made the \"princess\" smile bright, graciously giving you a curtsy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cppink\">\"I am ever so grateful,\"</span></i> the pokemon said. <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"With this cleared up between us all, I suppose this is where you return home is it not? I bid you a pleasant night sir.\"</span></i> You bowed in kind and finally made your way out of the cave; it was a bit of a steep climb but nothing impossible. On your way out of it you saw the small pokemon you had ran into on its way into the cave in a hurry. It didn't even seem to notice you, but oh well. Once you were out of the cave, you finally decided on how you were going to get home considering that you had effectively gotten lost, but to your surprise you found another trail of gemstones seemingly leading out of the forest you were in. Tempted beyond belief but restraining yourself, you merely followed the gemstones until you finally found yourself out of the forest. You saw this as the pokemon \"princess's\" way of getting you back home safely, and you silently thanked her. After some time walking along the trail you found your old man waiting for you right outside the front door of your summer home; he asked where you were of course, and you merely told him that you had taken a nightly stroll. While he did chastise you for straying a ways away from the house, he did pat you on the back for taking a stroll out in nature instead of burying your nose in a video game all day. Afterward the two of you went inside to your separate rooms and went to sleep, but you stayed up a little longer with that pokemon \"princess\" in your head. She was nice and understanding of you, and she was pretty too. Granted, she also had a scary side as with what she intended to do once she caught the one selling off her kind. Still, as long as she got justice you didn't mind it all too much, and with that you finally drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day was largely uneventful, aside of waking up from a saucy dream involving you and the pokemon \"princess\" for some reason, but all in all the day passed by in relative peace and quiet. You had also taken a stroll to see if the pokemon had left more gemstones for suckers to come by but the area you were in was barren of them, so you returned home for the day. Before nightfall your father had left again to do more of his trucking business, and while you didn't really believe he made so much money off of trucking you didn't bother to press him any more on it. With nothing else to do you merely stood outside of your summer home just taking in the surrounding nature. All was good and quiet, at least until you noticed something odd. Not too far off from the house was the same kind of gemstone that you had collected the previous night. When you went over to investigate, you found yet another trail of gemstones leading deeper into the forest, the same one you found yourself lost in last night, albeit more spread out to not look so much like a deliberate trail. You followed them in and, just like you hoped it wouldn't, found yourself right outside of the pokemon's cave. A few unpleasant thoughts crossed your mind, and you remembered what the \"princess\" had said she intended to do to the night-owl perpetrators kidnapping her kind, and with your father disappearing for the evening again along with the fact that the gemstones were eerily close to your summer home unlike last night, the implications were disturbing to say the least\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Despite this, you made some effort of communicating your plan of leave to let the pokemon be in peace as you returned back home. After taking a few cautious steps, however, the pokemon in white held her hands together in a prayer-like gesture, and before long the entirety of the cave was alight with magical dazzle. However, the squares that now decorated the cave were a familiar shade of blue on the walls and ceilings and pink on the floor. Soon afterward, to your horror, you realize exactly what move this was: Trick Room. If you had a chance of escaping from the pokemon it was gone now; in a matter of seconds all of the other pokemon have surrounded you in speeds you didn't think possible for them, cutting off your escape completely. In short, in your wonder over the magic the pink diamond pokemon displayed, you were now trapped in the middle of numerous pokemon, and from their glittering eyes and gemstones you knew that the next few moments of your life could be your last.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cppink\">\"Human\u2026\"</span></i> came a stern, feminine voice\u2014no doubt from the apparent \"princess\" of the pokemon. Said \"princess\" levitated her way over to you, and while her big and bright eyes of red and rose would normally be inviting and friendly, they were anything but as she looked your form over, eventually catching sight of the gemstones you had collected on your way there. Almost immediately her eyes turned cold when they met with yours again, and then she held her hand up high. Drawing energy from the surrounding air, she was then holding a bright pink sword in her hand in the next instant, and before you could even react she slashed at you in a blinding flurry\u2014or rather at your pants. They fell uselessly to the ground in shreds, and out fell the gemstones you had been collecting. You could hear the gasps of the other pokemon surrounding you, and before long their eyes went hostile and their gems began to glow a ghastly blue as they glared daggers at you. Of course, their princess was also holding the blade of her sword up near your neck; one wrong move and she'd have your head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"You have defiled the sanctity of our home by trespassing upon our nesting grounds in your greed for riches\u2026\"</i></span> you could hear her say in your head. <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"This is a grave transgression that I cannot abide.\"</span></i> Desperate, you tried explaining to this pokemon that it was never in your intention to wander into her den\u2014you were honestly just taking a stroll and happened to see the gemstones that were now on the ground, merely collecting them and planning to take them home with you. For a moment, it almost seemed as though this pokemon believed you, but just when you thought things were looking up, another pokemon came in from the outside. It was likely the same one you had dropped in shock upon finding out what it really was, and everyone's attention was drawn to it as it squeaked out some pokemon speak you couldn't understand. Whatever it was that it said, it didn't sound good because everyone's attention was back on you, and if you didn't think your life was at any more risk the pokemon surrounding you were now explicitly charging up some sort of attack. The princess now had the tip of your blade pressing at your throat; with your ruined pants around your ankles and hands up in the air, you had no real way to defend yourself now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"It seems that your true character has been revealed,\"</i></span> the pokemon princess hissed. <span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"You had attempted to abscond with one of our kind in tow in your bid to attain riches.\"</i></span> You tried to argue otherwise but felt the blade press against your throat to the point you thought the pokemon would pierce it if she went any further. <span class=\"cppink\"><i>\"Do <b>not</b> lie to me. I saw the way you looked at me when you arrived\u2014at the diamond encrusted upon my brow.\"</i></span> Inwardly you cursed yourself for looking at the pokemon that way earlier because now it was coming back to bite you in the ass. <i><span class=\"cppink\">\"You are just like the last humans who had come into our grounds to sell our kind\u2014A <b>lying</b>. <b>Kidnapping</b>. <b>Enslaver</b>\u2014and just like them you will face judgment as I shall now send you to Arceus. Have you any final words you wish to say?\"</span></i> With so little time left on the clock and scared out of your mind that you were dealing with a pokemon intent on killing you, you quickly ran over what cards you had left to play\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Threatening a potential mythical pokemon will no doubt end the way you imagine it would (or even WORSE than you would imagine, most likely!). And trying to make a trade your newly found gemstones in exchange for your life is pointless, considering she could just kill you and take the stones anyways! If you wanted to survive the wrath of a possible high-leveled but intelligent pokemon of assumed royalty that had a blade to your neck, you knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, your majesty!!\" you stumble as you address her by royalty, \"please spare my life! I'll offer you fealty in exchange!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie?\u201d she literally spouted out loud in a surprised and awfully cutesy tone of voice which did not match the voice you heard in your mind! Not that it mattered at the moment, cuz you were too spooked out when the  first word you heard her say was 'Die'! You remind yourself that she's a pokemon and is probably just muttering part of her name like all the others and she's not actually telling you to die! You hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes, it'd be a tremendous waste to kill me!\u201d you bargain, \u201cthere is so much I can offer you as your servant\u2026 your majesty.\u201d She said nothing, but tilted her head as the other rock monsters gazed at you unblinkingly.<br>\r\nTo SHOW your loyalty, as soon as she lowered the blade from your throat, you get down on your knees and bow to her.<br>\r\n\u201cMy beloved princess, I beg of you to grant me a second chance at life. And I shall be indebted to you as your loyal most trustworthy servant! Though I am not worthy of your grace, it will be an absolute honor to serve you, my liege!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your facade going despite the tense, possibly distrusting stares from the glowing-eyed rock monsters all around you. Perhaps they knew you were full of it, but the ultimate decision rested on their well-armed diamond-studded princess. Through the corner of your eye, you can spot a look of curiousness as if she was honestly considering your offer. You hoped she couldnt hear the distant thoughts in the back of your mind of escaping her as soon as you get the opportunity, but even if she did, it didnt matter. Because she had something else on her mind regarding this offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Wait a moment,\"</span> you heard her dainty and profound voice in your mind again, <span class=\"cpink\">\"this offer of servitude... <b>from one species to another...</b></span>\" you didnt like hearing THAT part, <span class=\"cpink\">\"could this be a similar if not exact circumstance to that of the enslavers?\"</span> You figured out pretty fast what she's getting at, but she had to solidify it. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Instead of one of my kind being captured by one of yours...</span>\" She points to herself, <span class=\"cpink\">\"It would be ME...\"</span> then she points to you <span class=\"cpink\">\"capturing YOU?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I'm not sure about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she wasnt asking YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I believe that is indeed the case!\"</span> you heard another voice reply in your mind, most likely coming from one of her close rocky minions, <span class=\"clteal\">\"well done, Princess! You have just captured a wild Human!\"</span>. Oh boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diaaan!!\" she let out a high-pitched squeal of delight while the elegant voice in your head shouted <span class=\"cpink\">\"Hooray!\"</span> Quite a silly turn of events, but it wasnt over yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Wait a minute, princess!\"</span> you heard another voice interject, coming from another close minion, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"the capturing ritual is still not complete!\"</span> She turns to him as he explains. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"To officially capture him, youre required to throw one of those sacred orbs the enslavers carry to properly ensnare him.\"</span> Ah of course. She doesnt have a pokeball to catch you! ...Er, those things cant ensnare humans, can they?<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I see. That is indeed a shame.\"</span> her dainty voice sighs while outside, she lets out a pout of disappointment and frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Do not fret, my lady!\"</span> said another voice from another minion, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"we managed to find one of those sacred orbs an enslaver dropped as he fled! Here!\"</span> It actually had a pokeball! She beamed with delight as her minion handed her the ball. You felt very nervous and uncomfortable as she eyed the ball with intrigue. You wanted to tell her that it doesnt work that way (at least you hoped it didnt!), but you knew better and didnt want her to change her mind and decide to kill you again! For your own good, it was best to just play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"How does this sacred orb work?\"</span> she asks, eyeing the pokeball carefully.<br>\r\n\"I think you just push the button on it and throw it at me,\" you assumed, \"at least, that's how I seen it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as you said, she presses the button and she and her minions jump and gasp on reflex when the ball expands. After that, the princess maintains her composure and stares you right in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Alright, human,\"</span> you hear her speak to you, <span class=\"cpink\">\"are you prepared to enter into my beloved kingdom? To pledge your loyalty to my crown and it's citizens? To serve and obey the will of your new Matriarch for the rest of your life?\"</span><br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and nodded, \"I am, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a nod, she raised her arm back and with one hard swing and shout of \"YANCIIIIEE!!!\", she hurled that pokeball at you!</span></div></div>",

You imagined an ursaring, rearing up its body with its claws high into the air, and channeling that ursaring into you did you stand up boldly and let out what you thought was your most impressive \"roar\". Against all odds, it looked like it actually worked; the Pokemon who were poised to attack you were refraining from doing so, opting to watch your next closely. Keeping up with the theatrics, you continued the display as you tried to slowly shuffle back toward the exit of the cave. Just a little more and you were home free\u2014! And then, almost as if the powers that be were cursing you for your stupidity, you ended up stepping on your own fucking shoelace, and with your tattered pants still at your ankles you promptly fell forward and landed your face right into the ground. You were almost certain that you might have broke your nose the rocky floor, and just like that your little show of intimidation was cut stupid short. Slowly, you rolled yourself over bemoaning how dumb you were\u2014clutching your bleeding nose and continuing to curse yourself. Here you were, pants at your ankles and totally defenseless\u2014it would be all too easy for the \"princess\" to finish you off now, yet a few seconds in and you hadn't heard anything from the pokemon. Chancing a glance up at your soon-to-be captors, you could see that they all had ceased their attack completely, and while the \"princess\" still had her sword in hand she was currently staring at you with the most disbelieving stare a pokemon could muster.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh, Arceus help me,\"</span> the pokemon's voice rang out in your head. <span class=\"cppink\">\"You cannot possibly be this incompetent and weak.\"</span> The words surely riled you up and you were about to tell the pokemon off\u2014if only you hadn't stood so fast and not set your balance correctly, falling flat on your ass for your efforts. You felt a particularly hard rock nearly shove itself up your ass very literally upon your fall, doing your best (and inevitably failing) to suppress a most undignified whimper. Losing whatever strength you had, you just fell over and curled up on your side, too weak to try nursing your wounds and more interested in crying miserably on the ground and hoping that the powers that be take pity on you and end you to spare you further humiliation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\">\"Pitiful\u2026\"</span> the pokemon \"princess\" lamented. <span class=\"cppink\">\"Perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment; you are clearly no threat to our kind\u2014least of all in the pitiable state you are in now.\"</span> Well that was certainly comforting but also kind of annoying to hear nonetheless. You took a few minutes to yourself to sulk, at least until you thought you were fine enough to stand and walk on your own again. No more in any mood to continue conversation with the \"princess\" you made your intentions as clear as can be and finished it off with saying that you just wanted to forget that any of this ever happened and go on about your life. Before you tripped over yourself again, you took off the pants around your ankles, and before you were making your way out of the cave you told the pokemon that if anyone asked that you'll claim that whatever pokemon lived around in the forest let you off easy. Turning back around and skulking your way out of the cave, you didn't notice that a giant pink diamond that wasn't there before was now blocking your way out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cppink\">\"I think not,\"</span> the pokemon spoke to you. <span class=\"cppink\">\"We are being hunted by poachers who wish to sell off our kind for material riches, and given how easily you seem to bruise if anyone were to threaten you about our whereabouts\u2026you <i>will</i> squeal like a Mankey if pressed for information. For now, it is in our best interest to detain you here with us. Or do you object?\"</span> The sword in the \"princess's\" hand had never left, and noticing how she had tightly gripped it made you think twice about immediately rebuffing her. Still, if you were not home in time when your father returned, you would quickly be reported a missing person and the authorities would tear up the whole of the forest searching for you. If the \"princess\" intended on keeping you, it would be better to notify others first, but something told you that this was no mere \"detaining\"\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Against common sense and by yourself without any protection, you told your friends you'd be back in a while and you naively left the safety and security of the resort to go catch a Zoroark on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou treked awful deeper in the unknown woods than you shouldve searching in vain for a Zoroark. You paced around quite a while, but still no sighting. All the while, you had the strangest feeling you were being watched. You couldve sworn you caught a glimpse of a twinkling feral slanted blue eye peeking through the bushes, but you shrugged it off and kept searching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed. Night falls. The battery in your smart phone which doubled as your GPS had long died. You were lost. You just started your damn vacation and already it's come to THIS! You rummaged through the woods searching for the way back, but lost count of the number of times you passed by the same bush, same shallow creek, same collapsed tree, same Snorlax sleeping awful peacefully in the middle of a lake. You didnt even know which direction was north anymore. Even after climbing a tree and scanning out in the distance, you couldnt see the resort anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it! Damn it! Damn it!\u201d you constantly tell yourself while smacking your head with your phone. You paced around aimlessly trying not to flip out, but you mentally nag to yourself about how you shouldnt have done what you did.  You knew it was a bad idea! You knew you shoulda brought one of your friends along. Sure they'd be annoyed at you for wasting so much time playing your stupid game, but it beats THIS scenario by a long shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO?!\u201d you finally resort to shouting for help, \u201cANYBODY HERE? ANYBODY?\u201d Sadly, your shouts dont even succeed in  \u201cHELLO?! HELLO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..Zor?\u201d Your prayers were answered. In the blink of an eye, help had already appeared before you and you got a nice look at your brand new friend. This girl looked about your age... with long slightly spikey red hair wrapped in a long pony tail thanks to a blue bead, a black tattered shirt that was too short to cover her belly-button, a short equally tattered black skirt, red makeup around her eyes and the ends of her lips, and big blue eyes that had a feral twinkle in them as she stared your direction with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont remember seeing a girl like her back at the resort. Maybe she's one of the native girls of this island. Is there a tribal area nearby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" you raised your hand and politely greeted her. She merely tilted her head a little and kept staring at you. Well, she SEEMS nice. Maybe nice enough to help you find your way back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" you say to her, \"I'm a little lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaaa...?\" she replied in a questionable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at your feet as she walked a little closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could help me find my way back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeel....p? Baa...ck?\" she thoroughly pronounced those words as she stared at you oddly. Maybe she doesnt speak English. Guess this was gonna be a lot harder than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M...\" you pointed to yourself, \"LOST...\" You shrugged your arms and shook your head. \"YOU...\" you pointed to her. \"HELP me,\" you swayed your arms toward yourself and patted your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heellllp... ME....\" she slowly repeated what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE,\" you cupped your arms in a begging expression, \"HELP ME... find HOME. HOME...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoooome... hooome. Home!\" she repeated with excitement, \"Find home! Find Home!\" Hm, did something click?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" you nodded and smiled, \"Can you please help me?\"<br>\r\n\"Find home!\" the girl smile and nodded, \"Find home!\" And in a quick unpredictable instant, she ran toward you! No, she CHARGED at you! You had less than a second to drop your smile before you tripped and fell on the ground from the surprise!<br>\r\nShe still stared down at you, smiling wide grinned. Although her smile looked cute, the pointed fangs in the middle of her pearly white teeth were kinda intimidating.<br>\r\n\"W-What are you doi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find home! Home!!\" then out of the blue, she grabbed your foot and literally starting DRAGGING you with her! Besides the fact that she was pretty strong, just casually dragging you by your foot like that... that's an awful weird reaction even from a native islander!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you doing?\" you questioned her. She didnt answer. Instead, she continued dragging and sang, \"Find home! Find home! Find home!\" on the way! Did you say her favorite words of the day or something? Whatever she was doing, she was in an awful rush to do it!<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait!\" you pleaded, \"where are you taking me?!\"<br>\r\nShe finally stopped in her tracks, but only to look down at you and repeat, \"Find HOME!\" She even winked when she said that! As you pondered the meaning behind that statement, she resumed dragging you off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was possibly the strangest night you've had in a long time. You've gotten yourself lost in the woods looking for video game dlc and abducted by a native girl who doesnt seem to speak english yet is fine repeating it! Especially the words 'find home'. Maybe she's taking you home. Maybe to HER home. While youre curious to find out where she lives, you probably should be getting back to YOUR vacation home before your friends start to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, this'll probably be the most fun you'll have on this vacation. Hooking up with one of the native girls would be a fitting end to this adventure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....Then AGAIN, why does her shadow look completely different?</span></div></div>",

My dream are tormented by my own regret, or maybe my inaction. I know that i could have stopped this, but in truth, i didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't!\" <b>Crash</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop Dammit! Not the vase, not the vase!\"  <b>Trum</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell with this! Rick, in here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats my cue, since that night, no one touch Kira, my Espeon, my beautiful Espeon. Life taste bitter these days, perhaps it's just me. I must get over this, i Know. My eyes open and my head clear itself while the light of the Pokemon center blind me for a moment. Deciding that self reminiscence wouldn't be helpful now, i get up and start walking at a leisure peace towards the back door, you know, those doors. A soon as i got close i hear the soft hissing of the pressure, circle in the air tubes pushing the door open, what a lazy bastard i must be, i don't even open my own doors these days. Still at my pace i walk thought the internal withe, stained corridor of the center, until i reach a door marked as \"Check Room\". Usually soft growling and pleasured purr could be heard from here. Now angry hissing and what i only can hear, a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"Stay back you miserable human!\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we go. Slightly pushing the door open, i realize that maybe i am not as lazy as i have thoughts, and the scene from my mind, my torment, appear before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira my beautiful Espeon is on the examination table, on all fours, staring at the nurse with venom in her normally delicate eyes. I can feel her anger, and her unpleasantness at being here. The nurse kinetically pushed away, try uselessly to gain ground toward Kira, desperation and tiredness in her feature. Time seems frozen, in this surreal scene, then finally i speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"Master! Bring me away, i don't need this, this checkup! I am fine!\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop for a moment, breath in, breath out, then with a condescending tone \"Kira, i have already told you, your check are mandatory, i must know that you are healthy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"But i don't need them! Only you master, only you may touch me\"</u> The she purposely add <u>In <b>ANY</b> way you want, Master\"</u> With this, always with this, she start purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite our talk, Kira is strong enough to keep the nurse pinned near the wall, stained, with what. Decency, arrogance, ignorance. Yes. This milky white walls are stained with this, and more. The worst of all sin, hypocrisy, pride. Hard to say if it's mine, if it was mine, or still is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith firm, strong voice i add \"Release her Kira, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrr \"<u>Yes master!</u>\" The kinetic field collapse harmlessly to the ground, bringing the nurse with it, Kira your humor is appreciated, most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes she is my torment, my joy, my damnation and my redemption. I love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized this too late however. I have raised my Kira since she was an Eevee, watch she transform to my beauty now before me, i have felt her prodding, in my feeling, in my emotions, than i accepted what was already know to me, witch i have always denied. I like Pokemon, yes, but i love my Kira.<br>\r\nEverything changed, subterfuge gone, advances, never refused, all only for That Day, the night when i took my Kira for the first time, the night when we become mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry nurse, perhaps another time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf, sure Rick, but mind explaining to me what happened to her? She was never this aggressive\" You said that to me? How wonderful, very acute from you o mistress of..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Master! Let's go, i want you, all for myself</u>\" purrrrrrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puberty?\" My answer seems logical enough, and it's also part of my torment, i am 16 and i have a life-mate, an insatiable one, both for my presence and for my body. Or at least a part of it. I Know that she loves me, my mind as well, what I am, or maybe she just love the one who raised her, and she find \"logical\", not being her father, to love me. My torment, once again as i look those beautiful eyes, i could have stopped it, but i didn't want to. I wanted her. I want her. I WILL have her, as much as i desire. She will oppose no resistance, why? Because she loves me. Because i love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Kira\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Yes Master! I am yours!</u>\" She heard me, of course. This is my torment. She is mine, because <b>I</b> Wanted her, desired her, and so i got her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can only hope, in my redemption. As we left the white stained corridor of the center, i can only think of my desire, that she really love me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>I always will Master!</u>\" I exhale softly as we come near our home. As soon i come near the door, it start moving on it's on, the latch come undone, the lock click repeatedly in their holes, the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Where are home Master! Do you wish to have me? Master?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exhale again, and answer truthfully \"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Kira, my beautiful Kira, walk in with me and close the door behind her, locking it once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Yes Master?</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't i told you to call me Rick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Of course you have Master, 24 times</u>\" I start getting angry, is she mocking me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>But then</u>\" she start coming closer to me, with those eyes, the one i want. purrrrrrrrrr  \"<u>You always love when i scream, Master. Yes?</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>I am yours, to do as you please, i love you</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrrr With this she go to the bathroom to \"clean up\", i know sounds strange but she always want to give herself a good cleaning before bed. Maybe i will be lucky and i can tire her enough for avoid our activities tonight. It's not that i don't want her, it's just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to think more on this. With my little introspection over, i strengthen my will, and go towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop in the middle of the room, revelation. I need to remember what happened that night. Yes it's the only way.  </span></div></div>",

I let the noise fade, the feelings of my body slowly disappear, and my memory resurface from the depths of my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, come the dinner is ready!\" Well i thought, her chow and my pasta anyway. I should learn to cook better. I had eat enough pasta and pizza for a lifetime by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Coming!</u>\" What she is doing upstairs? I thought she was in the garden, oh well, matters not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Kira coming down the stairs in a hurry, and a few moments later, appear before my eyes. Kira evolved the last week, she was sooooo happy, and i am too, finally she has become what she has always dreamt to be, an Espeon, my beautiful Espeon. Yes there is pride in the tone you hear this all about, i am prideful of my little Kira, she as trained hard and now reaps the fruits of all her hard work. I still remember the blinding light, just after i congratulate her on her new move: Trump Card. With this we will be able to give a nasty surprise to our next opponent. Ha, they think that Eevee is weak? We'll see now who really deserve the prize. Yes i was and still am a little possessive, both of my Pokemon and of my score, my battle score of course. When i saw her evolve, i was elated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Master? Are you alright?</u>\" i am broken from my (second) daydream, and looking at Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh? A of course, i was remembering your evolution, i am so happy for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrrr \"<u>Thank you kindly, master, but i know you like it as well...</u>\" purrrrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken y surprise for a moment, did she...nah, it's must be my imagination, i haven't sleep particularly well this last week, perhaps i am just a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course Kira, you are my little pride and joy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrrr \"<u>I am just that, Master? Just your pride and joy? Not more?</u>\" purrrrr <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said that in a way that i am not sure i want to understand. She was....sensual? Nah, i must really get some shuteye, before i start seeing things. Still i reply, i reply with my first...mistake? Desire, both probably, i can't change the past, and my torment resurface once again...I wanted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course not, Kira. You are so much more for me, you are part of my life, my very existence, i was bored beyond belief before you came around, beside didn't i have already told you to call me Rick?\" I told this to her, it was true, mostly, she was not my existence but she was my pride, and as such fundamental for me. I will get over this, i really love her, just like you love your close friends of course. But she continued purring, and staring at me, i felt something i my skull, like a pin but immediately, vanish like the morning breeze, you know it's was there, but you are to lazy to check. Like the other times she just look at me, not answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kira, let's eat!\"<br>\r\npurrrr \"<u>Of course, Master</u>\" Here we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore her, she is quite playful anyway, i know she like teasing me for, well, anything really, she has always been this way.<br>\r\nI drop my kiss the cook apron on the dishwasher, than proceed to seat in from my dinner. Kira sat near me as always, seated on a chair, hight enough for her. I have always thought that your pokemon deserve at least some respect, no? Her eyes are fixed on me for a moment, then she smile and start dig in. A little awkward, to be sure, her knowing smile is somewhat unsettling since she evolved, damn my lack of sleep, I'll go to bed early tonight, i need the rest.<br>\r\nAs soon as i thought this, Kira start purring yet again. She must like her chow, or i am just naive, naive for what? Aha it doesn't matter now, let's eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after dinner i get up to clean the dishes, Kira then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Master, i would like to get a bath now</u>\" purrrr Again the purring, is she planning something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why all these purring today Kira, what make you so happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Nothing, the usual, i just think it's enjoyable to wash with you Master</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, i remember when you was so shy as a little Eevee\" i say smiling. She smile as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>I was merely ignorant Master</u>\" Ignorant? \"<u>Come on, i want my bath!</u>\" She say playfully, than run towards the bathroom. Her joke, what she has planned this time, i was quite embarrassed when she saw me naked last time, how in the heck my towel slip i will never know, i was sure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Come on Master, i NEED you!</u>\" Playful again, with an hint...again, damn i will immediately go to bed after this, now i am hallucinating as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk towards the bathroom, and i let myself in, Kira is already in the bath, hot water already flowing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, can't you wash yourself? You can you know..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Not as well as with you Master</u>\" Again, she will ever call me Rick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Come on, it's hot and ready...</u>\" purrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Aha the bath of course, i am still a little uncomfortable with this, but ok, she already saw me, and i have definitely already saw her already, alright then. I remove my clothes, and even if i am a little reluctant, i remove my underwear as well. Kira is watching my like a predator, swishing her forked tail left and right, i ignore it, and go in.<br>\r\nWhen my tub is full, Kira can easily swim to remain afloat, and after a minute she does just that. She float towards me firsts, look me in the eye. I feel that prod again, insistent, demanding, she want something, she want to know something. I am not afraid that she can control me, it just can't happen but she can still mess me up good if she really try. After an awkward moment she smile and purr deeply, then she turn around, tail hight, nearly pushing her rear in my face. There i saw.<br>\r\nHer pussy, normally hidden beneath the fur, was clearly visible, and it was dripping slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrr \"<u>Master</u>\" her voice sensual in my mind \"<u>Do you like me,Master?</u>\" purrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am frozen, it's like i can't move, this was what she wanted to know? If i wanted to..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Yes, Master.</u>\" Slowly floating away, \"<u>I wanted to know if you love me enough... to mate with me</u>\" purrrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this she move her head toward my penis, that unsurprisingly, if what Kira has told was true, it was erect. Than she do the unthinkable, she start licking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moan, i can't restrain myself, i should stop her, really i should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice sensual \"<u>Mmmm Master, don't you want me?</u>\" She grip my penis with her paw, stroking it slowly, while sucking on the tip. Oh Arceus! She put her tail even higher, showing me everything, her tender flank, her lovely shaped read, and her aroused, slightly parted pussy just under her tight ass. \"<u>Don't you want to have me, to feel my inside, just like in the dreams, mounting me until i am full of you?</u>\" purrrrrr<br>\r\nI answer with my desire, with what we both know i want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" With this i grab her hips, and spread the lips of her pussy, looking at her inviting nethers, then still spread, i place her pussy in my month<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Ahaa, Master!</u>\" You have provoked me Kira, now i Will get what it's mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Yes! Master i am yours!</u>\" Our wash is over, i remove her from my lap, i set her on the ground, then i hastily dry myself while Kira, that now i know can read my thought, walk seductively towards the bedroom. As soon as i am done, i literally run inside, i Want her, I have Wanted her since her evolution last week, and she knew, she knew it all the time. As i walk in, i found her on the bed, on all fours with her rear pointed at me, she must really want this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Master, claim Me!

While my inner thoughts are still a secret to her, all my surface one can be easily read, i can try to put up a barrier using my will, but she immediately ask: Why? She do not understand that i still want my privacy, she still Doesn't understand that what have we done should have required more than just willingness. My desire put me in this situation, and i am still not convinced that my lust isn't responsible for everything that has happened that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i decide to put this strays ideas to rest, at least for now, my instinctual mental barrier flare up, something strong, powerful is trying to speak to me, something dark, distant, desperate. I put my hand on my head, it's like my brain is going on fire! Pain surge from within, then suddenly, the presence lessen his attack, relief slowly return to me, i feel incredibly tired, and i am aware that i am wobbling, mi vision is blurred, my eyelids heavy, whats happening?.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Master! Are you alright? I cant feel you, whats going on?!</i>\" I want to answer her but i can't, my body heat leave me and a strange coolness take it's place, all my sensory perception is shutting down, i feel like i am dying. I desperately try to use my hand to grab on something, anything, but my coordination is unresponsive as the rest of my body, then i can't stay up anymore, i fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Master! Pl a e! M s er! Ma   r!</i>\" Darkness swallows me whole, this is my punishment? This is the price i must pay? No redemption, no second chance, only the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am floating. I am nowhere. Bubble of indescribable paste like material seems to cling to me like a swarm of hungry locust. I don't feel pain, i don't feel anything. I can think, but i am empty. I can move but i have no body. My very essence has been extracted from my shell, and brought here. I am not afraid, i have no reason to, why? Could any torment release me from my sin? I have conditioned my pokemon, my Kira, my love. I have <u>convinced</u> her that giving herself to me physically, was the next step in our relationship, but what kind of relation is based on lust, anger and desire? Not a good one, not Love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy self imposed chastisement end abruptly, when a presence, the very same that brought me here, grip my soul with a dark, tendril like claws and bring it before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my weight again, my senses return to me, my limbs let themselves be felt again, and before me an image, a projection, real as this world, appear in my sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong, deep voice, like a whisper in the dark but strong enough to make you deaf, your very ears bleed, to beg to never be used again, resonates in every fiber of this dark place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"Greetings, Rick Cullen the third, and welcome to my humble home, please take a seat, i wish to speak with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that giving you my cell number won't suffice. Great, with my senses my wits returned as well, i am tempted to see it's reaction if i<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"Do not worry, you are not dead, not yet, i just want to...clear, some of your doubts about the very reason of your presence here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good \"What do you mean by saying, not yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"As i have said, do not worry, death come for all but a few, and in fact, this is one of the arguments of which I would like discuss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know only few that can even think of \"Discuss about death, or about end\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"You are, as i have hoped, very perceptive. Death and the end, are not the same thing, many do not realize what this phrase mean, perhaps you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not a fool \"Of course not, i may be arrogant enough to be convinced of the verity behind my action, but i am not foolish enough to think that My action and My emotion are always my own, nor i think that they are mine beyond the basic meaning of such words. No, anyone who believe differently bring the weight of the world on his own shoulder, alas not our action, or belief, are ours by right, many are imposed by moral, society, form and the most important of all, hypocrisy. Believing that my action are only my own, is like thinking that the universe respond only to me, only to my belief. Nonsense\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"A curios, but not far from the truth statement, tell me Rick Cullen the third, how do You judge yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it try to put my things in prospective? \"In doubt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"Of what? Your innocence or about your guiltiness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm i tested? \"Neither, i am not innocent as i am not guilty, i am just myself, and my action. I do not need to justify them, just accept them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA murmur, a pleased one? [Form] \"In the end, your punishment is clear, acceptance, quite the heavy sentence you brought upon yourself. Many just think that they have done something wrong, but do not really understand how, or why, nor question it, only escape or punishment. How limited they are. To accept your action, is to try to understand both the event and the reason that triggered it, anything else is just empty rhetoric about <u>justice</u>. Like a mere mortal can know something about it. How could You judge someone based on proof that do not explain the how, or why. Like those fools at the church, reading an empty withe book, filled with dark lies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church of creation? \"The church is a lie then? Their fanaticism a mere illusion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark, deep heavy chuckle resonate with you, resonate with this whole...world? [Form] \"Of course, how can They knew anything about creation, was they present? Did Arceus told them anything, or they merely guessed, saw what They wanted to see, a mere surface with little importance, shape matters not to me, nor to Arceus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doubts leave you, the truth make you feel more heavy that you thought ever being possible, not about the church, nor your guilt, but your blindness, toward Kira, and toward yourself, finally you see. Acceptance brought you the redemption and the answer that had eluded you since that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am guilty of having <u>conditioned</u> my Kira? Yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo i deserve punishment for it? No, i wanted her as she wanted me. What happened was nothing more than acceptance, a recognition of our Want and Volition. Nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"You understand now? Only your lack of acceptance was punishing you, not me, not Arceus, nor Kira\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forced her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother chuckle, this time stronger resonate in me [Form] \"Forced? How? She wanted you since the very beginning, since the day she choose her final form. You binded her true essence, the very moment you decided to bring her home. It was inevitable, other <u>trainers</u>\" it say the word with spite \"think that it's <u>unnatural</u>, like love could ever be unnatural, stupid yes, but never wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamned, this word echo in my mind, Damned. Now i know for sure, this form is the ever damned, the ever banished \"Giratina, will you give me the honor of showing you real form to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Form] \"You took your time to ask, a was curios if you have the strength of hearth to ask me that very question\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe form slowly take shape<br>\r\n[Form] \"And the answer\" The form solidify and finally Her real appearance stand before you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice become nearly melodious, even if it's still pretty deep, and it's still resonate withing you, fear is replaced by a strange belonging, and even...attraction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Giratina] \"Let me greet you once more. Welcome, Rick Cullen, welcome to the distortion world, the limbo of the dead, the very ship that deal with the soul of the departed, until their time come\" Their time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Giratina] \"Time for redemption, or punishment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings to you ferr, no.

A smile that would send running away the bravest of warrior, but just entice you to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Giratina] \"It's not missing, it's belonging, the very reason why i am trapped here, banished from the light of world. Do not worry, Rick, i will explain everything in due time, both your presence here, and your feeling, although your propose you must find yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to feel light, empty, i am returning, awakening<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Giratina] \"I am truly sorry, for the method i used to bring you here, i promise that next time it will be more pleasant. Goodbye, Rick, i am not death, but i still will prevent your demise, should the unthinkable happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight, it blind me. Heat, my body, my hearth it's still beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Giratina] \"Return now, and love Kira as you should, and when ready..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness, constant beeping noise, a weight on my stomach; soft firm fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight, a voice, revival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esp!\" \"<i>Master! you are alive!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

I try to lift my right arm, and while i see it responding, the numbness that still pervade me interfere my coordination, resulting in slamming what seems to be a severed piece of flash straight in my head. Perhaps it's for the best, feeling this would have been unpleasant. The slapping noise however seems to have restarted my sensitivity and, with my coordination slowly returning, i try to shield my still unfocused eyes to the horror that this limbo of color is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head hurts, my limbs feel heavy and i think that the law about limiting Rhydon population is definitely underrated, damn it, wasn't those bastard herbivore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esp! Espeon!\" Kira, please lower it, my head feel like it's has been used as a knocker for a war drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon! Esp!\" Ouch, Kira why,....why i can't hear you? Where am i?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later my internal logic seems to have awakened from it's dark slumber, and i feel the impediment of reasoning leave me like an heavy cloud, the mist disperse, and my eyes finally focus.

Joy, no not mine. \"Whats in tar...\" The doors are pushed wide open, and a familiar face greet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you awake, good, i was starting to think that you wanted to burden my already impossible workloads with your obituary paper\" Friendly as always, i am glad to have just lessen your fear of my imminent demise, feel free to buy me chocolate for celebrating the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice is deep, and i think that a Sandslash decide to rework some of my vocal cord, making them perfect for infra/ultra sonic resonance, sweet i could work in a seaquarium now \"Grummbsr, sht\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy, no not mine, bring her bright and light humor to the surface \"Oooooo, but thank you Rick, you heartfelt gratefulness is heartwarming, need anything? A softer bed, some orange juice, perhaps My Coffee? \" Man, her tone is so bitter that i could have used it for sweeten a dandelion soup. I get it, Bug Catcher, those weirdo go out in the middle of the nights trying to catch the biggest bugs they can find, and of course a power level 3 Caterpie isn't exactly a powerhouse, so you may try guessing what's happen when a group of this mentally unbalanced individual get out en masse, challenging...no, stroking the local fauna in the wrong way, witch for them is any; restless night are assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplying in the same tone, and pleasantly noticing that my voice can be now understood by human instead of needing a translation from a Wailord \"Why, thank you my dearest friend, 2 sugar lumps for me, and i think Kira prefer White tea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, for a moment i have really thought that a Growlithe has found it's way in, then i remind myself of Joy second name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And please, some Mago Berry for Kira, she Loves sweet flavor\"  \"Esssssp esp\" I would have swear that Kira tone was seductive in nature, i hope she hadn't just told me that sweet it's not the only flavor she like, you know what i mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growling deepens, so much that i suspect that being thrown out by the window is not a remote chance now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy exit the room, and i remain alone with my Kira. I am at disadvantage now, she has never moved since i waked up, although she has stopped treating me like her favorite  cornet, hopefully a good thing. But i can't hear her, and from the look of confusion in her face, she can't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to determine what kind of ungodly hour is, and to my surprise, only now i notice the starred sky behind my window, and the absolute silence of the center, must be quite late, how much time was i...suspended? I wait for Joy to return which she did, trying to leave me again as soon as the plate touch my stomach. \"Off! joy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dearest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened, i am serious i have felt like dying.\" Her face become serious, and so her tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know, we have tried everything, but we was unable to determine the cause \" She pause for a moment, in deep thinking \"The only clue we had, was a sort of\" she put her hands in the hair flexing two fingers, and using a deep bored tone  \"An mysterious dark wall of shadow\" she lower her hands, and recover her normal voice \"That our local Kadabra have found, she told us that that....wall...was Made of shadows, a ghost like power she has mentioned, it think, and she has said that the wall covered you memory as well, so we was unable to determine What has caused it.\" She look at Kira \"Kira here told us that you blacked out, and unable to wake you up she Teleported here screaming in my mind like and obsessed, i have never thought that teleport could do that, i mean i know that a pokemon can choose any unimpeded destination that they Can See, within limit of course, and any place they know well, but no pokemon ever teleported Inside the center, inside My Private room, Kira Never entered there, how she was able.....mphf, still, she mentioned this wall as well, but nothing we did worked, and while you seemed a little pale, your body was in a stable condition, or at least as stable an a near dead body can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind is in turmoil right now, was Giratina responsible? Probably, but this wall \"Will it go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe understand what i mean \"I don't know, kathia our Kadabra, said that the wall is slowly dispersing, so i think that in a few hours Kira will be able to speak to you again, and that your memory will return as well\" My memory? I remember everything, even a little too much if you ask me. \" My memory is intact Joy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with stupor, then \"It is? Curios, we assumed, bha, no matter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe observe the monitor with something akin to fascination \"Your biological value are a little...off, but nothing serious, i will keep you  here for the night in observation, tomorrow if the value are ok, I'll dismiss you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joy, really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile \"It's okay i never get bored with you around, good night\" She leave the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kira, how about a stroll in park tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esp! espeon esp!\" She is happy, good i have much to tell her, i just hope she will not think that i have gone nuts.

I can't think, but i can feel, just like in the distortion world, i am here but i am not. I feel a little cold, despite the weight of Kira on my chest. Will i always be in this state while asleep from now on? Time pass indefinite in this...place. But as i try to wake up, an hot, slimy feeling make way in my brain, then light.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up, from a place where dreams are a solace and a valuable bargaining chip; not even sleeping is free in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes open, and differently from last night, refocus nearly immediately, my thoughts invade my conscious once more, my perception return as well, and the pleasant fur of my still sleeping Kira, bring a smile on my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whisper to her twitching ears\"Wakey wakey sleepy head, morning as come.\" She let out a displeased grunt, her morning routine is even worse than mine, we are both quite the sleeper, and if i wasn't eager to leave this place, i would have remained in the land of dreams some more. Kira eyes slowly open, then finally I hear her voice again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: purrrrrr \"<i>Morning, Master, do you..oh, you can't hear me..</i>\" she said the last part with sadness, but i surprise her, and myself replying mentally \"<i>No Kira, i can hear of just fine</i>\" Her eyes show a surprise that borders on fear, but then her smile return and she start jumping up an down, speaking both physically and mentally<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>Master! You recovered! And i can hear you! This is so...i don't know it's glorious!</i>\" \"Esp! Espeon esp esssssp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff! Excited much? \"Calm down Kira, it's alright, i\" OFF! \"Kira stop!\" My overexcited Espeon stop using me as a jumping board, at least for now, and look at me with an happiness that transcend common emotion, she is beaming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"Master! we can finally speak, i have so much to tell you!\" We have been able to speak since the day you evolve Kira, what are you talking about? \"Speak? Didn't we have spoken every day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head \"<i>No Master! Really speak, not with just voice, but with our mind, with emotion and feeling!</i>\" She then switch to a seductive tone \"<i>And there are so much things, i want to......speak about....</i>\" purrrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember my conversation with Giratina, and i know that she is right, i must stop blaming myself for what happened, what both of us, me and my Kira has wanted to happen, and start to enjoy our relation, our affection. I gently grab her heads and bring her lips to mine, kissing her deeply, she look surprised for a moment, but then reciprocate as best she can; not being one to end our fun already, i push my tongue in her muzzle, a gesture the she return eagerly. I then decide to spice up things a little, and bringing my hand down her flank, i slightly lift her tail and start caressing her labia. \"Essssp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe try to remove her muzzle from my gentle caress, but i don't allow it, and pressing further, i both deepen the kiss and push my fingers in her snatch. \"E..ps\" Her body welcome me, from both side, she stop resisting and push back on my finger, making them slide in fully, i start to stimulate her with a slow peace, non letting her recover from this pleasurable ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove my mouth form her sweet muzzle, and speak to her \"Like my new epiphany Kira? I think that we should have enjoyed our relation more\" I push a third finger inside her, spreading her luscious now dripping snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>Ahaaa, what....yes, our relation...our love...aha!</i>\" Yes Kira our love. Suddenly i feel a presence coming near us, so i reluctantly remove my finger and push Kira down on my chest, bringing the cover on her back, hiding our little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, fast light steps could be heard from the hallway, then the double doors open, revealing a smiling and far more rested looking Joy. Yes, my too now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Morning you two, slept well?\" Can't remember much of my sleeping, but breakfast was delicious. \"Yes, thank you Joy, we are both rested and ready for tackling the day\"<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>Why Master, was i delicious to you? Can i get some salty side dish later?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira not now! \"<i>Kira, if you won't shut it i will pound that womb of yours like our first time</i>\" Kira: \"<i>Can you do that for me Master? I am Always available to you, i feel so empty right now...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is getting....good? Nope not now. \"<i>Kira shut it, or i really gonna fill you until you burst!</i>\" Kira: \"<i>Promise, promise, Master. I will believe it when you do it</i>\" Luckily Joy is unaware of our little dirty talk, and still smile sincerely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Good, you value are mostly normal so i can release you form the center\" Mostly? \"Mostly normal?\" Joy continue: \"Why yes, some our your values are a little off, but nothing worrying, also your emanation streams are quite hight, usually it's typical with Lucario trainers, we don't really know What it do, but seems to be harmless.\" Emanation?

Totodile pussy is already leaking, ready to be taken. This is a very good dream or a strange...no, enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get down and give that reddish blue sex a good long, lick \"Tooooo\" She taste..spicy? and sour, i give a few more hard lick, then I get up pressing both my new pokemon? why not, gently down, pressing their ready sexes together, i then place my cock at their joining and start to push my tool in between<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooooo\" \"Kaaaaa\" I start slowly, enjoying their difference of heat, their wetness. We will do this again for sure, but for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathia: \"<i>Master..she too is...her first..</i>\" So, i will have two..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy excitement grew, and so my impatience, i speed up my push, getting moans of pleasure from them both. Deciding that's it's time, i slow down, pressing the tip of my tool to My water type labia \"Tooooo\" I finally push myself inside. \"To! tooooo!\" Her body welcome me, gripping my organ with ferocity, she is incredibly wet and tight, her small stature compress my cock like a vice, and her slick fleshy insides massage my explorer of worlds while it explore uncharted territory \"Tooo! To!\" She give herself to me, barely meet, and let me give her inner mouth a big sloppy kiss \"TOOO! Di!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep myself in, savoring her willingness, then i extract my greedy explorer, making it breath fresh air once more, only to plunge it inside the cave once again \"Dile!\" I start mating her short, but tight passage, unwilling to remain in this bathroom longer than necessary. With this goal in mind, i begin to force cervix, wanting to claim my prize and continuing on, knowing that i can have them both in the future, in a more pleasant environment. My thrusting speed up, ramming My small water type, giving to her what she has asked for \"To! Toto! To! To! TO! TO! Toooooooo!\" Not even 5 minutes later she come, gripping my cock with so much strength, that i can't continue thrusting, so instead i push myself to her inner barrier, and release \"TOOOOOOOOOO<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">oooo</font>\" I feel my seed leaving my tool, letting the explorer mark this territory has mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Tooo to toooo</font>\" My water type womb fill pretty quickly, letting my mark flow out of her and on Kathia patient lips, Totodile is exhausted already, i don't blame her, her first time was pretty intense. I remove my brave explorer from her caves, and let Totodile rest in her position, then grinning like a madman, i use her lubrication to push inside My Kadabra in one swift thrust \"Kaaaa!\" I reach her cervix immediately, thanks to her readiness and my more then plenty water type juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, i start to mate Kathia with hard, deep thrust intent on claiming my second pokemon today \"Kaaa\" \"<i>Master, give it to me ahh! please! all of it!</i>\" Her encouragement is all i need, my press down my now sleepy Totodile, and enjoy her still dripping pussy juice, while i breed her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathia: \"<i>More! please ah! yes, morrrrree ahhh!</i>\" She has waited too much, even if she has just come i won't stop, not until i am satisfied too. I continue to push in her looser but stronger suctioning sex, my rhythm increase gradually until i am literally pounding her furred snatch, down on the toilet cover \"Braaaa! Ka! Kaaa! Ka! Ka!\" Not yet, not yet, just a little bit morrrre. Ka! Kad! Her cervix finally open and my tip slip inside, locked in a loving embrace. \"Yessss!\" I finally release, all i have left \"KAAAAAAAAAAD kaaaa kaaad kad...braaaaaa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer velvet walls and her strong suction make me empty my remaining stocks inside her now very satisfied womb. I try to keep myself up, but end slipping back, and extract frocefully my bold explorer from Kathia sanctum, a wet \"<b>POP</b>\" could be heard, then i fall on my ass, tired, but quite happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass before i can finally get up, my two candidates are still out, i don't feel any bind between us....a shame....but i will keep them regardless. I call for my little lust daemon, Espeon \"Kira, shees, give two balls if you please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>I am sooo happy!...But i don't feel them.....oooh, damn it, it would have been so fun....alright i..oops</i>\" What is it now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>Master, i...don't have brought any balls..</i>\" \"<b>SLAP!</b>\" I facepalm, so...\"Kira, you remained there all the time....and didn't pass for the antechamber of you pretty brain, that i may have needed the balls!?\"..................................................\"<i>No, i mean yes!

I always have!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Kira, and i will not deny our connection anymore, but it's seems that from now on you will have some competition, so beware..\" I finish with a playful tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrr she say with an lusty tone \"<i>I am always ready, Master..</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, behave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\npurrrr \"<i>Always, Master</i>\" purr <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure like i am gonna believe that \"SO Kira, do you believe me?\" she reply with a serious tone \"<i>Of course Master, i have felt a wall of shadow between us, and only a very powerful Ghost type would have been able to do such things, also i have scanned our home and no trace of other pokemon whatsoever was there, so...yeah Giratina is the only one would could have done that</i>\" I am relieved that Kira believe me, would have meant lot of trouble if she didn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in Months i truly felt free, but now a new question torment my mind, what Giratina really want from me? The same thing that Kira and i share? I wouldn't exclude the possibility, also the longing that i have felt was genuine, i am sure of it. I admit that her shape does not repulse me but.....no, there will be another time to discuss such things, and beside, i have two new member of the family that still await to see their new home. Let's just hope that Kira don't want to ^break them^ about rules and such<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira: \"<i>Master, what about Kathia and the Sirana? Will you keep them?</i>\" Trick question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i will keep them, i have no intention to abandon them anytime soon, let's just hope that their willingness about try to bind with me can be translated in patience and discipline, after all, i don't want to be ambushed by Sirana or Kathia with a request of....you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira with a very mischievous tone and smile : \"<i>Why not master, i think that you new water type enjoy being....fulfilled by you..</i>\" More like filled to the brim...i admit it was an interesting experience, but..no devious thought later, for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the sky, evening approach, how long we was here? \"Time to return home Kira, we can discuss about fulfillment later, hopefully not before a day or two.. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira with the same smile as before \"<i>Don't count on it...Master...</i>\" purrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am gonna get fucked....again</span></div></div>",

I would have never believed that not only i would have mated with two pokemon at the same time, but those two type in particular, i admit that i had fantasy about pokemon and me in...intimate connection, but while i do like their forms, i never had a fantasy about those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that i have also never thought about Giratina and...well...me in that way, or at least i think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in my head, i rethinks about today events, i fell the soft ground soon get replaced by the stone paddled path that i knew so well, the path that bring directly to the central plaza, and then from there home. I realize that i am over thinking yet again, and worse about something that already happened, i should focus on the present instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira walk beside me with quite a smile on her face, her happy and easygoing behavior make me suspect that she has planned something for our...my home welcoming. Knowing Kira it will probably regard both our new member and probably sex, lots of sex. I must stop her plan, i know that if anyone would hear what i am saying, they will probably tell: WTF man! You have three willing poke and you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes i will, i will say no. I don't want that my family consider me for my cock first and for everything else later, while i would probably enjoy what Kira is planning, i must stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even turning towards her \"Kira, you are not preparing a surprise for me are you?\" I feel that my Espeon is turning towards me, still walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira with a sweet innocent tone: \"<i>Me Master? Why, do you wish for one?</i>\" I now look at her, her predatory/mocking smile can't be really described, nor the level of fake innocence that she is putting in her acting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you well, well enough to reasonably suspect that you are planning for something..intimate between the Four of us in the near future\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira smile don't change, nor her tone: \"<i>Master, you wound me with your accusation, i would Never put you in the middle of something like that, without your Explicit consent</i>\"..that's exactly my point<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? What do you mean for explicit exactly? Not trying to escape by jumping trough the window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira try to sweeten her tone: \"<i>Never Master, i just...</i>\" I interrupt her: \"Just what? Waking up founding myself fellated by you three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare in her eyes, she try to advert her now clear failure by feigning innocence but i won't allow it: \"Look Kira, i know what are you trying to do, but...not now ok? i just recovered from this ordeal, i don't want to wake up in an orgy, literally, so...no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira look displeased, but she quickly recover her happy mood: \"<i>As you wish Master, but remember that Sirana will probably try anyway, she doesn't seems the type to give up easily, or at all</i>\" We will see i guess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continue our short remaining walk in silence, nothing else has to be said, not here anyway, i admit that i dread my little confrontation with those two, while Kathia knew about that ^wall of shadow^ and can compare, Sirana may just think that i am nuts, or worse she may believe me and think that i am cursed or something, after all, only the death, dying or special person usually see Giratina, In dream at least. Trainers are hunting for Her for a long time, believing that with ^it^ at their command, they won't have to fear death anymore. Bullshit, i say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's quite funny really, some think themselves expert on the subject, while in truth they don't even know her gender, most believe that she is just a force and the others that it's is male. Fools. Giratina is not even death. Their ignorance is surpassed only by their greed, and stupidity probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally reach our home, and like always, Kira unlock and open the door for me, of course reclosing it once inside. I feel so useless sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira then claim the couch as her own, and watch me with amusement, knowing what i am about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the balls that contain Kathia and Sirana, releasing them both. Their balls open, leaving their translucent form materializing before me, and a second later i have a Kadabra and a Totodile staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, this is my..our home, feel free to look around or ask Kira for anything you may wish to know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathia look at me with a worried expression: \"<i>Master we..failed?</i>\" I think that she refer to the binding, i reply: \"We didn't succeed, no. Don't worry Kathia, i won't abandon nor treat you differently, even without a bound you are still family to me, remember it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathia expression change into a relived smile, while Sirana: \"Toto dile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathia: <i>She never doubted you...Master</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we go again, i reply with a bored tone: \"I told you already, call me\" Kira interrupt me: \"<i>We don't care...you are Our Master, now and forever</i>\" purrrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira tone has become quite...possessive when she said our, and both Kathia and Sirana nods. It's seems that i wouldn't get out this mess so easily after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to walk towards the bedroom, when Sirana call for me: \"Toto to diiile\" I turn and, not particularly surprised, i look as my water type present herself on her back, spreading her already leaking sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to say no, when Kathia, get on all four exposing herself fully as well, they both look at me with a needy expression while Kira watch bemused. She knew it. Probably encouraged them even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit to be tempted, but i decline, not only i am quite tired i am also still a little...uncertain about all of this: \"I..appreciate your intent girls, but no, another time perhaps\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn and continue to walk towards the bedroom, they both ask me to come back but i resist and push forward. I will not be dissuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swiftly enter the bedroom, reach my bed, and without even undressing i lay down and start to sleep. Not what i think is a minute later, i feel weights placing themselves on me, i recognize a purring Kira on my chest, Kathia soft fur on my right and Sirana slightly damp scales on my left: \"Good night girls, i love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esp\" \"Toto\" \"Kaaad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira and Kathia: \"<i>Good night Master, we love you too</i>\" I feel a smile placing itself on my lips, then the sweet relaxing melody of dream call to me, and i respond in turn.</span></div></div>",

Oh yes, this is love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning to you too Dera, like your sleepeng arrangements i assume?\" Especially because she choose it, not that i complain. Oh yes not much more, i want to see how much i can push her before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breon\" With this she get out from under our? sheets, she lazily walk on my stomach, then as our usual mornings, she stretch lifting her tail and purposefully showing her under tail to me, i can smell it, i would just need to slightly extend my tongue to taste her if i just wanted so, and i want to, but first i want to break her fully, not just temptation. She remain it this position for a few seconds, much more then she would need, and i decide to indulge in a little, teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove my hands from under the cover and put them on her rear, than i place my finger just at her entry and slowly move it up and down. <br>\r\n\"Breon umbr\" Oooh she like it.<br>\r\nIt's but a few seconds before she start dripping and at this point i push my finger forward all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breon! Bre!\" I start to pump my fingers in and out of her at a brisk peace, i feel her tight love hole squeeze my finger delightfully, and more fluid clearly drip out of her, but them after a few minute i abruptly stop, i leave my finger hilted at my knock and star moving them around, this can easily send her crazy with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre! Bre!\" At this point, i stop once again, and remove my finger, her box pulse with desire, i can see it, i can smell it, i can nearly taste it but it's not the moment, yet.<br>\r\nShe is clearly annoyed that i have interrupted her stimulation, but say nothing, beside staring at me with light malice, then she return on all four and jump off the bed, always keeping her tail hight. I know she wanted it, but i want her to surrender to me, i want her to start the contact, to submit to me completely, to admit that i am her master and she is my slave, well love and passion. Ok mostly passion, but i would lie if i say that i don't worry about her safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lazily get up from the bed, and put my plan in motion, i know that my neighbor fuck his Absol in the park most morning. Yes as i have said, dark type have very little morals in regard. So i want Dera to see our friendly Absol fucked until she begs to be filled. That and the morning stimulation should break her. I check the clock, 8:30, still time. I suit myself with the usual pokemon-trainer-lazy-style, and go to my not so modest kitchen, prepare breakfast for both of us, and looking at the clock, the twelve faced machine show me a good perpendicular angle, 9:00, perfect! My exhibitionist friend should be at the park just about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dera! Come we go at the park!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre umbr\" Well, she seems a little insufferable. Not for long my dear, not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both get out in the streets, and quickly go towards the park. Victory, sweet and tight, Will be mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reach the park in lees than 10, and i immediately bring us near the place where i know my dearest neighbor do his dirty deeds. Not that most trainer don't do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abso ab sol!\" Oh yes we are here. Dera look surprised, then intrigued, i let her go in front of me, and finally she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Sila! How can you can you be so tight! I fill you everyday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sol! Sol!\" Hehe she is enjoy being taken from behind, with her muzzle on her front paw and her rear in the air, of course i know, i tapped that pussy once, a whole day in her. Our dear neighbor leave her with me one day. It was before i had Dera. She was sooo needy, that i couldn't deny her, nor i wanted to. One of the best lay i ever had. Far better than a human anyway. I took her in all possible way, or at least most. Eating, drinking, and  mating, alllll day. Tiring but was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera was mesmerized, her tail lift on reflex, and i see her juice drip down on her legs. Nearly, nearly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a condescending tone \"Come on Dera, it's not nice to peep\" Oh i know that both of them would love it, but i had other plans. \"Come on Dera, let's go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera still look a little stunned but obey, and come with me to another part inside the park. Home will be much sweeter.</span></div></div>",

But i ignore her and go to my room. Living alone has it's perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my computer on and remove my pants, leaving only my underwear, then i log on my favorite site, Hotvolutions.com, you can easily guess it's content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI click on female Umbreon, and watch the show start. I place my hand on my cock, and slowly stroke. I know that i don't have to wait much more, i just need to look the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected my lovely Dera show herself, panting, she failed relieving herself, and just as expected, she come to me. She advance slowly, with purpose, i feign ignorance and look at the screen. Few seconds later her hot breath is on my underwear, only then i <i>notice</i> her. She is panting with lust, her eyes aflame, and without even give me the time to recite my part she bite. My underwear come off easily, and not a moment too soon, she put my erect cock in her hot muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moan heavily, she must have been more frustrated than i... Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe start sucking, hard, bobbing her muzzle up and down my cock, saliva drip from her around her lips but she don't stop, and go even faster, second after second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhaa\" She is really trying! But no, i must claim her first, damn! She bobs her head even faster, and i can feel her throat clenching on my now sensitive member, but she don't stop. She is Desperate, and my preemptive stimulation doesn't help, I have barely the time to tell say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deraaaa!\" Than i come in her muzzle, she bottom and continue sucking. I can see my cum as it descent in her throat, and she look at me with satisfaction. But i am not satisfied, and still hard i grip her by the flank and lift her at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeeee!\" I look at her with angry eyes, and say \"Soo, my little slut, you decided to show your nature, you should have ask permission and now i have to punish you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with the same hunger as this morning, when i fingered her, but this time, much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go towards the bed, the computer forgotten for the moment, and trow her on it. \"Present yourself, slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe don't hesitate and immediately go on all fours, lift her tail, and show me her dripping box. I don't hesitate either, i got behind her, grip my cock and point at her labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeeee\" \"Shut it! From now on i only want to hear your moan\" I press her front down, align my cock and without remorse push it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breon!\" So tight, wet, hot, just like i have imagined it, her wall convulse around my cock, inviting me to pound her and release my gift. All in due time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove myself from inside her, as soon as the tip reach her labia i push it in again, with more strength this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre bre breee!\" I feel the tip kissing her cervix, and i am still 2 inch out, eventually i will get them in as well, for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove myself once again, and when half my cock is out i push it in again, i know she is enjoying this, to be my slut, i establish a slow peace with deep strong stroke. I am finally having whats is mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre! Bre! Bre! Breon!\" I continue my rhythm, and decide to start speed up a little, seeing my cock getting out of her pussy, fluid dripping on her legs, pushing in again  and feeling her box opening for me, convulsing on my most sensitive part, is glorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pound her faster and faster, i am near my limit, my Dera, as well, i push with renewed vigor, i want to release in her deepest part, i will overfill my slut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breon! Bre! Bre! Bre! Breon!\" she is close, i can feel it, i pound her cervix a little harder, yes there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BREEEEEEEEEEE!\" She is coming, her wall squeezing me, with a last push i feel her barrier opening and i cram another half inch inside, then, i too came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deraaaaaaa!\" I feel my seed leaving me, filling her womb, not long after she is overfilled and my cum get out of her on her legs. I keep coming for an eternity, even if i knew that are just a few more second. Then when i feel spent, i remove myself from her, and fall on the bed, best lay ever! Dera fall on her stomach as well, her box still open and dripping. The day is good. My new life, and her start now.</span></div></div>",

I am ready enough, and i think that Dera will always be ready, so i decide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I don't have a specific destination in mind, i just needed to leave the coziness of my home, it's not that my home lack in entertainment, both technological and practical, especially now with my new practical Umbreon, no, it's my wanderlust, that from time to time, let herself know, and bug me until i do something about it, usually ignore it with my pokeplay(console) works tough. Not this time, and my curiosity about this so called binding between pokemon and trainer picked my interest. So while Dera and me walk down the road, i let my head remind my of why i have bothered myself, with even getting up this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember when i have read about it, long ago, i was i child i think; anyway, i was in the public library and i was trying, uselessly, to find something, anything to keep me entertained. My parents, well, their are a delicate subject, you see most parents just want the best for their children, they wanted only one thing: let the bloodline continues. In simpler terms, have a child so your reproduction instinct leave you alone and you are free to pursue you life interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents never leave me hanging however, and while a little cold, i have never missed a meal, or the lastest gaming platform. While my family aren't the richest bastard ever seen, money was never an issue. I suppose that him being a relatively famous archaeologist, and her being one of the top designer at Poketech, bills become nothing more than the bother to receive them, just like the ad, you know that everything is covered or you just don't care, and throw them in the nearest trash bin. One small life pleasure i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless i remember to have found a thick blue book called....i don't remember the title, something about ancient trainers and special bond or something. Anyway i clearly recollect that a person can develop a strong connection with certain pokemon, with the result of empowering them both. The concept fascinated me, and i have tried to seek more about this binding process, only to find that officially such thing doesn't even exist. Years later i have discovered that the government deliberately hide information about pokemon and their potential, and among the others thing, binding was one them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day i decided to finally use the connection that both Mother and Father had to have more information about this binding thing, and after having tormented them for a while, they relented and both has given me some documentation regarding this matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mother file i discovered that the binding happen when an individual <u>connect</u> with his own or another, even wild pokemon, research regarding this matter has been interrupted by the Poketech, but the scientist was still able to determine that not every individual is able to form a binding, not the one that interested them anyway, and also developed a test to recognize such individual. As you may have guessed i have tried the test immediately and the result was unsurprising, positive. Apparently, only the 15% of the population has my same result, insufficient for the Poketech standard, so the project was discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Father i have obtained an unremarkable notebook, with brown-grey cover, pages half yellowed by time, inside notes written seemingly chaotically on the pages. After having lost a good hour lazily examining the small book content, i discovered something amazing. In time long past, the trainers had another name, Handler, problem and beast handler to be specific, their purpose? Solving humanity problem, with pokemon help. You must understand, pokeball are a relatively new gadgets, developed less than 35 years ago by a nearly unknown character, know as John Sandovar, the book mention that probably it's was not his true name, and that this Sandovar has strange abilities, not much different from now well know Pokemon attacks, even if not that powerful. At the time, pokemon moves were nearly unknown to most but the most dedicated researcher in the field, so it's not surprising that many wasn't able to connect the dots. Also this Sandovar vanished in strange, if not bizarre, circumstances, fueling his aura of mystery even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow i may not be the most gifted individual in the world, but i am pretty smart, more than my parents has always wanted to admit, and i think i got it. This binding happen when the individual <i>connect</i> physically, as well as emotionally, with the pokemon in question, also there must be a trigger, emotional or spiritual in nature, that unlock the process potential to it's fullest. Now i know that some Trainer literally fuck their pokemon senseless, and most of the time, the above mentioned pokemon want it. After all, i think that pokemon are very practical in nature, and see no reason to refuse their trainer of something the they would be doing normally in the wild anyway. My neighbor would approve, I'm sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ubre oooooon\" Yeah, Dera i got it you are bored. \"Not much longer now, see that tall grass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breooooooo\" She saw that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway translating and simplifying the whole ideas the concept is this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breo Umb!\" I look at Dera, she reach got inside the bushes, not far from the path, following her i notice a small spacious area behind it, perfect for resting \"Breee ooonn\" Dera lay on her back, her legs in the air and her pussy exposed, a mischievous look in her crimson eyes. or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes as i was saying, the binding start this way.</span></div></div>",

Getting up i discard my pants and gently fold them on the ground, my underwear, new one after the computer accident?, follow closely; my sword is ready, and the chosen sheath more than eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her already wet for me, i point my penis at her entrance and slowly thrust myself in. \"Breeoo Bre!\" I found that i have bottomed easily, her familiar inner mouth greet my tip with a lustful kiss; i can tell than being on her back is causing slight discomfort for her tail, by i really don't care, she is my slut, my toy, and i take her whenever i want, as long as i don't really harm her, not that she will ever complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now well know dance start once again as i retrieve my spear and thrust it in with force \"Bre! Bre! Breoon!\"  Her well know walls of flash rejoice at my visit, a joy that will repeat itself a lot in the future. I start with a good deal of strength behind my rhythmic thrust, i want to relieve myself and go on with the plan \"Bre! Bre! Bre!\" Well unless someone, or something doesn't find us first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile <u>binding</u> with a pokemon is tiring, i never let my surrounding blur with the noise, and as i have half expected, a light noise get my attention from Umbreon, the bush on our right move slowly, evidently wanting to made less noise as possible. I feign ignorance and increase the speed of my thrusting inside my loving Dera, she doesn't disappoint \"Breoon! Bre! BRE! BRE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling safe, our hidden, but not necessarily unwanted guest, show it's head. Recognizing the orange pokemon isn't much of a challenge, it's seems that we made enough noise to attract a wild Charmeleon, my mind try to focus while a good part of my blood flow in another direction; with mostly my instinct, lust surge from within and i decide that having another test subject would be a Very Good Idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to look at our stalker wanna be, and i notice that it's seems far too focused on our joining point to care, so i decide to try to put on a show, one that could be dangerous, after all it' is a wild pokemon, but i am confident of my lusty and probably non particularly well conceived plan, my care however, is all in the same place as most my blood is right now, so....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift myself up, still remaining joined with Dera, then i angle myself almost vertically on her pussy and thrust in slowly but powerfully \"Breo!\" she appreciate, good. I notice that our guest does too, as it slowly come near us, like in trance. Finally when it's body is out of the bush i finally see with what material i will soon have at my disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmeleon is still in trance, as it coming closer, i notice a lack of pointy things, but i don't fail to notice the lusty stare and as it reach my arm length, something dripping on the ground, bingo! I carefully extend my arm, while simultaneously stop pumping Dera, and grind instead. Our guest doesn't notice my hand until it touch her, she recoil back and i restart fucking Dera powerfully still keeping my arm extended \"Bre! Bre!\" She too have noticed but doesn't seems to care much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur guest seeing that the show has returned, look at Dera pussy once more, and the mesmerized look return, she doesn't even care when my hand caress her snout, descending on her back, but she definitely take notice and start emitting pleasurable growl; that is until i reach for her under-tail and delicately caress her wet, hot vent. She look at me unsure but doesn't move, i slow my thrusting of Dera once more, as i circle with my fingers what, if i play my card right, would be my next bind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmeleon still look at me but doesn't react beside pleasurably growling, i stop my thrust inside Dera, keeping my cock hilted, kissing her cervix, but don't forcing it open. Charmeleon do not seems to notice, and continuing, i start to spread her vent, i caress her outer layer making my next bind close her eyes. I decide thats the hock is in, and while spreading her vent open, i push two fingers in. Charmeleon open her eyes, surprised but still immobile, the i start move them in, she lose her surprised face and softly growl again, at this point i start pump, in a slow and steady rhythm. Damn she is tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmeleon eyes close again and doesn't even notice when i remove myself from Dera, much to her disappointment, but she know her place and doesn't vocalize about it, as i lay on the grounds. Dera watch us with morbid fascination and some envy, she seat, and watch me play with our new friend. I quicken my tempo until, going behind her, i start ramming my fingers in \"Char! Cha! Cha!\" I continue until nearly a minute later she start to convulse and i feel her walls heating up, clenching my finger with force. \"Chaaaaaaaar!\" I continue pumping until she stop convulsing and drop to the ground laying on her stomach, i remove my finger, and taste the the smelly substance, spicy and....aromatic? can't really describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly a minute later, she recover and look around, clarity must have returned to her. with a burst of speed, she start to run, luckily Dera was expecting this and jump on the Charmeleon back, effectively pinning her to the ground. How ungrateful, maybe i should remind her. I walk behind the Charmeleon, kneel and lift her tail, she try to put it down, but stop as soon as i caress her vent once more, correct my orange friend, remember, i then spread her vent and ram my finger in, \"Char!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start stimulate her vent again while Dera lick the back of her neck, a few second later her vocalization of pleasure bring a smile on my face. I pump my finger a few more time, every intrusion harder then the last, she seems to approve. Charmeleon is ready. I stop, removing my finger, then keeping her tail hight i place my hard cock at her vent and sunk in. \"Charrrrrrrr\" she seems happy to finally get the real thing, and i have waited long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spread her vent my with tool, with quick hard stroke, making clear that i have all the intention of claiming her \"Char! Char! Cha!\" she push back, i think she accepted me, or at least our mating and she has stopped resisting. I hilt myself, and pause, i lower my head to her eyes level and speak \"Will you be a good, slutty Charmeleon for me?\" i accompany the slutty with and particularly hard thrust. \"Char! Meleon!\" she nods, \"Good then please Dera, while i breed you\" Dera look exalted, jump off Charmeleon back, and expose her pussy to her. Charmeleon reaction is immediate, she extend her long tongue and start licking Dera with gusto, maybe this is not her first time she please another female?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless i start back my rithm and enjoy my new claim, her hot, slick vent caress my spire, while she is not as eager as Dera, her inner heat compensate it nicely. I continue my not so forced mating, until i decide that i can break her in later and start thrusting with speed, going as deep as possible, i want to claim her fully. \"Char! Char! Cha! Ch....\" she mute as my effort are finally repaid, the door to her egg chamber open and i mercilessly use it as an extension to her vent, she remain immobile while my pleasure mount, and moment later i came. \"CHAAAAAARRRRRRRRR!\" Glad to hear her voice again, as my seed flood her inside, i still continue with slow, light stroke, just to be sure that my cum coat her inner wall completely. As my cum messily flow out her vent, i feel a strange hotness inside, like a fire, slowly increase, as i stop flowing, so does the sensation. I remove myself from her, get up and look at the messy spectacle before me, a Charmeleon exhausted, with her tail down, her vent spasming and dripping a slow stream of my cum, while she pant heavily releasing her hot breath in the air. Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bind through Dera start showing, as my vigor replenish itself from a seemingly unknown source, so does my arousal, i have Never came this hard until now, i should be spend and dry, but i am not. Incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera look unsatisfied tough, so i think i should teach our new friend, that from now on i will call Ren, to never left a work unfinished, and i will teach her, finishing her off.</span></div></div>",

So instead of finding a solution, i just apply the solution to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel behind my leaking Charmeleon, see her eyes try to follow my motion, i grip her tail and lift it up, obtaining and unrestricted view of her inviting vent. Without hesitation i put my now again aching cock directly on her box, i see that Ren Eyes widen with disbelief but do nothing to stop me, then i push it in. \"Charrrrrr\" Ren is so tired that she barely react, but her body respond pretty well. The slickness of her vent combined with my seed, permit me to reach the entrance to her egg chamber nearly immediately, despite her gripping attempt to slow me down, as soon as i feel her still partially open inner mouth, i lower my head to hers \"You feel it?\" prodding her limit, she nods \"Do you want me inside, my new bind?\" she look slightly worried, you are unsure if it's at your question or at the word bind, still after a few second, you fell her vent gripping your cock harder and she nods. You don't need further encouragement as your spire pass trough her inner barrier and settle in. \"Char! leo!\" She seems to enjoy it, good lets see how much seed she can hold in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip the base of her tail with your left hand, while keeping Ren down with you right, remove yourself from her making some fluid come out with you, then ram yourself in \"Char!\"<br>\r\nHer body clench down on you, trying to keep you still. A worthy but futile attempt. A soon as you establish an healthy rhythm you watch as Dera put her pussy on Ren muzzle, Charmeleon extend her long tongue and start to lap  at the exposed treasure, much to Dera pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her ordeal, Ren take you pretty well, and you hope that you will be able to obtain her full trust as easy as you took her vent. While examining the small horn at the back of her skull, you notice how red it is, and you suspect that is not only a sign of her recent activity. Reducing your motion but not stopping your hips you speak to your new bind \"Ren\" your tone firm, she understand even if nearly overwhelmed with pleasure that you want he attention, she look at you \"Are you in heat?\" finishing the phrase with a particularly strong thrust that make your tip touch the wall of her inner chamber. \"arrrr! cha! rrrr\" she is nearly at her limit but still nod. You push her head down again and resume your fast and hard rhythm. That explain a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look as finally Dera came drenching Ren muzzle with her orgasm, as soon as it is finished, you brace Ren, and with your cock still all the way in, you lift her up, impaling her on your rod. \"Chaa! rrr er!\" She is a little baffled but don't resist and you start push her as much as hard at possible without harming her. You resume you pounding and not a minute later Ren came again \"Charrrrrr.....\" she lose her voice as soon as you start blasting her inside with your seed, you feel as her inner sanctum got filled to the brim once again and the extra juice flow down to the ground, some on your hips as well. You notice as Ren eyes roll back in her skull, then she got limp, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving yourself from her, you lay her gently on the ground, and admiring your handiwork, touch her with a pokeball and officially capture her, even if you know that she was yours the moment you speared her vent.  Dera look pretty satisfied, and even if this wasn't exactly your plan, the result cannot be denied. With a tired smile you lift up put Dera on your shoulder and walk towards home. Not a bad day.</span></div></div>",

Luckily my plan, devised and put on hold until Dera and i would have bound, was to start training seriously and to book events and feeling, derived from the above mentioned bind. In theory it should make both me and my bounded pokemon, stronger, smarter and generally better somehow, the details are scarce and on many accounts there are no written text at all. I had to improvise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide that take a relaxing, refreshing shower would be the best course of action at the moment, that is, until i remind myself that with an overly lustful Umbreon and a Charmeleon in heat, my shower could easily become anything but. Still i need one, and my two lover too. Lover? Why i said lover? What...is the bound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre! Breoon Bre!\" i shake my head and lock the door, no one will try to get in, but is the force of habit, i must. \"Dera, you are a filthy little Umbreon\" She look at me with a confused look \"Bre?\" In both sense, although no shower would remove that \"Yes you are filthy, we are taking a shower\" The confusion left her feature, replaced by a grin \"Breoooooo\" No shower indeed \"No Dera, you and Ren will get thoroughly washed, but i won't mate you, nor her, again\" A disappointed look on her muzzle \"Breooon Bre!\" Persistent slut \"No, Period\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the ball containing Ren, and as i approach the bathroom, i consider to take them both at the pokemon center later, just to be sure, and to see if....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breo!\" Fine little slut, i will lose myself in my introspection later. I restart walking expediently toward my destination and, once inside, i wait for Dera to come in, then i close the door. Little bastard has the bad habit of running inside the house when completely wet after a bath, and while the idea of punishing her is always present, if she like it, will help me not, beside i will not harm my pokemon. As i start to undress, i analyze my previous statement, an unshakable determination was in my tone when i thought of that, it's seems that the binding process protect the pokemon as well, to the point that their trainer, or handler as it was caller before, will do anything to keep them safe. A strange but not unwelcome feeling, i have never wanted to treat my bounded has slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breooooooon\" She break my daydream once again, shoving me her raised tail and aroused box, fuck it, hasn't she got enough? With a determined tone \"No, Dera, in the tub, now!\" \"Breoooon Bre!\" No Dera i won't fuck you in the shower, \"Dera, stop\"  she seems to have understood this time \"Eon\" Sure, like i am gonna believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish to remove my underwear, open the hot water, feel the relief that bring me, \"Bre\", look at my slutty Umbreon, losing the relaxing feeling, and after estimating the distance, i release Ren directly under the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen does not seems to be particularly tired, a little roughed up sure, but nothing special, this bond is really amazing. My seed is still leaking from her vent, and after a good head shake, she look confused, until she spot me. \"Char\" She seems quite content, i wonder if i can just waltz in, fuck any wild pokemon i want and just leave as nothing has happened, maybe i will test it sometimes. I just hope that i haven't become a sort of pokewhore, that would not be a pleasant prospective, especially if afterwards they become as these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving further thinking at later date, i pick up Ren, who seems excited at the process, not sure why, then i turn her on her back at the wall just under the flow of water, and spreading first her legs then her vent, i watch as my seed get slowly removed by the said water. Ren look at me with a strange happiness, is she on drugs? Her smile widen after a few seconds and her flamed tail start swishing left and right, \"Charrrrrr\" not again, \"Ren, i won't bred you again, not today anyway\" she seems to be getting confused by this statement \"Char? Char der!\" She then try to make my finger slip inside her hot vent, and she succeed \"Charrrrr\" I remove my fingers immediately, if i fail to control myself now, it's over, I Am The Master, I Choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ren, no\" Disappointedly she reply \"Chaaar cha der\" She seems to get it and i return to the cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later i am finally out of the bathroom, Dera has tried numerous time to get me fucking them both, but i resisted and now they seems pretty calm. I hope it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon and dinner was spent just like you would expect on a normal trainer house, playing at the pokeplay, a gaming platform that can be used by pokemon too, well some pokemon, the last time at a video store, a guy has tried to make his Tyranitar play with his feet, it just...didn't end well, no death but i think that that guy was never seen again around here; then we watched TV and ate various snack while running around the house. Both my pokemon wanted to have more physical contact as possible with me, hand, forearm, head, anything really, and strangely enough, no sexual harassment from those two the whole day, miraculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night everything was peaceful, and of course, both wanted to sleep on the bed. I know that i will regret this in the morning, but their pouts, and Ren feeling that i now start to being aware of, convinced me; after the goodnight to them both i slowly drifted to the land of dreams.</span></div></div>",

What influence it? Our recent memory? Our very belief and nature? All of them? Yes, probably all the above and more. But what do you do, when your dream become a reality of witch you would like to, sometime escape. Where do you go then? Apparently not asleep with you pokemon or the very feeling of pleasure, can easily become a reminder of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlick hot breath, something caressing me, a part of me, then...teeth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the fu..\" I look at my hips, where the pain has originated, and there two very busy and totally nonchalant pokemon are licking all over my now very erect shaft, Dera on my left, with her paw firmly planted at the base enjoying the taste? of my balls, and Ren witch claw are delicately pumping up and down while happily licking at the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...the fuc..ah, where you two..ha shit! Haven't you both got enough?\" They both look at me with a bemused expression, never stopping their respective task. This bounding is far more tiring that i have ever expected, although thanks to it, i recover so fast that i can place this whole thing, in the minor bother section, and i got them as much as i want, which with what seems to be my now boosted libido, is a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that i had enough of their game, i grab Dera by the neck, and bringing her at my face i tell her \"What i have told you about asking permission?\" Dera look displeased \"Bre! Breo bre umbre bre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am just getting in the lecture mode, when i feel Ren gripping my cock like a pole, looking down i see that she is rubbing her clearly ready vent on it, trying to impale herself. Look like i must clear the concept to them both, yet again, my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take Dera on the side of the bed, then i grab Charmeleon and lift her up, without giving them any time to protest, i get out of the bed and slam Ren on the soft bedding, lying or her stomach, the air get knocked out of her, but i feel that this move didn't harm her, i then grip Dera neck again and put her a little higher than my fiery lizard head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Lift Ren tail forcefully, extracting from her what seems a deep moan, then without warning i fully penetrate her, reaching her egg chamber with my tip. \"Charrr! Char char!\" She love it, it's seems impossible but she did, i practically impale her on my cock, and she thrust back, asking for more. Fucking slut! I don't think that this eagerness could be natural, this bound must be responsible for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push her down with all my weight, i don't think that it can harm her, pokemon can withstand far stronger beating, then placing my face at Dera pussy, i start to stimulate her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bre! Breon bre!\" She approve, but wait for the second part Dera, you'll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to fuck Ren Hard, Hard as i can, and she only moan in pleasure, i have hoped to make her learn to respect some pain, but she seems to love it, all of it. Fueled by anger i thrust even harder, deeper until i finally pierce her inner sanctum, my head just got in, and i have no intention to stop. \"Chaaaaa...mel..meleon. Char! Char!\" Nothing, not even this make her reconsider, she seems to want me there, and try to push me in as much as possible. What the fuck? I thought last time she was too tired to resist and that her lust toke the better of her, instead she is willing? Eager even? She is so damn wet, hot and grip me relentlessly, begging for it, all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring it for the moment, even if it's not easy, i remove my toungue from Dera, and wetting 2 fingers, i start pushing them in her tailhole. \"Bre?! Breon breOOOOOOOON!\"<br>\r\nIt's slip in, and her walls start gripping my finger to the point of crushing, then i feel her relax, pant and incredibly, after looking at me with a mischievous smile, push back, hilting my finger in. This i haven't even..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen shudder under me and came, massaging me and inviting me to do the same, i relent, for now, and decide to double the pace for Dera, that surprisingly seems to like it. This is getting weirder and weirder. I need more information about this whole mess, before i am driven insane by lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hard pump later, Dera come as well, releasing her nectar straight on the sheets, laundry time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give Ren a few more hard thrust, before removing myself from her, and pointing at them both i come. \"Chaar!\" \"Bre on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later i am still try to clean the whole failure that was my punishment plan. While these two are licking each other clean. I decide to shower them both, no sex however, i will consider it later...Wat! Later? Am i really, shit! Whats happening to me, i need answer before this house become full of whorish pokemon that want to hump me to oblivion. That's it, we depart as soon as ready, this afternoon our journey will commence!</span></div></div>",

Both case I'm screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i just say the truth \"I want to be sure that both of you are healthy and fit for travel, we are gonna fight, train and generally have good time screwing up other people plans\" Well, most of the truth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at me with uncertainty and with no small dose of incredibility, then \"Bre!\" \"Char char!\" I'm screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the Pokemon Center was easy, wish i can say the same for getting to speak with the nurse, she is overly busy today, it seems that Team Rocket are bothering travelers and trainer again, for what i was able to gather, rocket took the worse part of the beating and flee; it's still worrying though, those useless sack of meat have made more than their share of trouble around here, and all the nearby city. Perhaps they have a base of sort not far from here, i should check the less traveled path, maybe i will find some useful information about their plans. Rumors says that a lot of construction material was bought not longer than a few months ago, but no construction company got the contract. While this information help me little, i think i can go back to Who has rented the necessary machinery for the actual construction, after all while it's possible to use pokemon for helping in the construction business, they can't replace complex heavy load machinery, and of course, it's safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a mental note of my new pet project, i notice that finally Joy seems to have cleared the last of her patients, and with a slow pace, i walk to her, preparing myself for some small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings nurse, i see that you have just gotten more busy than that day at the Christmas Eve, nothing exploded in the wrong place this time i hope\" While reminding myself of that <u>accident</u> is amusing, i have a timetable to respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy make a tired smile \"Good afternoon, yes i was quite busy until just a moment ago, those criminal are trying to get control of the main road again, fortunately they meet a group of trainer coming here for the festival so...\" So they got their ass kicked, deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Joy, i know you are tired, but can you give my team a quick check up?\" She look a little weary but still answer with a noticeable fake smile \"Of course, immediately\" She hate my guts already, wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy take my two family member to......! Wait, i said family? What the!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy \"Here we are, please do step inside\" I look at the examination room, it has nothing you wouldn't expect finding here, except for a thing \"Joy, i appreciate to being able to observe, but......what am i doing here exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just giving me a hand in case thing go bumpy, you see....i am strained, literally and i may need some support\" Is she that tired, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy, pardon me but, are you afraid?\" She look at me with an incredulous face, then \"How..i..i mean nonoabsolutely..\" She exhale \"A...a little, i had a problem with this....Charizard not a month back and...i am still kinda....traumatized\" I am nearly afraid to ask \"What...he\" she cringed at the word \"He, right? What he did to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tremble for a few second, than she take a deep breathe and \"He...he nearly...well...raped me\" I was lucky that i have not gotten some poke cola in the lobby coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried?\" She look at me with fury \"Yes! Tried! He didn't succeed only because it's trainer, hearing the commotion got in and recalled it with it's ball\" The anger left her eyes, replaced by sadness \"I..i have tried....i have willed to remove that horrible memory but....every time i see...\" Yeah, i got it \"Do not worry Joy, i will stay here, however you should already know that i have a Charmander not a Charizard, and both my pokemon are female\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy \"I know.....but..\" Good guy time \"Okay, it's okay, i am sure that with time, and maybe the help of your numerous....colleagues, you will get over this, I'm sure\" Well not really, but it's her best bet, and i am sure....\"Look Joy, i don't think that you are the first nurse, to have found herself in similar predicament, so probably a \" Therapy?  No, i can't tell her that \"possible way to free yourself of such oppressing memory, already exist\" She look at me with expectantly \"Talk to your colleague, there is nothing to be ashamed, you was a victim\" Unless she is not telling me everything, which is a serious possibility, but i just aim to have the checkup done and leave, i am not her psychologist, nor her boyfriend. If i want to catch anything useful from both the Rockets and respect my timetable, i can't lose anymore time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still look grateful, she hasn't notice my little misleading talk. \"Alright, release you pokemon and i will gladly start\" Here we go.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                            Nearly 2 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy \"Astonishing, incredible, but how? Their base statistic are far higher than normal, what you did to them?\" She seems a child ready to open her birthday gift. Still it's better if i don't tell her What i Do to them, it's the binding tough, or more than half the pokemon of this world would have such hight statistic for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I train a lot, and involve them in deep physical exercise\" Deep and physical for sure Joy \"Really! But i must know, what kind of\" Nope \"Joy, sorry, but thats a little secret, i do not drug them or force them to take some poisonous plant for increasing their strength nor...\" Joy \"I know, i have already checked, no strange substances in their bodies, although you Charmander show sign of recent mating, and she is strangely happy\" Strangely? How long since Your last date Joy? \"What you mean, why she should not be happy to...you know, release some stress\" I tell her with a mischievous grin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy look at me like the little prankster that i am, she understood perfectly what i meant \"Of course, you see when Charmander mate they usually do so with a larger/heavier pokemon, usually quite larger, like a Charizard or Arcanine, it's their instinct, to find a suitable male\" Oh, really, now thats.. Joy \"As you may imagine, it's not exactly a pleasurable experience for the female, but Ren here, look perfectly fine, and quite happy to, so i am wondering with who she has mated with....\" Ren look at me with a smile big enough to put a Feraligatr to shame, for a moment i tense, but then i notice that Joy is so focused in her examination that she haven't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy \"Well, it's all in the norm, beside their hight stat of course, you sure...\" Persistent are you not \"No Joy, i can't sorry\" I really can't, but i am not sorry, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy \"Fine, i clear both you pokemon for travel, have fun\" Oh that i definitely will, especially if i find the time to.....i must test my theory, later, in the wilderness with a wild one. Seems legit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joy, and have a good day\" I recover both my adulteresses, even if we are not married, and i was the..well you got it, an returning home i recover my equipment. Finally ready. Let's start with some testing, then i will proceed to gather more information about Rocket secret hideout, i am sure is no far from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then, adventure awaits!\" \"Breon, breeeeeeon!\" \"Char! char rider\" Fate, tremble. I Will get whats mine! Here i come!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My journey start with a light step and in hight spirit, i am sure that i will have the opportunity to both test my theory and test my pokemon as well, perhaps i will find a suitable member for reaching one of my goal in this journey, transforming my duo in a trio. While not a difficult thing per se, finding a new suitable partner may not be so easy, i have quite hight standard after all, and not all pokemon will be able to meet them, i do not expect to find a fully trained and ready Tyranitar in the tall grass waiting for me, but there is no way that i even try to capture a freaking Bidoof, i would prefer to get in the field and start kicking anypoke ass myself instead. That said we take the road and see what adventure await me, and of course my preliminary analysis based on rumor heard inside the Pok\u00e9 Mart, seems to point in this direction. Also....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren, do come here\" \"Char!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen turn around and come near me, stopping at my feet \"Ren, i have gotten something for you, it's both for training and...pleasure well mine mostly but...\" \"Char?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hand in my backpack and knowing where to look, i get out a little chain with an Everstone attached \"This is an Everstone, it will prevent your evolution into a Charizard, should you reach the necessary power to do so\" Ren look at me with some confusion \"Char? Char rider?\" Quite easy to understand, something like You don't want me to evolve?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly Ren, i want you to evolve, just not now\" \"Char?\" I continue \"It's pretty simple really, first i want you to train at you maximum potential, and if you evolve too fast, considering that your stats is already quite hight due to the binding, all the other opponent that we will find won't do much in helping you grow\" Ren nod, she seems to have understood, good<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, well......you see...ok, fucking you in Charizard form would be pretty difficult and frankly i prefer to handle you at you actual size, at least for now, got it?\" Ren doesn't seems surprised of my second reason, actually she seems quite happy about my decision. I was right, the binding has changed Ren probably already lusty nature, in a whore, or at least for me. Before at the start of our little outing,  we meet a very interested Quilava, she didn't even get him the time to start courting her, that Quilava found himself bashed in a shelf, that subsequently fallen on his head. Instant KO. I should ask if i can use That at the next gym, i am sure that they will at least agree that is quite the flashy move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen nod vigorously and with what seems to be a sensual tone \"Charrrr, cha char chaaaarrrr\" I hope not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her \"Wear it\" I pass the chain and she wear it immediately. Feigning to examine her new chain, she go down on all four and exposing herself completely, than looking back at me \"Charrrrrr\" and slowly she walk away, always keeping the posture. Damn slut, i will end up fucking them both here and now, i must focus. \"Breeeeoooon\" I get it Dera, you are jealous<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the most condescending tone i can muster \"Dera, i did it only because i must, i have not forget about you, ok?\" I tell her with more sincerity as possible, being the truth is not difficult at all \"Breon!\" She believe me, at least trust is not an issue here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of walk, i decide that i should finally test if my..well how to call it? power? ability? not sure, if i can really bind with any pokemon i want and if i can redirect feeling and emotion trough another being. Lust, will be a good start, it's not that i can try something else at the moment so....let's do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mention my plan to Dera and Ren, and they both agree to give it a try, but they both seems Very reluctant to add any other pokemon to the bind, we'll see i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to look for potential prey, i would like something decently big, but not excessively so. Decided my engagement parameter for the test, i start to carefully analyze the environment is search for my next....victim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour of worthless searching, i still haven't found a suitable test case and i will never try that on a bug, especially not one big as me, although certain...no! Focus, something more fluffy? no anything decent will do. When i start thinking that i am just losing my time, a big flying pokemon land on a tree nearby. Looking i notice that it's a Pidgeot, i point my dex at it and after a few moment i got the result, female. Well at least i won't have any bad surprise, the estimated statistic aren't bad so i decide to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dera, Ren i want to try my...attract? at that Pidgeot, be ready ok?\" They both nod, but then \"Breon Breo on\" \"Char, meleon char\" They both make a negative sign with their head, they don't approve it as a new member. Will that influence....no matter, let's try and see.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pidgeot are ignoring me, so i move a little closer, not sure what range limit this supposed influence that i should be able to exert, has. I stop not too distant from her roosting place, then i start to focus on my inner lust, gathering as much as i can. First nothing, but then i fell myself getting hot, excited and i fell my lust rising, i hold it until the boiling point, then like an incubus would probably do, i release it all at once facing the Pidgeot. I fell like something has been removed from me, myself cooling down, the excitement doesn't leave me tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more second, i notice that the Pidgeot start showing an erratic behavior, she seems bothered by something, constantly ruffling her feathers, then her sharp eyes fall upon me. She stare at me like i was a juicy bug, and i could have swear the she has started salivating. After nearly a minute of staring contest she quickly spread her wing and land not a meter from me, never losing her sight of me. Then she slowly start coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel the heat of her body from here, i could have swear that this Pidgeot was truly a Blaziken in disguise, and after she has reached me, i could literally feel the incredible lust in her eyes, the need, desperate to be fulfilled. I may have exaggerated a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgeot bring her beak near my face and look at me intently, then she shift her attention to my crotch, and after what seems to be a good sniffing she extent her short tongue and try to lick at my cock through the shorts. I stop her and she look at me with a fire that i cannot understand, then she turn around and extend her wigs, exposing herself completely, she submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cloaca is open, swollen and drip fluid continuously, pulsing with a need than only a good rutting could placate. She look at me from her lowered position, she is at perfect height, and with a small \"pid geoo\" she invite me in. I bring my hand to her opening and try to push, as soon as my finger got in, her cloaca pulse and close gripping at my fingers desperately, she is far colder that Dera but still quite hot, and very well lubricated, also the bump inside would probably do wonders to my cock. I try to remove my hand but the suction is quite strong, i have to pull with a certain effort to be able to it get out, she will definitely suck me dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she had enough teasing, i remove my pants and under, throwing them aside, i want her now. I pointing my now quite hard cock at her entrance and push in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as my organ touch her inside she push back, impaling herself fully. Her walls contact madly, trying to bring me deeper, her cloaca nearly seal around my cock, the suction is amazing \"Aha! Damn, aha shit! So tight!\" With me sheathed in fully, i try to pull out, only to found that her suction is making such simple task, quite difficult, her walls literally don't want to let me go and i have to pull quite heavily to succeed. When i am finally out, i notice that a small part of her cloaca as come out as well, the suction is so strong the i literally have to force my way out, it's so fucking hard to not cream her here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resist, barely and push myself in with all the strength i can muster, and she welcome me back inside, i don't think that i will resist long, but hell if I don't try. I manage to give her some good solid thrust and her suction diminish, at least enough to permit my movement, from what i can see, she is already in limbo, letting me have my way with her as i see fit, and i decide that pounding her to the ground is my next objective. I start putting more and more strength in my push, and she is slowly but surely going down, then with a good shove, i finally top her down. With her beak on the ground, i start to really give her the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pound that hole, now that the lubrication permit me, with my whole weight, and i manage to go a little deeper, until i finally manage to fell my tip reach the bottom of her hole. I am getting tired far faster then expected but i won't relent, and resolute to enjoy her fully i continue in my prehistoric dance, finally managing to bring some appreciative vocalization from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how much time has passed but i know that she is close, her lust induced heat has probably increased her sensitivity a lot, i feel her suction becoming stronger, and the pulse of her cloaca becoming shorter and faster, until finally, she came. \"Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!\" Saliva drool down her beak while her walls start to collapse on my tool, i can't hold it, it's a miracle i reached here already. \"Ahhh, take it! Take it all you slut!\" I release, my seed travel from my penis to her needy insides, trying to fertilize an incompatible egg, still in an unready state. Her pulse give no sign of stopping anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt require nearly 5 minutes before her suction slow enough for me to speak, she has literally try so suck me dry, and she is still weakly attempting. Her cloaca is still quite well sealed, and while i can move, i still can't get out without harming her considerably, so i wait, recovering my stamina and reminding myself to never use all that lust on a single pokemon ever again. She seems to relax, but as soon as i attempt to pull myself out, her cloaca grip my cock again, inviting me to remain in; my repeated try seems only to arouse her again, and she start to trust back, effectively locking me inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point i know that only when she will be too tired to resist i would be able to get out. Steeling myself, i start mating her once again. Her posture didn't change but her wings are now nearly to the ground and her still very needy, pulsing hole remind me of how much seed i have already deposited inside, but she doesn't care, until she is conscious she wont release her mate, making it quite clear pushing back every time i pull myself too far. At this point i decide to use my remaining strength and forcing her to the ground, i start mating her roughly, not caring about her pain, witch seems to only stimulate her more, but if i can overload her senses, maybe i can knock her out, at least i hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frenzy of this dance bring her to another orgasm, and i continue to pound her as much as i can, until finally, i provoke her in a second release in a row, then, i finally, painfully let myself go, filling her with all the remaining cum i have. \"Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">iiiii</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">iiii</font>\" Finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait until her walls stop pulsing, and only then i slowly attempt my escape. It require more than a minute for fully extracting myself. My cock is drenched in her fluid and her cloaca, still quite open, release our combined cum. I look at my handiwork, painting heavily, more thirsty than i ever remember to have been. The Pidgeot is unconscious or at least in a dazed state, her beak opened, touching the ground, with her small tongue on the side, her feather completely ruffed and her back raised from the ground with her cloaca still partially opened with our fluid soaking the ground beneath, trying to invite it's missing part in once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit that that was quite the ride, perhaps i should keep her....no bad idea, if the lust induced heat pass she may be quite pissed, or worse, needy once more. I leave her here, maybe an unlucky male will believe to have found an easy prey, poor fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at my two very amused, grinning pokemon, and with a dirty look, i recover my undergarments and leave this plain behind, faster as possible. Well as soon as my penis stop hurting at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote to self: Never use this ability at it's full potential Ever Again, or at least not against one pokemon, maybe just at all. Feeling my connection with both my pokemon my body is recovering pretty fast, even if i am still quite tired. Maybe, as i should have expected, i don't fell any connection with the Pidgeot, only with my two little pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am quite content however, i don't think that i would have survived unscathed another such performance anytime soon, or at least not now. Fast as i can we leave this place behind, hoping in a peaceful, quite rest for the evening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I walk forward trying to remind myself that i have brought this upon myself, while the now dull ache is slowly disappearing, my tiredness do not, and i decide that we should make camp soon, if nothing else, to prepare for my search. I haven't forgotten my little pet project, discovering what Team Rocket has really been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, most of my attention is focused on where i could fine a good camping place, that and the dull ache in my guts. Luck seems to favor me as i spot what seems to be an empty patch of ground not far from the path, a perfect camping place, secluded and with enough space to stretch both mine and my little pest legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i drop the backpack and unlatch the tent, my two little slut make sure to remind me of my little misadventure with the Pidgeot by keeping their tail as hight as possible, showing their privates and by constantly smiling, oh I'll make you both pay for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i mentally scroll down all the sexual torture that i know, admittedly not many, i notice Ren coming excitedly towards me \"Char! cha char der!\" while pointing her claw deeper in the forest, i understand that she must have discovered something so, i order Dera to stay here and, with mild intrigue, i follow her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i am getting towed inside the forest by my little lizard, i notice that we are following a well hidden path, only now i notice the difference, i whisper to her \"Good work Ren\" She nod, and looking at me i feel a sense of proudness coming from her, then we continue undisturbed. Not a minute later i notice Ren slowing and, with a cleaver deduction, i understand that our objective must be pretty close, so i crouch down and, moving stealthy as possible while being lead by a lizard with a fire on her tail, or her tail on fire? i decide to hide us in the biggest bushes i could find, only then reminding myself that a tail on fire and bushes does not mix well together, so while i prepare myself to treat my probably painful burns, i notice that Ren tail does not ignite anything just by touching it. Relieved of the worry about strange cream and bothersome nurse, i start focusing my attention on what i am seeing ahead of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few meter ahead i can easily notice a quite big ventilation shaft planted on the ground, sealed from the inside it's seems. This tell me that with a shaft this big, the base must not be far and that it's probably quite big, i can also reasonably assume that such structure would be well defended. Making sign to Ren to follow, i start searching for a possible weakness or anything that could lead us inside, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe start scouting the area without noticing anything interesting, when minutes later from a distance, i see what seems to be a grunt entering the base using a keycard on the front door, a plan start forming in my head, but i decide that i need more detail if i want to use this way, later. For now Both Ren and me, withdraw back to our camp, maybe a good rest will bring me counsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe return was uneventful and i am confident that we have not been discovered during our little reconnaissance, so while i start to formulate possible plans, the last sting of what was a bothersome ache leave me, the reminder of my activity return to me, i evidently exaggerated with the Pidgeot, pushing too much lust, i believe that if i wasn't able to daze her out, she wouldn't have let me go, asking me to mate her all night, i don't even want to know how long the effect will last, probably quite a while tough. I was pretty lucky all considered, what would have happened if my \"victim\" was a Aggron or a Nidoqueen, a shiver run through my spine, still i am alive and mostly intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to question how such ability even exist, or why. I will get answer however, one way or my way. Perhaps i can use this, i am curios if it will works on pokemon of others trainer, gym leader for example.......now that it's an interesting idea, i will try it when the opportunity arise. My two pokemon seems restless but i am tired, so i decide that tomorrow we will seek another way in, and with luck, i will find the necessary details for such endeavor. Maybe i should wait and ambush one of their executive, will see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the tent, i put myself on the sleeping bag, and keeping the tent open, i mention to Dera and Ren to come in. As i lay down, both of them climb on me, Ren on my stomach and Dera on my chest. We all fall asleep in minutes.</span></div></div>",

After having found a good hiding spot, i can finally see who is attacking the structure, or perhaps i should say what remain of this side of the building, not much really<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes are caught by an enormous Tyranitar, clawing and bashing at the reinforced walls, tearing trough the heavy looking steel bars like nothing while a trainer incite it to demolish the whole structure, jeeze got up with the wrong foot today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a slight push on my sides, i turn to look at Dera and Ren who seems unimpressed by the big pokemon display, a would daresay nearly bored even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass, our presence still undiscovered by both the building inhabitants that until now didn't show themselves, neither by the trainers that are attacking the building, i can't see the others from this position but i can still hear their screaming for blood, i don't blame the Rockets for hiding, if the authority don't show up soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when i am start to think that the Rockets won't risk an improvised escape, an hidden door silently open sliding inside the external walls, finally. As soon as the door is fully opened, one inconspicuous looking person with common civilian clothes, come out in the open and quickly try to run towards our hiding position...hehehe like a mouse to the cheese<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sign to my team to stand ready, but as i look at them, they are already charging up an attack, didn't i have already said that i love smart pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unaware victim is getting close to our position fast, and as soon as he reach us Ren place herself in front of him and feign a slash? Why Ren what are you...the frightened human kick Ren which immediately answer with a punch to the guts, effectively knocking out our prey.....I recognize the move, Counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit that i am impressed by Ren efficiency, she knew that a normal attack would probably grievously harm the unaware human, and try to attack him in another softer way, may have given him time to release it's pokemon removing the advantage of surprise, after all we don't know what pokemon he may carry with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever i admit to be also quite amused, after all while a wild Charmeleon may knew Counter, it's not in the standard moveset, and curiously i check the dex for confirmation...yes i was right, counter can be learned by breeding, specifically with..well, there are various possible partner but Meganium....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI momentarily lose myself for a few moments, imagining a Charmeleon or even a Charizard mounted by a Meganium...now i understand why Ren is so slutty, after all it's well known that grass type, especially the Bayleef are quite whorish pokemon, more ofter then not offering themselves to their trainer in many occasion, sometimes even in public<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover from my distraction and look at the downed rocket member and a very proud looking Ren, that start to look at me with what i now recognize to be lust, yep it's seems that a certain fire pokemon liked it green \"No Ren, i will...reward you later\" she doesn't stop staring but at least seems to calm down..\"Char char\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel towards our guest and try to look for any distinctive feature, while i also remove it's pokeballs, i better keep them sealed, it's also well known that team rocket drugs their own pokemon for making them more powerful in battle, sadly it will also make them very aggressive and usually difficult to control, also i don't want to take any chances right now, maybe later or perhaps i just bring them to the nearest center and that's it, i don't want a junkie in my team, beside they probably need help<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI order Dera and Ren to pin him while i lay him on it's back, then i prepare my best evil grin, and ready myself for a good old interrogation, pokemon style...</span></div></div>",

I want answers but there is no need for excessive violence\" Ren nod and remove her clawed fingers from the man crotch, and push it on the man stomach instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Dera and notice that she is pinning our victim by standing on his chest, pointing her fang at his neck, definitely not a good way to wake up, oh well, the Rockets deserve this and more...probably, no matter i should prepare my question list, i must appear decisive and focused on...shit Dera<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dera will you please lower your tail? It doesn't exactly help me focusing here..\" Dera turn her head towards me, smiling like a fool, then without changing posture, resume her probably soon to be effective intimidation work. I not even dare to look at Ren, instead i kneel near the man face and slap it loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Slap</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man start to regain consciousness and i realize that Dera distraction did effectively make me forget to formulate some question beforehand, i sigh, thinking that these two will be the end of me one day, then i quickly recover my stern expression and, moving in front of him i place myself in a position that should make my face appear just above Dera threatening grin, then i wait for our victim to wake up fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't require more then a minute before the man open his tired eyes, of course one of the first thing he do, is trying to move his hand, a motion punished swiftly by Ren who, with her right claws lightly starch our victim that promptly try to get up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Grrrrrrrrrrr</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera is quite good at this. The man eyes widen in fear as he hear Dera warning growl, of course he also try to crawl away, an action stopped by Ren that, jumping forward bury part of her right claw on the soft ground purposefully missing the man shoulder by an inch. At this point, the scared rocket member try another obvious move, trying to reach for his pokeballs, i decide that this is my cue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the most ironic voice i could master \"Looking for this?\" The man shrunken pupil immediately turn towards my voice while i show one of his, now not anymore, balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man try to calm himself down, recovering a semblance of a normal behavior, then with an arrogant tone: \"Kid give me back what's mine or..\" Ren interrupt him by jumping at the man genital and slashing away his pants, then she place the tip of her claw at the man penis: \"Charrrr! Cha cha Charrrr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man got the hint and shut up, and while i am grinning on the outside, i start to get a little worried, Ren is showing quite the aggressiveness in dealing with this man, perhaps she has a bone to pick with rockets or she just don't like this poor human, i just hope that she won't react this way every time someone say anything unnecessary at me, that could bring us more problem then we need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing my thoughts aside, i keep my tone and ask: \"If you haven't already got the hint, i explain you the rules, I ask, You answer, period\" The man try to give a forced laugh but get interrupted by Dera Growl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then continue: \"I don't care about morals or ethic, nor i do care in how many pieces this interrogation will be concluded, but....i assure you, if you refuse my questioning it will be more then one, starting with those\" I point at his genitals while saying the last word, and at this, our victim understand his position and dropping his macho expression, nervously nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, let's start with: What in the nine hells are you doing here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nervously pass his look upon a pissed Dera, then looking at me: \"I..eh..well..i don't..know much, just.\" Lies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head slowly in an universal negation sign: \"No, no, no. A common grunt wouldn't have know of the secret escape route you just used, so cut the bullshit or i cut your balls, your choice\" I am not serious, i won't have emasculated him, but i would have certainly given him a nice remember me by<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nervously gobble some saliva: \"Ok, ok look, i really don't know much but this laboratory beside that is specialized in bioengineering, specifically cloning\" Cloning? Don't tell me that they have tried to clone a legendary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disbelieving tone: \"What? Last time with Mewtwo wasn't enough? You really think to be able to play Arceus and think there that will be no consequences? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man calm a little but it still quite nervous: \"Well..yeah\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdiot's, you can always counts on Team Rockets doing their mistake twice, maybe thrice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover my normal tone, adding a bored feeling to it: \"So what was you trying to clone this time\" I don't even bother do add in an interrogating manner, this fool clearly doesn't worth the effort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocket member try to move his left arm, only to find himself nearly bitten in the throat: \"Ok ok! I won't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI add: \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man start to speak again, barely breathing afraid of Dera retaliation: \"Raikou, we capture him and try to clone a partner for...breeding\" Breeding, they wanted to..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have wanted to breed Raikous? For what? An army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answer with a tone similar to an excuse: \"Not me! Them! Well okay me too but..i am just an underling, only the hight officer know most of the plans! Really i was just executing orders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hand under my chin in a thinker pose, ok so maybe i can get in unnoticed and see it for myself, i don't think that it would be a wise move try to capture a very pissed Raikou, but perhaps if i gain his gratitude something..bah, better releasing him..or her? than leaving it with the rockets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are the codes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe look at me confused: \"Code of..\" I interrupt angrily: \"<b>Don't play dumb with me, you must know the security code for Raikou cage!</b> You just admitted your position by getting out of that door\" I point at the secret exit \"So what are the security codes? I won't ask again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera lower her head and nearly touch the man face as she look straight into his eyes: \"Alright ...give them to you..but can i go afterwards? Really i can't..\" Nope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it! we will see, you try to lie more then once, and i don't take kindly on people that try to make me pass for a fool, but if you have the codes, you will probably be able to have children one day..\" On my cue Ren slightly press her claw down, i also notice than Ren isn't excited at all despite the man position, so she is behaving like a slut only with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scared: \"Yes! Yes i have them, do..do you have a pen?\" I reply: \"Unneeded, i have good memory\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the rocket member finish: \"Can i..ehm..leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feign to think about it, then: \"Well...no\" As soon as i said the word, Dera charge a weakened shadow ball and make it explode under the man chin, launching him a few meter in the forest, knocking him out. I try to understand how, after all a human is considered a normal type so...right, she make the charged energy explode before contacting with his skin, so it was the shock wave that pushed him away...smart<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid i have already say that i love smart pokemon? Yes? Well ok, i really do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover and congratulate with my team: \"Good work, both of you. Now let's see what's inside shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char char\" \"Umbreoooooooon\" They both look annoyed, yeah i got it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look i know that it could be a trap, but they are quite occupied with the other trainers and none of them will suspect our infiltration from the secret exit there, come on i want to see if they really tried to clone Raikou\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI store the reduced rocket balls in my pockets, not comfortable but it will do, and start to walk towards the secret door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth my pokemon look at each others then nods, finally we will see what all this mess is about, and if we will finally get answer or just more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy instinct tell me that we will find both.</span></div></div>",

Not even 2 seconds later Dera already reach the opened door and slide in. I admit, i knew that Dera was fast, but this fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering my wits, i look towards Ren who nod, and while slower then Dera, she too sports quite the speed. Happy than no scream come from the secret door, i too quickly cover the relatively short distance and let myself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs could be expected the small passage lead to a well lighted room that seems to be used as an archive of some sort, with long shelves full of different colored folder, all unnamed; this room remind me of a secretary's office. I ignore the small ocean of useless documentation, and regrouping with my team we proceed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office door open on a darkened disproportionate corridor, now partially ruined with broken fluorescent lamp attached to the ceiling by feeble strings, small spark coming from the wires still in the plastic casing. Fortunately there is still enough light to go around, and with the utmost cation we proceed following the partially ruined placards resembling a chemistry set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming noise from the pokemon outside bashing on the structure wall make the atmosphere a little claustrophobic, and piece of roof falling down here and there, give me the feeling that the general structural integrity of this place may not last long<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move team, we must find the cloning lab and leave, i have no intention of getting us crushed under tons of rubble\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breo!\" \"Char!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera take the lead as her near perfect night-vision allow us to run avoiding most obstacle with ease, also i notice how she look at the placards affixed on the walls proving once again how dark type has a nearly perfect eyesight in the dark, wouldn't mind having that ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring our running we encounter no human nor pokemon, or at least until we reach some heavy looking sliding double doors with a green light flashing over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breo bre on?\" It seems that we have reached our destination, after all this is the only section of the building that seems mostly intact, probably heavily reinforced against assault from outside and probably given the nature of their work, from the inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven here most lamp are busted, but the red light coming from a panel at the right side of the doors give me all the illumination i need for clearly distinguish the keys of keyboard attached to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dera, Ren, flank the door as soon as i unlock it target the first humans you see and try to knock them out, then we try our luck with Raikou or whatever creature they have cloned\"  There is a good possibility that a few scientist are in there, trying to secure for transportation the precious creature in their ^custody^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth nod at my instruction, Dera taking the left while Ren the right; I calmly walk to the panel and pressing down the keyboard, the light suddenly become a bright yellow.<br>\r\nDamn it! If they can see the light indicator from the other side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly punch down the 2 codes given to me by our blabber friend and sure enough the light turn green; the door noisily release what seems to be a it's magnetic lock and promptly open<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDera and Ren jump inside the the small fissure as soon as is large enough from them<br>\r\nFrom the inside of the lab: \"What the..What..<b>Bam</b>Ahhhhhh!\" <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>Crack</i></font>....Is that snap what i think it is....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door take nearly half minute to fully open allowing me inside<br>\r\nThe lamp here are intact and the bright light nearly blind me for a second, then walking in i notice 3 important things:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The snapping sound i heard is outside is exactly what i tough it would be, my team near a man in lab coat unconscious against the wall, with an arm bent in an unnatural way, probably when he try to shield himself with his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Raikou is really here, behind strong looking bars of what seems to be a sort of graysh copper, with polarity rods attached to it's extremities<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) A creature floating in a tank full of what i believe is nutritious fluid, the same used for accelerated growth in in genetic labs, nearly identical to the Raikou behinds the bars, only smaller and more....sinuous, a respirator mask attached to it's muzzle, a fluffier tail and no star-mustache, no frontal protruding teeth, and when my eyes fall down on her proportionate strangely attractive body, a vagina is clearly visible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn artificial, metallic voice loudly interrupt my observation: \"<u><i>Enjoy clone view?</i></u>\"<br>\r\nI turn towards the source of the voice, ready to issue commands to my poke, only to find the immobile form of Raikou staring at me, his lips move and the metallic voice return<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><i>Yes, me, called thunder god.....your service</i></u>\"...what the....i look up to the ceiling over the small cell, and my suspect are confirmed; cables are attached to the speakers side, connected to a what seems to be a quantum computer, the same that probably control the whole lab</span></div></div>",

I press the button and the text ^Transl^ disappear from the lower part of the monitor along with a screeching noise coming from the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rai ko kou rai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth my pokemon nod, he continue: \"Raiko rai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain both nod, enthusiastically this time, again: \"Raikou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time both Dera and Ren look embarrassed, but happily nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char char chaaaaarrrrr\" Ren tone become quite suggestive, i think that i know what they are talking about<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbreee um breoooon\" Right, yeah i love my pokemon physically, so what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou nod, a smile on his muzzle: \"Rai ko?\" Both my pokemon look at me with a predatory smile, then turning to him, they nod again. At this point Raikou look straight at me and press down his paw repeatedly, i understand and turn on the translator<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speak with a decisive tone: \"<u><i>Interesting, bound with both?</i></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply with a calm tone: \"Yes, they are my family and my lovers\" At the word lovers, Dera and Ren look at me lovingly and i add: \"They are mine, body and soul\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou nod, convinced: \"<u><i>Good, then free me, take her</i></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply a little surprised: \"Take her, you mean with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod and continue: \"<u><i>Take her, dominate her fully, breed her, when she yours i safe and both happy</i></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tone return normal: \"You want me to bind her to me?

Looking thought the glass i see Eve playing tag with the kneeling human, ok so far so good. Now as i try to look for a quite way in my sight fall on Eve and my jaw hit the floor. Eve is leaking, and she is rubs herself against the human crotch. Fuck! Little sister what in Tartarus?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human look flabbergasted but doesn't stop her, instead he put an hand on her rump and start rubbing. Da Fuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment later the human push Eve away and start rubbing her slick, dripping pussy. Eve start moaning. I can't hear them but shit i can see them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy snatch is leaking badly, while the human start pushing his finger inside my sister. What in the!

I'm busy here! \"Whats going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO I'll tell you \"Well dearest sisters, it's seems that Eve is getting fingered from the human just now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Ohh the best chorus in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyesa than \"Let me see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve is presenting herself now, lowering her muzzle on the ground and giving to the human, and us, an unobstructed view of her very aroused love box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human reaction doesn't disappoint. He hastily remove is garments, his very erect cock pointing at the sky. The human then kneel behind Eve and start rubbing his cock up and now her wet snatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am flooding right now, and Eyesa isn't fairing any better, her eyes fixed on the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI return to the scene and look as the human start pushing is cock in. Normally Eve would need to be properly prepared being her snatch not made for a human cock, but with her heat, the juice are literally flooding down her legs and the human have no problem cramming himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve moan loudly, even behind the window i can hear her. The human push in as much as he can, probably bottoming on her cervix, then after extracting himself he push in again. There on the floor my sister is getting bred for the first time by a human, and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human get his tempo quickly and establish a nice rhythm. Eve just moan loudly and pant has her tongue lol out of her muzzle, her flank firmly in the human hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve being this her first time doesn't resist for long and after a few quick paced trust she came, the human however don't stop, and continue to mate her relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyesa get replaced by Shade while i continue to watch the mating pair. It's only after a good 12 minutes and at least 4 Eve orgasm that the human quicken his pace, and finally come inside her. His seed flood my sister snatch in but a few moments and start dripping on the floor. The human keep himself in the whole time, then after he has finished, remove is cock from Eve snatch and seat to the ground. Eve remain in position, leaking his seed from her still open pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade look at the human with an hunger i can easily understand, i think that a change of plan is in order. If the human i willing to relieve us, then i have no intention of going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve look behind to the human and shake her rump, leaking even more seed. The human got the message and kneel behind her again. He is mating her again! He has already recovered?! Just like that the human cock rise one more and without hesitation sink inside Eve once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point i am desperate, i need a cock, i want his cock, NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was it I couldn't hold it anymore and came straight on the Jolteon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jolteon ON!\" The jolteon said happily licking everything up every lick I felt small bursts of electricity flow through me. \"AH!\" I can't say anything other then that word the Jolteon then decided it was time and quickly aligned herself with me then quickly slammed herself on my cock I felt an Extreme flow of electricity on me I couldn't believe it I couldn't move before but now I can barely stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jolteon wasn't as tight as Eevee but, the electrifying pleasure made up for it, The Eevee just watched rubbing herself with her paw and licking all the liquid that fell out of that pink love hole, while the Jolteon happily humped me if I could move I'd push her because of the electricity but... I have feeling that she won't as easy, and... it did feel good I'd probably push her in anyway so.. yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jolteon quickly came but didn't stop. The more she came the more excited she got and the more electricity I felt... Well she is an electric type so this should be expected. It took a while but I finally came in her, she had already came two times and when I came she did too. That's when she stopped but didn't remove herself until I was done, that's when I noticed the large puddle below me. The jolteon looked calm but lust was still in her eyes...</span></div></div>",

With determination in her eyes she order her remaining sister to wait while she go in try to sort this mess out, perhaps if they are lucky, the human will be in a acceptable condition to relieve at last another, or if she can gain his trust, making him take the herbs that she has collected and transported nearby, capable of boosting physical performance, hopefully the mix of her invention will increase his virility has well.

I haven't asked the most brilliant question in human history, but bear with me, i am naked, i was just forced to mate with a crazed looking Jolteon, an Umbreon have just tried to force me to breed her, and an Eevee, is licking my seed out of her pussy while staring at me like i was her next meal! So sorry i have have freaked out a moment\"<br>\r\nYou say with the most sarcastic tone possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Espeon look at you for a moment, then look at your partial aroused state \"<i>You didn't like it?</i>\" Shocked. What the hell of a question is that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i liked it, nothing forced me to breed Eevee, i wanted to, but this is getting a little awkward\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A little? Why?

Better, maybe i have underestimated him, after all Lia Has interrupted him mating Eve, and having a Jolteon break your window and jump your bone while said organ is being showered with electricity, must not be a pleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Than will you help us?</i>\" putting on my best predatory grin, i can threaten him, but maybe it won't be necessary and i can make his whole ordeal better for us all.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Human Pow----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\nOk, why not, i admit it i want them, but i will not be used like a toy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, i will mate with you, but...there are condition\" The Espeon look at me with annoyance but still reply \"<i>What condition human?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are getting result, finally \"First call me (yourname), second i choose in what order and how, third no raping and last.......i ehh........i will.....have the chance of keeping you when this all is over\" She look a little shocked but recover her facade \"<i>Keeping us?

Well the persian is out of the bag now, let's hope...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Espeon face contort from a scared grin to a creepy one, the same you will have if you would have just found a gold mine in your walk at the park, ever saw that film?

That one, same grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Really now, i can't answer for my sisters, but i am willing, altrought we may not being able to remain here all the time, we have a cave not far from here, we will stay there or hunting when we are not here</i>\"  You release the breath you don't know you where holding \"Fair enough, so ehh, can we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh yes definitely, you may want to start with Shade tough</i>\" \"Shade, who..ahh!\" The Umbreon just got on her hind legs and pressing her muzzle on my erect penis, she start licking it, her crimson eyes tell me that she won't accept any more delay. \"Ok Shade, i will start with you, will you ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tackle me on the ground, \"Bre!

I thought as the insane looking Umbreon excitedly rubbed herself on my now hard cock... This feeling... What is it? \"Bre bre!\" The Umbreon said now aligning herself with ready to push herself down and get penetrated. I was about to say something but as soon as I opened my mouth Shade quickly threw her hips down easily sliding my cock into her already dripping love box \"AAhH!!\" What is this... I feel so sluggish why? Wait this feels just like that crazy Jolteon! I get it now Shade's a dark type... This Eve I think she's the Eevee is a normal type and the Crazy one thunder! 'So... That's it...' \"AH!\" This dark, sluggish sensation I feel so tired... It feels as if she's sucking all my energy... I look down at Shade now seeing a PURE evil smile creeping across her face... 'Well it suits her...' Each second her pace quickens even though she still looks crazy especially with that look on her face at least it feels like she knows what she's doing. \"Umbre bre!! *Purr* \" That sounded sensual or excited she looks at me that smile never leaved her face. She then laid herself down on my stomach slowly licking it purring with each lick. She's lazily lying down my stomach licking it while still humping me, and she STILL has enough time to purr with each lick! Is she even trying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------Eyesa's POV-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks relaxed what's wrong with the human is that weak? or is it something else? I look at Shade then at Lia still struggling with my psychic I then remove the field on her mouth <u>Why did you try to ruin the plan?</u> I asked annoyed with her weak will power <u>I didn't ruin anything Eve's the one who ruined it!</u> She said still trying to break my field but when Eve heard her name she happily hopped over to where we were stepping on my beautiful tail <u>Yes?</u> She asked <u>We didn't ca-</u> <u>Oh hey look! At that thing over there!</u> Eve said interrupting Lia's rant pointing at a strange box with a hole in the middle. When I looked at it I was completely surprised to see that there were more smaller humans moving inside it! <u>W-what is that!?</u> <u>I don't know. But it looks fun!</u> What kind of contraption is this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------Shade's POV-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh I feel alot more better now I know why mother says not to mate with male humans it feels so addicting no wonder the other Pokemon call them exotic, and they recover more quicker then any Pokemon I've seen his skin feels so warm... Hm? The human looks tired but I'm not even doing anything... Oh well I'll worry about that later he's taking so long time to step this up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------Your POV-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Shade's slowing down? What is this I thought she was crazed she's till going she just slowed down alot each hump takes like ten seconds to enter and remove herself... What is this is she really taking me this seriously! Lazy position, lazy humping, even the licks, and purrs got lazy. She then suddenly raised herself from this position... I have a bad feeling other then the side effect she's giving me. I strained to raise my head and as soon as I opened my mouth she quickly started moving at blinding speed! Wait this- ah i-is Agility, a-and Quick Attack!!! \"AAAAHHHHH!!!\" I t-thought I said no Rape! probably wasn't listening I can barely move with out feeling tired and then she uses this! I already came during that Espeons POV and now this she doesn't even warn me. Shade move's her hips back and forth closing her legs from time-to-time just to make herself fell more tighter then it already is (It's super effective). 'A-at l-l-least she's not using double team...' I thought... I'd be in real trouble if she did...</span></div></div>",

Since he will be able to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSight, alright but he better be appreciative of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk near the lust frenzied Shade, and the quickly fading human, his energy won't last for long, if this continue he may fall into coma, i must intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing all the energy i could gather in my forehead crystal, i gently touch his head, and start transferring what shade has drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your Pow-----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMy tiredness fade, my vision returning, i feel a lot better, what, oh, the Espeon! She must be giving me her energy! I should tank her later, or maybe i should just punish this naughty, wild Umbreon. If she don't learn to stop sucking my essence, i won't mate her, ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shade\" She look at me with unfocused eyes, she is so absorbed trying to get bred that she haven't even notice my weakness. I then decide that it's for better for me and the Espeon, if i finish her quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab Shade hips with both my hand, effectively stopping her, she immediately look at me with what seems to be anger, but before she could do anything about it, i lift her up, and impale her pushing myself deep as i could go. \"Breeeoon!\" I nearly remove myself only to do the same motion again. and again, and again. \"Breo! Breo! Breo!\"<br>\r\nShe is quite tight, and now that i can feel my limbs again, it's quite pleasurable as well. The tip of my cock it's reaching her deepest part, if i satisfy her completely maybe i can find the time to recover, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeooooooooon!\" Damn, she is literally sucking me in, i can't \"Take it you slut, take it All!\" With this inspired phrase i came, pointing right at her cervix entrance, with this donation she should calm down. I feel my seed leave my cock, and soon after, her full womb dumping the excess out, in a moment of euphoria i push her down, retrieving my shaft from her still clenching pussy, i grip her head and ram my cock in her open muzzle. The effect is immediate, While Espeon lose contact with my forehead, the Umbreon Seat on her haunches and my seed flow straight down her gullet, she doesn't even try to remove me, still fazed from her orgasm, and a few moment later, i release her head. Shade fall down like a sack of potatoes, and a white fluid slowly dribble out from both her extremities while she lay down still in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Quite the work (yournamehere), never seen her so satisfied before, perhaps she will think of you as a possible mate instead of nothing more that a reliving lay</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the Espeon surprised, you euphoria as left you \"Satisfied? I practically force her to blow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes, i am sure that she will appreciate it, she as always liked strong, Very Lightly abusing males, i suppose that being a dark type it's in her nature</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Dark Type \"What was she doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nothing, on purpose at least, dark type can suck away the energy of their opponent, just like i can transfer some to pretty much anything alive, within reason, and Lia can shock you silly. Other effect may happen as you..relieve me and my sister, but don't worry, i will not let them harm you, on purpose or not. And i think that with some practice we should be able to control ourselves, at least well enough</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough? There is anything i can do? I don't want to become a catatonic zombie after having mated with you all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, there Is something you Should Do, and that would be me</i>\" She tell me with and unnerving smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do own you for that little boost before, but it's you sister responsibility if....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she reply \"<i>Yes i know, i apologize on behalf of Shade, beside i don't think that she will be able to for a while at least</i>\" looking to the collapsed, still leaking, well satisfied Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen epiphany \"Didn't you said that you have...more sisters? You didn't really expect to me being able to...well..breed you all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Breeding, why not call it fucking? Isn't a more suiting human term?</i>\" I think on it, but then looking at her i reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not. You may consider me as just an heat relief, but i don't consider you as nothing more that a tight hole to fill\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why not, aren't we?</i>\" That's a way to put it, jeez, and they say that I was obsessed with sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are more that that, i don't know how it work on the wild, but here, or at least in my home, you Will not find Only food and a relief, but.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me expecting, hopeful? \"But also a family, if you wish so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A family, did you wish to bred us then? To give you eggs?</i>\" She seems to laugh at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My future is unknown, my past is but a shadow, but the now is a gift, thats why is called present\" I say to her with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me intently, studying my every word, she look confused, then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Do not worry about eggs, you can't give us any, and we take herbs to prevent conception anyway, so...fell free to pump us full as much as you desire</i>\" She smile again, but this time is bitter, something torment her. I would like to ask her, but alas i cannot, we are not close enough yet, and she my take it as an offense.

My anger slowly dissipate, leaving only lust behind. I thrust forcefully in my new bitch, and a few minutes later, i fill her once again, i keep myself in, she has wanted it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long minute, both my climax and my rage abandon me, my lust mostly sated, for now. The Espeon womb is filled to the brim and she is slightly twitching, i remove myself from her, her pussy walls and even her cervix massage my cock begging me to stay, but i have enough of her, and good part of my seed come out with me. She is conscious but i don't think that she is aware.

Lia...\" She said looking at the jolteon... \"Who are you anyway!\" I asked annoyed with her calmness \"My name is Varia the oldest of our group of sisters... and perhaps the most mature...\" She said moving towards the Eyesa and Shade she then used this I don't know ability...

I think that i will reserve that same treatment to her in the future, perhaps i will be able to make her admit her feelings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile my mind is occupied, my hand involuntary descend toward Shade tail \"Breo?\" i feel dampness on my finger and i immediately recover from my daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breoooon\" I notice that my hand has descended under Shade tail, and i have started to caress her vulva, i want to retract my hand....but i can't, i don't know why but..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to play with my Shade, then before things start to become too hot, i stop, bringing her muzzle close to my face, Shade open her crimson eyes and stare straight into mine, i can clearly see the happiness and the affection towards me. There unexpectedly, she close her eyes and kiss me, and i reciprocate without hesitation. It take at least a minute before we finish and my mind start t process what has actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade return in her original position on my chest, and relax.

I don't think it's bad to mate with humans... But if Chrystal heard me... She'd chase me around like she is with Flare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!!</u> <u>Viria isn't here to save you this time!</u> Looks like Chrystal caught her... I guess I should say something... <u><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I like humans...</font></u> I whispered under my breath... <u>YOU-...

I may seems strange but when the season come Chrystal is actually the shyer of us, despite being the second eldest she has mated far less than any of us, excluded Eve of course, and that lead to a lot of frustration on her part that she promptly release on us at the earliest opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may not have a direct type advantage over her, but her element is not particularly efficient against mine, so i decide to stand my grounds and try to talk civilly with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Chrystal be reasonable, i understand that your pride may be,,disturbed by the idea of mating with a human, but really there is no reason to be this angry!

You refused to mate with all the pokemon that offered! And still you convinced Viria to abandon our old home! Your distrust and ignorance are the cause of all of this! We are alone oh great icequeen, what other inauspicious act you wish us to fulfil your freezeness?!</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal feature now contorted with rage shoot another Icebeam at me, but i counter it with a Flamethrower, the very proof of my claim! She make us abandon our old home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her strength, the anger give me the boost i need to push her attack back, and unexpectedly, Acqua join with Scald and distract Chrystal enough for my attack to hit, causing a small explosion as soon as the pressurized water and my flame touch each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at my stubborn, unmoving sister, that now bear a visible burn on her left side. She should be alight, painful but not really debilitating or anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Acqua: \"<u>We should go, she may get up at any moment and i....i want to...you know the human...it's getting worse</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcqua: \"<u>Viria can deal with her if she persist, beside she is feeling this too, and if not her mind, then her body will force her to see reason, or at least get a good romp and finally..</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal: \"Glaaaaa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>She is getting up!

That's over... I looked over to Eve still mesmerized by the TV, then at the two trouble makers. Well I just hope they learned their lesson... I turned my head to the broken window. 'What could happen next?' I thought sarcastically and right on cue Aqua and Flare jumped through it at the same time and got stuck. With enough squirming they got free and fell straight on the floor.

As the huge Pok\u00e9mon lands in the middle of the front room everyone freezes where they are at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in a line now!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all scramble to get in a line I walk in front of them while others are shivering in fear some are seeming quite calm, but the Glaceon is still looking at me pissed off. I understand that from what Viria said that they were abused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Glaceon decides to charge at me my Charizard decides to protect me by using blast burn\u2026 A little overpowering I admit, but my Charizard although female is very protective of me, The Glaceon fall over with a burn and has trouble getting up as I try to help her understand that attacking me is not going to help the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS I go get some berries I give her them although she wishes not to be fed by me I still force her to eat them I then walk back over by my Charizard and whisper to her to be ready for anything that Crystal decides to pull and tell her to use flamethrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS the Glaceon seems to stopped attacking me knowing that my Charizard will always be ready for anything that she may try as my Charizard knows some of the most powerful fire type moves. She sits and listens I start by telling them that\u2026 \u201cYou guys are destroying my house! If you\u2019re going to live with me I would like it if the house was to stay intact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nod in agreement as I tell them to un-freeze the walls the flareon gets right on it and then afterwards goes back into line I then see what else there is to do\u2026 I see that the wall has and impact mark on it. I then think about what I can do about it\u2026 I decide to move to other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t really see much else that we can check as I then realize I hadn\u2019t mated Viria. I point to her and say \u201cYou come with me.\u201d I turn to my Charizard and say \u201cMake sure they don\u2019t destroy anything else and keep an eye on Crystal.\u201d And me and Viria head up the stair case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we then reach the top of the stair case I pick her up. As I carry her into my room I then look at her she is staring at me like she knows what\u2019s coming next.  As I ask if she is ready from this as some of them were just upon me and not even asking for my approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then nods as I strip my body of my clothing she turns around and then lifts her tail as I soon take her as my own a few minutes later I launch my load into her womb and fall on the bed and rest before I hear a loud boom downstairs I quickly get dresses and then head down with Viria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I get down there I see my Charizard and Crystal fighting it looks like crystal has taken quite a lot of damage and still firing ice beams at quick reloads while my Charizard is just as quickly using flamethrower countering her ice beams she finally is slowing down while my Charizard is soon just moving left and right as it seems all the energy of Crystal is slowly waning out as she has used a lot of her energy just firing all them fast attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I run over and stop her as she slowly charges a large beam which I am guessing is a blizzard attack. I soon pick her up and ask if she is okay? She simply leans on me tired. Obviously not caring that she is laying on me I softly sit her on a pillow. As I run and get several berries which I handily keep in a greenhouse in my back yard my mom and dad didn\u2019t see how it was relevant, but after a while they soon agreed that if I could take good care of it I could have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I come back and slowly feed the weak Glaceon she is slowly looking at me as it looks like she is kind of opening her heart to me she looks at me softly before falling asleep I look at Viria as she walks up to me saying \u201cI think you have actually gotten through her cold heart Jaden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at the sight of the sleeping Ice Type I keep my Charizard out just in case something happens while I go upstairs and take a shower as I get in the shower I hear scratches on my door knowing very well it\u2019s one of the Eevee\u2019s. I finish and open the door to see none other than Crystal at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not who I exactly expected at the door I figured it would be one of the other Eevee\u2019s, but none the less she comes up to me after I am dressed and jumps on my lap as I look at her she turns around and raises her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her as she didn\u2019t trust anyone at first and I say \u201cWait are you sure you want this?\u201d She turns around and looks at me after lowering her tail she looks at me with some of the saddest eyes I have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at me and then nods turns around and I then proceed to mate her and after a few short minutes I paint her insides white. And I then get dressed to head downstairs and make me my Eevee\u2019s and Charizard dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon get done as we eat, after we get done eating it is time for bed I recall my Charizard and then head up to my room where the Eevee\u2019s run and jump on my bed. I look at them and ask a question I probably already know the answer to. \u201cLet me guess you want to sleep with me?\u201d They all nod I simply reply \u201cOk, get off the bed so I can get in it then you can join me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all then get off as I get in they then crowd near me as I hug and kiss each on before saying \u201cGood night.\u201d I hear them all reply \u201cEevee, Glaceon, Flareon, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Umbreon, Espeon, and Goodnight Jaden.\u201d From Viria I forgot she can speak English and Pokemon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Spewing flames from its mouth Monferno flips forward speeding towards the doomed grass and ice type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning wheel easily plows through the Snover, immolating and crushing it into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job\u201d you praise your Pok\u00e9mon before you return it to its ball. You take a moment and just stand for a moment. A slight movement at the edge of your vision draws your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArceus Damn it\u201d you turn to face the next Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ll do battle with. Standing in the snow is a Sneasel, \u201cAgain with this bullshit\u201d you pull out a pokeball and press the release only to have the sneasel snatch it out of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give that back you lit-mph\u201d the sneasel throws a snowball, hitting you in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re begging for this, GO SHIELDON!\u201d you roar as you pitch one of your pokeballs only to have it ripped from your grasp as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSne sne sne\u201d the offending dark type snickers at your frustration. At a loss, you make a snowball of your own and throw it at the sneasel. To your surprise you hit it dead on, the snow covering its face. Wiping the snow from its face the sharp claw Pok\u00e9mon grins wickedly and places your pokeballs neatly on the ground, before gathering a large snowball together and throwing it at you. Despite being snow it is thrown with quite a bit of force and knocks you off balance as it hits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation you throw a volley of your own snowballs, enjoying yourself despite the situation. The impromptu snowball fight escalates until the both of you are just plain laughing as you hurl chunks of snow at each other. Eventually one of the Sneasels projectiles causes you to overbalance and fall on your ass. Sneasel is on you in an instant, sitting on your lap gazing up at you with a smile. You gently pet its head as you catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a girl\u201d you mumble absently as you run your finger down the short crest extending from her ear. Sneasel leans against you with a soft \u201cSnea\u201d. Your hand works its way over to her ears and rub them gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneasel mumbles happily as you scratch behind her ears. The silence is broken by your ringtone, loud obnoxious, and impossible to ignore. You slide it out of your pocket and answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d \u201cWhere are you, you were supposed to be here half an hour ago\u201d \u201cMom, relax I was on my way over and I got sidetracked. I\u2019ll be there soon, love you, bye\u201d you hang up with a sigh. \u201cSorry Sneasel, I\u2019ve got to go\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSneaaa\u201d she whines pitifully as you lift her off your lap. \u201cI know, I want to play some more too\u201d you get to your feet. \u201cBut my family\u2019s having a reunion, and I haven\u2019t seen some of them for years\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Sneasel one last pet on the head and pick up the pokeballs that she had taken before setting off towards the town. You had only taken a couple steps when a snowball hits you in the back of the head. \u201cHey, come on now\u201d you turn to face her \u201cI\u2019ll be coming back down this way tomorrow, we can play more then\u201d you kneel down in front of her and hold out your hand. \u201cPromise?\u201d she looked at you for a moment before placing her claw in your hand \u201cSneasel\u201d \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hike back up trail towards your parents\u2019 home, Sneasel disappearing into the distance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You follow suit allowing Monferno and Shieldon to have some fun as well. With everyone having multiple Pok\u00e9mon, the open space in the rooms quickly disappeared. Several hours pass in a slight haze from the alcohol. Your uncle, now thoroughly drunk, slouched on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where\u2019s \u2013hic- Jason?

She was always there by my side and had been for years, supporting me no matter what. She legitimately loves me and I love her back,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be some kind of law against this right?\" You question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's perfectly legal,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's not human,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" you keep trying to find reasons as to why what he's doing is wrong but as you go back and forth you slowly realize your argument doesn't have a leg to stand on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I give up, I can't think of any reason it's wrong, but I still don't like it,\" it's really starting to get late now, and you've had a long day. \"I won't tell anyone, but you'd better be more careful in the future. I'm going to sleep,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to go inside he grabs your shoulder, \"Hey, thanks for hearing me out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment you reply, \"Yeah, no problem,\" and pull open the sliding door. You navigate your way through the dark house to the guest room you're using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you crawl under the covers you can't help but think about the conversation you just had. You didn't have any real reasons for it, but you still had a nagging doubt,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'll never get any sleep if I keep thinking about it,\" you roll onto your side and close your eyes.</span></div></div>",

She takes several of these pieces and places them on your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold ice feels good against your skin. You relax as the heat begins to ebb away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ung... uggghh... urr...\" you began to wake up with an aching groan. Man, were you hurting. The sleep was not pleasant nor was it relaxing. You dont recall having any good dreams until now. In fact, you dont even remember how you fell asleep in the first place. At the moment, everything before now was an awful blur. Were you drunk? Drugged? Knocked out? Lost a pokemon battle and experienced what was called a 'white out'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont even recall falling asleep in the middle of a huge bed of sunflowers in a wide-open field. What were you doing sleeping outside to begin with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?!\" .....You ALSO dont recall your arms and legs being tied together in ropes!! Ok, who was the jerk that's pulling this little prank on you?! No matter how much you struggle, you cant break free of the ropes! To make matters worse, you dont see anybody else with you in this flower field. Youre all alone...<br>\r\n\"HELLO?!!\" you call out, hoping someone out there can here you, \"ANYBODY THERE?!! HELLO??!\"<br>\r\nNo response. \"SOMEBODY? ANYBODY!! HELP!! I'M TIED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A SUNFLOWER GARDEN AND I CANT MOVE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no response. \"HEEELLLPP!!! PLEASE HELP!!!!\" Nothing. Youre on your own. Wonderful. You'd try to wobble out of there, but your body's aching and the lack of much blood circulating to your arms and legs dont help it much either. You'll be exhausted and in extreme pain before you reach the end of the field!<br>\r\nLooks like youre stuck there. You could be stuck there for hours... even days! Will you ever see your friends and family again? Are you even anywhere near home anymore? ...and who... who would do this to you?! AND WHY?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar? Garde?\" just then, you heard someone's voice. It sounded rather cute and feminine, but now wasnt the time to reflect on how a girl's voice sounded!<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you try and call back to the voice, \"Im over here. Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n\"Gar garde. Gar.\" That didnt sound like any language you recognize. Nonetheless, the voice was coming from right behind you. You turned around to see someone looking down at you. Or rather someTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you is a slightly tall green-haired creature with long green arms, blood-red eyes, pale white skin wearing what seems to be a billowing dress of the exact same color and two pink half-valentine-like outgrowths sticking out in the middle of it's chest.<br>\r\nThis creature is a pokemon. But not just any pokemon. It's a Gardevoir! And quite a cute and lovely one, too. But lovely or not, you dare not underestimate a high-leveled pokemon! You wouldnt want to agitate her and have her use those psychic powers against you! And seeing as though you dont see a trainer nearby, she must be a wild pokemon. Not a good sign, since wild pokemon are incredibly unpredictable. You dare not imagine what kinds of damage a high-leveled unpredictable wild Gardevoir can do to your brain out of fear she might read your thoughts and get nasty ideas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!\" but she wasnt showing any signs of hostility. She looked back at you with those intriguing red eyes and smiles. She even grabbed the folds of her 'dress' and curtsied to you. Cute. But once again, powerful!<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi!\" you greeted her, \"um, listen I could use your help here. Can you um... untie me, please?\"<br>\r\n\"Gard?\" she just tilted her head as she smiled. Maybe she cant understand what youre saying. But being a psychic, couldnt she just listen to the voice in your mind? Or maybe she just doesnt understand English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please G-uh, Ms. Gardevoir!\" you continue to plead as Gardevoir edged just a little closer to you, \"I c-cant break free. Please untie me!\"<br>\r\n\"Ga ha ha ha arde!\" you couldve sworn that was a giggle coming out of her mouth! The way she bent down at you and grinned, you could swear she's playing around with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you dont want to do anything stupid. \"Please! Im serious! Untie me, please!\"<br>\r\n\"Gaaaarrrrdeee?\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Gardevoir! Please untie m-!!!!\" You cut yourself off the moment she lowered her head just an inch or so away from your face! Judging by the way youre blushing, youre not used to a pretty face being THAT close to yours! Hmm. This Gardevoir's been acting a little suspicious. It's almost as if your little 'capture' was planned out or something!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an hour of staring into her eyes, Gardevoir-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your lips instinctively start to twitch as the Gardevoir kisses them. Your eyes even blink uncontrollably. As soon as she finally stops kissing you, your eyes go from blinking uncontrollably to being hard to focus. You feel dizzy for a couple seconds, then you feel tired. You recall watching a documentary on Jinx's before that described a move of theirs which involved these symptoms. The Gardevoir had just used Lovely Kiss on you! A Gardevoir using a Jinx's signature move?! How is that possible?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didnt matter at the moment. You were in no state of mind to question it. You were too busy struggling to keep yourself awake. Sadly it was far easier said than done. Gardevoir's a high-leveled pokemon. And an attack like that could knock out a beast ten times your size.<br>\r\nBy the time you realized the tenacity of this sleep attack, you had already took your mind completely off the discomfort of the ropes. However, that was the only good thing about it. The rest of your body had already went limp and your head was soon to join it. Even as you struggled to keep your eyelids open, your consciousness was already slipping into dream mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, Gardevoir smiled and gently lifted herself off of you. She stood up straight and looked down at you... then her eyes glowed and the next thing you noticed was you were staring at her at the same height level! Feeling nothing beneath you, you assumed she had lifted you off the ground with her telepathy! With that playful smile never leaving her face, she turned around and trotted off... as your body was floating along with her against your will!<br>\r\n\"Where are you.... ta.....zzzzz....\" you didnt get to finish asking her before you quickly slipped to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urggh....gyaaad....\" it ached waking up. It ached BADLY. It wasnt just your wrists and legs hurting, it was your whole body, including your head. If you were drugged earlier, THIS must be what a drug withdrawal feels like! You dont know how long you've out been because the alarm clock nearby was broken. Despite the throbbing pain, you forced yourself to get up and you quickly find yourself lying on a bed in an unfamiliar bedroom. It looked like a teenage girl's bedroom what with the worn out boy band posters and pictures of girly cartoon characters on the wall. You notice the room was a slight mess with several shirts, pants, and dresses torn off the hangars in the closets and piled all over the floor. Someone wasnt very tidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you rub your pounding head and gradually get out of the bed and leave the room. You wobbled a bit walking down the hall, admiring the unfamiliar house you were currently in.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you called out, \"anybody here?\" You hear no response. You peeked into another bedroom (you assume was the parents' room), but found nobody inside. Nobody but dust and a few cobwebs. Guess 'tidiness' runs in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you continue calling out as you head toward the living room. Didnt take you long to discover you were in a log cabin in the middle of the woods. What woods? Who's log cabin? You still havent figured that out yet. But somebody's here. The tv's on (flashing a test pattern), a door's wide open, window's smashed, and there's a pile of clothes and left over food on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GARDEVOIR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped out of your skin as soon as you heard that familiar voice shout out of nowhere! You turned around and almost tripped over from being so unprepared for her as you faced that Gardevoir from before. Your eyes widened... then quickly squinted from disbelief. You had the oddest look on your face as you stared at this Gardevoir now wearing a cute pink T-shirt that looked a little too big for her and a pair of blue jeans barely hanging over hips because she hasnt seemed to mastered zipping them up properly. You were still trying to comprehend why she put sparkly glitter in her green hair... but it was silly enough she smeared quite a bit too much lipstick on her lips. Was she trying to look like people? Cute. Weird, but cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar de Voiiirr!!\" she happily sang and twirled as left glitter on the floor!<br>\r\nDespite making for one hell of a strange day, you tried to keep calm (Gardevoir was still a pretty powerful psychic pokemon after all).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... is this your house?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"Gar gar de,\" she spoke gleefully and you couldnt understand her.<br>\r\n\"Are you this family's pokemon?\" you kept questioning, hoping you'll get something from her.<br>\r\n\"Gar de voiiir!\" she twirled again, again leaving glitter everywhere. <br>\r\n\"This cabin,\" you try again, \"the people that own it. Where are they?\"<br>\r\n\"Gar de v-ah,\" Gardevoir looked down and tried to adjust her borrowed jeans and frowned, \"gaaar. De gar! Voir de gard?\" she asked with a pouty look on her face.<br>\r\nThis wasnt helping. You scratched your head trying to think. An idea comes to mind. Since Gardevoir's specialize in telepathy, maybe you can communicate with her telepathically?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where are the people that own this cabin?' you ask her through thought.<br>\r\n\"Gaaaarr... de!\" she didnt notice it. She was too busy trying to adjust her tight jeans.<br>\r\n'Where are the people that own this cabin?' you think again. Gardevoir was too busy adjust her T-shirt as well to take notice.<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir?\" you say out loud.<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir?\" you finally get her attention. So you try it again.<br>\r\nYou stare her straight in the eye and repeat the thought, 'Where are the people that own this cabin?'<br>\r\nGardevoir tilts her head questionably. Is she not getting you message? Is it not working? Or are you not trying hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give this one last shot before giving up and trying to figure things out on your own.<br>\r\nYou stare intently at the Gardevoir, focus on clearing your head and concentrate hard  like youre trying to send mental-waves to her. Feeling like you concentrated hard enough, the voice in your heads as loud as possibly, hoping that her own mind will pick it up. 'WHERE. ARE. THE. PEOPLE. THAT. OWN. THIS. CABIN?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the question ended, Gardevoir smiled again. Then you coulda sworn you heard a faint voice call out to you. Did she reply to you? It seemed like that to you, because the voice sounded like...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Kyle, you're 16-years-old and you're currently a Pokemon trainer on a journey to become Champion in the Hoenn region. At this moment, you've received two badges and are moving onto the third as you head towards Mauville city to face Wattson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've captured many Pokemon, but the closest companion is your female Gardevoir, Nissi who has been with you since you were little. Your parents raised you and Nissi when she was just a little ralts and overtime, you and Nissi became the closest of friends. To you, she's almost like a sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, Nissi is traveling alongside you and almost never goes into a pokeball as she prefers to stay next to you. Although you like to think of her as someone of the same age, Nissi actually likes to think herself as the \"older sister\", to your annoyance. In some ways, she's always been trying to take care of you and when she evolved into a Gardevoir when you were only 14-years-old, she had both the height advantage and stature to be the \"older sister\". You thought of it as unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven to this day, she's taller than you, if not by a little. You're standing at 5'9\" while she's about 5'10\". While traveling and seeing other Gardevoirs, you found something else about Nissi you never realized. Biologically speaking, she's somehow a little taller than most Gardevoirs but above all else, you've come to find that her chest is not normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Nissi actually has breasts around the C-cup size. Of course, you've never really noticed them when you were little and growing up as you thought they were normal, but now after comparing to what most Gardevoirs look like, you realize she's supposed to have a flat chest with her heart-shaped tag in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>It looks like I'm something real special, huh master?</i>' she would claim proudly when you and her both realized the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is what it is, but now that you're older, you've begun to realize how beautiful Gardevoirs are and it might be due to the fact that they are some of the most humanoid Pokemon to walk the Earth. With Nissi's...interesting chest, joyful and optimistic smile, and her tendency to remain close to you, it's becoming harder to see her as someone like family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Master! You're staring off into space again!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you hear Nissi telepathically alert you. Feeling embarrassed, you chuckle nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry about that,\" you apologize as you and her walked the route to Mauville city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNissi narrows her eyes suspiciously at you. '<i>Sometimes, it's really tempting to just peak into your mind, master.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't,\" you flatly reject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNissi grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Well...who knows, maybe I already have~. You wouldn't know it in the first place,</i>' she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry to say, but there's nothing interesting in my head,\" you claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>That's not true~ I've been living with you since we were both little, you're the most...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses and hums flatly in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>...actually, you might be pretty boring, master</i>,' she corrects herself as she thinks to the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little annoyed, but this is just how she is. At the same time, although you wouldn't admit it, you wouldn't have it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNissi giggles again and leans close to you, locking her arm with you and humming contently. While this is normal as she's always stuck close to you, for the past few weeks since you've started this journey, you've become highly aware of Nissi's tendency to remain close and her blatant affection. Gardevoirs are always affectionate to their trainers, willing to risk their lives for their master's safety, but you know that it's not something you should react to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou internally groan, wondering why you chest has been feeling heavy recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You let her and just got dressed. Whne you walked down you saw your mom working on some of her notes and neer by was her Gardavoir. who was doing some cooking as well as cleaning.<br>\r\n\"Hello Mom how you doing?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Hello sweety I was looking over some of my notes for the Professorer Oak. He wanted it sent over as soon as I could. I saw lilly stole your towel agin. She ran to the landry room.\" Mom said as she placed her notes down as breakfast flotted over.<br>\r\n\"At lest she waited untill I was out of the bathroom befor she took it.\" I said as Lilly walked over with her head down. \"Lilly did you take my towel so you could sart the towels?\" I asked she looked up and took a secont befor she noded.<br>\r\n\"Well I can yell at her for doing the towels not can I?\" Mom asked her gardavoir flotted over and looked at the Ralt.<br>\r\n\"Gard gard, Voir voir gard?\" She asked the Ralt nodded and ran off to the landry room. The sound of the washers sarted up.<br>\r\n\"Now are you sure you want to be a Pokemon trainer?\" Mom asked as she tooka sip of her cofee, \"I sure I could get you a job at any poke Lab you wanted.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom we talked about it, I wantto go out in the world and see pokemon not just study them. It took Lilly a hour to undo the knots you made Gardavoir make.\" I said as Gardavoir giggled to her self.<br>\r\n\"Well I gess that was a little to far.\" Mom said as she huffed, \"All right sine Your so set on it. Here I made it so it fully ready and legal to use.\" Mom said as Lilly came out with a Pokelisons and a Pokedex. Gardavoir floted a bag and five poke balls out from a hidden spot.<br>\r\n\"Wait where the six Gardavoir?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n\"Gard?\" She said as she looked around.<br>\r\n\"RALT!\" Lilly said as she held up the pokeball to me.<br>\r\n\"Lilly Why do you have it?\" I asked. She blushed and handed it overto me befor she smack it. \"Lilly.\" I said as it stoped shacking.<br>\r\n\"Well Lilly coming along I thought she might.\" Mom said as she smiled. \"There your pokemon Azure. A Ralts named lilly.\" Mom said as I left.<br>\r\n\"I'll make you proude mom. I be the best there is.\" I said as I walked out the door.<br>\r\n\"I have no reson to disagre.

Flame thrower!\" the trainer said as a wall of fire care at Lilly.<br>\r\n\"Talaport and Magic leaf.\" I said in a secote She was behind growlith and fired a large voly of leaf at him.\" it knocked him out and sent it back. the trainer was pissed and pulled out a knife and attacked me it made a large gash made me fall back. just as he was about to attack me agin. when he was sent flying in to the sky I looked and saw Lilly glowing befor she changed. When the light dimmed. It has a white body and looks as if it's wearing a tutu. had skinny, green legs. hair doesn't block its eyes as much as Ralts's hair does. Kirlia's hair has bangs that reach down to its shoulders and the two red horns have shifted their position, making them look like hair pins.<br>\r\n\"Kirlia.\" Lilly said as she looked at my arm.<br>\r\n\"Im ok Lilly.\" I think we should rest for to night.</span></div></div>",

I mean who could blame ya? The damn things are HUGE! Heck the beedrills are a little over half your size and have gigantic stingers for hands! Arceus help you if you actually trip and fall right in the middle of a beedrill nest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, long story short, you have a terrible fear of bees. Something about a childhood trauma, but everytime you ever walk into a forest, you always ALWAYS carry insect repellant and listen hard for buzzing. You'd never go near your best friend's beedrill no matter how friendly and playful it gets with you. Sure these bugs tend to keep their distance if you keep your distance and are a necessity due to the honey they produce, but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became a detriment seeing as though one hot blistering summer, your parents had to leave on a business trip far away in the Unova region for a few days.  You had the house all to yourself. With a bit of money and food to tide you over, it was gonna be a nice pleasant few days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...AT LEAST until you turned on the tv to watch Operation RePokemon when it got rudely interrupted thanks to a special news report!<br>\r\nSeveral rogue swarms of Combees have flown in all the way from Sinnoh and started migrating down south. Colonies had been spotted in small corners of Kanto and a few towns in Hoenn. The SS Anne in Vermillion City had to be fumigated and closed off due to a big wild nest making itself at home within the luxurious ship.<br>\r\n\"Aw, you cant be serious,\" you groaned as your fears began to escalate.<br>\r\n\"Combees are known to be gentle and affectionate to humans,\" the news reporter stated, \"however, they can be hostile and aggressive during migration. This is usually the sign that a new Vespiquen has been crowned and are ready to expand their territory. When this happens, Combees scout out in search of food, nesting ground, and a potential mate for the newly crowned Vespiquen. If you see any nearby, it is recommended that you remain indoors until the migrating is finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and turned off the tv, trying to calm the panic that's dying to tear out of your body. You remember the breathing exercises your doctor told you to do when a panic attack's about to start and successfully put the fire before it could spread. <br>\r\n\"Whew... ....'potential mate'?\" you squinted your eyes thinking about what the news reporter said, but you tossed that thought aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheyre just extremely rare cases,\u201d you tell yourself, \u201cwhat are the odds that any of would swarm anywhere near here?\u201d You convinced yourself you had nothing to worry about.  After dinner, you still thought about that news report, but even before you thought \u2018What if-\u2019, you kept on telling yourself you had nothing to worry about throughout the night just before heading off to sleep. What were the odds, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beeee.... beee.... bee.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pleasant sleeping gets cut short thanks to the sound of strange buzzing. The strong scent of honey filled the air. If you any other person, you'd just shrug it off and go back to sleep. But because youre the great big Beeophobe, you immediately open your eyes, and nearly jump out of bed wondering where you kept that bug spray. You overheard the buzzing coming from outside your bedroom window. You sensed very very VERY bad things coming from that direction, but you still approached the window. Something deep down was telling you 'DONT OPEN THE CURTAIN DONT OPEN THE CURTAIN DONT OPEN THE CURTAIN', but like 90% of the murder victims in horror movies, you go against common sense and open the damn curtain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMBEEE!!! COMB BEE! BEEE!! COMB!!! COMBEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EyyyaaAAAAHHH!!!\" you fell back screaming at the huge wall of cute smiley-faced honey combs stacked right outside your window! Each one of them smiling into your soul. Combees! While they looked like friendly smiles on their cute little faces, you imagined hearing them say 'We HaVe BeEn WaItInG fOr YoU, JeRrY wEsTwAnE!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard each of the Combees mutter to one another in their pokemon language as you stayed perfectly still, trying to keep absolute quiet, and trying not to show any more fear than you already were showing.<br>\r\n\"They cant get in here,\" you whispered to yourself and ignored the sweat dripping off you, \"they cant get in. They cant ge-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ComBEEE!!!\"<br>\r\n*Twwwiiiiinnnnnngggg*<br>\r\n*CRAAAACCKKK!!*<br>\r\nOh right. Bug Buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combees let out an echoing noise that was so high-pitched, it shattered the glass!! With their way in secured, flying three-headed smiling combees swarmed in by the dozen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyaaaddd!!!\" you screamed as you darted out of your room, slamming the door shut behind you! You could still the playful cries of 'Combee! COMBEE!! COMBEE!!' coming from all directions! They surrounded the house!<br>\r\n*Twiiiingg*<br>\r\n*Crack! CRACK!! CRAAACCKK!!*<br>\r\nWindows in your kitchen and living room shattered as more of those combees flooded in! You could hear the combees mumbling inside your parents' room, so you dare not open the door. Sadly, you remember last minute that you left your can of bug spray in the garage... which was already occupied by a Combee wall! The only safe place in the house was the bathroom, but only because there were bars over the window. You dashed in to the bathroom, locked the door (as if combees could turn knobs!) and prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont understand it,\" you whisper to yourself, \"why the hell would they coming HERE of all places?! It's not like we have a garden. We aint got much food a combee would eat and theyre aint a decent pollinating field for miles!\" You seriously wondered deeply about it. Why would they come HERE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMB BEEE!!\"<br>\r\n\"COOOOMB!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard combees just outside the door. They were actually waiting outside. For what?! You?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bump! BUMP!* They were ramming the door! You were completely perplexed by this!<br>\r\n\"Combee!!!\" shouted the combee outside your window! One of the heads was shouting impatiently while the other two heads were biting down on the bars trying in vain to yank them off! You couldnt believe that your worst nightmare was coming to fruition! The bees were coming after you! YOU, personally! What did you do to deserve this misery?! You always kept your distance!

You brushed your shaggy brown hair out of your green eyes letting them adjust to the lower level of light. You could hear the sounds of various Pokemon going about their business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you wouldn't have ever considered going into the forest alone, but with fifty bucks and your pride on the line you couldn't back down. While you didn't have any Pokemon to protect you, you took some solace in the seven inch knife you had attached to your belt, and the sturdy walking stick you carried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tasked with going deep into the woods and retrieving a piece of the mossy rock that stood there, you set off at a light jog. You had some idea of the route you would have to take to reach the stone, but you also knew that the forest could become a maze and would be easy to get lost in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You followed the path for a ways before turning off it and heading into the wilder parts of the forest. The sounds of the wildlife began to die out as you traveled deeper, replaced by an eerie silence. You gripped the staff tighter, in nature silence was a bad thing, it meant that there was a predator, it meant that there was something strong nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite the obvious danger you continued to trek deeper and deeper into the forest. It doesn't take you long to find the stone, standing tall amongst the trees. Placing a hand on its smooth weathered down surface, you can almost feel the age of the near monolithic boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing your hand to fall you search around the base for any fragments. On the far side you find a decent sized crack along with several grooves that remind you of teeth marks. Steeling your nerves you slip your hand into the crack and feel for any loose pieces.  Reaching along the sides you easily find a fragment that you can pull loose. Your fingers wrap around the stone and you pull with all your might. At first it barely budges, but with a grating sound it finally gives and comes out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire the stone for a moment before placing it in your pocket. As you stand back up a loud buzzing reaches your ears. Nervously you hold the staff in both hands, spaced out so you had a couple feet between your hands and the stick was nearly parallel to the ground. The buzzing increased in volume as the seconds passed until it was deafening, before cutting out and allowing silence to rule once again. You slowly back towards the tree line, watching carefully for any hint of movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you near the trees you notice a flicker of movement above you. Jerking your head upwards you see a flamboyant red form aproaching from the air at an alarming speed. You throw yourself to the side, just barely dodging the crushing hit.Leaping to your feet you spin the staff around so you're holding it like a bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scizor\" rising to its full height of about six feet, the Pokemon was truly intimidating. It's arms ended in wicked pincers with eye marks, rising from its head were three crests, and a small pair of wings stuck out from its back. The carapace shone like dull metal. With what you had already seen, there was no way you could flee, and it would be impossible for you to fight the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean you wouldn't try. Still holding the stick you begin to back away from the insect. It stepped with you maintaining the distance and clicking its pincers menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" You grit your teeth as you ask. \"Scizor!\" The bug gestures at the large boulder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's a big rock, what do you want?\" It gestures at the stone again and then at you before waving a pincer in a \"come here\" gesture<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't understand its words, but you think you get the message. One hand slowly releases the stick and finds its way down to your pocket. Visibly tensing as your fingers slip into the pocket, the insect follows your every move. You can feel sweat dripping down your back as your fingers grip the rough sliver of stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you pull out the stone and hold it out to the bug type. In the blink of an eye it had gotten within arms reach and taken the stone. Before you even realized something had happened the Scizor was back in its spot holding the stone. You paled dramatically, the whole time it could have easily killed you. Scizor examined the stone, turning it around and peering closely at it. You again began to back away towards the trees.</span></div></div>",

You keep the end of your staff pointed directly at the aggressive bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt keeps taking steps towards you, snapping a pincer whenever you try to take a step. It slowly closes the distance between you until you could touch if you reached out \u201cSTAY BACK\u201d it hesitates for a second but takes another step. You swing the staff around with all of your might, and with a sharp crack the end strikes across your tormentors face. You try for another swing but before it hits, a red pincer closes around the midsection of your staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull away but its grip is iron, and with a single snip your staff is neatly bisected. You jump back and hurl one of the staff sections at the bug-type, which calmly bats it out of the air. Your now empty hand grips your knife and you lunge forward drawing the blade and swinging it in a sweeping slash across the stomach. Before you even finish the attack a thin metallic arm catches you across the neck in a lariat and throws you onto your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall back the Scizor jumps atop you and lightly grabs your neck with a pincer. You relax your whole body immediately, trying to portray submission. Apparently satisfied it releases your neck, only to have you kick your legs under its arms, plant your feet into its underarms and push with everything you\u2019ve got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou successfully throw the insect and roll to your feet, switching the knife from a backhand grip to a normal one and charge at the downed bug. As it got to its feet you drove the knife hard into its hard carapace. The point of you knife snaps off as it fails to penetrate the steel insect. It retaliates with a heavy strike to your stomach that lifts you off the ground and drives all the air form your lungs. Moving faster than you can react it flits over to your side and slams both pincers down on your back in a double hammer fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the blow drives you hard into the ground. You try to ignore the pain as you push yourself up from the ground. A sharp hit to the side knocks you over onto your back, followed by another hit to your stomach. You desperately try to suck in a breath as a clearly pissed off insect stands above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is wheeze helplessly as the crimson bug reaches down and clamps its pincer around your neck. You panic as the pincer starts to squeeze, clawing at the arm and kicking at your enemy. One of your wilder kicks shifts your weight onto your side allowing you lash out with one of your arms at the insects head. In a stroke of luck you manage to jab into its eye, earning a shriek of pain and the freedom to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to crawl away as you gasp for air, but the seething insect gabs the back of your neck and throws you into the boulder, your vision swims as your head collides with the unyielding stone.  Your stomach heaves as you pull yourself to your feet, leaning on the boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pincer roughly clamps around your left arm and yanks hard trying to pull you off the stone. You resist the pull, leaning back towards the boulder. Suddenly your mind goes white and everything is crystal clear, you look over at the Scizor who is glaring back at you, your gaze drops to see your forearm bent at an unnatural angle in the grip of the pincer, broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began to giggle, a high pitched psychotic sound. The sound is cut off as a red pincer collides with side of your head. You fall to your knees, blood dripping from the gash above your eye. Another blow strikes your head, knocking you onto the ground and opening another cut on your head. The crimson bug stands above you pincer raised to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHariyama, Arm Thrust\u201d the Scizors\u2019 attention is drawn away from you moments before an incredible force sends it flying into the boulder. You tilt your head slightly and see the three friends that had put you up to this crazy adventure. One hurried to your side and pulled you onto his shoulder, your broken limb hanging limp. You are in such a pain dazed state that you can\u2019t tell who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red flash out of the corner of your eye alerts you to the Scizor dashing towards you again. \u201cCounter!\u201d Hariyama places itself firmly in front of you, catches the Steel-bug type, and hits it with a heavy punch to the abdomen that drives it back. Rising to its feet once again Scizor hovers just off the ground and glows pink for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next attack was too fast for you too even see, one second Hariyama was standing firm, and the next Scizor had pounded it into the ground with a high speed metal claw. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d you hear from one of your friends, \u201cThat thing\u2019s way too strong to be wild\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others send out more Pok\u00e9mon while one drags you out of harm\u2019s way. He rests you gently against a tree \u201cWait here\u201d you focus as hard as you can on his face finally identifying him as Garret, a longtime friend. \u201cArcanine, I need your help\u201d he pops open a pokeball from his belt releasing the large canine \u201cProtect him\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarret rushes back into the fray releasing another Pok\u00e9mon to combat the Scizor, which was holding its own against three others. Arcanine places itself between you and the fight, obeying Garrets orders but also denying you a view of the conflict.<br>\r\nThe battle continues for a few minutes but even the Scizor can\u2019t continue forever and collapses from exhaustion. One of them throws an ultraball that successfully captures the red Insect. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief as they hear the ping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friends return their Pok\u00e9mon to their balls, and one retrieves the Scizor. Very carefully the group leads you out of the forest and back into town<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The doctor picks up the sphere and holds it out to you. With a shaking hand you take the ball, and stare at it in your hand. \u201cWhy are you giving it to me?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one of us without a Pok\u00e9mon, this isn\u2019t ideal of course, but you need someone to protect you\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll kill me, I don\u2019t have nearly enough badges to train her\u201d \u201cThen just release her, she\u2019ll probably return to her territory\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go quiet for the rest of the time in the hospital as they fit you with a cast. You are still silent as you walk out the front doors. The sun is setting casting, its fiery glow across the cityscape of Eterna city. You and your friends make your way towards you home only to walk straight past. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to release her\u201d  \u201cNow? Shouldn\u2019t you at least wait for tomorrow?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel safe with her in my room\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their protests you make your way back to the edge of the forest. Standing before the trees you steel yourself for what you are about to do. With a shaking hand you press the release catch on the pokeball, and with a flash of light, the very creature that put you in the hospital only a few hours ago was standing before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScizor focuses on you for a moment before getting its bearings. Once it seems to know where it is, you call out \u201cGo home\u201d and drop the ultra-ball. Before the ball even hits the ground you are walking away. \u201cSciz\u201d you look back to find it has halved the distance between you and is getting closer. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you ask with no small degree of fear in your voice. Your friends are close but they wouldn\u2019t be able to react in time if Scizor attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScizor\u201d you speed up putting some distance between you and the crimson insect. It stops where you dropped the ball and gingerly picks it up, but in an instant it closes the distance between you. It gently grips your uninjured arm and places the orange and black ball in your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSciz\u201d it simply stands there, expectantly. You break out in a cold sweat with such a dangerous being standing not two feet from you, \u201cW-what do you want?\u201d \u201cScizor\u201d it gestures at the ball. \u201cThen take it\u201d you hold it out, but the Scizor refuses to take it. \u201cTHEN GO HOME!\u201d you yell, the communication barrier proving extremely frustrating. \u201cSci\u201d she shakes her head. \u201cWhy not\u201d you whine \u201cjust go home and leave me alone\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you wrap this up\u201d Garret call from where he\u2019s sitting. \u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d you yell as he chuckles. \u201cNow, what do you even want\u201d \u201cScizor\u201d \u201cScrew this\u201d you drop the ball back at your feet, only to have Scizor pick it up and give it to you. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll play that way\u201d you throw the ball as hard as you can into the forest and take off running back towards town. Scizor immediately takes to the skies and catches the Ultra-ball before you even get back to your friends. Landing in front of you and handing the ball Scizor looks extremely pleased with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give up\u201d you simply take the ball and put it in your pocket. \u201cSCIZOR!\u201d the Bug-type calls out to the heavens and you nearly piss yourself as she exuberantly wraps her arms around you. \u201cScizor sci\u201d she hugs you tightly, putting pressure on your broken arm. \u201cGahhh!\u201d she immediately releases you and checks you over, making sure she didn\u2019t injure you, before dragging you back into a much more careful hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still afraid of the red insect, despite her friendliness, and having her that close was not something you were enjoying. You quickly disengage from the happy Pok\u00e9mon putting a few feet between the two of you. \u201cReturn\u201d you put Scizor back in her ball and put that back in your pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were going to release her\u201d \u201cSo did I\u201d you reply with a beaten tone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a short look around you are positively sure you don\u2019t know where you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit, I should\u2019ve checked which direction I was running\u201d you get to your feet and try to get your bearings. Unfortunately the trees make it impossible for you to see the sun. Your town is to the west of the forest but you can\u2019t figure out which way that is. Thinking about it for a second you decide to climb a tree to see which direction to go. <br>\r\nYou pick a decently sized tree with several low branches and haul yourself up onto the first. Making sure you aren\u2019t disturbing any Pok\u00e9mon you continue to climb further and further until you can no longer find branches to support your weight. From there you are able to push aside the leaves and see the sky. The sun was nowhere to be seen, dark heavy clouds obscured everything. Dejected, you climb back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only is it impossible to see the sun, but it\u2019s going to rain as well, Just my luck\u201d with the incoming storm in mind, you set to work on a shelter. You collect sturdy branches from the ground and lean them together vertically against one of the lower branches. You cover the branches in mud and leaves, creating a barrier. You grab more branches and stack them up along the vertical ones. Before too long you have created an impromptu shelter that should at least protect you from the rain. <br>\r\nNot a moment after you have finished does the rain start and you huddle under your shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing out here was a terrible idea\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The leaves were dried and cracked resulting in little to no durability and the mud itself was too soft and wet for a sturdy coating. The branches you carefully crafted together were only held steady by a few weak load-bearing twigs that the mud could not keep in place. And the very micro-second after you told yourself coming here was a terrible idea, you remembered watching a weather report earlier today saying that were was gonna be a major rainstorm rivaling El Nino today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took no time for that shelter you busted your ass making to collapse right on top of you! You shielded your head from the falling branches, wet mud, and heavy rainfall as you mumbled curses. Perfect time to remind yourself that you shouldve worn a jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long cold wet walk through this raining forest maze. It feels like you've just been walking a straight line, yet the forest never seems to stop. Did you somehow manage to end up in the middle of a whole new forest continent when you stepped out of that cave?!<br>\r\nYou quickly regret moving away from that boulder, Scizor or no Scizor. At least the boulder was warm. Your ice cold hands shivered as it missed it's touch. Sure, there was a big scary bug pokemon guarding it, but looking back it really didnt seem all that hostile. All it wanted from you was that piece of the stone you took off back. If it wanted to attack you, it couldve easily done so. Heck, it couldve just snapped off your wrist right then and there as soon as you offered the piece back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... just maybe, if you asked it nicely, it couldve at least hinted a way out of the forest in exchange for you never bothering it's special stone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain poured harder and temperature dropped lower. It was so shivering cold at this point, you pulled your arms inside your shirt and curled them against your bare chest in a desperate attempt to get warm.<br>\r\n\"W-w-why d-d-id I agree to that s-s-s-tupid b-bet?\" you shivered to yourself, \"f-freaking f-fifty bucks'll barely c-cover all the damn cold medicine I'm gonna be needing later!\" $50 wasnt jack to you anymore. You'll gladly take the loss and fork over the $50 if it meant you could find your way home again. Back in your nice warm house, in a nice warm shower, cranking the heater to max, and chugging down some hot chocolate. Ah... just thinking those happy thoughts makes you feel a bit warm and cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, seriously. Youre actually feeling warm. The slight refreshing heat you were feeling was being emitted from the direction of a nearby cave. You'd be thanking Arceus for this blessing of warmth and shelter, but after your first screw up, you decide to be a little cautious before barging into that cave uninvited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping your walking stick in defense, you peek your head into the brightly lit cavern. The sound of buzzing echoed from the distance. You could see a few little three-headed honeycomb-shaped smiling bugs flying around. Bees. Combees.<br>\r\nYou shouldve known it'd be too easy. Inside the cavern lies an active Combee hive. And you know what happens when you rattle a beehive. Pissing off one bug is enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it's blistering cold and the rain shows no sign of slowing down. If youre desperate for warmth and shelter (and you certainly are), who knows when or if youre gonna find another opportunity like this? Maybe if you just keep a good distance, you wont startle any of them. Or maybe if you only stick around for just a short period of time, they wont mind. Or maybe the Vespiquen of this hive is friendly.<br>\r\nOr maybe all the antidotes in the world wont be able to treat the amount of poison stings you'll receive if you so much as BREATHE their direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, youre just getting yourself more wet and chilly wasting time thinking about what to do. Whatever you decide to do, better do it fast. </span></div></div>",

The rain shows no sign of abating as you attempt to keep yourself warm by jogging. It was an uphill battle as your drenched clothes quickly sucked the warmth from your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep moving, determined to find another source of warmth. To your surprise, you come across the wreckage of your shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit I'm just going in circles\" your mind travels back to the Scizor. Going back and asking it to lead you out of the forest was looking like a better and better idea with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my shelter is here, then the mossy rock should be that way\" you begin jogging once again, this time with a firm destination. It takes longer then you remember but it's still not long before you find the clearing from earlier. <br>\r\nSteeling your nerves, you call \"Scizor!\" When you get no response you call again and again. No matter how many times you call the scissor doesn't appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, cold, and despondent you slump against the large rock and give up. It's not long before you fall asleep, accepting your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You are woken up by something jabbing at your shoulder. \"Scizor\" you slowly raise your head to see the crimson insect standing before you, the image of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help me\" you plead \"can you lead me to the edge of the forest?\" The Pok\u00e9mon remains silent, perhaps thinking about how to help perhaps not, it's face is inscrutable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment it nods and extends a pincer. Shaking from the cold, you grasp it and are pulled to your feet. The steel bug points in into the tree line and begins walking. You follow eagerly, sticking close to your savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" the insect hesitates for a moment but keeps moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the guidance of the scissor you soon find yourself at...</span></div></div>",

But today you were soaked to toe, freezing to death, and possibly gonna get sick, and this particular Scizor youre blindly following is the closest thing to warm as youre gonna get for now. It had a warm gentle grip on your icy cold hand for something with extremely sharp pincers. If it wanted, it could easily slice your whole hand off with little effort! But this Scizor seemed to be ever so careful not to hurt your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no state to question whether it was a good or bad idea to trust your life to a wild pokemon. You were too desperate and in need of saving. You didnt care from who. You didnt wanna freeze to death and not be heard from until random campers find your body in the Spring! If it was gonna be a wild dangerous pokemon that saves your butt, so be it! Personally, you'd rather it be an Audino since theyre cuddly, cheerful, practically raised to be nurses (which is why pokemon centers recruit them), know CPR, and give the best hugs! A Scizor is as cuddly as a bag of rusty nails, but beggars cant be choosers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou edged a little closer to the Scizor, trying to soak in more of it's warmth. <br>\r\n\"Sci?!\" It's eyes lingered at you for a second, \"sci...\" but quickly returned it's eyes to the road as if it trying to maintain it's focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk took a while, but the horrific $50 nightmare came to an end. The endless valley of trees finally ended. Nothing but a clear field and the sight of your town in the distance! You've finally reached the edge of the forest!<br>\r\nScizor let go of your hand, not realizing you were missing the heat of it. Still, it was over! Praise Arceus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief, thankful to be out of that stupid maze of a forest! Of course, you didnt forget about the particular one that got you out of that stupid maze of a forest! You werent just thankful. You were eternally grateful! If it hadnt been for that big selfless bug, you mighta never woke up from that rock. And if you did, worst case scenario, you mightve ended up as lunch to that combee hive! MIGHTVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the Scizor and politely bow, attempting to show your gratitude as obvious as possible.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you thanked it, \"thank you so much. I really appreciate you helping me out of there. And I'm sorry about the whole ordeal with the rock. I promise I wont touch it again.\"<br>\r\n\"Sci...zor...\" it eyes you for a moment, but nods, accepting your gratitude, then turns around to begin it's trek back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Scizor, you werent just gonna let a great deed go unrewarded. You owe it. You felt an obligation to repay the favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scizor wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scii?\" it turned around, giving you it's attention.<br>\r\n\"I cant just you let you go without properly repaying you for what you done,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Sci. Sci izor.\" you assumed it said you didnt need to do that. But you werent having that.<br>\r\n\"I insist,\" you tell it, \"how'd you like to come over to my place... at least until the rain stops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tilted it's head, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much better than staying out here,\" you assure, \"not to mention it's warmer, plenty of heating. Also, I'm a good cook. I'll be happy to whip you up dinner.\"<br>\r\nScizor squinted it's eyes suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna try to capture you,\" you say, \"I'm not a trainer. And if I was, you think I'd be stupid enough not to bring a pokemon or two with me out in this harsh rainstorm?\" You made a good point. Besides, you felt safer being around Scizor anyhow. Not to mention since you werent able to get a piece of that rock, maybe, just MAYBE, you can present the guardian of that rock herself as evidence to get your $50! It's win-win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" you gently take it by the pincer despite how easily it can snap your hand off, \"it's the least I can do. And I'd be happy to have my hero...... uhhh....\" you carefully inspect Scizor, \"...I mean heroINE as my guest of honor this evening! Uh, that is if it's alright with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sciiiiiii....\" SHE seemed to contemplate that offer. After a brief moment of thinking, she...</span></div></div>",

You move at a rather quick pace, wanting to get home and out of the rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your home, a small rental property, and usher Scizor inside. once inside you remove your soaking wet shirt and, noticing the water droplets covering Scizors' shell, you grab her a towel. \"Here, you can use this to dry off. I'm going to get some dry clothes and then I'll start making dinner\" as you leave the living area you call back to Scizor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to look around, the couch is kinda old but it's pretty comfy, uhh here,\" you turn on the TV and hand her the remote, \"These buttons change the channels, watch whatever you like\" she grasps it gingerly in one pincer and begins to press buttons with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she understands the remote you retreat to your room and put on a t-shirt and some sweats. A quick peak into the living room reveals Scizor is seated on the couch and still surfing channels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting dinner, do you like chicken?\"  finally settling on a channel she nods \"Scizor\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She definitely had a trainer at one point\" you think to yourself \"Wild pokemon probably wouldn't know what a chicken was much less how it tastes, and she wasn't surprised by the TV\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put these thoughts aside as you prepare dinner, her past is none of your business, and you doubt she would tell you even if she could. The chicken cooks quickly and you cut hers into smaller pieces to make it easier for her. Since you lack a dining room, you take both plates into the living room and plant yourself on the couch next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, seared chicken,\" gently she accepts the plate and eats a piece of the chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sciz!\" she exclaims and eats more <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it good?\" she nods and continue to eat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I've never really cooked for anyone before, so I'm glad you like it\" pleased with your cooking you start to eat too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you watching?\" between bites she attempts to describe it but you still cant understand her, realizing this she grabs the remote and, after scanning the buttons, presses the one labelled info. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can read too\" she nods and gestures for you to read the description. Y0ou comply and find that she's watching one of your favorite show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I love this show, its old but it's a classic. Are you enjoying it?\" She nods and settles herself a little deeper into the couch. The two of you continue watching until the end of the episode. After it ends you take her now empty plate and take both to the kitchen, through the window you can see that not only is it still raining, its turned into a downpour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its still raining and you're welcome to stay the night, but if you want to head home I wont stop you,\" </span></div></div>",

She took glances at the window, then glances at you in a repeated cycle. You didnt rush her however. She was patient enough to guide you through a rainstorm in the middle of dangerous woods, so you can spare the patience to make up her indecisive mind in a nice warm cozy house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a particular amount of time that many would consider to be long, Scizor lowered her head and kinda curled into what looked like a very very nervous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sci...zor?\" she nervously asked. You had a good idea what that question was.<br>\r\n\"No, it's no problem at all,\" you said with a smile, kinda happy she chose to stick around a bit longer, \"it's really bad out and I'd love for you to stick around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sci ZOR s-s-sci...\" she rolled her eyes and stuttered a bit as if she was in denial of something, \"Z-ZOR sci! S-s-s-sci!\" Then it seemed like she was getting defensive for some reason. Unfortunately, that was your limit when it came to verbal communication.<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" you just smiled blankly, \"well, feel free to make yourself at home. Just try not to make a mess, ok? I just had the carpet rug-doctored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough she nodded, reading you loud and clear. Hopefully her trainer taught her about keeping a host's place neat and tidy. Her picher pointed over to the tv, \"Sciizor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go right ahead,\" you allow her, \"knock yourself out.\" She was incredibly quick to hop back on your couch, wear out your ass-groove with her uh... lower-abdomen groove and quickly flipped the channel to what looked to be a foreign cartoon. Nothing you could understand, since it was in another language and there were no subtitles. But she got really immersed into the cartoon regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So she's bilingual too, sorta?' you think to yourself. So not only did she have a trainer, she may have been from a whole other country. She must be a long way from home. Cant help but start wondering how she ended up here of all places with no trainer. Was she abandoned? Or maybe a tragedy happened? This pokemon was an enigma. Scizor must have quite a story behind her and sadly she's unable to tell it. Even if she could, it's probably best she doesnt.  If it is tragic, you'd hate to open some bad wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the cartoon she's watching was certainly not safe for children. It was very action-oriented. A lot of fighting, a lot of screaming, a lot of blood. A LOT of blood. A crazy sword-slinger slicing up knights left and right, severing limbs and blood gushing out of severed gaping wounds! His companion which looked to be a cute little puffy bird-creature transforms into a huge massive ferocious dragonite-like creature and starts chomping down on screaming knights, grinding bone against it's razor sharp jaws! Then there's a sudden cut to a preacher giving a sermon while a baby's about to baptized... then cut back to the slaughter of crazy sword-slinger and his carnivorous man-eating companion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was a little too extreme for your tastes, but Scizor was leaning in, staring with complete awe of this disturbing cartoon. This was probably one of her favorite shows too, isnt it?<br>\r\n\"Uh... can we watch something else?\" you asked, clearly uncomfortable with the cartoon. Scizor just gave you a quick cold stare and clenched the remote a little tighter then turned back to the cartoon. Guess that's a no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in defeat. Maybe it's cuz you were far too grateful for saving your life or maybe you just didnt wanna be on the wrong side of her pincers.<br>\r\nStill, you didnt have the gut to be watching something like that for long. Forcing yourself to put up with it only made your blood run cold just like when you were in that blistering storm! <br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go take a quick shower,\" you tell her as you hopped off the couch and headed to the bathroom. She didnt bother turning her head away from the screen the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you went in the bathroom, turned on the hot water, took your clothes off, put them aside, then stood under the nice warm rain pouring out of the shower head. After the storm, your body felt like it hadnt experienced major warmth in eons! Your mind melted away in the bliss of the nice warm shower. You didnt wanna take too long while you still had a guest in your house (even though your guest was a pokemon!), but you didnt wanna leave that spot either! It was just too good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, fate was nowhere near as patient as you were! For your bliss ride came to a screeching halt when...</span></div></div>",

Also, for those who want to add a chapter in this story please try not to say the character's name or at least his real one I'd want it to feel like your talking without saying your name, come up with a nickname that people call him. You can say Dan but you guys can think up something right?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what a day.\" I said as I walked through the park, taking in the bright morning air as I walked on the stony road. It was half past noon last time I asked one of the joggers as they ran by me. But either way it was a great day! I got fired, the sun was shining, the managers' Machoke beat me out as I made a scene, and I protested for a while until I gave up an hour later. Now I'm just walking through the park with a few bruises having a wonderful time! And who am I? Well most people call me Dan, even though it's not my real name though but I don't mind.<br>\r\nI'm 17 and a half almost about to be eighteen in three months too, I have dark brown hair almost turning black from the sun, and dark brown eyes, black shirt and blue jeans. Yup that's it, nothing special really. I looked and noticed a few kids playing with their Pokemon, \"Ugh, I should've became a Pokemon trainer...\" I sighed a bit and kept walking, I never got a Pokemon, the professor always ran out when I came so I just gave up and lived like a regular human, besides I would never have been a good trainer I get distracted too many times, one reason why I was fired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way I stopped walking and sat on a bench near the forest. Yup I said it there's literally a forest that comes in the path after the park, which is just an easy way for trainers to have fun and then continue their journey. I usually sit here in the late afternoon but since I'm fired I have an early start now. \"Hmm?\" I turned my head towards the path of the forest, for some reason I seem to be getting weird vibes coming from a particular bush that's conveniently placed next to a tree. It feels as if I'm being watched, it's so strange because I've never had this feeling when I sat in the afternoon. \"Eh, it's probably nothing...\" I said turning back around and looking up at the sky to watch the clouds a bit before I decided to leave the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like a pretty good day, besides getting fired. I mean, what could go wrong?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sighed a bit as I started to get comfortable on the bench, it seemed like a perfect day for a quick nap before leaving I always take one in the afternoon, it seems more natural for it in the middle of the day too. Oh, I forgot to mention, I live in a small newly found island close by the Kalos region it's close enough to surf over there on a Pokemon actually. After people found out about this island trainers flocked over here like they were birds migrating trying to find new Pokemon and something called a Mega Stone, which I guess makes certain Pokemon stronger or something? This was after some 15-year old beat the champion Diana, I would've wanted to meat this trainer... Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything slowly started to get blurry all of a sudden followed by the light fading away into darkness. This obviously meant that I was slowly dozing off as I sat on the bench also meaning I had to switch positions to laying down. Nobody except me sits here so I doubt anyone would say anything about this. And in no time at all I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Some Time Later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah get 'em!!\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw NO WAY!!\" Said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Ngh...\" I slowly started to wake up from my nap as I heard some commotion going on. I opened my eyes to see what was going on, I saw a crowd gathering up somewhere near the entrance of the park. I got up and walked over there to see what was going on, when I got there I saw it was just a friend of mine who was battling some other trainer. Strangely his name was Flame, I don't know if that's his real name though but, I went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tall, having spiky blonde hair, grass green eyes, and a wild attitude. He's a pretty fun guy to be around, not only that but he's a master trainer he caught every Pokemon there is out there, even most of the Legendaries! Even with all his accomplishments he's never been arrogant or cocky, but he never really thinks things out and always gets into trouble, I sometimes break him out though and out of all that he might even be a little crazy at times. In the end he's a cool guy. The other trainer seemed like one of those aces mainly from another region since I didn't recognize the outfit. He's probably a tourist, the city in the island built a hotel near a beach for all the trainers and tourist's visiting and all.<br>\r\nIt seemed like the fight was already over since the Ace was calling his fainted Salamence back into it's Pokeball and people started to leave. \"Haha! Another one bites the dust!\" Flame said calling his Pokemon back into it's own Pokeball, it must've been a new one since I didn't recognize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're now beating the tourists huh?\" I asked Flame as I walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh hey dude hows it goin' and yes I am!\" He said with complete confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh fine I guess... I kinda got-\" \"Fired?\" Okay how did he know? \"Uh....\" \"Oh yeah I saw you making a scene as a Machoke was dragging your but out of the building, it was funny so I didn't do anything to stop.\" At least he tells the truth.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if ya need a job, I can get you one at that hotel near the beach.\" Wait he can!? Wow that's close to where I live!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really? That would be great!\" I said as he nodded with a slight fang grin, I never knew how he got those but I didn't want to ask since he might actually show me. \"Yup oh by the way you notice anything weird while you were asleep cause I saw a weird figure watching you from afar.\" He tried emphasizing 'afar' by putting his hand in front of me slowly passing it by to make it seem special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... No I didn't notice I was asleep.... \" I said slightly confused at what he said and did. \"Oh well figures, anyway I'd be careful if I was you.\" He said and turned quickly running off probably to go battle some more trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to do now though but I had two choices:<br>\r\nEither go home, or look for that strange figure Flame was talking about, so.... What next?</span></div></div>",

You told him a lot about you, and told him your family problems, which was already a huge step for you, and got you alot of weight off your shoulders. You also got to know a lot about him.

''Looks like I don't have a choice, now do I?'' he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, it worked! You opened the door and let him in first. ''Go ahead.'' you say. Nero walks over to the door and enters your home and walks past you. You then notice Nero's butt. Wow.. his ass looks amazing.. it looks so big, soft and suave.. you blush heavily now but try to hide it. You close the door behind Nero. ''Well, go ahead to the living room and take a seat. ''Sure..'' he says, taking a seat on the bench, taking in quite some space due to his size. ''Now, could I interest you in some steak or water?'' you ask. ''Uh.. Zeke, really, I appreciate it, but..'' Nero answered, but was interrupted by his belly rumbling. You grin. Nero blushes. ''Uh.. yeah.. that steak might be nice now.'' he answered. You smile. ''All right.'' you say. You walked to the fridge and took the steak out of the fridge. You started cooking it for him, and you notice the Nidoking already hyptonized by the smell. Cute, but also worthy worrying for. ''Have you eaten lately? You seem very hungry.'' you ask. ''Uhm.. I actually didn't eat for 2 days straight.'' he says. This shocked you. ''W-what? Not for 2 days? I'll try to cook this as fast as possible.'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to spice this steak as good as possible for the poor guy, and quickly served the steak to him. Nero quickly started eating his well-cooked meal, and he looked happy and satisfied at the same time. ''F-fis ifs grfet!'' you hear the Nidoking say with a full mouth. ''Uh.. Nero..?'' You notice Nero gulping that enormous steak all in one gulp. Looks like it's capable of swallowing quite a big prey, which reminded you of something..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''..Nero? Why didn't you eat me right away if you were so hungry?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Nero stopping all its movements, like he's in a shock. You notice his face turning red now. ''Uh.. well.. I.. ehm..'' you hear the Nidoking stutter. So cute, but what was he trying to tell? ''Relax, Nero.. what now?'' you ask. The Nidoking gulped yet again, but this time out of nervousness. ''It's.. because, when I found you in that forest.. something snapped to me. I told you about that I was saved by an human in my earlier years, right?'' he asks. ''Riiight..'' you say. ''Well.. I looked at your face, and I saw the resemblence, the little guy that saved me as an baby.. was you.'' he said. ''Me? But.. I don't recall anything.. I..'' you stopped for a moment. It's why your parent's started scolding you. For playing with wild pokemons. Flashbacks play inside your head, of you playing with the little Nidoran, and your parents scolding you. ''That's when I started to remember. That certain feeling I felt for you that day was the same now.. I.. I started to remember.. that feeling was.. love.'' Nero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both quiet for a time, when you started tearing up, you noticed the Nidoking's claw against your cheek. ''There, there.. no need to cry.'' he says, with a gentle smile on his face. You look at him, and you didn't even hesitate about it, you kissed him on his lips, shocking the Nidoking very much. ''Z-Zeke..? Y-you do l-love me too?'' he stutters. You smile. ''Ofcourse I do.. You're sweet, gentle and kind.. so.. that's good enough for me.'' you say. You look each other in the eyes, and noticed a sparkle in the eyes of Nero. You then both proceeded to kiss each other. You suddenly felt something warm underneath of you, and noticed Nero grabbing your buttocks gently. ''How about we make out?'' he says, with a naughty grin on his face. You nod.

You walk over to him as sexy as possible, giving the Nidoking already a pretty good boner. Talking about boner, his penis is huge! How is that ever gonna fit? Well, at least if you're bottom, anyway. You push over the Nidoking so he falls to the ground. ''So, buddy.. you want some of this..?'' you say, turning around, showing off your ass to him. ''Stop teasing me and come here already! Let me get a good taste of that ass of yours.'' he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As you wish, my lord..'' you grin, and walked up to his face, spread your buttocks and naughtily slipped his mouth inbetween. You felt Nero's tongue against your buttocks, and soon already felt his tongue penetrating your anus. You moan, it felt so good.. you noticed his dick, pointing at you, and you looked at Nero's paw, who was kind of ''fapping'', as you may say. You bow forward, and put your hand on Nero's paw, and started sucking off the big boy's dick, and tried to go as deep as you could. ''Hm.. man.. your ass tastes.. not too bad actually.'' he says. ''Thank you.. and if I may say.. your dick tastes AMAZING.'' you say. ''Thanks.'' Nero answered. ''I kept it nice and warm just for you, babe.'' he says. You blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well.. looks like that takes care of that.. your insides are wet enough, and my dick too.'' Nero says, gently taking back his tongue, and putting you on his belly. ''Oh, right.. we didn't discuss this yet.. I bet you want to take this dick, hm?'' he says, grinning at you. ''Or do you want to be the ''master'' of me?''</span></div></div>",

I want you to..'' you say. ''Ah, good.. here we go then.. prepare yourself.'' he says. As soon as he finished his sentence, you felt his cock going up and down your asshole. Your dick was throbbing, and it felt so great. You got humped up and down, and you felt the pulse of Nero's throbbing dick against the walls of your anus. ''Ah.. you.. you're good..'' you say. ''I..

It was only given this name because you, and countless others, have heard it, night after night, singing its haunting melody.Oddly enough, the song hasn't worked on humans, but you've seen several formidable Pokemon ditch a good meal because they heard its song. Because of this reasoning, you are absolutely positive the being is some kind of Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending most of the day collecting wood for a fire, making sure your food storage was good enough to last you the month, all of the things you'd normally do, you sat in your home in wait.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasnt bad being an intern for a pokemon research center that studies the supernatural. Sure, you didnt believe in it, but it didnt matter to you. It was easy experience and it beats studying several years spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in some big wig university when you can actually get some experience and hands-on training for free! Granted the researchers were pretty odd and had very interesting personalities, but nothing unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Imariel was quite possibly the most interesting pokemon prof you had the privilege of working for. The slightly heavy-set incredibly curly bearded chap had a professional demeanor and always kept an even temper regardless of any stressing situation despite his odd interest in imaginary creatures seemed anything but professional.<br>\r\nHe talked a lot about things called 'Ultra Beasts'. Pokemon from a whole other dimension called 'Ultra Space'. He'd go on and onin deep detail about what he knew about them (or what he THOUGHT he knew) despite no other pokemon professor that you know of even believes in any of that stuff. Imariel, on the other hand, devoted an entire lab to study the fictional Ultra Beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd check him off as a little crazy, but he's provided free lodging AND a trade that'll help when you look for a REAL job as a pokemon researcher, so you keep your mouth shut and do as youre told. Besides, your internship was pretty easy to follow through. Just jot down notes, pay attention to detail, humor him when he goes on a UB-rant, sight-see, and assist with clean up. You got no incentive to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the final week of your internship, Imariel claims he has just discovered the location of one of these so-called Ultra Beasts and demands you come with him to this uncharted tribal island in the middle of nowhere to witness it in all it's majesty. Being stupid and loving to travel, you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccording to what I've researched, the natives of Hime-Hime Island perform a special ceremony paying tribute to what they believe is their goddess of the moon,\u201d he explained to his staff during the cruise ride to the island, \u201clegend has it this moon goddess appears before them once every 50 years on this very day. From my interview with their tribal chief, her physical description that he gave me bears a rather uncanny resemblance to what may very be UB-04. Also known as 'Celesteela'.\u201d<br>\r\nProfessor Imariel turns his head to you, \u201c[Anthony], I'm gonna require you to come with me to meet the chief. Your attendance is absolutely detrimental to my project.\u201d Detrimental, he says! \u201cAre you ready to make history?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am, Professor Imariel!\u201d you state with more pride than you really had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHime-Hime Island didnt seem like the stereotypical 'tribal' island you assumed it be. Instead of a 'tropical' setting, it was more like a 'far eastern oriental' theme. You know, shrines, pagodas,cherry blossom trees, huge drums, lanterns, that sort of thing. And judging from the fireworks, lit candles and the music, they were having a festival. No doubt to pay tribute to the 'moon goddess'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImariel marched toward the big fancy looking shrine with you following and met with who assumed was the island chief. The professor bowed and the chief bowed back before speaking to him in an unfamiliar language. Imariel replied back in the same language as the island's soldiers surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine. They were already aware we were coming,\u201d he explained to you, \u201cthey've arranged special front row seats to witness the grand return of the moon goddess in all her glory.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you say, pretending to sound more excited than you really are, \u201cI cant wait to see the great Celesteela herself.\u201d<br>\r\nImariel translated what you said to the chief. He smiled and said something as he pointed to you.<br>\r\n\u201c[Anthony], present yourself to the chief,\u201d he translated.<br>\r\nYou nodded and stepped up to the old balding heavy-set gentlemen in oriental dress. The chief observed you carefully, feeling your face and cheekbones, observing your eyes, and inspecting your mouth. After an uncomfortable brief moment, he nods his head and calls his soldiers over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Who quickly grab your arms and restrain you. This didnt seem like a friendly gesture so you got concerned.<br>\r\n\u201cP-Professor Imariel, what are they doing?\u201d you asked him who looked completely unchanged by this action.<br>\r\n\u201cTheyre going to offer you as tribute,\u201d he calmly replied. Certainly not a friendly gesture.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Tribute?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat was part of the deal I made with the chief,\u201d he nonchalantly explained, \u201cin exchange for helping me with my research, I would provided him with a worthy tribute to their goddess. I couldnt think of one more worthy than yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wha, w-w-wait!!!\u201d you struggled, \u201cwhat kind of tribute are they looking for?!\u201d<br>\r\nImariel asks the chief. The chief goes on a long speech, ushering his arms, raising them up to the sky then downward, clenching his fists and opening them as he speaks with such passion in his voice.<br>\r\n\u201cSacrifice,\u201d Imariel answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSACRIFICE?!!\u201d you heard him correctly, \u201cTH-THAT'S RIDICULOUS! I DIDNT AGREE TO THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm afraid you did [Anthony],\u201d Imariel corrects you, \u201cthe waiver you signed clearly stated there may be controversial situations you'd be involved in within this line of work that would be hazardous to your health.\u201d He considered human sacrifice as a 'controversial situation'?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your clear frustration, the islanders were not patient for it. You were immediately dragged off as you screamed, \u201cYOU WONT GET AWAY WITH THIS! MY FAMILY'LL SUE!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey cant sue! That's in the waiver, too!\u201d he shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought desperately to break free of your captors, but they were strong and there were many of them. Still, you struggled and squirmed all the way to the summit of a mountain where the majority of the villagers were gathering around. After nearly tiring yourself out resisting in vain, your captors tie you to a pole on the summit. Far down below,  you could see the damn professor and a few of his assistants alongside the island chief and several villagers looking up at you. You could hear active music that had good rhythm and beat, but in your situation, they may as well have been singing \u201cNA NA NA NA HEY HEY HEY GOODBYE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet the camera ready, Ali,\u201d Imariel ordered one of his assists, \u201cwe are about to witness an extraordinary phenomenon that may not ever occur again in our lifetimes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner after he said that, thunder and lightning struck! The clouds began to shift and spin! Then the earth rumbled and shook! You were hit by an incredibly bright blinding flash and your ears buzzed like you were hit by a flashbang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud high-pitch howl that echoed all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT WAS THAT?! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!!\u201d you screamed with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief shouted to his people with enthusiasm in his voice.<br>\r\n\u201cBehold! Our great beloved goddess in all her glory graces our presence!\u201d Imariel translated with the same enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUUUUUUUUUUU!!!\u201d you heard the high-pitch howl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me down! Let me down! Let down! LET ME DOWN!!!\u201d you panicked but no one paid attention to your cries. They were staring in awe at the colossal figure that appeared in the distance.<br>\r\nA giant green-haired feminine figure with an outrageously long skinny accordion-like neck with a huge spike sticking out of the top of it's head and two blade-like protrusions poking out of the sides of it. Though you couldnt see the eyes behind it's hair (unless those green orbs on it's forehead ARE the eyes), you can feel then gazing your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's wide abdomen looked like it a green kimono over a large wide rocket which hovered in the air. Your jaw dropped when you saw the detached arms that look like two big bamboo canons with fingers! It wasnt a pokemon, it wasnt even a goddess, it was a living breathing doomsday weapon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUUUUUUUUU!!!\u201d it called out as it approached.<br>\r\nRiddled with fear, you screamed off the top of your lungs but no one cared about your cries except for Imariel.<br>\r\n\u201cDont scream too much! She's very easy to startle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelesteela continued her approach and you were running out of time before your fate was left in her mercy. If you were gonna act, you need to act fast!</span></div></div>",

If anyone ever asked you what was your favorite season, it'd take you no more than a second to response in big bold letters FALL! Because it was the absolutely perfect time of the year to go jogging!<br>\r\nThe blistering hot summer weather's long gone, but the unbearable freezing your pokeballs off winter weather is still a ways away. The lightly cool wind blew through your skin and hair as you jogged down the beaten field. The sun is out, but it's not blindingly bright so you dont need glasses. It's pretty cloudly, but with a near 0% chance of rain according to the weatherman who is never wrong (and not just because the law arrests inaccurate weather forecasters in this region!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd best of all, no wild pokemon prowling around. The tall grass they like to use for ambushes have already dried up and withered away. Without their best factor for the element of surprise, the vast majority tend to leave this route and migrate to more grassier territory or near the mountains where there are plenty of big rocks and caves for hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, without the wild pokemon, there are no loud annoying pokemon trainers wandering about trying to hunt them down or challenging eachother to pokemon battles, which means jogs down the Route are peaceful and quiet. Plenty of time and opportunity to clear your head of any bad chi while you work your cardio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until today that is. Turns out not ALL the wild pokemon were drawn away from the Route during the Fall season. In fact, some may have been drawn toward it. One in particular you've had the pleasure of encountering. And unfortunately for you, it was a very slimy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Poink!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour peaceful relaxing jog came to a pause because you stepped in something you really shouldnt have. It was wet, squishy, gooey, and slimy. Ew.<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026 great,\u201d you groaned in disgust. Your immediately assumption was that you stepped in some fresh poke-droppings.<br>\r\nBut you looked down and notice that it wasnt droppings. It was slime. Clear, greenish, sticky, wet slime! And it stuck to your shoe pretty well! Dang, and they were brand new, too. Still cringing, you grind your shoe against the dirt to scrape off some that sticky gooey stuff.<br>\r\n\u201cHope it's not poisonous,\u201d you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished scraping off what you could, you noticed there were more puddles of slime down the path you were taking. Bad feeling. <br>\r\nYou wondered where they came from, but you had a pretty good guess. Mustve been left behind by a really slimy pokemon. A grimer, maybe? Best not tread that way then! The last thing you want is to get attacked by a poison type!<br>\r\nUnforunately, while you were busy observing the slime tracks, you failed to notice said slimer had already crept up at you from right behind! By the time you noticed something was behind you, you spotted the shadow of a rather long neck with long tentacle-like protrusions sticking out the head portion descend on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGooo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's slightly high pitched voice called from above. You froze up, taking slow quiet breaths, and gathered your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoo\u2026.draaaaa...\u201d it called again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you turned, very slowly, hoping not to spook whatever just caught you off guard! After a long uncomfortable minute, you finished turning and had to tilt your head at the rather tall lavender-colored pudgy creature staring down at you with it's big green eyes beaming with interest! This bipedal creature stood over 6 feet tall with long tentacle-like antennae, short stubby horns in front of them, a long purple ventral portion reaching from the bottom down half of it's face all the way down to the very end of it's thick curly tail and big green spots on the sides of it's cheeks and the sides of it's tail! Oh, and it was dripping slime. Very slimy. You definitely didnt wanna touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDraaa! Goo dra!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA GOODRA?!! What the heck is a Goodra doing all the way here in this Route?! They aint native around here! Heck, their nearest habitat that you know of aint for miles! And that place hasnt rained since Spring! But there was no trainer in sight, so it was most certainly wild. Wild and unpredictable. And possibly hungry. And maybe a little disgruntled what with being a long way from home! And possibly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoooooooo...\u201d it's cute slimy face leaned in toward you as if eyeing with sheer curiosity. You could see the sweat dripping down your forehead through the reflection in it's eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason it's here, it's high-leveled dragon-type. Being a dragon-type was bad enough, cuz theyre not meant to be taken likely by beginners! But this dragon-type was Level 50 at the LEAST cuz that was the bare minimum for it's previous form, Sliggo to evolve! Sadly, that's about all you knew about Goodras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDraaa! Goodra!\u201d the Goodra continued to observe you. You had no clue how long it was gonna observe you before it finally reacted! And you had no clue how to properly deal with a wild goodra. Do you ignore it and show no fear like with a Mightyena? Look it right in the eyes and stretch your body out to look taller and more intimidating like with an Ursaring? Play dead like with a Kangaskhan? Compliment it on it's muscular physique like with a Machoke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many options to choose from and such little time to choose from them!<br>\r\nAs you thought, the Goodra continued staring at you with curiosity. It didnt seem very threatening. Maybe it means you no harm. In fact, it's look of beamed interest in you was kinda cute. The Goodra itself looked adorably cute. The huggable kind of cute\u2026 if it wasnt so dang slimy!<br>\r\nThen again, for all you know, one false move and it could swallow you whole in a single gulp! So you had to think carefully. Lucky for you, the Goodra was not impatient. You had plenty of time to think your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you think\u2026 until finally, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You paused for a bit and got closer, maybe it was just a coincidence. He did say he was on a business trip, he was could just talking be talking with his boss no big deal. Until he kissed her, no just kissed but was full on making out with her until he looked up and saw you staring at him. His eyes when wide with shock and in that moment you knew without a shadow of a doubt you knew it was him and it broke your heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get up and say \"It's not what it looks like baby\". But at that moment you were completely crushed. The girl turned around confused \"Whose that babe\". He replied \"Just some crazy chick that won't stop stalking me. I mean she is completely obsessed with me\". You couldn't believe it, how could he do this to you. You spend months together dating to the point where you were considering spending your life with him and he was just done with you like that. You broke down crying and ran off. Within the next few days he used is charm and influence to turn everything against you and that you were a crazy stalker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou friends turned their backs on you and his vile lies decimated your reputation.It felt like your entire world collapsed right under your feet.In the end it got so bad that you had to get on Ember's back in the middle of the night and skip town with little you could carry. You knew not how long you flew or on what islands you landed on nor did you care. As long you were far away that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few weeks you were inconsolable wreak. How could somebody who claimed to love you be so cruel. You felt so alone, betrayed, angry, sad, bitter, hopeless like nobody every really loved you but throughout it all Ember never left your side. Many nights you spent crying into her chest. It took a long time but you putting yourself and your life back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scars left by you ex were still fresh but you were getting better thanks to Ember. Ah Ember, she was your first pokemon and you two basically grew up together. She had always been mischievous at times, stubborn, but she always cared about you. Despite the fact that she loved to play light hearted pranks on you, you found it endearing. Thanks to her you picked pokemon training back up and it helped you take your mind off everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked long and hard together, it was like old times. Well not exactly. Lately you have noticed the nature of her pranks were changing. The weren't mean or innocent but were somehow different. She would sometimes steal your snacks to mess with you but last week she stole your shirt and would not give it back for some odd reason nor could you find it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that there was nobody else you would rather have by your side.

Yeah, a plan might've been cool now. I guess it's improvising time.

Someone's escaping!'' the human says, and the guard already got distracted quickly. As soon as the guards gone, you cut trough the bars and ran trough the hallway, with the human following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard lots of talking suddenly, and immediately stopped, and felt the human bumping into you.

''Do you have amnesia? Because I think they're talking about you here, your name is Laer, apparently, and they gave me to you as an Pokemon, and your rank is currently general.'' you say. ''Laer, huh? That doesn't really say much, but all right. Wait, general? We could use this as an opportunity.'' Laer said. ''What? How?'' you ask. ''Well, let's just act like we're hypnotized, and just walk out the front door like this, making us look like we're on a ''mission.'' he says. Oh, wow.. that's an pretty good idea. ''Let's do it.'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking behind Laer when the door opened, and the rookies immediately started to freeze. ''Oh, S-sir Laer.. I uhm.. we weren't ta--''  the rookie said. ''O-oh.. uh.. Just ignore him, w-why are you here?'' the other rookie asks. Laer, as ''un-emotionally'' possible said. ''We're on a mission, do NOT interrupt us.'' He seemed to have scared the rookies quite a bit so they're silenced. Not too mention you too, that was really good acting. You both walked into the elevator, and went down to the first floor. As soon as the elevator closed, you both relaxed again. ''Oh, pfew.. that went well..'' Laer said. ''Right, but don't let your guard down just yet.'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator came to the floor, you both proceeded to walk quickly towards the entrance, when you get stopped by security. ''Hey, Laer. Can I see your wristband, please?'' One Security Guard said. Fuck, his wristband. This is not good. You notice Laer looking at you desperately, and you just nod. Laer shows his arm, and you quickly push and slash the other guard unconsciouss, while Laer punched the other guard who then lost his balance. ''Run!'' you scream, as you started running, and Laer following. You noticed that Laer is somewhat slower than you, so you decide to carry him, and run away. ''Laer and the Zoroark are escaping, wristbands and collars are off! Repeat..'' you hear, as you run even faster, when you hear bullets hitting the ground. One bullet hit you in the leg, but you still went and ran away, not feeling any pain right now because of the adrealine. After a while, you managed to shake them off, and you notice a cabin. It looks abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo in the cabin?</span></div></div>",

I'm fine.. I.. hng..'' you say, as you tried to stand up but fell down again. ''Dammit..'' you mumble. ''No, you're not okay. Uh, let me search around here..'' Laer said, as he quickly wandered off, and quickly came back again with some sort of medkit. ''Here, let me patch you up..'' he says, as he started treating your wound. Oh, man.. this guy is so sweet and caring.. luckily you've taken him with you. You look at how he's treating your wound. Seems like he's doing a prety good job. He even removed the bullet pretty quickly. ''Th-thanks, Laer..'' you say. ''No problem, buddy.. it's the least I can do after you helped me escape.'' he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There, good as new. All right, you can walk, but don't put too much pressure on it, all right?'' he says. ''All right..'' you say. You started looking at Laer. If you're being honest.. he's kind of cute..

Can't get enough of my ass?'' you say, as you started standing up, and walking to Laer as elegant as possible, swinging your hips from side to side. ''U-uh.. Z-zoroark.. I.. uhm.. your ass.. i mean.. uhm..'' he stutters. You look him in the eyes. ''Yeah..?'' you say. ''W-we can't.. you're a pokemon.. and..'' he stutters. ''So, what? You like this, right?'' you say, as you turned around, and naughtily pushed his face between your buttocks. Laer pushed himself somewhat off your buttocks, and answered; ''W-well, yes.. k-kinda..'' he says. ''Well, noone is stopping you, right?'' you said, as you turned around. You then went ahead and began sitting on the couch, naughtily doing the finger to lure him here, and Laer came to you pretty quickly.

After quite a good kiss, you felt your penis erecting, and felt incredibly horny. You look at Laer, who looks amazed at your dick. ''Nice, isn't it, Laery~?'' you said. ''Y-yeah..'' he said. You started to dress off the human, wanting to mate as soon as possible. Laer didn't resist and put off his pants, underwear and other clothing off too. You notice..</span></div></div>",

You started whispering in his ear. ''Hey, you can fuck me, but don't cum in my ass, I've got a surprise for that little guy over there.'' you whisper. ''Aight.'' The Machoke answers. You walk up to Laer again. ''Hey, buddy.. ready?'' you ask. ''Y-yeah.. I'm r-ready..'' he said, as he bend forward, revealing his anus. You thrust your dick inside of Laer, and heard him moaning already. ''Can you hold on, Laer..?'' you ask. ''U-uh.. y-yeah.. b-bring it..'' he says. ''If you say so.'' you say, and you started humping Laer. You suddenly felt the Machoke's dick penetrating your anus. ''Ohh, Machoke.. Nice and big, man.'' you say. ''Thanks, bro.. you've got an really nice ass, but can you take it all?'' he asks. ''Very likely, c'mon, thrust it in, faggot.'' you say. ''Who's calling who a faggot, bitch?'' Machoke said, as he humped his dick further in, making you hump your dick further inside Laer too. You all three moan. Man, this felt great. You and Machoke humped like there was no tommorow, and Laer just took it all. ''You certainly do like it, huh Laer?'' you ask. ''Y-yeah..'' he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of humping you notice Laer starting to mumble. ''I-I'm going to..'' he said, as you heard a lot of squirting of cum. ''Heh heh, can't hold on long enough, huh, buddy?'' Machoke said. ''Right, like I don't hear you almost cumming.'' you say. ''What..? I'm not almost..'' Machoke said. ''Like I don't feel your cock throbbing. Now get that load out there somewhere, like in Laer's mouth.'' you said. ''Huh? What.. I..'' Laer said, but Machoke already pulled out his dick, and put it in Laer's mouth, and soon already cummed in his mouth. You also felt like cumming, so now might've been a good idea. You start releasing your cum inside of Laer, and it felt magnificent. After your last squirt, you took his dick out of your butt, and looked at Laer. ''Are.. Are you all.. all right, Laer?'' you ask, exhausted. ''M-More.. than okay..'' Laer said. Machoke loudly laughed. ''Welp, I'll leave you to this ''surprise'' of yours.'' he says, as he just walked away. ''Surprise?'' Laer asks. ''Yeah..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo the surprise?</span></div></div>",

A trainer wanted to challenge us but after his memory reminded him of our last encounter he fled for place unknown.  My trainer look at my behind like it's gonna vanish at any moment, i have caught doing this from time to time, i don't put much attention to him and continue walking at relaxed pace. Sometimes i would have swear to have heard other vuplix in our home, but i found nor smelled any, beside some musky scent in his room. I'll think about this later. The forest is, vibrant there is no other term for it, vibrant with life.That would imply bothersome bug as well of course, bugs that do not make us wait for long. Sometimes, i think that they have a bone to pick with me or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria ember!\" The flame exit from my muzzle and strike the insufferable wurmple back into oblivion. Despite my clear victory, that damn bugs has hit me with his damned String Shot, again. I hate that move, i hate the very existence of every filthy creature that can use that move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Saria, come let's rest a little\" As if you had done something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tree should give us some cover, come.\" Yeah, yeah I'm coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lazy trainer decide to lay with his head on the tree, leaving the rest of his body in the shadow of said tree. I walk to him and jump on his stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off, Saria!\" Hehe, i look at him straight in the face then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul! Vulpix Vul\" Lazy bast....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Saria a treat when we return home, sounds good?\" Better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul\" After clarifying our position i turn around and lay on his stomach with my muzzle towards his legs, the soporific effect of laziness reach me immediately later. I start to close my eyes, and at this point my lazy trainer start to pet me, at least he do something useful from time to time. Slowly he caress my luxurious fur, and i fell him try to remove the remnants of the string shot, making his hand trail lower, removing what is still tangled with my tail, urgh, to damn bugs doesn't even have a decent...aha! What is this? Ahaa yes. I abruptly turn and see my trainer is touching me just behind my tails, what he is ahaaaaa. My muzzle open on it's own, electricity flow trough me, like that battle with luxi ahaaaa....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the same, but it's not painful, is feeling, aha. I am painting at this point, my tongue get out of my muzzle, his finger caress something under my tails, there is some string there too? Why is so Aha! Wha.. i freeze, something entering me, what's is this feel? I can't move or think, it's slightly in, then, as it has come, the feeling go way and i release the breath i didn't even know i was keeping. I never aha! Again deeper this time, i feel it stretching me, but it's not painful, it's good, it's moving aha it's feel so good. Now what, ha..happening, it's pumping in and out, aha. I am panting, like i am tired but i am not! Why it's so go..ha! I feel this, thing, his fingers! Pumping in and out, another?! Ahaaa, yes more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point my mind go blank, i can only feel my body moving on it's own, my tails rise and i feel myself pushing back on his fingers, something is slowly building inside me, and when i am close he push a third finger in, then after a moment he start pushing again, harder, faster. I want it! I like this feeling, I feel like i am going to burst, yes more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain my mind go blank, i am like frozen, i feel my inside clenching on his fingers, and i release something, l don't know, he is still pumping. Then suddenly he stop and i crumble on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am breathing heavily, i don't know how much time is passed, a moment, an hour? The feeling hasn't left me yet. I am content. I look behind me and see him licking his finger, he evidently like it. I turn my head again and in front of me his, pants has a tent in it. What's that, somithing got inside his pants? Ho no! i must help him. I bet it's one of those damn bugs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI touch the tent with with my paw, thing to squish the hated intruder, i heard a him exaling, and his breath is quckening, damn bugs! The are harming him now?! I'll kill it , I'll kill them all! I try to squeeza the tent, and then delicately, i bite at it. Not strogly i don't want to harm my trainer by chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, Saria no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at im, what? I am helpin you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Saria, it's nothing,.......really it's noting\" with his check are so red? Bah, fine if you don't want my help, but it's better you don't bring one home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vuplix! Pix! Vul!\" I make my statement clear, and evidently he understand, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Saria, let's go home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul!\" While we walk home, something is leaking out of me, oh! The liquid! Whats was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I'll ask him later, i feel pretty tired despite having done little. I will rest home on the couch for a while. With hi, as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes home come to view, reminding myself to \"ask him\" later, i got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouch how i miss you so.</span></div></div>",

As i have hoped he start petting me, than he go lower on my rump and start caress my tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria, there is something i need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to turn to face him, but he keep his hands on my rump, he let his finger descend where i am leaking, stroking slightly, aha!

Only when two love each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAha! Really? Gooood then that i care for you, isn't that love? Aha! More!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria, stop for a moment\" I reluctantly, stop. More because he remove his finger than anything but still. I turn my head and listen. Hiss cheek are all red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must understand, that this lead to do something much deeper\" Deeper? Better than, ah no, not deeper in that sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing is called mating, or at least the preparation to it, and it's supposed to do only between....you know lover\" Lover? You mean affection, i have that plenty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we continue, we become...like mates. You understand Saria?\" Mates, yes i understand like our neighbor pokemon, so it's that why they was so noisy from time to time. Is in this way that you express affection? I'm ok with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wait a few more moments looking at me, then \"Are you ok with this?\" More than ok, i want to feel good, and i have plenty affection for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul! Vulpix Vul!\" i nod happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope that you have Saria, for both of us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter our little conversation he turn me around once more and wait. I lift my tails and he put his finger inside. He is not gentle like before, and start pump me immediately but i love it all the same. I feel his fingers reach deep within me and i vocalize my appreciation loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul! Vul! Vul!\" I feel his finger move around and the sensation is sublime. Looking in from of me i see the tents in his pants once again, there! Those damn bugs, why now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get ready to pounce but he stop me gripping my rumps with one hand, while the other still pump at a lighter pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Saria, is just my cock, it's my.....equivalent of you\" Equi-valent? \"I am stimulating your pussy, Saria, your female part, and that is my male part instead\" Oh, i got it. It's raising?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we are finished, my part will go inside yours, it's much thicker so it's should feel very good for you\" Better?  \"Look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then remove his pants and what i will know in the future his underwear, a pointy piece of flash raise up from his hips. It's leaking, like mine? A strong smell of...i...i am fell lightheaded, confuse? no whats thats?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to move forward toward the pointy flash, cock? thats how he called it, my instinct tell me to..lick it? ok. He stop me however and say \"One moment Saria\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stop pumping his finger, remove them from within me, and lift me up. He get up and seat intead of laying, then he place my muzzle near his cock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it, Saria\" His fingers return in me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vuuuul\" and i agree immediately. I open my muzzle and extend my tongue on the dripping part. Salty? Not unpleasant on my tongue and i feel even more excited. I start lapping with gusto and i feel he moaning now. Soo am i good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul vulpix vul?\" His face contort for a moment, he look elated, his voice is different, quicker, lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Saria, continue\" i don't let him tell it twice. I continue to lap where the leaking is and he start pushing his finger faster and faster. I feel like i am gonna blow any moment now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vuuuui!\" Unable to contain myself anymore i let it go. I feel my inside on fire and my flash contracting and trying to drive him deeper. He continue to pump his finger at gentler pace now, the feeling continue for a while, i don't know how long, then i stop and i collapse with my muzzle near the base of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good Saria but we are not finished\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul vulpix vul\" I feel soooo tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel to tired we can continue this tomorrow, alright?\"</span></div></div>",

Another usual morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of clashing dishes remove the little sleep left in me, my hears point towards the source of the offending disturbance only to hear him cursing at the dishwasher with a vehemence that would make a Gyarados recoil in it's wake. A smile appear on my muzzle, yes typical morning indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyelids, letting the day brighten my already good mood, the dull pain that the light bring on my eyes quickly fade, after a hundred times i barely notice it anymore. As my retina focus, the blurred light yellow color of the bedroom come to greet me; i decide to get up, pushing my legs under me, first my front paw, then the back one, a ritual old as the prehistoric dance that i appreciate so much, a dance that i repeat every day with my lover. I still feel his seed moving in my belly, and soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risa! Come breakfast is ready!\" Of course it is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes finally refocus and the spartan looking room finally become visible in all it's glory...well not really the bed is quite soft tough, i turn around and behind my withe fluffy tails, i notice the stains of something withe and sticky attached to the upper sheets. Hehehe, i will once again prove my affection to him soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i get off the bed, i hear him again <b>Crash</b> or maybe it would be better say that i hear what he is doing. \"Risa!\" Yeah, yeah..pfffff, human<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine! Tail Nine!\" I am coming, no need to rush breakfast...hehehehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i walk towards the kitchen, i notice that the couch is still dirty, the memory of our first time return to me, when months ago still as a Vulpix, we expressed our affection and our bound as a team, a bound that we daily renew since that night. I smile as i remember his cock penetrating my womb, painful but pleasurable at the same time, and the release....i leaked for....i don't know, a lot! Sadly since my evolution, he is not long enough to go that deep, but still....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally reach the round, wood dining table, a chair is there, left ready for me to seat, but first...i feel needy again, my nethers feels so hot and i know only one cure for my affliction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jump on the seat and i rest my rump on it, that fastidious feeling again, not long now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seat on the chair opposed to me me,  i act, using a simple psychic trick, i release a weak energy pulse directly to him, while not powerful enough to harm him it's still quite the disorienting experience, then i jump down the chair and while he is still recovering, i place my muzzle at his short and start licking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, wha....Risa! Not no.ha!\" The short taste quite badly, but i can smell my prize under them, the arousing smell of our night activity still linger on him, and i need more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ris..ahh..n.no.not..ah..not now Risa\" He push my muzzle out, i reluctantly stop my ministration, and look at him from under the table, i put on the needy puppy expression hoping that...\"No Risa, not now ok? I...need some time to recover, at least a few hours, what happened to you anyway, you have never been so.....uh? I got it now, how can i be so..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? No? No way! Now! I need it now! \"Risa, you are experiencing your first heat, normally you should have gotten...well..you should have gone into heat as a Vulpix but..our..constant activity soothed you and...eh...yeah thats, now that you are a Ninetails however you instinct is stronger and so your....need\" .......????.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the fix is a good rut? I totally agree! \"Nine!\" i happily turn around and show him my inflamed, needy sex to him, hoping to gain his help, i shake my rump, come onnn...your Risa Need you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..ah..yeah..i..understand Risa but...i am tired, seriously, we mated at least 4 times last night and i...want you but i need...my libido need to recover and so my penis <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">it's still stinging..</font>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrroowll\" I start to get angry now, you are my lover, i neeeeeed you help and you are denying it to me? \"Nine!

Risa what the..\" I jump on him and place my claw at his short, and with a decisive calculated strike i shred them to pieces \"Shit! Risa Caaaaa...\" I immediately start to lick his cock, placing the tip in my muzzle and suck as hard as i can, wet slopping noise can be heard coming from me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh..Risa..sto...ahhh! Ri..ah.shit!\" I bob my head up and down always keeping my hot tongue on his now quickly raising organ, nearly there...i force his leg down with my front paws, keeping them as the side of the chair he is still ^seating on^, forcing him to remain still \"Ahh!..ah o..ok ah! fine I'll mate you j ah..stop!\" Finally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up, placing my still sticky front paw on the chair, then i push myself up grinding my sex on his face \"Nii nine!\" i feel his tongue parting my lower lips, yes there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen knowing what will happen i get down from him and present, just like he taught me that night, i hear him getting up and place his cock at my ass, teasing me, then he place his hand on my rump and his organ on my now dripping pussy, then he finally push in \"Ni Nine!\" I feel his cock spreading my desperate insides, gripping him with unnatural strength..it's feel soooo good, much better than last night<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push back, impaling myself on him \"Nine!\" Then he place an hand on my back, pushing my front part down, i raise my rump as much as i can. I feel him trying to place my rump as vertical as possible, while my insides massage his cock during the whole time he is in, getting grunted moan from him, but i still i need more....more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally move again, extracting himself from my gripping walls, then nearly out he push all the way in \"Ni!\" Yes, there deeper \"So my slutty Risa, are you happy now? Happy that i will fuck you like a whore?\" He push harder at the last word, ah! Finally! Harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't reply, instead i grip him with all the strength i can muster, pushing back on his thrust, he build up a rhythm, much frenzied than usual, and i enjoy it immensely. \"Niene! Nine! Ni! Ni! Nine! Nine!\" Harder, he push inside harder and faster, my tongue help me cool down, i breath heavily, if he can only go a little deeper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis trust become frenetic, i feel my insides burning, the electric feeling is there stronger then ever, but i can't...i want to release..but i can't! I need him! I need his seed! I push back harder, i am so close but i can't it's so frustrating! Harder! Faster! \"Niiiine! Ni! Nine!Nine!Nine!\" Why?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grip the floor with my claw, i feel the pavement giving in! Why don't he give it to me?! \"Here Risa! Here it come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel he push as deep as he can, then finally, his cool sticky liquid get pumped is short rapid pulse inside my needy tunnel, i feel his liquid reach my womb and slowly going in.<br>\r\nIf only he could burst in like when i was a Vulpix, it will be so much better. I feel his release coming to it's end...Already!? I need much more than this \"Nineeeee ni nine ninetails nine!\" I express mi disapproval at his reduced donation \"Ah, sorry ah Risa but i..ah..told you i need...rest\" I can hear his panting breath on my back, he is tired already...noooo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Want more, Need more.....\"NINE!\" You are mine! I won't release you so easily.........I froze, i feel something, something from my hearth? my chest it's coming out...it's...going toward him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risa...Risa? What's happening? What.......\" he stop, i can feel his cock inside me throbbing, then nothing, suddenly i am tired, i feel empty, cold. \"Risa what..\" He remove himself from me and i fall to the floor \"Risa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a connection....something deep and....beautiful between us....i need some rest \"Risa! Are you...fine? i feel...you...? Are you tired...? Alright i....bring you on the couch ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lift me up and i feel the roughness of the couch touching my fur, then again, i fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

The second he leaves, you jump to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is his birthday today. It doesn\u2019t seem he remembered, being so busy and all, but you definitely did! You\u2019ve been planning all month to have the perfect surprise ready for him -- his favorite lumiose galettes, homemade with love! Of course, being a Pok\u00e9mon, you\u2019ve never cooked anything before\u2026 but it couldn\u2019t be that hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your trainer Sakuma used to spend many a lazy afternoon together, wandering the beautiful city and meeting all sorts of interesting people. But nowadays, he spends all of his time studying at the Lumiose City Academy, leaving you to lounge around in his apartment, doing housework and trying to kill time. You always wish you could just go on adventures together like you used to\u2026 but Sakuma is just so busy nowadays, you can\u2019t bring yourself to impose on him. You just do what you can to make him happy, whenever he\u2019s around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled open your personal chest, retrieving all the supplies you had been gathering over the months in preparation for today. With this, you noticed your first problem -- all the ingredients, the flour, the apricorns, the berries, were soggy and moist. You realize you probably should\u2019ve picked a better container to keep these in. <i>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll probably be fine\u2026\u201d</i> you think to yourself, kneading the squishy, foul-smelling berries in your paw. <i>\u201cHe probably won\u2019t even notice!\u201d</i> Still, panic was already starting to creep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dough crumbled when you tried to roll it out, the berries melted in your hands, the recipe insisted on ingredients you had never even heard of, and time was quickly running out until your trainer returned home. You tried to calm your nerves by reminiscing on old days while you worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuma never had any interest in becoming a serious Pok\u00e9mon trainer. He always wanted to become an engineer, and improve society as a whole instead of seeking personal glory. Still, when he left his hometown to study in Lumiose city, his mother insisted he get a starter Pok\u00e9mon to keep him safe. Back when he was alone in Lumiose, you were his only friend, and the two of you spent all day together, going on adventures. But now, he has real friends. Human friends. And you? You were just\u2026 his Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess you should be thankful he at least never keeps you in a Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize with a start that you\u2019ve left the oven running this entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorry excuses for galettes looked mangled and burnt, with crust that was both soggy and overbrowned, and the berries a sloppy mess. You whimpered a little as you looked down on the birthday treat you had been so looking forward to creating. How could you have failed so spectacularly? Any human could have done this easily. Maybe that\u2019s why Sakuma doesn\u2019t hang out with you much anymore. Maybe you don\u2019t deserve him in the first place. You\u2019ll never be as smart, or funny, or charismatic as all Sakuma\u2019s real friends are. You\u2019ll always just be his dumb, useless Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you hear your trainer opening the doorway, and you realize there are tears in your eyes. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cKiyota, I\u2019m back!\u201d</b></span> he called, and you cringed. You felt the panic in your chest, and wanted more than anything to hide all the evidence of your little venture, but you were frozen in place. You could only stand there, covered in flour, clutching the foul-smelling mixture in your paws as he walked in. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cUh\u2026 whoa. What have you been up to?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"I-I'm sorry...\"</span> you say, feeling the tears flow more freely now. <span class=\"cborange\">\"I was set up to make a nice surprise for you, but... I-I just can't do anything right...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWhoa, Kiyota...\u201d</b></span> Sakuma frowned, tossing his bag aside and kneeling down to face you. He took you up in his arms, and you cried weakly into his shoulder as he comforts you, wetting his jacket with tears. You had been trying to keep these emotions bottled up for months, but now, they were all pouring out. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWhat's this all about?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"Y-you and your friends are so good at so many things! Human things! Cooking, computers, engineering...\"</span> you say, feeling the tears flow more freely now. <span class=\"cborange\">\"I r-really want to be like your friends, but I just can't figure any of it out! I'm j-just a Pok\u00e9mon...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cCome on, Kiyota. You know better than that,\u201d</b></span> Sakuma said, obviously a little taken aback that you felt that way. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018just a Pok\u00e9mon\u201d. You\u2019re my best friend, and you can do anything you set your mind to. There\u2019s plenty of things you\u2019re better than me at, after all.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. <span class=\"cborange\">\"Y-you really think so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cOf course. Different people are good at different things. Nothing wrong with that,\u201d</b></span> Sakuma smiled, and you smiled back a little. He gazed over at the burnt mess that was lying on the floor. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cNow what were you trying to make, here? Some galettes?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"Yeah...\"</span> you nod, a bit ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cTell you what. Why don\u2019t we cook something up together? I can give you a few pointers,\u201d</b></span> Sakuma offered, and smiled so warmly you couldn\u2019t help but smile back. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cThen we can have a nice dinner together. After all, if you wanted to hang out all this time, you could\u2019ve just asked.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dry your face with your paw, realizing how silly you had been. Of course Sakuma cared for you. You WERE one of his real friends, and you have been for years. Just because you\u2019re a Pok\u00e9mon\u2026 that doesn\u2019t change anything. <span class=\"cborange\">\"That sounds\u2026 perfect,\"</span> you reply with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While sucking gently on the dick in your mouth, you think back on the events that got you into this situation, as people with dicks in their mouths are apt to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a Pok\u00e9mon trainer isn\u2019t always as exciting as it seems. As with all \u2018adventurous\u2019 careers, it\u2019s mostly down time. Routes are a lot longer than some people believe, most taking days to transverse; thus, your trainer, Kataoka, spends most of his time simply walking from town to town in complete silence, enjoying the peace and quiet of nature. Despite the fact that your legs always felt sore, you did enjoy sharing your trainer\u2019s nomadic life style. The peace and <br>\r\nquiet of the natural trails gave you a lot of time to just\u2026 think. And you\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trainer and you were always moving from place to place, wandering the wilderness on your own, not really able to make many permanent friends along the way. For years, you\u2019ve been his only real companion\u2026 and thus, you\u2019ve volunteered to take care of his \u2018needs\u2019, whenever the necessity arises, and he does the same for you whenever you\u2019re in estrus. That\u2019s all it was -- <i>routine maintenance</i>. Surely neither of you were <i>enjoying</i> it or anything! You <i>definitely</i> weren\u2019t a couple. Admittedly, these flings have slowly been becoming more and more frequent and intimate\u2026 but surely, your trainer must just be fantasizing about one of the <i>human</i> girls he knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, a human like him could never fall in love with a simple Pok\u00e9mon like you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Kataoka fondly as you cradled his shaft with your tongue. He hasn\u2019t been able to shave yet on this expedition, giving him a prominent five o\u2019clock shadow, which you always loved. He also donned a thick brown flight jacket to protect him from the chilly northern winds, which gave him a bit of an outdoorsy look. Something about him just seemed so perfect to you. <b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cKurisu, seriously\u2026 you don\u2019t have to...\u201d</span></b> He said, looking a little guilty. Just a few minutes earlier, the two of you had been sitting around the campfire, when you noticed a long-brewing tension in your companion that you were more than happy to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cShh\u2026\u201d</span></b> You whisper, crudely. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cLet me take care of you\u2026\u201d</span></b> You struggled with the english language, but you knew how to say a few basic phrases, having been patiently taught by your trainer. Still, you preferred to stay silent most of the time, but Kataoka always loved to hear your voice during sex, so you whisper sweet nothings into his ears whenever you need to calm him down. Seeing how willing your are, Kataoka hesitantly leans back and relaxes, closing his eyes as you gently take his entire shaft in your mouth, letting it press against the back of your throat. Besides the sound of the campfire, the two of you were dead silent, both trying to pretend not to enjoy this; however, Kataoka can\u2019t help but let out little moans as you slide your tongue back and forth against his shaft, which you have to admit excites you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your lips back and forth along his shaft painfully slowly, sending your tongue over every inch of your trainer\u2019s manhood as you gently suck him off by the campfire. He was always worried that another trainer might stumble upon the campsite, but in the vast expanse of the wilderness, that was next to impossible. It was just you and him, now\u2026 and the two of you had as long as you needed. Eventually, you sense that the man\u2019s about to reach his climax, and plunge his shaft as deep into your maw as it would fit. It didn\u2019t take long for your trainer to blow his load down your throat, and you delighted as you felt the man tense up, completely failing to stifle one last moan as he thrusted forward. You listened to his exhausted pants as you made sure to swallow every last drop, before finally opening your mouth, letting his manhood slip free from your lips. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cThere\u2026\u201d</span></b> You whisper, softly. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that all better?\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded curtly, still not daring to open his eyes. As you sit there, slowly licking his shaft clean, you wonder what he must be thinking about. He might\u2019ve been fantasizing about that lady that runs the Blackthorn gym\u2026 or perhaps he was picturing the lady that hosts that news channel he's always watching. Or, maybe\u2026 he was thinking about <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly wipe that thought from your mind. That was silly. You were just a simple, ugly Pok\u00e9mon. Why would he ever be fantasizing about somebody like you? \u2026 at least, that\u2019s what you tell yourself. Either way, you fall asleep that night wrapped in his arms, as the two of you keep each other comfy and warm throughout the dark, cold night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, you were back out on the road again, following contentedly by your trainer\u2019s side. You\u2019d get goosebumps sometimes when you look up at him, still feeling the buzz from last night. Every once in awhile, he\u2019d check his Pok\u00e9tch, keeping track of your progress to the next town. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHow long have we been walking?\u201d</span> You ask, struggling to pronounce certain words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cEighteen kilometers,\u201d</span> he replies simply. Due to the fact that he was always travelling, Kataoka always wanted to make consistent progress every day; the two of you already take a break for lunch after 20km, and set up camp for the day at 40. Of course, that wouldn\u2019t be strictly necessary today; the two of you are going to arrive in Goldenrod city in just a few hours! You had been bustling with excitement for the entire journey. Goldenrod was your favorite city in Johto! There were all kinds of new sights you\u2019re hoping to see, and old friends you\u2019re hoping to catch up with. Unfortunately, he was only willing to stick around here for a weekend -- Kataoka had business in Saffron City -- but you had already made up your mind to savor every second as much as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you\u2019re only a few minutes away from town, the two of you decide to sit down and have a bit to eat anyway. The restaurants in human cities are alright, but expensive, and to be honest, you enjoyed the soups Kataoka cooks for you even more. He\u2019s learned how to make the perfect stew over the years just to put a smile on your face -- which, you suppose, is what it means for something to be \u201cmade with love\u201d. You help him collect and arrange some kindling in a fire, before you light it up by breathing a single, small flame. You watch with fascination as he brews the soup in a big pot balanced over the fire, the delicious smell drifting through the forest. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSmells delicious,\u201d</span> you say, sniffing at the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles, looking down on you, and you blush a bit. Being a human, he of course can\u2019t find you attractive\u2026 but he does think you\u2019re cute, and that\u2019s close enough. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou say that about everything I cook,\u201d</span> he said, idly stirring the pot with a wooden spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt\u2019s always true,\u201d</span> you reply. You always had a bit of trouble pronouncing the letter \u2018r\u2019. In fact, with the way your snout is shaped, it\u2019s downright impossible. You always found it embarrassing, but Kataoka seemed to find it adorable. He chuckles a little, to your annoyance. Eventually, breakfast is ready, and you chow down while Kataoka fiddles with his journal. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo\u2026 you were up last night,\u201d</span> you decide to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you blankly for a while. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2026 couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d</span> he admitted, and you frowned. Did you do something wrong last night? Did you make him uncomfortable? Just as you were about to ask, he leans forward, offering you his journal. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cBut I did take the time to draw this.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the journal in front of you. One page was covered in all sorts of sketches, most notably a drawing of a grand, majestic bird Pokemon you\u2019ve never seen before, seemingly in flight. The art style was very basic and simplistic, but still impressive. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhoa. What is that?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, just a staraptor,\u201d</span> he replied. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI spotted one roosting while we were walking yesterday.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flipped the pages a few times with your snout, looking through Kataoka\u2019s sketches of various wild Pokemon. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWow, these are really good,\u201d</span> you said, shocked by the quality of a few sketches. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about these?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThey\u2019re nothing special,\u201d</span> he shrugged, dismissively. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI mean, anybody could draw those.\u201d</span> You were about to argue, until you realized; any human could draw these. With your paws, even if you practiced for your entire life, you would never be able to draw like this. Your ears droop as you consider your natural inferiority. There are so many things that come naturally to humans that you would never be able to master. In that moment, though, you wonder\u2026 what if you were a human? You beamed at the thought. If you were a human, you could have a little home in Goldenrod city, and spend all day painting and cooking, and Kataoka and you could get married...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, either way, you need to draw more,\u201d</span> you hurriedly say, realizing you\u2019d gotten lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUh\u2026 alright,\u201d</span> he nodded. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnything you have in mind?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to turn him down, but... <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHm. Maybe\u2026 you could, uh\u2026 draw <i>me</i>? But as, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d</span> you ask, tentatively, trying not to sound weird. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201c... a human?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a brow, giving you a weird look, seeming amused. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAs a human?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah, you know, just, what you think I would look like if I was\u2026 ahem\u2026\u201d</span> You try to explain yourself, but eventually, you\u2019re so embarrassed you start stuttering. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cActually, no. Never mind. That\u2019s a stupid idea.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you a bemused look for a second, before smiling. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d</span> he said, and your ears perk up as he rubs your head, cheerfully. You always love it when he pets you. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019ll get right on it\u2026 right after we make it to town.\u201d</span> You look down, and realized you had devoured the soup while you were distracted by your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201c... oh, right,\u201d</span> you chuckled. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAlright, lead the way!\u201d</span> The two of you promptly packed up your things and walked down the dirt path for another half hour, until the bright lights of the beautiful city became visible over the trees. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWow...\u201d</span> You were practically jumping with excitement by the time you walked through the gates. You had grown used to living in the wilderness, and thus, you were always awed by the sheer scale and beauty of human cities. People and Pokemon were wandering down the streets in unbelievable numbers, and you have to stick close to your trainer\u2019s side to avoid getting lost. You happily greeted the other Pokemon you spot as you walk by. You\u2019d never seen some of these species before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reach a neighborhood atop a hill on the southwest side, giving you an unbelievable view of the vast ocean. This is where Kataoka old friend lived; Isuzu, a friendly Pokemon breeder, who lives in a beautiful, quaint little hut by the sea. Excitement rises in your chest as Kataoka knocks on the door. Eventually, Isuzu pulled it open and greeted you. She looked a little more bookish than you remember, with wide-framed glasses and a dorky green turtleneck sweater hiding her curvy frame. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cKatoaka!\u201d</span> She greeted your trainer cheerfully, holding her arms out for a hug. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh, how long has it been?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cToo long,\u201d</span> he smiled, and you felt a little jealous as he wrapped her in a familial hug. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNice to see ya.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh! Mm! You need a bath,\u201d</span> Isuzu giggles, pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, yeah, sorry. I\u2019ve been walkin\u2019 Route 35 all week,\u201d</span> Kataoka chuckled, a little embarrassed, rubbing the back of his head. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHere, let me get unpacked.\u201d</span> He walks deeper into the house, towards the guest bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAfter all these years, you\u2019re still quite the outdoorsman, huh?\u201d</span> She calls after him. Once he disappeared out of sight, Isuzu finally turns to you, inviting you inside. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAnd how have you been doin\u2019, little lady?\u201d</span> She kneels down, petting you on the back of your neck while you wag your tail cheerfully. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cBeen getting up to trouble?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou betcha!\u201d</span> You nod, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh! I see your english lessons are going well,\u201d</span> she said, seeming a little surprised and impressed to see you speaking human. The last time you and Isuzu talked, you could barely say your own name. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIf only Akako caught on so quickly\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perked up at the very mention of that name. Akako is Kataoka\u2019s prized ninetails, and undoubtedly your best friend in Goldenrod city. The two of you have known each other since you were just a houndour, but unfortunately, you haven\u2019t been able to keep in touch recently. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAkako?\u201d</span> You beam. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIs Akako here?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu giggles at your excitement. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cShe\u2019s in the backyard, by the beach,\u201d</span> she smiled. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cYou two can go explore the city if you want. Me and Kataoka have to catch up.\u201d</span> You nodded, before sprinting off without even bothering to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly run around the side of the house. You had been planning to chill out in Isuzu\u2019s house for a while, but you didn\u2019t want to miss out on a single moment with Akako. She could show you all the new buildings they\u2019ve been building around Goldenrod! Then maybe the two of you could go for a swim\u2026 or maybe dig through the dumpsters of that one pizza place\u2026 or\u2026 or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you finally reach the back yard, and see the unmistakable silhouette of the ninetails before you...</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry but I can make sure that you will always respect me.\" Lifting the cinccino a bit upwards still tied to his penis, he eagerly looks at his knot. \"Time to literally tie you. So brave up and worship it.\" applying one strong push, he knots the Cinccino with his dick as the tip punches through her womb and present a thick bulge as he cums straight into her already occupied womb. Hearin the little rodent cry out of euphoria, he lets go of her body and begins to stand up. Thanks to his knot, Cinna dangles around looking upside down. \"You may struggle to see me, but you can definitely tell now what my little Pachirishu and Ledian always end up becoming after every round of sex that I give to them. This time, you ... belong ... to me.\" swaying his hips, he continues to cum inside the cinccino's womb and humps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the little normal type, his is something that she finds beyond amazing. It ends up making her dizzy yet felt truly close to her new mate in the physical sense.</span></div></div>",
