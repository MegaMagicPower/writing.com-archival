But what was the biggest upset was that they collected next to no shards of the Jewel of Four Souls! Not to mention that Inuyasha always felt like it was HE who did all the work around here. All everyone else did was just get in the way and get into trouble, to which HE had to rescue them from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha decided it was time to man up a little!

The images of him being strong, crushing the demons like insignificant bugs excited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better start exercising if I want to achieve that result\" Inuyasha muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the warm up, he started to run toward the river which located quite far from their tent, purposely to be able to exercise without much disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran on the grassy rocky road, making his feet felt itchy. Also the dim light made him increasingly disturbed, but not because he couldn't see clearly in the dark, it was just he seemed a little bit sensitive that day.<br>\r\nIt didn't take a long time before he could see the river, the water sparkling as it reflected the moonlight. Without wasting his time further, the half demon began his exercise, his body sweating after moment swinging Tessaiga, cutting some branches and small tress, shattering some rocks. He tried to improve his accuracy while seeing in the dark, trying to get a better focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of exercising, he began to get bored, knowing the fact that exercises wouldn't made himself a lot stronger, mostly in size and muscle. The white haired man began to worry and a bit desperate. Sighing slightly the half demon advanced his body to sitting position, trying to get comfortable he leaned himself on the rock near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should collect all the jewel shards then wish for a God-like body? but it would take a lot of time..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling deeply, he felt the cold air stung his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I should ask someone for solutions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped to his feet then walked around, trying to get his body relaxed, then he decided to..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inuyasha snuck back to camp, where everyone was still fast asleep. Inuyasha was about to lie down, and set sneak off the next day by himself for jewel shards, when he happened to glance over to Kagome. After that, he snuck a little closer. He had just remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout making a single sound, he snuck over to her bag, and took a peek inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnng... Inuyasha...\" She mumbled. Inuyasha pulled back, freaked that she might wake up and see him going through her things. After she settled back down, Inuyasha carefully took the bag away, getting out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside of camp, Inuyasha started tearing through the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is half this crap!? No wonder she always feels so heavy!\" Inuyasha growled to himself. He tossed out many objects that most females would find necessary for being out and about. A brush, a little lip gloss, a little money... And what the heck was this thing in a tube!? Inuyasha pulled it out, and looked at it briefly. \"What's this... Some kind of... Candy?\" Inuyasha's tonuge stretched out, and gave it a lick. It soon pulled back. \"Bleh. Tastes like a sheep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of searching ang trying to learn how things worked, getting kind of lost as he almost forgot what he was searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" He pulled out the tiny jar that held the sum of their jewel shards. Inuyasha bit the cork off, and put them into his hand. Within that instant, he felt new energy now flowing through his body. However, looking over himself, nothing had changed as he wanted. He HAD the power, but at more so, he wanted to SEE the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, these things are frickin' useless!\" He said, gripping them in his hand. He sighed. He was okay with the power, and he didn't want to give it up. \"... Aha!\" Inuyasha opened his mouth, and popped the jewels in one by one, making sure they wouldn't cut his mouth as he swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha let out a sigh. They all made it down safely, and he patting his stomach, feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something was strange. His stomach felt... harder. Pulling back the layers of his red kimono and white undershirt, he saw his abs had tightened! He already had a nice midsection, but now he had a set of genuine abs! The wavy curves alone was enough to satisfy the half-demon, but then he saw more changes coming about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders had started to stretch outward, with his pecs filling in, layer by layer, spreading the collar just a little farther open. Immediately, he pulled back his sleeves to see his biceps welling up with new power as well, the little baseball sized muscle had started pumping up, becoming a nice softball size! His forearms began to enlarge as well, a big healthy vein running up the side. Inuyasha grinned confidently as he gave it a good flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha could feel his pants starting to more frequently rub against his thighs. They were normally so roomy, but now they were starting to fill up with meat. Speaking of meat, Inuyasha's already well-endowed self had started to become even more so! His calves started to bulge as well, growing in proportion with the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was all done, Inuyasha looked over himself. He grinned, flexing his whole body. Although he was too lazy to take his clothes off, he just loved the feeling of being huge! He messily packed things into Kagome's bag, and started heading tword camp. He'd have to make sure his body was well covered up for now. The last thing he wanted was for one of his friends to see and start asking questions, or even worse, for them to catch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha carefully set the bag down next to Kagome, and tiptoed away. He curled back up into a ball like a dog, and fell fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Although he barely had a decent night's sleep, he wasn't tired in the slightest! Maybe it was all the excess energy from the jewel... Either way, he felt great! He couldn't just sit here all and way for daybreak! He had to get out and try to find a few more shards to pump up his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy for the half-demon. He had to search far and wide, and even then, all he could find were some lesser demons that were hardly worth the time; they didn't have any shards within them at all! That's probably why they were so easily defeated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Inuyasha was innocently walking, a huge spider seemed to explode from the ground! It hissed, it was made of rock, and appeared to have venom just dripping from it's large maw. Inuyasha didn't know much about spiders, other than the fact that they were to go \"squish!\" under his foot. However, this one would not prove as easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I've been waitin' all morning for you...\" Inuyasha said with a cocky grin, withdrawing the Tessaiga from it's sheath. The beast lunged forward, not knowing any better than to try to paralyze Inuyasha with it's deadly venom, before ripping the handsome half-demon's flesh to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha easily dodged, and slashed at the beast. He managed to carve a nice slit into the stone body. It cried out in pain, before releasing a web from it's behind, sticking Inuyasha's legs together. He fell forward, as the beast jumped back, and dove in again, ready to paralyze then man, when Inuyasha barely managed to get to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr... Better not let this drag out...\" He growled to himself. \"Wind Scar!\" He then shouted, letting his blade do the talking as it slammed against the ground, creating a wave of energy that sliced the spider into two pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a noisy, hiss-like cry, the creature then began to disintegrate, and Inuyasha had a moment to himself. He took the Tessaiga, and cut the thread around his legs, before getting back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... That wasn't too hard...\" He walked over, and picked up the two jewel shards. \"And I got two shards out of it. Guess it was worth the scrap.\" Inuyasha swallowed the pieces, and immediately felt his body grow larger and thicker. His pecs got a little deeper, his biceps thicker, his abs harder, his legs wider, and his calves bigger. Inuyasha looked down his shirt in disappointment. \"That it?\" He asked no one specifically. \"At this rate, I'm just gonna have to collect the entire jewel if I want any results!\" He laughed confidently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The half demon spent a full minute to admire himself. His shirt was getting tighter and tighter but hadn't given any signal that it would be shattered soon. He was concentrating the power into his upper body, making the pecs feel even more massive along with his hard six-pack. He rubbed his abs occasionally, giving his right hand a time to feel the hardness. The sensation rendered him in unimaginable sensation, and made him feel somewhat strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha re-positioned his shirt to the most comfortable condition as possible after admiring himself a little, but finding it hard to due the bigger muscles inside. \"Man, this is tight.\" He thought to himself while walking in discomfort. His thighs felt pressed together every time he moved his legs. The white haired demon growled in annoyance but kept walking anyway, until he heard a sudden voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there!\" In instant, Inuyasha turned his body, getting into his fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to his surprise, the voice was coming from a familiar figure, Kagura. What an unexpected visitor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" He spat with cocky tone formed in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm here not to fight you.\" Silence masked them for few seconds. \"Your body.\" The wind witch said as she pointed a finger directing into Inuyasha's new developed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it?\" The dog boy seemed impatient with her twisted talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems you have found out, huh?\" She answered with a sigh, then opened her fan in a steady position as Inuyasha walked closer. \"Hey, I'm here not to fight you! Listen, I'm here only to give you information, and by looking at you, I guess you already know what will happen if you consume those pieces of shards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging from your new look, there's no doubt you want more.\" She explained carefully with her low tone, but that was only making the man in front of her losing his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it then?!\" The teen shouted at her, giving her a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey easy!\" She said, before looking off to the side. \"Well.. I need your help to defeat Naraku. You're not the only one who know how to use these shard's power!\" Kagura finally made her point. She said it directly, totally ignoring her calmness before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement came as a jolt to Inuyasha's mind, his eyes grew larger just by imagining how many shards Naraku had, and definitely it wasn't a good thing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you understand now? He's stronger than you, and the point is I want my freedom back from him. So the only way is to defeat him, and that's will be your job.\" She began to speak rapidly, directly to the point. By the time Inuyasha almost argued with her statement, she continued. \"I'll tell you something: you need to collect shards as many as possible in order to defeat him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\" Inuyasha interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't finished, dog boy! Your friend, that wolf demon, has three of them.\" She said while folded her fan back down into her fabulous looking yukata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha just made an underestimating sigh tone instead of thanking her. \"And what should I do if Kouga has already consumed the shards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, beat him. The shards will expell from his body if he's beaten, or at least unconscious. That's the time you should grab those shards.\" The witch gave him a stern look, hoping that Inuyasha would believe her. She was his enemy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wasting my time too much here... Farewell, dog boy!\" With her accustomed move, she made a mount from her feather, then flew high into the sky. The wind blew so hard that Inuyasha had to move his right arm to cover his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that witch!\" He cursed under his breath. The half demon spent a good thirty minutes to think about it, then he made his mind and decision.</span></div></div>",

He needed power first, and what better way then beating the snot out of some punk wolf demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyahsa began on his way, trying to track Kouga down. It was a little difficult at first, but as soon as Inuyasha had found a scent, he quickly began to track it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of following the wolf's stank, he soon happened upon him. Inuyasha chose to remain behind the bushes for the time being as he watched the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who's that!\" Kouga suddenly shouted. Inuyasha felt a chill travel up his spine. Was he spotted? He was being so quiet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Nevermind... It's just you babies.\" Kouga said adoringly, as he flexed his two powerful biceps. They were easily five inches thicker than Inuyasha's arms. Inuyasha gulped. Could he really do this? His insecurity was instantly shaken off. Of course he could do this! No muscle headed dog was going to beat him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emerged from the bushes. \"Kouga!\" He shouted, pointing his finger, \"Come and face me, you stupid wolf! I'm gonna kick your ass and take those jewel shards!\" He then unsheated Tetsuaiga, and rose it to Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga laughed it off, before standing to his full height. He wasn't a giant, but he was far taller than Inuyasha. \"What's that? Are you offering me a toothpick?\" He said, still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the hell up! I'll cleave those shards out of your stomach myself!\" He said, before charging right at Kouga. \"Wind Scar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga raised his hands, and clamped them onto the wave of energy. He grunted, thinking he was powerful enough to stop it. After a moment, it finally broke, but not without leaving Kouga quite worn. The sweat beading down his muscular body was apparant, and he was trying to hide his panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha grinned. He knew he had the upper hand. \"Wind Scar!\" He unleashed another wave at Kouga. Kouga wasn't a total idiot. He dashed out of the way of this one, and felt safe for a moment. As soon as he looked up, he saw Inuyasha coming down from above, ready to slash! Kouga had no time to react!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last second, Inyasha turned the sword on it's side, slamming the flat, blunt end down on Kouga's head. The large, heavy fang rendered Kouga unconscious, and the large man fell on his side, zonked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shine from his abs, as the jewel shards emerged from his stomach painlessly, without having to cut him open. Inuyasha gripped them tight in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to swallow them, he looked down at Kouga. He then thought of what Kagura had told him, and what Naraku plans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha could always use an ally... But then again, Kouga could just as easily end up getting in his way...</span></div></div>",

Far stronger than Inuyasha at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------- About an hour later... --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Man...\" Kouga rubbed his head as he slowly sat back up. The last he remembered was Inuyasha, who hit him on the head, and rendered him unconscious. His attention then turned to his body. His armor felt really loose, which brought a frown to his face. To think, it seemed like just moments ago, the armor was filled with massive, bulging muscle. \"Damn that mutt!\" Kouga growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A voice shouted back. Kouga looked around a bit, until he spotted Inuyasha sitting under a nearby tree. Kouga grit his teeth. He was less than pleased to see his rival just sitting there so smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do YOU want?\" Kouga asked, baring his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup! I'll tell you when I'm good and ready!\" Inuyasha barked. He walked over, standing high above Kouga, his body far superior to the tiny little wolf's. Inuyasha liked this feeling of having dominion over the smaller male. One might even say it was... Arousing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga on the other hand, was hating it. HE was the alpha male around here, not some half-breed mutt! There was no way he was going to stand for this! ... If he could get up, that is. Inuyasha seemed to have quite a scare over the wolf demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal, idiot! Naraku is getting more powerful by the second, and I need YOUR ass to help me beat him!\" Inuyasha instructed. \"I'm gonna give you a couple of jewel shards back, but you work for <i>me</i>! You got that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga just growled at the larger male. \"Why in the HELL would I EVER want to work under you!?\" Kouga barked. Inuyasha flexed his large bicep, and puffed out his pumped pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm bigger than you, and I could just crush you like the bug you are!\" He answered. Kouga just gulped. He looked down at Inuyasha's feet. The big hanyou wiggled his toes, making the ground shake ever so slightly, and showing Kouga how powerful he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... Fine.\" Kouga finally said, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Inuyasha replied, dropping a few jewel shards down onto Kouga's lap. Kouga looked at them with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! This is less than what I started out with!\" Kouga shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think I was gonna give you ALL of those? Hell no! Then you'd be bigger than me! So I took a few!\" Inuyasha then grinned, rubbing his tight eight-pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga just snuffed. Whatever. He could gather more shards easily for himself, and overpower that damn dog if he wanted to. He swallowed them, and gained some of his former size back, but not nearly as much as he had before. He then stood to his feet, now having to look UP at Inuyasha. \"I'm not gonna like you!\" Kouga then said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you had to, you stupid wolf!\" Inuyasha snapped back, \"After all this crap is over, I'm going right back to treating you like the worthless trash you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M trash?\" Kouga scoffed arrogantly. \"YOU'RE the one who turns back into a human every new moon, you half-breed mutt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little...!\" Inuyasha began, but before he could finish, he was interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

Inuyasha beat his chest with a single fist proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like those grunts were nothing for the new and improved Inuyasha!\" He grinned, turning around, and starting to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inuyasha walked off proudly, Kouga was quickly scanning through the corpses for and jewel shards. He had to be fast, and he had to be quiet, lest Inuyasha spot him, or worse, took and shards that Kouga might have found!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a move on, wolf!\" Inuyasha called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga, too focused on searching to hear, kept on looking through the remains of the creatures. Suddenly, he saw a twinkle! With lightning speed, he snatched up whatever it was. As he opened his palm, he saw a total of three shards! All for himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

The murderous intent around Inuyasha was a sight to behold, and even for a hardened demon like Kouga, it was both frightening and slightly arousing... Perhaps he would not mind being the whipping boy of such a powerful master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-- Erm...\u201d The smaller lupine man choked out. He could not believe he was actually this scared of that damn dog! He had stuttered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha smelt the fear just pooling off of him, and yet he also noted the rather ample bulge in the wolf demon\u2019s arm bracer. \u201cI saw the jewel shards\u201d He answered almost silently, which to Kouga was even scarier then when he was screaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really plan to hide any we get? You think I would be that stupid not to scan the corpses? You found some and yet instead of telling me so we could split them you took them for yourself!\u201d He acused violently, his hand shaking as he held the teen, his grip tightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga realized that Inuyasha at this point could snap his neck like a twig if he wanted...

A little lump traveled down his throat, and into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inuyasha let out a smirk down at the little wolf, his body inched higher, as his muscles bulged out a little thicker. He licked his lips, and then walked over to Kouga. Bending over, so they were face-to-face, Inuyasha purposefully let out a triumphant burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga pulled back immediately, fanning his nose. \"Ew, you sick mutt!\" He groaned, \"You're disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're worthless liar.\" Inuyasha snapped back coldly. It hurt Kouga a little, but also fueled his fire a little as well. Just as he was about to say something back, he had a moment to take in just how much smaller he was than Inuyasha now. The giant half breed could probably crush Kouga's ribs under his foot if he wanted! Kouga's mind continued to wander, starting to develop somewhat of a fear for Inuyasha. At the same time, that very fear was causing him to have a bit of admiration for Inuyasha... Almost like an attraction, if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha had stood back up to his full height, dusting off his hands. \"Well, that's done.\" He said to no one in particular. He may have gained more power, but now he wasn't very trusting of Kouga. He snatched Kouga up by the back of his neck. \"Come on, you pathetic wolf.\" He said, \"We have to take down Naraku, and any damned thing that stands in my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga wasn't stupid. He had a fairly good feeling that he was included in that \"anything.\" It made him gulp in fear, as Inuyasha dragged him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, things were getting late. Now that Kouga was his new partner, he remained with him rather than the ones he used to call friends. \"Alright, you little runt...\" Inuyasha said, \"You're going to go get firewood.\" Inuyasha then wandered over and under a shady tree. \"I'm going to wait here while you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How is that fair!?\" Kouga barked. Inuyasha figured this was going to happen, but he had a plan. His large foot soon shoved itself in Kouga's face, practically covering it! Kouga could smell the earth scent on Inuyasha's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, you two faced wolf! First off, you owe me, and second, if you don't, I'm gonna pound you, got it!?\" Inuyasha snarled at Kouga. Kouga, yet again, was frightened, but he wouldn't let it show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the evening, the two were gathered around the fire. They were roasting up some of the less disgusting demons that they had defeated earlier. Neither of them really spoke much to each other. Inuyasha was doing his best to cook properly, Kouga merely watching, glancing at the food, and at Inuyasha from time to time.</span></div></div>",

The fire was down to smoldering embers, as the two canine teens laid out under the starry skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha could tell by the dirty looks Kouga kept sending his way every now and again that he was not happy with his decision to consume all the jewel shards for himself. Inuyasha brushed this off quite quickly; the wolf had betrayed their alliance, so Inuyashs had just acted accordingly. He would have to test to see if Kouga could be trusted in the future; to see if he could handle more than small amount of jewels shards within his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga, for his part, was completely blaming Inuyasha for today\u2019s action. \u2018Damn mutt, those were my jewel shards! Now I'm stuck at this pitiful size, as he just gets bigger and stronger... and sexier...\u2019 His face flushed a bright hot pink at that thought that had unwillingly rushed through his mind. He quickly tried to shove that thought as far down in his mind as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha was watching his partner carefully for any further actions. Who knew what other treason he could be planning! However, the half breed was suddenly taken aback by the sight of Kouga's massive blush. The dog demon snorted in annoyance as he tried to imagine what it could be to cause such a hardened demon to openly show such a weak, human reaction. \u2018Feh, the stupid wolf is probably realizing what a stupid mistake he made... He was an idiot to betray an unstoppable force like me, and he's probably just now realizing it!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog demon brushed it off  and pushed his formidable bulk back up against a tree. Inuyasha continued to openly stare at his new, untrustworthy partner. \u201cAbout time to get some sleep, eh?\u201d He said after a little time had passed, his tone indifferent. For his part, he was more then ready to call it a night, despite his increased reserves of energy from both the jewels and his new body. However, he <i>was</i> a little worn down from all the fighting this day had brought on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Kouga to even notice that Inuyasha was speaking to him. He was staring at the large beast, and all he could focus on were those two soft looking lips sliding and rubbing against each other as the big guy spoke. He fought back a mild groan, pleading with himself not to get a erection at the sight of the mutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha? Sorry?\u201d He said after a moment, his voice a bit meek as he snapped to. He had hoped Inuyasha wouldn't notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouga frowned in confusion when Inuyasha hadn't repeated what he had said. Inuyasha just continued to stare at the wolf with a slightly firm look on his face. Kouga had to fight back another lust, he had just noticed how beautiful the half demon's face was when he seemed angry. Now he was struggling against his own primal instinct, to which at this point, it was just a losing battle. He let out a muffled groan as he felt his slit begin to ooze pre, starting to really got aroused!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha of course picked up on the groan and he noticed just how Kouga was holding himself. The way he looked so flushed, and that almost wanting, hungry look that covered his face as he gazed over at Inuysha. The big guy may have been slow on some things but he could at least put two and two together, and when he reached his conclusion, he was shocked, to say the least. \u2018Is he getting aroused by me?\u2019 He thought absently as he rubbed his a buffed up pec. As soon as he did though, he heard another strangled groan from Kouga, which confirmed it in his mind, no matter how shocking it was to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha could not believe what thought had just crossed his mind \u2018Kouga's clearly interested in me... Sexually... That damn hypocrite! Always raving about what an idiot he thinks I am, all the names he's called me, when really, he wants me!!! Just look at him... Panting over there like a bitch in heat.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts brought a slight grin to the half demon\u2019s face as he pushed his large body off the tree and walked over towards Kouga, he sat down with a slight thud, close enough to Kouga that he was standing over on all fours over the smaller male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga nearly jumped when the half demon came over him, watching as his pecs just grazed his face. His nose was gently brushing Inuyasha\u2019s skin. It felt so soft... Probably due his overly-muscled body... Not to mention that most of teen\u2019s massive body now looked so dominating and strong... Kouga tried to push those thoughts of his head as best he could. As he tilted his head slightly up to look at Inuyasha, he was surprised to see the half breed already staring intently at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want dog breath?\u201d Kouga barked, trying to be tough, when in truth, he was curious. Why was Inuyasha over here? Why was he being so oddly silent and strange? And why was he staring at him? Kouga desperately wanted all these burning questions to be answered! The sooner the better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha just smirked at the weak vibe kouga was emnating. It was funny that the wolf\u2019s mouth could scream all those insults at him, all while his eyes were screaming \u2018Fuck me hard...\u2019 at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you mangy wolf, I have excellent hearing. I could hear your panting from over there, your groaning, and if I tried hard enough, even your racing heart... That means lust, right?\u201d He grinned at that statement. Of course they did! While he had not learned much book smarts in life, he was smart enough to know the primal instinct to mate, be it among humans or demons. Thanks to that instinct, he knew what Kouga was feeling for him, and was able to immediately indentify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga was shocked! He thought he had been clandestine and quiet about the whole ordeal, and yet Inuyasha had picked up on it like it was nothing! Part of him was angry at being treated like an inferior, childish toy, but part of him as loved how he was so easily taken advantage of, not to mention dominated, by the one he once called a stupid dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a point flea ridden mutt?!\u201d He shot back, hesitation clearly in his tone. Deep down, his heart just wasn't into all the insults anymore. Inuyasha grinned the grin of a winner, doing his best to stop himself from laughing in triumph. He had been hoping Kouga would say some thing like that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kouga, since you said it that way... My point is that you're clearly aroused, and I'm the only other person here... So either you're so vain you get off on yourself... Or it's that you're totally attracted to me!\u201d He lent forward and let his hot breath just fall across the side of the wolf\u2019s neck as he ran gently ran his sharp, pointy nails across the wolf\u2019s back. Despite his increased size and strength, he was still as soft and careful as a parent to it's newborn child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga almost went to putty when he felt that steamy breath upon his neck.  He tried to stifle another groan, as he did his best to stop himself from thrusting his hips forward. However, as soon as he felt those thick, powerful fingers on his, still strong, back, just rubbing against him like that... So affectionate and warm... The dangerous nails forcing his back to arch in fear of pain... But no pain came... Just a tender, chilling touch that sent shivers up the wolf's spine, giving him goosebumps. His resistance had ceased. He had to get closer to that warmth, to that gentle rubbing on his back, against Inuyasha\u2019s fingers, where he belonged! Kouga mood was simply euphoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or so passed, Inuyasha stopped the rubbing. Kouga turned his head like a puppy, his gesture asking 'What? Over already?' His eyes had a tinge of sadness, asking why he would tease him like that...</span></div></div>",

He had practically left Kouga a mess, yet he was able to recouperate from it almost instantly. \"Think you can get to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga just stared up at Inuyasha, his eyes wide. His mind was flushed with questions, as well as a little bit of hurt. Was it all a game to him? Or was Inuyasha really just giving him a taste of what was yet to come? \"I... I...\" The teen wolf hesitated, not sure how to reply after all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not an answer!\" Inuyasha picked Kouga up, and gave him a light shake. \"Are you ready to sleep now!?\" He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga shoved Inuyasha's hands away. \"Yes! Okay!? Yes!\" He snapped back, looking up at Inuyasha. Both of them had rather unpleasant looks on their faces. They were both glaring at each other for a moment, neither of them backing down. Kouga still had the desire to give in to Inuyasha, whereas Inuyasha was still willing to dominate him. However, Inuyasha knew just giving Kouga whatever he wanted wouldn't tell if it was true emotion they were just feeling, or just a mere lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What are you staring at!?\" Inuyasha barked at Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!? You're the one who's staring!\" Kouga snapped right back. Inuyasha just stomped his foot, hard, shaking the ground slightly to intimidate Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh, whatever. I'm going to bed.\" Inuyasha declared. He got moving over to the fire, where he laid on his side, his back facing both Kouga and the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga, still a bit hurt over how Inuyasha played games with him, stared at him for a moment. Inuyasha didn't make a sound. The bigger dog was just laying there with his eyes closed, trying to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" Inuyasha thought to himself. \"You could have had him! All you had to do was bend him over and show him how much of a man you are!\" As part of Inuyasha's brain thought this, another part began to think as well. \"This is what he deserves! He decided to play games with me, I'm going to play games with him! Besides, if he really likes me, and he thinks I like him, he'll be more willing to do what I say! Mangy wolf...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga did the same, curling up not too far from the fire as well. He remained awake, as Inuyasha tried to sleep. He peeked over his shoulder several times, and as soon as he knew Inuyasha was asleep, he crawled away, over to the tree that Inuyasha was sitting up against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, he slid his hand down his abs, giving them a brief stroke, before moving down further and taking his dick in his hand. It was still a little lubed up from his encounter, making it easier on him as he began stroking himself. Another grunt barely escaped his lips as he closed his eyes, trying to relive that scene between him and Inuyasha once more. He fanticized over Inuyasha's massive pecs, his rock hard abs, and not to mention, Inuyasha's own, thick manhood. Slowly, he opened a single eye, peering at Inuyasha. His eyes glazed, he stared, getting off to how massive the beast's back was. Another lustful moan escaped his lips as he started stroking faster, squeezing his cock a little harder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kouga...\" Inuyasha said in Kouga's mind. \"How about you come a little closer... Give my pecs a nice rub?\" He asked, one of the larger dog's hands groping his massive pec, the erect nipple poking out from between the fingers. \"They're so big and tender... Come on...\" The imaginary Inuyasha said in a sultry voice. As the giant groped his pecs, he let out a lustful moan. \"Oh man, Kouga... I'm so horny right now...\" Inuyasha crawled over, his movements making a noisy thud that shook the ground all around. Of course, it only supported to bring Kouga even closer to the edge! \"Do it Kouga...\" The figment of his imagination begged, \"I wanna feel your hot seed all over my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those last words echoing in his head, Kouga couldn't hold back one final moan. His neck craned back, as he shot a load of hot, sticky cum in front of him, which landed on the ground. Kogua was now left panting, his body feeling heavy, but his head felt lighter than air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily, he stood to his feet, and looked down at the mess he made. He made sure to wipe it off of himself, and what was on the ground he kicked dirt over. It would be dried by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga walked back over, a little wobbly, before curling back up by the fire. Inuyasha was still fast asleep... And Kouga was glad he hadn't woke him up. If the embarassment didn't kill him, Inuyasha probably would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

His face was so curious, or at least that's what Kouga thought. He spent a few seconds in silence, no sudden movement; not a single word. His eyes scanned through Kouga's, demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing.\" Kouga replied as he started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha, with his superior body, could just grabbed his shoulder easily, preventing the wolf boy from going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wrist is bleeding. Are you sure you're okay?\" Inuyasha asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah I'm fine!\" Without giving a second for Inuyasha to reply, he just backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There's no way I'd waste this chance away. This could be my one and only chance!</i>\" He thought so surely that he unwillingly clenched his palms in excitement and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------A Few Minutes Later------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrgh!! There's nothing here!\" Inuyasha began to shout, along with few foul words afterward. He was quietly observing the corpses, but his footsteps were vivid enough to be sensed by beings around him. After all, he had wasted all that time for nothing. Not a shard, and not even a trace of Naraku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting tired of his search, he sat down, still inspecting his surroundings, in hopes that his attention would drawn by something surprising. His previous conversation with Kouga occured in his mind, drawing his attention. He was building his trust on Kouga, of course, but did Kouga trust him the way he trusted Kouga?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What if he's hiding something?.... No, that can't be!</i>\" Inuyasha spent minutes battling with his own mind, while Kouga just stared at him with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Enough of this! I shouldn't be bothered.</i>\" Inuyasha finally tjought. He was just about to close his eyes due to his fatigue, but his instinct forced him to stay focused, either because of the danger, or only because of Kouga's strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" The bigger demon yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah?! Yes?\" It was pretty obvious that Kouga was just brought back from his blank mind towards Inuyasha. Was it because of his hot body? Probably, but everyone would stare in awe of that massive body. Or was it because he was afraid Inuyasha had figured out the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't found any proof yet, but he would find out tonight, or even tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll spend the night here. I'm not that tired, but it's good for us to have enough sleep. Naraku could come with his attack anytime.\" Inuyasha explained. He was to prideful to admit how tired out he really was to a \"lesser being\" like Kouga. He moved to the grassy ground nearby before undressing out of his tattered clothes. His body was now visible entirely, and Kouga couldn't help but stare at the muscled physique. His shoulders, chest, and those rock hard abs! Sweat was leaking from that body, and every time Inuyasha made a movement, his muscles seemed to look at Kouga with a taunting presence. Not to mention that made him feel puny in Inuyasha's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to the river, you can find a spot to rest if you want.\" Inuyasha said as he threw his clothes away to the grassy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kouga simply answered. Silence then masked the wolf demon, sending his mind rushing over the decision he had to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What should I do? Is it better for me to consume the shards right now before Inuyasha finds out?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had set, leaving the sky entirely dark except for the sparkling stars and a half full moon. After minutes of thinking, he still hadn't got any answer. Desperate, he decided to relax, then he began to undress himself, set his clothes near Inuyasha's before walking to the river where Inuyasha was, still holding the three shards tightly in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the river...</span></div></div>",

Having an ally was a good idea, but the possibility of rebellion was a important factor to consider. After all Kouga wouldn't be an easy opponent later on, when he had even MORE shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What to do.. what to do...\"</i> A single simple thought that kept going through his mind. He gripped the shards tightly, feeling every contour as he leaned down to make his final decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nIn Naraku's Realm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\" A deep voice was risen as Kagura entered Naraku's private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business.\" Kagura said calmly with a deep sigh. She turned her sights to Kanna who was standing in front of Naraku, holding his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden heart beat rose up inside Kagura's body. <i>\"Was Kanna spying on me?\"</i>. Kagura tried to approach Kanna, but she turned the mirror, a moment before Kagura could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind witch couldn't do anything but stared, accepting the fate that Naraku was spying on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I thought Inuyasha about the plan and he--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough.\" Naraku interrupted with unruffled tone, before walking to his altar. He held the imperfect shikon jewel with his right hand, scanning it whole several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura herself had no idea why Naraku hadn't consumed the shikon jewel. It was rather careless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to consume it anyway, if you're wondering..\" Naraku said, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" Kagura was shocked and confused at the same time. Her mind recalled every moment related to the shikon, all the works she had to do to gather it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stopped thinking as she felt a cold breeze of devastating aura emanated behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half demon stood up, then inhaled deeply, feeling the mild breeze. \"Okay it's settled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly brought the shards to his mouth, and wasting no time, he gulped it down. The jewel shards went through his throat then down to stomach. He didn't have time to savour the taste in this uncertain condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed. He started to feel the exact same feeling; one of much power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeaah!\" He screams in pleasure, as his body began to grow. The first change was visible through his height, he stood up approximately in 15 feet, along with larger body. His clothes couldn't take his huge muscles anymore. As the chest jutted out, the fabric gave in, revealing his upper body in all glory, his board pecs, a well defined eight pack, all which was then followed by developed thighs. His groin was showing a development along with his body proportion, forming a obvious bulge in his former pants. Perfect upper and lower body proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new power indirectly affected his ego. He began to flex some of the muscles as he grew, tattering his clothes even more. Inuyasha was a sight to behold, in his new manly form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat enormous amount of power definitely sent out such a powerful aura from the half demon, enough to wake Kouga up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh-- what's happeni...\" Koga couldn't finish his sentence as he gathered his vision together. He saw Inuyasha stood before him, in his new god like body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh looks like you're awake, wolf boy!\" Inuyasha said with a evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What happened to you?\" Kouga stammered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! Don't play dumb. Look at yourself.\" Kouga then inspecting his body, knowing that Inuyasha had beaten him and took all his shards. He turned his head down in shame. He had to live in his old appearance... At least... Until he found more shards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You have problem with this?\" The white haired demon asked as he flexed his right bicep. \"And guess what, wolf!? The good thing is I'm nice enough to at least spare your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" Kouga growled, bearing his sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, I'd show some respect! After all, you have to thank me for sparing your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga raised to his feet in instant, ready to have a quarrel with Inuyasha's word. But coming to his surprise, he was now standing at the level of Inuyasha's upper thighs; He was facing his crotch! Inuyasha's pants was now becoming tight shorts! Plus, Inuyasha was standing on lower level ground than Kouga was, so he must have been even shorter when they were standing on level ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha just stood there. He stared at Kouga with a sinister grin look on his face. Kouga couldn't do or speak anything, he just turned away. He didn't want to admit the truth. On the other hand, Inuyasha was enjoying the sight, helpless wolf boy stood before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your knees!\" Inuyasha suddenly commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Kouga had no idea what Inuyasha was planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said on your kness!!\" A loud voice coming from Inuyasha along with the flow of devastating aura, making Kouga to tremble in fear and just did what Inuyasha just said. He had no control over his body for some reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.. First, this is the way for you to thank me, for sparing your life. Just bowing down isn't enough. Now you're my slave, whether you wanna be or not. If you have any objection, or you don't like it, go ahead, attack me anytime and anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga just stayed still in his position. He bowed down to his rival, while his pride began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Inuyasha then spoke again with cocky tone. \"No objection? That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting anytime, Inuyasha let his ego took over. He positioned his right foot in front of Kouga's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for your first task as a slave.. respect! What's the thing in front of you, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your foot.\" Kouga mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show! Your! Respect! Or I'll have to use force!\" The half demon raised his voice, sending small amount of energy flow to Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your foot, Master.\" Kouga said a little louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder. Say it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your feet, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Now why are you kneeling before me?\" Inuyasha was now grinning menacingly, enjoying every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to please you, Master.\" Kouga then said against his will. Why wasn't his body listening to him!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right... Now worship my feet!\" Inuyasha liked when his ego took over. He never felt like this before, so full endless power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga then began to stad up, reaching for the sole of the foot, until Inuyasha slammed his foot on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you to get up?! On your knees! Crawl!\" Inuyasha growled as he pivoted his foot, smearing Kouga's face with dirt, reminding him his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of hard \"training\", now Inuyasha was in his sitting position, relaxing his legs and giving his feet for Kouga to worship. He leaned back to a nearby hill. He closed his eyes occasionally as...</span></div></div>",

Kouga looked over, as did Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand suddenly clasped Kouga's arm. \"Master Kouga! We have to get you out of here!\" Ginta said. He didn't know the situation, but he was at least smart enough to know that a king-size Inuyasha meant bad luck for the likes of Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Not so fast!\" Inuyasha then shouted, stomping his feet down on top of both of the males. \"And just what do you think YOU'RE doing?\" Inuyasha said with a dark grin. \"You think you can just waltz in here and steal MY toy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-No, Inuyasha!\" Ginta said, a little intimidated by the giant hanyou. \"I-I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what?\" Inuyasha replied, impatient as ever. He wasn't about to have all his fun times with Kouga just pulled out from under his feet! Literally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just waiting for me!\" Another voice called. As Inuyasha turned around, he nearly faced the same fate as he did to Kouga. Hakakku had a large boulder in hand, and was about to smash it down on Inuyasha's head! Luckily, the dog managed to see through the ruse in time, and smashed the boulder to bits with his powerful, iron fist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You're gonna have to do a LOT better than that to get me!\" He laughed, feeling oh-so cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to!\" Ginta shouted. As Inuyasha looked down, he saw that Ginta and Kouga had escaped from under his foot! They had already began to run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Inuyasha said, giving chase. Not even 50 feet from where they started, Inuyasha's foot had sprung a trap that Hakakku had set up. A giant log came flying down and smacked Inuyasha square in his face! He fell backward to the ground, now with a bloody nose. Thank goodness he was so huge, or else that could have seriously hurt him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back Inuyasha!\" Kouga shouted back at the half-breed, as Hakakku finally caught back up with the group. \"And when I do, I'm gonna be even bigger and badder than ever! I'll pay you back double for what you did to me today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha's face was in a bit too much pain to make a sassy remark back. \"Dammit...\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, he was at least thankful he wasn't knocked unconscious, and Kouga and his mindless lackeys didn't get him.

Thinking over it all was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the group woke up, and were back on the road once more. They made their way into the nearest village to re-stock on supplied. As they wandered through town, Inuyasha heard a shout. It wasn't of distress, but nevertheless, his curiosity was piqued. He searched around, the rest of the group not even noticing that he went walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha soon found the source of all the shouting. It was the town's local dojo, and a sumo one at that. Inuyasha groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, just a bunch of sweaty fat guys groping each other...\" He thought to himself. At least, until he saw the next match up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a smaller male, perhaps only about 200 pounds, up against some 350 pound giant! Inuyasha just snickered as he watched. \"This must be some kind of joke match...\" He thought, \"But I guess it'll be fun to watch that little guy get creamed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the signal, the two men slammed together, and started to grab at each other. Inuyasha couldn't help but notice how even though they were large, they certainly were more sturdy than normal... And he <i>had</i> heard that the best offense could also be a great defense. The more matches he watched, the more he became intrigued by the large warrior's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was watching the people inside, he was spotted by the dojo master. The man peeked out the door, where he saw Inuyasha standing on a box and watching from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You can come inside, you know.\" The man said. Inuyasha nearly fell off his box, shocked as his attention was broken away from the action inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scare me like that!\" Inuyasha barked, still a little spooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked a bit nervous, feeling awkward. \"Did... You want to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha was a bit leery at first, but he soon reluctantly got up, and walked inside with the man. After all, it was better than watching from outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inuyasha walked in, his nostrils were assaulted by a musk unlike any he had smelled before. It reeked of men, but there was also the subtle scent of power. Inuyasha took a ringside seat and watched along with the dojo master, who was a rather large man himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatch after match, Inuyasha only grew more intrigued by the sport. The dojo master took note of this, and smiled down at the half breed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what you see?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... S'alright, I guess.\" Inuyasha replied, seeming a bit indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just chuckled. \"You can join us here, you know.\"</span></div></div>",

He'll show her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more arguing, the gang eventually left, leaving Inuyasha in the dojo. He turned around, and pointed at the man. \"Alright, you're going to train me to be a great sumo wrestler so I can prove all of them wrong!\" He demanded. The man could see the fire in his eyes. Whether the passion was just to prove his friends wrong or if it was because genuinely interested wasn't important. As long as Inuyasha was willing to learn, he would teach him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This diaper feels weird...\" Inuyasha said, messing with his sumo belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a mawashi.\" The man answered. \"And you mustn't worry. You will grow into it!\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Inuyasha agreed idly, still messing around with the belt. He was worried his manhood might slip out the side, or some other malfunction could happen. The dojo master then took Inuyasha by the wrist, and gently tugged, issuing for him to follow. Inuyasha did so, still not taking his attention off of the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man set Inuyasha down at a small table. \"Now... Normally we all have dinner together, but we need to bulk you up!\" He said, \"And to do that, you're going to have to eat... this!\" The man then held out a bowl filled with cooked vegetables, chicken, and fish. All kinds of proteins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha took the bowl and set it on the table. He wasn't repulsed, but he was curious. \"... So what is it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chankonabe!\" He said happily. \"It's an ideal meal for sumo wrestlers! And you're going to have to eat a lot of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha gave it a sniff. It was not very bad, in terms of smell. He picked up his chopsticks, and started to eat.

Each bowl pushed his kimono out further, his rounded belly starting to make him look pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inuyasha slammed down his tenth bowl, he let out a long, painful groan. His hand immediately started to rub his stomach. \"Oh man... I don't think I've ever eaten that much before...\" Inuyasha's swollen gut stretched out at least a good five inches from his once flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job!\" The coach said, slapping him on the back. Inuyasha just groaned out in pain once more. \"Now it's time to sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep...!?\" Inuyasha said, a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We gotta help you gain some weight first, so we can't have you doing anything for a good while!\" He replied, \"We have room upstairs. Want to stay with us?\" He asked the hanyou. Inuyasha thought it over for a moment. Returning to his friends would surely result in him getting mocked... When he saw them again, he wanted to be there in all his new found power and glory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Inuyasha said, a little apprehensive. Unfortunately, due to his pride, he didn't really have much of a choice! The coach called over one of the wrestlers, who looked down at Inuyasha. The coach instructed him to move him to the upstairs room, to which the sumo agreed. He signaled for Inuyasha to follow, to which the dog complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha, one hand still on his gut and rubbing, was looking all around the room as he moved about. He noticed how much bigger this sumo was than he was. He was a few inches taller than Inuyasha, but he must have weighed at least 350 pounds! That huge gut could probably slam Inuyasha through a wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the large man showed Inuyasha into a vacant room. The rooms weren't nearly as musky as the dojo downstairs (thank goodness), but they did have a peculiar smell... It was really strong... Almost painfully so. But at this point, Inuyasha was just glad he didn't have to smell sweaty men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sumo left, without a word, heading back downstairs. \"Tch, isn't he friendly.\" Inuyasha mumbled to himself. Even though it was daylight out, there was a thick blanket covering the window so no light would shine through. Inuyasha shrugged it off, and made his way over to the bed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting all settled in, he laid there for a moment, thinking about all the decisions he made. Was he making the right choice? And not to mention, how big would he get? Was this a really the best way to get powerful? It all perplexed Inuyasha to no end, until his mind wore itself out, and soon the half breed fell fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha later woke up...</span></div></div>",

All of them really, check up and make sure the village people were safe and to an extent, happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha broke away from the group, however, before he could get too far, a shrill, annoying voice rang in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha!\" Kagome called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what!?\" He shouted back, annoyed as hell. What did she want THIS time...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Shippou with you.\" She said, holding up the little fox boy. \"He'll keep you out of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't wanna go with Inuyasha!\" Shippou pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And it's not like I want the little brat either!\" Inuyasha barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not a brat!\" Shippou retorted. Now he kind of wanted to go with Inuyasha, just to tick him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking him, and that's final!\" Kagome said, shoving Shippou into Inuyasha's arms before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Geez what's her issue today...?\" Inuyasha scowled. He looked down at Shippou, who didn't seem any happier about this than Inuyasha. With a shrug, the half-breed demon put Shippou under one arm, and walked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Put me down! I can walk, you know!\" Shippou complained, but Inuyasha just squeezed the little fox boy tighter under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm not letting you out of my sight just so you can cause trouble, and get Kagome to blame ME for not watching you!\" Inuyasha informed the boy. He walked on unhappily, carrying the little guy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Inuyasha found himself walking down the market lane. There were all kinds of merchants, but no matter which one he happened to listen to, it was  all the same. Money, money, money. That's all these humans seemed to be about, and truthfully, their greed was starting to sicken Inuyahsa. Suddenly, Inuyasha felt his arm clap against his side. He looked, and saw Shippou had escaped, and was running around the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Shippou!\" Inuyasha growled, running off into the crowds to find the little fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, as Inuyasha wandered, the more sickened he got. People selling what literally seemed like crap with glitter on it. He had to find Shippou and fast. It was faint, but he could smell the boy amongst all this sweat and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he happened upon Shippou, who was crouched over a small packet of some kind. But that was no concern of Inuyasha's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" He said, as he snatched up the boy, taking the little packet away from him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Inuyasha!?\" Shippou said in a cowardly voice, surprised he was found so easily. \"Hey! Give that back! It's mine!\" He said, frantically trying to get the package back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did you even get this? Did you steal it?!\" Inuyasha replied, ignoring the boy's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not like you! I got money and paid for it!\" Shippou argued back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what, some twigs and leaves disguised as money?\" Inuyasha shouted, shaking the fox boy a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Yeah right! Kagome actually GIVES me a little money!\" Shippou retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grk!\" Inuyasha grunted, a bit pissed. Kagome ALWAYS insisted that they were \"flat broke\" and \"money was tight.\" But she sure as hell had enough to toss a few pennies Shippou's way! A little smile stretched across Shippou's face as he saw Inuyasha's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Kagome, you... You bitch!\" He growled, his grip growing ever tighter on Shippou. Gripping him reminded Inuyasha he still had the little man. \"And YOU!\" He then snarled, \"You're gonna return this packet of crap you bought!\" Inuyasha started marching along, when he then began to read the packet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"Instant growth formula! Take water, pour in contents of packet, and enjoy!\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh.\" Inuyasha said to himself, looking at the packet.</span></div></div>",

And what do we have here?\" He grinned, seeing a well withing walking distance. With that, he headed right over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou wouldn't stop complaining the whole way there. If this DID work, he could see why a shorty like Shippou would want it. As soon as he got to the well, Inuyasha just couldn't take it. He slammed Shippou to the ground, and put his foot on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT, WILL YOU JUST SHUT UP!\" Inuyasha yelled at the kid. He drew a little attention, but he didn't care. And apparantly, no one else did either, since they went right along with their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha read over the instructions once more. It was pretty simple, but he just wanted to be sure. His foot still on Shippou, he began drawing water from the well. Once done, he removed the bucket, and tore into the package with his teeth. He poured it all right on in, and gave the bucket a light little shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Inuyasha!\" Shippou said. \"I-I'll do anything you want, if you just let me have a little sip!\" He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Inuyasha snapped right back. \"It's your fault for running away, so this is your punishment!\" He said, as he applied a little more pressure to Shippou's tiny frame, making the boy wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyahsa rose the bucket to his lips, taking a huge gulp. \"Ahhh!\" He sighed happily. \"Hey!

And, to make matters worse, he was still getting bigger! Shippou had to literally back up a little so his paws wouldn't be forced under Inuyasha's still growing, thick, long toes, each one re-arranging itself on the floor every few seconds. As the huge dog continued to grin and flex, the last of his clothes finally burst off, only leaving him in a few rags that were around his expanding, well-endowed package. The rest of his massive, well-muscled body was now being portrayed completely to the rest of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha grinned, looking down at Shippou, his chin almost hitting his pecs; the small fox quivering in fear. \"You little... how the hell did Kagome get her hands on stuff like this!? It's freaking AWESOME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou finally decided to stand up, though he was now even more frightened of Inuyasha after hearing his loud, thunderous voice. Being his usual self, he just ignored the feeling, and walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cINUYASHA! That was mine!\u201d Shippou yelled, kicking Inuyasha\u2019s lengthening foot repeatedly, though, Shippou then noticed that Inuyasha had gone back to admiring his huge, hot body. \u201cUgh! You stupid dog! Pay attention!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha then looked down, just noticing that Shippou had been kicking him. The young half demon snickered, watching Shippou waste his time. But, as Shippou\u2019s yelling and whining continued, Inuyasha started to become more than just a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Would you just SHUT UP ALREADY?!\u201d Inuyasha yelled, bringing the foot that Shippou had been kicking backwards, thrusting it forward right after, the massive foot hitting Shippou with so much force that he literally went flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInnnuuuyaaaaasssshhhhaaaaaaaaa!!!\u201d  Shippou yelled, his voice soon becoming faint as he disappeared into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha smiled, rubbing the dirt off  his colossal foot and wiggling his toes as he laughed, almost everyone in the village hearing him do so, some people even going into their homes as the massive, hot half demon\u2019s growth spurt slowed down, and then stopped, levelling off at about 12 feet tall. Inuyasha then sat down in the middle of the street, putting his legs in front of him as he thought of what to do next. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything felt... Well, bigger! Not only was he bigger, but everything else was so much smaller! Even the nearby town seemed more like a tiny village, and as far as his eye could see, all the houses were almost like toys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Inuyasha?\" Shippou stammered, looking up at the big half-demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha ignored the child, and started to stomp off down into the town.

All the people had begun to flee, the very of sight of the big dog causing their legs to quiver in fear. Of course, this only helped in stroking Inuyasha's overinflated ego! Shippou followed behind him, doing his best to keep an eye on his foster brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha, you have to stop this!

Inuyasha turned around, and saw a peasant standing there, quivering as he held a pitchfork. \"L-Leave our town! And never come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha glared at the man, walking over, his footsteps only making the man even more nervous. He jerked the pitchfork away from the man and looked at it briefly. He looked down, and picked his teeth with the tool. He then tossed it into the distance, before picking the man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something...!?\" He snarled at the man. The peasant was about to faint, scared out of his mind. \"No? Thought so.\" Inuyasha growled, tossing the man carelessly to the ground. With that, he turned back around, and stomped off.</span></div></div>",

The bucket was about as big as he was so his stomach was pretty bloated with water. It didn't help that had gulped the entire bucket dry without stopping for a breath. He was already worn out and he hadn't even begun to try and get his revenge on Inuyasha! This wasn't exactly looking good for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an enormous amount of heat filled Shippou's tiny body, causing him to gasp and bend over, clutching at his stomach. The fiery heat seemed to originate from there. A loud groaning, creaking noise erupted from his body as he slowly started to change. Shippou watched in shock as his point of view slowly lifted from his little stature to a much higher one. With a few quick bursts he was suddenly the height of Miroku or Kouga! His clothes had ripped apart completely through this sudden growth spurt, leaving him in nothing but a bit of cloth remaining to cover his crotch. The fire subsided slightly as Shippou looked over his body in amazement. His arms were no longer short and stubby and neither were his legs! His whole body was more proportionate, like he had undergone puberty in a few seconds, though his facial features were still soft, adding a strange contrast between his youthful appearance and his more adult body. He grinned, already loving these changes, but deep down he knew it wasn't enough. Sure, this might have been okay back <i>before</i> Inuyasha had grown, but now it just wasn't enough! He clenched his hands into fists and hoped for more! Much more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him his body seemed to cooperate, the heat returning once more, spreading all throughout his body, filling him with a feeling of pure strength! He flexed his arm and watched his bicep, more developed than when he had a child's body, grow even more developed! The muscles were rising up against his arms like someone was inflating them, not with air, but with pure size and power! His once flat chest slowly pushed out, bulging into two separate slabs of meat, his back flaring out while his shoulder's broadened to help balance it out, his neck thickening as well. His abs were next, each row bursting out form his torso like solid bricks, harder than rock! His legs followed suit, his thighs ripping apart any remaining scraps of cloth that still clung desperately to his hips, his calves exploding out behind him into orbs of pure power. His forearms thickened to help balance the look of his arms out, his hands and feet both swelling to match the rest of Shippou's new godly body! He laughed as he flexed his arms, bouncing his pecs, his hands running over his abs and...what was this? With a grin he reached below the belt and discovered that <i>every</i> part of his body had grown up! Judging by the feel, it was even quite a bit above average!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou cracked his knuckles, feeling even more confident than before! However, the packets had not yet run their full course. The first packet had given him the base body he needed to grow, the second had given him these godly muscles, and now the third packet was going to add the coup de grace! Before Shippou could so much as take a single step, his body began to grow taller and wider, his feet pushing aside dirt and rocks, the bucket getting caught under one of his thick toes, getting crushed into a splintered mess. Soon, Shippou's body was pushing  aside trees as he expanded more and more, birds flying away, shrieking from the sudden violence of the shaking trees, Shippou's every simple shift of his feet sending tremors through the ground. \"Haha! This is more like it! Outta my way trees! Nothing's gonna push <i>me</i> around anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth slowly came to a stop when he was about fifty feet tall, double Inuyasha's already impressive height. \"Not even Inuyasha is going to stand in my way!\" Shippou declared, lumbering off in the direction of the village. Finally, after so many years of being pushed around and beaten up by Inuyasha, he was going to be able to get his revenge!</span></div></div>",

Shippou couldn't help but feel a <i>little</i> sorry for them all. But now he was twice Inuyasha's size! He could put an end to it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted Inuyasha, who was messing with a few other villagers, and began making his way over to him. As he made his way, he noticed a few tiny peasants fleeing before his might, not wanting to be captured or squished. Shippou felt sort of... Empowered. It was a feeling he wasn't exactly very used to in his life, but something about it almost felt addicting... Before he could truly reflect, he was directly behind Inuyasha, who had not yet noticed the fox boy's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You like that foot!?\" Inuyasha barked, stepping on, but not squishing, the helpless man below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" Shippou said expectantly. At this brief moment, he realized how deep his voice had gotten! It made him smile slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wha... What...?\" Inuyasha said, his eyes widening as he looked up at Shippou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Inuyasha.\" He said with a sly smirk. \"Whatcha think of the new me? I'm even bigger and stronger than you!\" He said proudly, flexing a powerful bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what!?\" Inuyasha barked, \"You're still that stupid little fox I always teased!\" Inuyasha stepped off the villager who than ran for shelter as the two giants were about to go at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha pulled his fist back, and slammed it into Shippou's kneecap. A shocking pain then traveled through Inuyasha's hand, forcing him to pull back! All that muscle really made Shippou into one hell of a tank! As Inuyasha flailed about holding his hand and shaking it, Shippou laughed, his voice bellowing over the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" He asked, \"Did I just get bit by a flea?\" Shippou had to admit, he did feel a little something, but Inuyasha had end up more hurt than Shippou was! \"Now then...\" Shippou's giant hand came down on top of Inuyasha's head, and lifted him up to his face. \"How about I pay you back for all those years of pain and suffering?\" The boy said, his sweet, innocent face spoiled by a twisted grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou swung Inuyasha around, and held him in a headlock. His fist rose up, and he started grinding his knuckles on Inuyasha's head, giving the mutt one fierce noogie. He laughed triumphantly, as Inuyasha groaned and struggled. Shippou was loving this new feel of power and dominance over a lesser being!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the noogie stopped. Inuyasha sighed, feeling a slight headache from the fierce rubbing. As he weakly looked up to Shippou. He had his finger in his mouth... He pulled it back out, leaving a long trail of saliva from his mouth. Inuyasha whimpered as he knew what was coming next. With a devious grin, Shippou stuck his moist finger in Inyasha's ear! It sloshed around, making a gross squishing noise as Inuyasha recieved the biggest wet willy ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwwwww!\" Inuyashas shouted in disgust, as his flailing resumed once more. Shippou just laughed, feeling victorious over his former tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shippou went through several humiliating punishements, he then decided to give Inuyasha a task slightly out of the ordinary. He was going to have him...</span></div></div>",

For all his newfound might and raw power he was almost nothing in terms of the massive fox boy. He let a dark scowl cloud his features as he gazed up at the pondering vulpine, as a even sicker looking grin came across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInuyasha\u201d He said far too innocently for the dog demon\u2019s liking, as he hefted the dog up once again as he plopped on the ground so he was sitting up, shaking the village as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to play with my thingy!\u201d He proclaimed loudly with a child like grin upon his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'His thingy?\u2019 The half demon pondered for a moment, before realizing that, while Shippou had grown physically, it was clear that mentally he was still almost child-like in his thinking processes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha suddenly realized with a grin of his own how he could even the odds and even perhaps more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInuyasha!\u201d The large fox boomed clearly impatient with the tiny mutt\u2019s lack of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Shippou...\u201d He grumbled as he was hefted up and forced against the giant fox\u2019s noticeable bulge. The few threads of cloth covering the region did little to mask the size of the member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, InuYasha, with his plan in mind began to slowly slide down to the region, gripping the thin cloth that was still covering it and pulling at it until it gave away. The Shippou's large, uncut member bouncing free, the large orbs he called balls beneath it, wobbling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInu... Inuyasha...\u201d Shippou panted slightly. The half breed had only rubbed him slightly to get his cock free, but the situation was completely new to the young boy, and it was a bit much for some one who had just been an innocent kid mere minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox\u2019s rumbling of pleasure was not lost upon Inuyasha, who had just gently squeezed the flesh of the cock and slowly had his strong, rough hands rub it up and down. The large dick began to pulse and slowly slide out from it\u2019s sheath as Shippou was brought into full arousal by the smaller dog\u2019s casual ministrations of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog lent forward and gently ran his large tongue across as the foreskin of the shaft, forcing the younger male let his head fall back as he let out a wail of pleasure. \u201cAhahaha... So good... Strange...\u201d His cock continued to throb and pulse because of Inuyasha, but suddenly the tiny dog pulled off and stood back up, just grinned at the panting mess the once proud and powerful new Shippou had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Shippou...\u201d Inuyasha called out lightly. The fox who had just been absently stroking himself in Inuyasha\u2019s absence looked up and stared at the hanyou who stood over him as the huge fox boy laid on his back. For some reason, the fact that Inuyasha was still dominating him despite their size difference just made this all the hotter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh... What is it, you tiny mutt?\u201d The boy asked in a cocky tone, as he was panting heavily, rubbing his enlarged testicles for a moment. This was all so new to him! He felt like he was going to burst if some thing did not happen, and happen soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should show me where those growth packets came from, and I'll show you what I can really do!\u201d He said in a deep tone. He was too prideful to admit that pleasuring Shippou had been some what enjoyable, and if Shippou <i>did</i> comply and show him, he <i>might</i> keep his word and they would see where this went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou\u2019s mind, clouded by lust, tried to focus himself and ultimately decided...</span></div></div>",

It must've been at least a good ten minutes before he got back out! \"I should really watch where I'm going...\" He grumbled, looking down at the spring. As he did, he saw more... And more... And more! There was a countless number of springs, each of them with a bamboo pole in them. \"That's... strange...\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" A man popped out suddenly. Kouga jumped back, nearly falling into another spring. The man grabbed his hand, and pulled him back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" He said, wiping his forehead.

As all this happened, Kouga was a little faster for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga soon stopped to take a little break. He wasn't tired at all, in fact he felt great! But he was at least smart enough to know not to push your body too far. He sat down, and noticed how it felt different.

He was amazed, and started running his hands all over his body, unable to believe it was really his body he was feeling!

As he sat, he then saw something that made his eyes open even wider. Either Kouga was mistaken, or his arm was growing even larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was true, his arms starting to grow from a decent baseball size, then popping up,  and swelling until it reached a thick, full softball size. Kouga was so enticed, that by the time he looked over the rest of his body, it was nearly done growing as well! His pecs had pushed out further from his chest, looking like two overinflated basketballs, his abs a rigid washboad of unquestionable power. His forearms had filled out, giving him unparalleled grip, and his back flared out, becoming an immovable wall of strength. He looked down the best he could, watching as his thighs filled out the animal skin kilt that he wore, rubbing against each other and growing wide and powerful. His calves welled up with new size, becoming two pillars of power, which was followed by his feet which grew wide and thick, nearly completing the beast's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if icing on the cake, Kouga looked down, watching his bulge grow longer and thicker. This just made him laugh in joy. \"Ha! Now no man can compare to me!\" He chuckled, watching as it came just short of being longer than his kilt. \"Damn... Any longer and I'd have to get new clothes! Not like I'd want to hide this godly physique!\" He said, flexing his arms once more. Never had he felt so powerful. He felt like he could take on anyone or anything! Kouga reached around on the ground, and picked up a good sized rock. He started to squeeze it tight, his arms pumping up and flexing, veins pushing up against his skin. \"Come on...\" He grunted, giving one last crushing grip that reduced the rock to pebbles. \"Ha ha! Alright!\" He grinned, feeling confident and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, a new idea crossed his mind. \"Hey... How about I go show that stupid mutt who's the real man around here...!?\" Kouga thought, smirking as he flexed his body. \"Yeah... I'm so frickin' huge, I'll probably crush the little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga laughed at the idea, as he got to his feet, and began to search for Inuyasha.</span></div></div>",

REALLY heavy. \"I never get this tired...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching a second, although brief, wind, he started out once more, only to end up stopping about 500 feet from where he started, which compared to how much he normally ran, wasn't a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.

Maybe I'm just a little thirsty...\" As he bent over to the water, and saw his reflection, he immediately shouted, and fell back on his behind! \"WHOA!\" He shouted. He slowly worked his way back, and peeked in again. \"Is that... Is that me...?\" Kouga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the water's reflection, he saw a large version of himself. His stomach was clearly distended from where his abs once were, a nice, rounded belly in it's place. His once toned pecs had now gone flabby, and a pair of soft man breasts gently lay atop his stomach, all hidden behind the armor that covered his torso. His arms still had some strength to them, but they too were noticeably softer as well. His trim legs, which were the most fit part of his body, was now wide and gelatinous to the touch, as well as his now wobbly calf muscles. His feet were a little wider, and a little harder too for some reason... As if he had been stomping around a lot. What really gave Kouga a shock though was his face. His cheeks were a little puffy, and he noticed there was a wide double chin whenever he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man... What the heck happened to me...?\" Kouga said. He now looked over himself, and saw that this was certainly all too real. He groped his chest, and whimpered at how tender it was.

A few more feet away, the bushes rustled again, and a huge, fat boar shot out in front of the wolf demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He mumbled, looking at the beast. It as looking at him with rage for some reason. It just snorted, and began to stamp it's feet. Apparantly it wanted to challenge Kouga! What a foolish pig it was! Kouga merely grinned in response. \"Bring it on, porky!\" He said, getting into a sumo stance. The boar charged right for him, his tusks ready to ram into Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it was withing a foot of Kouga, the wolf suddenly vanished. The boar stopped, and looked around, only to suddenly be kicked in the side, and slammed against a tree. Kouga just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Worthless animal.\" He said, before then starting to walk away from the injured beast. Clumsily, it got back to it's hooves, and shook it's head. It began to charge at Kouga once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga just barely heard the boar, and turned, taking it's full force. Luckily his armor protected him from those powerful tusks. Kouga picked it up, and slammed it onto the ground, leaving it unconscious. He was about to leave it be, when he looked it over. It definitly looked bigger up close... So much more delicious... And it WAS rather fat... Kouga picked it up. It was certianly heavy too... Kouga's maw began getting soaked with drool. It certianly was a fat little one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was still knocked out, Kouga began to feed the beast into his mouth. It was a bit hairy, but the flesh underneath was delicate, and made Kouga moan out in joy. Deeper he fed the creature into his mouth, gulping it down quicker than expected. He couldn't control himself as it was forced down as soon as it was caught by his throat, until the entire thing landed in his stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga heard a loud snap around both of his ears. Looking down, he saw that swallowing that boar whole had caused his armor to pop right off! He blushed a little as his bulging gut was now on display for the world to see. It hung just faintly over his lap, and seemed as if he swallowed a beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kouga dealed with the dilemma of his new size, he was then found by...</span></div></div>",

As he looked at them, he instantly noticed them looking at his fat, round gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Kouga...\" Hakkaku began, \"You... Have you...?\" He wasn't quite sure how to say what he wanted to, and the last thing he wanted to do was insult his pack leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga was a bit nervous at first, but gave his stomach a firm slap. \"Y-Yeah!\" He answered, going along with it. \"I figured I needed more stamina, and what better way than to gather it up than a hearty meal? I think I might have overdone it though, ehehehe...\" He stammered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinta and Hakkaku looked at each other for a moment, before nodding. \"Right.\" They said in unison.

You want us to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kouga asked, unsure what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... Help you get... Bigger?\" Hakkaku clarified. \"You did want to, right? You know Ginta and I would be willing to help you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga was a bit surprised at first, not sure how to respond to the lesser male's offer. If he refused, it would make him look suspicious for sure! On the other hand, if he took up the offer, this little Buddha belly wasn't going to be the only weight he would be putting on! He had no choice at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure!\" Kouga agreed, a little nervous. The two men's faces lit up with joy. They were happy to be able to help Kouga out with his endeavors. They both took one of Kouga's wrists, and started to pull at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then!\" Ginta said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a lot of work to do!\" Hakkaku added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga was sitting in his nest in the back part of the cave.

Ginta, meanwhile, walked over and set the animal before Kouga, smiling at him expectantly. Kouga looked back up with a hesitent grin, before looking back down at the pig. At least this one was smaller than the last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga dove into the pig, trying to seem ravenous. Ginta and Hakkaku smiled, watching their leader gorge himself. They felt like they did good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alpha male continued to eat, more tribe members were returning, and the two boys were able to stockpile the food, making a nice, hefty pile not too far from Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga had really got more than he bargained for. He had went from a little belly to having a full-on gut, that jiggled at even the slightest touch. Every bit of food that vanished down his gullet only served in making his stomach bulge out further and further, fattening the wolf nicely. He almost felt like a prisoner, forced to keep eating with no signs of abating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga then stopped, taking a moment to breathe. This was understood, and no one questioned it. He looked over his stomach, remembering how just this morning there was a set of slim, cut abs there, now replaced by what was surely a 230 pound gut. He rubbed his stomach, sighing softly. It felt really good, and soothed him. Ginta then got down next to Kouga and started to rub the round flesh for him. He smiled at Kouga, who smiled back. Now he didn't even have to waste the effort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga's pants felt a bit tight around his waist. While he didn't have a button or zipper, he did the next best thing he could do. He lowered his pants a little, just short of showing his pubes to the world. With a slight groan, he sat back up, and got back to eating, just as he was expected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeal after meal, consisting of animals, berries, fish, every little thing that the tribe could find was now disappearing down Kouga's throat, making the wolf bloat out, fattening him to no end!</span></div></div>",

Gint was setting up Kouga's bed for him, getting it warm and comfy for their leader. Kouga then made his way over and laid down just as he was expected to. The two boys then left and laid down, preparing for slumber like the rest of the tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta work off this gut...\" Kouga thought to himself. \"I'm already huge enough! If all this stuff digests, I'm gonna end up becoming a blob!\" It was then that Kouga made a plan to leave and exercise once everyone was asleep. He may tire out easily, but getting at least a little work out would help him shed a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga laid about in his bed, forced to waste precious time and allowing his food to digest. He could almost feel himself getting heavier by the second! Carefully he started to listen for the snores of the tribe. That would be his signal to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good while. Some members didn't fall asleep for a whole hour, while others were out in a matter of seconds! But once Kouga was sure the coast was clear, he made his way out passing through the waterfall with one little burst of agility. He was out and free to start working off this huge belly he had acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga started with what he was best at. A sprint. As soon as he could, he made a run for it, giving his legs an adaquate workout, while also getting him away from the base. Once far enough, Kouga started to work out, lifting various rocks and branches, and even trying to do a few sit ups while he was at it! It would take time, but he knew that soon enough he'd have this huge weight lifted from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarder and harder Kouga worked, tiring out and taking short, ten minute breaks, before pressing his nose to the grind once more. His body was covered in sweat, as he had quickly realized how much harder it was to work!

The young wolf demon slowly stopped in his tracks, vaguely aware of his surroundings. At the moment, all he cared about was if\u2026 what if, the man was being serious? He didn\u2019t sound very bright, but still, Kouga had this weird feeling, like something was off.  Soon, his paranoia became too overwhelming to ignore. He quickly looked his body over, from his chest to his feet, keeping an eye open for any abnormalities or changes. From what he could see, his body was as perfect as usual! His slightly tanned skin, his small but horribly powerful muscles, and his strong hands and feet; everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I\u2019m such an idiot\u2026\u201d He muttered, tugging on his fur and armour, both feeling a bit tight for some reason. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let myself get worried about what that\u2026mental man said! So stupid, seriously. I think seeing that mutt so often\u2019s making me dumber! Well, whatever, my Kagome\u2019s worth it~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kouga began running again, going faster and faster until his usual twister formed. Before he could go very far though, a loud TEAARRRRR sound  surprised him, and with a sudden SNAP, he lost his footing, tripped, and went flying into a tree, which, was knocked down in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga pushed a few pieces of wood off of himself, sitting up as the sudden dust in the air slowly cleared. \u201cUghhh\u2026 *cough* That \u2013 REALLY \u2013 HURT! The hell?!\u201d He yelled, attempting to stand up, a strong, tingling feeling going through his body<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nStill disoriented, but now standing, Kouga looked down at his feet. He was dumbfounded when he realized that the usual straps around them had ripped and snapped off, now in tatters. The material between his toes had rubbed and pushed into his skin until it couldn\u2019t take the strain all of a sudden, making it horribly painful to run, which was why he had tripped. They had also ripped at the ankles, resulting in the tattered mess a few feet away. The upper part of his fur \u2018boots\u2019 had stayed on, but hugged his lower calves WAY too tightly. His confusion did not fade, as did the slight tingling sensation still going through his body. Kouga then realized, after shaking off the disorientation that the fall had caused, that\u2026 he was shirtless?! Every inch of his well-toned, muscular upper body was glistening in the partial sun under the tree. His pecs seemed to be pushing outwards more than usual, while his wash-board six pack seemed to be developing into an eight pack! Looking around, walking from tree to tree, the unknowingly taller wolf demon found his fur upper wear and armour under a tree, and both had a huge tear running down the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? Cheap crap\u2026\u201d Kouga muttered, bending down to get a better look, his hands on his knees. \u201cWell, I HAVE been wearing them for a long time \u2013 WAY too long, I guess,\u201d Kouga whispered to himself, noticing the faint but obvious smell coming from his clothes, sighing. \u201cWell, whatever! They were worn out anyways! I\u2019ll just leave it alone\u2026 I kinda like being shirtless anyways~ And I\u2019m used to being barefoot too, so I\u2019m good!\u201d Kouga laughed, slightly bouncing his pecs and wiggling his bigger toes as he admired himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he was fine, Kouga stood up, only for his head to hit a large branch REALLY hard, the branch breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOD DAMMIT! THIS \u2013 is getting REALLLLLY annoying! SERIOUSLY!\u201d Kouga growled, rubbing his head as a few wood chips fell out of his hair. \u201cSomething is DEFIN\u2026 etly\u2026 wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga immediately stopped talking, utterly confused, though somewhat intrigued by the fact that, for some reason\u2026 he was surrounded by leaves! He looked down, not in the mood to pay attention to his massive, towering body, and saw that everything above his pecs were in the trees. Kouga blushed hard, turning his head as he noticed that his huge manhood was hanging out of his REALLY tight fur undergarments. Trying to ignore that, he finally pieced what was actually PREEEEETTY obvious together. All the clothes, and the \u2018shoes\u2019 that he had been wearing ripped\u2026 because they were too small! As a matter of fact, EVERYTHING seemed smaller! Even his loincloth, failing to hide his pride and joy, was ripping and tearing against his thicker thighs. As Kouga watched the tears grow larger, and felt his hair tie snap off, he realized\u2026 he was getting bigger! Kouga took a small step forward with his massive, growing foot, the tremors it sent through the forest scaring a few birds away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No way\u2026\u201d Kouga pushed a few branches and leaves out of his way, making it back to his original path, his behemoth sized, bare feet leaving two foot long footprints in the dirt. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 Gigantic! I\u2019m freaking HUGE!\u201d He yelled, his loincloth completely shredding off as he swelled past the height of ten feet tall. \u201cHehehe\u2026 well, I guess I got nothing to hide anyways~\u201d Kouga announced, not even minding a bit that he was stark naked. \u201cBut still, how? This is just too frea- WAIT! No way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twister formed around Kouga\u2019s body as he began running, his body this time demolishing anything in his way, including a few small trees. It was that weird, messed up man who said he would change\u2026 He was sure it had been the springs! He could swear he was even still getting bigger\u2026 Though, little did Kouga know, because of the cursed spring, he\u2019d NEVER stop growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga smirked as he made his way too\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't remember seeing any of this on the way here... Well, no problem! A big-shot wolf like me won't have any problem returning home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his short break, and a little self-encouragement, Kouga was back on the road, heading back to meet up with his tribe. After yet another hour, he stopped for another break, this time in the middle of a clearing in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Kouga groaned, wiping his forehead, \"I should have easily been there by now!\" He looked about at his surroundings. \"Man, am I in some kind of gigantic forest or something...!?\" He said, looking all around.

A gargantuan cicada, at least 3 feet tall, was crawling right along the ground in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa! How the hell did that thing get so frickin' huge!?\" He said to himself, pulling back, away from the beast. Eventually, it merely flew off on it's own, doing no one any harm. \"Okay... Now I KNOW there's something freaky going on...\" He told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was a loud stomp! It nearly made Kouga jump out of his skin! Without even looking back, Kouga sprinted off, not wanting to know what made such a powerful, earth-shaking stomp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf man continued to flee, the stomps didn't seem to end, and no matter how fast he ran, he couldn't escape! Not to mention he had yet to recover from his earlier fatigue. After a few mere minutes, Kouga fell forward, completely worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

He grinned down at the tiny Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you stupid wolf, you can start serving me by rubbing my feet!\" He said, setting Kouga down. Instantly, the wolf tried to run from Inuyasha. It wasn't going to be that easy! Inuyasha lunged forward, and pounced down on top of the tiny Kouga, pinning him down to the cold, hard ground. \"Hey! Don't you even dare try to escape!\" Inuyasha applied pressure onto Kouga's tiny body, making him cry out in pain. Inuyasha just grinned. He loved the way Kouga wailed. But he at least knew that too much pressure could end up killing the little toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha released Kouga, and picked him up by the scruff of his neck. Inuyasha laid back up against the tree, and set Kouga at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, get to work! And don't try running again, or I'll make sure you end up dead next time!\" Inuyasha barked. Kouga shuddered a little. Before, Inuyasha was no big deal, but now that he was practically a giant compared to him, Kouga was walking on eggshells here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kouga pressed his hands to Inuyasha's giant foot. It was warm, but practically hard as a rock! How could that mutt even feel anything with feet this hard?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any rubbing down there!\" Inuyasha said, shoving the foot into Kouga's body. Almost immediately after, Kouga began to rub the foot. He could feel every contour of the large appendage, not to mention the faint musk the emnated from it. \"Ahhh, yeah...\" Inuyasha sighed. He had never had someone rub his feet for him before. He was liking how this felt! His wide toes flexed and relaxed, making a slight crack as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga had a scowl on his face as he worked. He really didn't like that he was forced into slavery to this giant, worthless half-breed, but there wasn't anything he could do to fight back at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kouga massaged, the foot suddently came down, and pressed on him. Inuyasha laughed to himself, loving how powerful he felt when he had dominion over such a lesser being. Just one foot alone was enough to cover Kouga's entire body. He pressed down a little, rubbing Kouga against the rough, musky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that, wolf boy?\" Inuyasha said with a cocky smirk. Kouga could only grunt in reply, which was muffled by Inuyasha's foot. This only made Inuyasha laugh even more. He lifted his foot from Kouga, and picked the mini-sized wolf up once more.</span></div></div>",

Inuyasha looked down, rubbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, hungry already? I already had breakfast...\" He grumbled to himself. He then looked at Kouga. \"Heh... Someone's looking like they'd make a tasty snack!\" Inuyasha said with a dark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!? No way! I-I taste horrible! I'm all tough and gamy!\" Kouga said, starting to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you had to be tasty... You just gotta be filling!\" He grinned, his hand slowly moving up to his mouth. Inuyasha was doing it on purpose. He could feel his taste buds tingle, his whole mouth beginning to fill with saliva. Kouga was slowly drawing closer to the mouth. He was pushing at Inuyasha's hand, giving his all trying to get loose, but the bigger dog just tightened his grip. As the mouth slowly opened, the drool flooded out, Inuyasha's chops moistened by the wetness. It looks like Kouga had a nice, warm pool eagerly awaiting his arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga was placed in, and held in place by Inuyasha's hand, as his only exit closed around the limb. The hand released him, holding him down to the tongue with just a few fingers. Slowly, the hand worked it's way out, and the teeth clamped shut! Kouga was sealed within with no hopes of escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha swished the little wolf around in his mouth a little. \"Mmmm... I dunno what you're talking about! You're delicious!\" He said, as he then started to suck. He let out a sudden moan that was near deafening to Kouga, but felt so good to Inuyasha. \"Aw, man! You're so delicious!\" Inuyasha said, making sure to speak carefully so Kouga still had no means of escape. Kouga was suddenly thrown up, pushed by the tongue, and slammed into the roof of Inuyasha's mouth. He was slid around up there, as Inuyasha continued to take in the wolf demon's full flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop it, Inuyasha! I'm begging you!\" Kouga shouted in a submissive tone. \"You can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga's pleas were, of course, ignored, as Inuyasha merely kept toying with him, moving him all around, getting the wolf over every little inch of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... You taste so good... So... So good...\" He moaned. Every spot in his mouth that the wolf seemed to touch was like a spark of pure ecstasy jolting throughout his entire body, from his little dog ears to his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga got an idea. He quickly turned around, and bit Inuyasha's tongue! What a stupid idea it was, and idea that sealed his fate no less. Inuyasha then yelled out in pain, but in doing so, craned his neck backward, sliding Kouga down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? N-No! Nooooo!\" Kouga shouted, but his cries soon became muffled in the tight tunnel that was Inuyasha's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Inuyasha touched his tongue. He wasn't bleeding, but the spot certainly was tender...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga soon was worked all the way down, landing with a splash in Inuyasha's stomach! He dashed over to the stomach walls, and started to hit on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let me out!\" He shouted desperately, as the liquid started to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha just laid back up against the tree, rubbing his stomach idly. He let out a noisy burp feeling great about himself. \"Haaaah... Not bad...\" He snickered to himself. \"Maybe I should get you some friends! Perhaps a little Shippou... Kirara... Hey! Maybe you can even have Kagome join you!\" Inuyasha said, laughing at his own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-breed demon just laid back enjoying the warm sun on his skin, sighing. What a perfect end to a perfect snack!</span></div></div>",

There hadn\u2019t been much to do lately, besides just wait for his sister to come home, but of course, what he really wanted was for Inuyasha to come by, like he used to! Though, since Kagome was spending more and more time in the Feudal Era, and less time here, Inuyasha didn\u2019t come very often, or stay for very long when he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis just sucks\u2026\u201d He muttered, walking up to his front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to Sota\u2019s surprise, as he opened the door and walked into the house, he spotted Inuyasha, screwing with Buyo like he usually did while waiting for Kagome. Sota smiled, yelling, \u201cHey Inuyasha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha turned his head, still holding Buyo by his paws, simply replying, \u201cHey Sota!\u201d He let go of the cat, grunting. \u201cCould you tell Kagome to hurry up? I\u2019ve been waiting here since this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go tell her!\u201d Sota answered, already walking up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sota reached Kagome\u2019s door, he came to a sudden realization. When Kagome was ready, her AND Inuyasha were going to leave. The young boy was about to turn around, wanting to spend some time with Inuyasha downstairs, but his sister came booming through her door, in a slight rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome turned her head as she ran down the stairs, yelling, \u201cSee you later Sota!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAhhh\u2026 Already?\u201d He whispered to himself, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSota began walking down the stairs, at least wanting to say goodbye to his sister and Inuyasha, but stopped right in his tracks when he saw a gleaming piece of\u2026 glass? He bent downwards and picked the small shard up, cleaning it off a little before placing it in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa must\u2019ve broken one of his fake Shikon Jewels!\u201d Sota said, as he reached the bottom of the stairs. \u201cHe\u2019s so clumsy sometimes, seriously\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSota was sad to see, when he got downstairs, that his sister and Inuaysha were already gone! He sluggishly walked back up the stairs, feeling horribly disappointed as he walked into his room, kicking his shoes off, but leaving his socks on as he jumped onto his bed. He slightly stretched his muscles, and repositioned himself a few times, staring up at the ceiling. What was he going to do for the rest of the day? Sota\u2019s thoughts were cut off as he scratched his leg where his pocket was, feeling a strong, tingly itch. Though, almost a few seconds later, the itching stopped, letting Sota think about what he would do next. He once again stretched and repositioned himself, feeling a little uncomfortable for some reason. Little did the young boy know, his body had absorbed an actual jewel shard, that Kagome had accidentally dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere isn't that much to do...\" Sota muttered, still thinking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the thought was quickly discarded when he remembered it was spring break, so they out of visiting relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I'll go explore the woods out back!\" It had been so since he went into the woods that covered the mountain range belonging to the Higurashi estate. In fact, the last time he could recall was when Inuyasha claimed his sword could make diamonds, of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plan of action cemented in his mind, Souta hopped off his bed and headed down stairs to kitchen to fetch a couple snacks for his little expedition. There he found       his mother working on what he only imagine to be that night's dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm going out into woods. Is there anything I take for a snack?\" Souta asked as he rummaged through the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are few leftover onigiri that didn't make into your sister's backpack. Fell free to take as many as you want, they should be on the second shelf.\" The desired treats were right where he was told they would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouta grabbed four before closing the fridge. He then retrieved his lunch box and a backpack to carry everything in. Finally, the boy made his way towards the exits, but not before asked to return home before dinner. It was curry, one of Kagome's favorite dishes, but with her suddenly being spirited away again, the rest of the family was going to have to work at trimming down the amount of leftovers. Souta was going to have to make his trip a swift one if he had any hopes of doing anything worthwhile while he was out. He slipped the shoes he had accidentally brought to his room back onto his feet. It was a slight, though, almost like the shoes had shrunk. Or maybe his feet were still swollen from when he last took the shoes off. The possibility that his feet had honestly grown bigger since early that morning, also crossed the boy's mind, but was written off as being as equally impossible the shoes shrinking. But to be on the safe side, he'd let his mom know that he needed a new pair when got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least now the canopy made by the surviving trees that lined the scarred earth hid it from at the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouta enjoyed admiring the true strength that lay before. But admiration sometimes brought to the surface the few insecurities that he had, even for a boy his age. He was weak, short, and useless. The boy couldn't even the the doorway to the past deep within shrine's well. In his mind, he was a pathetic little brother, unable to help when to help his sis when it mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you don't have a shrimp like me holding you back, sis\" he said in defeat. \"If I wish was bigger and could open that stupid gate. But who am I kidding, by the time i get big enough, there will be nothing left to help with.\" Souta pulled his lunchbox out, said a brief grace, and began chowing on his onigiri. He determined to grow quickly, and what better place to start than with the food had with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after he ate last speck of rice he could find, Souta noticed how tight shoes felt now. Where as back at the home the tightness was like a slight squeeze, he felt like his feet were being crushed. The boy looked to his shoes and saw how much they were bulging, threatening to burst at any given moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouta work hastily to remove the ill fitting shoes and, in turn, relieve the unbearable pressure he was feeling. Whatever was going on certain wasn't ordinary by any means, but he would have to hold onto the thought as the sun had nearly sunken below the horizon. Running full burst the boy managed to make it home just as the last embers of day faded from the sky. And with even greater speed bounded up the stairs and straight into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was shut soundly and locked for privacy, Souta examined his shoe. There was nothing wrong with it. It appeared the same as it had always been.<br>\r\n'I wonder.' There was no problem with either shoe, so maybe his own feet were to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouta sat down on his bed. He took one the shoes and lined the heel up with his foot suffice to say he was shocked at he was looking at. The shoe came nowhere near to matching the length of his foot reaching just below the ball. There was definitely something supernatural going on, but how? Why?</span></div></div>",

All he could manage to think was how small and pathetic he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Shippou felt like he was a burden unto his friends. He hopped down sorrowfully from the tree, and started to wander off. As he did, there was a sudden trill from behind him. Shippou turned, and saw Kirara there, gazing at him with wide, questioning eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going for a walk, girl, okay?\" Shippou said, walking over, and petting Kirara's head. She hopped along, following Shippou. \"No! You have to stay here with the others!\" Shippou insisted, gently nudging Kirara back to camp. She fought it for a bit, but then turned once more to Shippou. As she trilled again, she tilted her head, looking at Shippou. \"Don't worry about me, okay?\" He asked her, \"I promise I'll come back okay!\" He said, his former sadness becoming determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou set out, walking far and wide. Things were kind of relaxing on his own. He felt strong and independent, as if no one could stop him. Of course, he didn't think about that too long, since it would depress him, since pretty much ANYONE could stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, he was poking around the bottom of the mountains, enjoying a little exploring. As he did, he soon happened upon a hot spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Lookit this!\" He said rather loudly to himself, looking at the steam as it rose from the hot pool. \"This is so cool!\" Shippou inhaled the fumes from the pool, and instantly, he felt as if he could jump over the mountain! It was amazing... Just imagine how he'd feel if he actually bathed in it!</span></div></div>",

Not me!\" Shippou replied, starting to sweat a little, either from the steam, or the tension of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha continued to glare at the boy, and would've continued, if not for seeing the steam rising from nearby rocks. \"Hey, what's that?\" He asked.

Looks like a hot spring...\" He said, \"Not bad, Shippou!\" He held the fox boy up to his face, \"Looks like you found us our own personal bath! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's hop in!\" The half-demon insisted. He let Shippou go, and started stripping down. First his kimono top, ditching it entirely, before sliding out of his white undershirt to reveal all the sexy, slender muscle underneath. There was a distinct pink blush across Shippou's face. He had always bathed around girls, and to see his older foster brother like this... Well, Shippou felt a little stirring, to say the least. Next was Inuyasha's kimono bottoms, to which he easily slipped off. Inuyasha then stood there, in nothing but a pair of white briefs that Kagome had given to him as a gift a little while back. Although, it barely hid his well-endowed self, the more Shippou tried to look away, the more he found himself staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying the little boy no mind, Inuyasha splashed right into the hot water, and laid against the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh...

He looked up to Inuyasha, watching as the young half demon continued to slowly swell larger, his blissful smile partially hidden behind his huge, expanding pecs. Shippou\u2019s feeling of excitement slowly faded, as he realized that, even though Inuyasha was still growing in the hot spring, he hadn\u2019t grown AT ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou flinched as Inuyasha attempted to reposition himself in the water, his lower abs slowly beginning to poke out of the hot spring. \u201cUgh\u2026 Damn it Kagome\u2026\u201d Inuyasha muttered. \u201cThese\u2026 Uh\u2026 boxers are WAY too tight\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha shivered slightly as a light breeze blew against his upper body, which he thought was unusual. Attempting to ignore it, he just continued to relax. He didn\u2019t encounter awesome hot springs like this very often, so he was going to take real advantage of it! And luckily for Shippou, the boxers Kagome had given Inuyasha would be able to hold his massive junk for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou, rubbing his eyes, hoped he was dreaming. But, he slowly stopped doing so, right in time to see Inuyasha as big as ever. He looked down, avoided the sight of the massive, hot half demon, to only see one of Inuyasha\u2019s massive, slowly expanding feet under the water. Shippou jumped slightly, intimidated by the size of Inuyasha\u2019s barefoot, letting out a shrill whimper. There was NO way that was one of Inuyasha\u2019s feet! The massive appendage was longer than Shippou was tall! He watched as Inuyasha\u2019s huge, long nailed toes flexed slightly, each one still slowly growing along with the rest of his colossal foot and his ever expanding, mesmerizing body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey Shippou!\u201d Inuyasha yelled, his voice now MUCH louder than usual, with his massive hands still behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uhhh\u2026\u201d Shippou stuttered, still shocked about his ever so slowly expanding friend. He had to be past eight feet tall at this point! At that size, with those massive muscles of his, he\u2019d be torchered to heck by Inuyasha! Or even worse, he could be STEPPED ON! \u201cY-Yeah\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou slowly looked up, and up, and up towards Inuyasha\u2019s face. Though, he nearly stopped breathing when he realized that Inuyasha, still slowly growing in the hot spring, was smiling down at him! Shippou\u2019s eye twitched as he backed away from Inuyasha in the water slightly, and stared at the young, cute half demon\u2019s huge face for a few seconds, his ears slightly twitching, his knees also beginning to ever so slightly poke out of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha stirred in the water a little, his boxers outlining his massive manhood, and then looked down at Shippou, saying\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His heavy feet making powerful dents in the hard earth.  Shippo soon wouldn't be able to keep up.  He looked at the thick-clawed feet and shook his head.  Part of him hated this and part of him wanted it.  But regardless, if he was to keep up, he had to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith careful timing, Shippo jumped onto the massive, wonderfully scented feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shipp, don't toss a feather on my feet,\" Inuyasha said from inside the canopy.  He grumbled again as another \"low bush's\" branch hit him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome shook her head.   Where the hell was Inuyasha?  He better not have been tormenting Shippo.  She looked at food she just brought back from her world.  It was meant to be a surprise for Inuyasha.  She sat on a log as Sango and Miroku enjoyed their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Kagome.  I'm sure they are both fine,\" Miroku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we finish eating we can take Kirara out to find them,\" Sango said before her demon companion rose to her feet.  She looked in the direction Inuyasha and Shippo disappeared to.  \"What is it girl?\"  Before she could answer, Kagome blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a tremor?\" she muttered before noticing her water bottle had ripples in it, despite it being on the solid ground.  There was a massive creaking as though something was making the trees do what wasn't natural for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a foot appeared.  It was large, heave, and had familiar claws.  The powerful muscular leg that followed was bare.    As the hips appeared, they could see the tattered remains of some clothing that had ripped around the groin, leaving a large genital hanging free in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torso was sculpted.  Every bit of muscle seemed too perfect to be real.  The chest jutted out with perfect and strong muscles.  Those alone looked like they could crush boulders.  The arm appeared with such sculpted muscles Kagome was sure it was a dream or something she ate.  Especially as she recognized the necklace this being was wearing.  It seemed to be the only thing left on his massive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs wearing a necklace technically not make him nude?  Kagome didn't know nor care as she watched as Inuyasha's head appear from the trees.  He was over 20 feet now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long leg finally hit the ground and he brought his back leg forward.  A scream was heard as the leg moved forward.  The three humans and demon companion watched as Shippo came into view, riding the massive foot.  Inuyasha didn't even seem to notice.  He just looked down and grumbled to himself before sitting down.  His tight, musculat butt made a large thump as it hit the earth as his friends jump into the air.  Shippo was still clinging to the foot, terrified to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In-In-In-Inuyasha,\" Kagome breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kagome.  Is dinner ready?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- what happened to you?\" Kagome asked as Sango and Miroku carefully took in the well-sculpted half-demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes shrank,\" he said reaching out.  Kagome didn't jump back when the mighty hand that could grab her effortlessly came at her.  It stopped and dropped what remained of his clothes and boxers.  \"Think you could fix them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha, they didn't shrink.  You grew!  You're gigantic!\" Kagome yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Inuyasha muttered.  \"No I didn't!\"  Kagome walked towards him and stood between his legs with his growing member inching towards her.  But she was still by his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you left, you foot was not taller than me!\" Kagome yelled.  Inuyasha looked from his foot to his friend.  Foot.  Friend.  Foot.  Friend.  His mouth dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" he asked.  He reached up and scratched his head as Miroku and Sango noticed something disturbing.  Inuyasha was still growing taller.  They could see a slowly building pile of dirt being dug up as his heel continued to move forward.</span></div></div>",

Kagome had to stop focusing on that and on how amazing her friend was looking.  This was a serious situation.  \"Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kagome yelled.  \"How-how-how can you say that?\"  She watched as he flexed an arm, the muscles bulging outward.  Inuyasha turned back to Kagome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm stronger now.  Whatever has happened, it's made me stronger and that's a good thing.  I can fight Naraku better at this size,\" Inuyasha explained.  \"I can protect you guys.\"  His went dark as he remembered just what he had lost to that demon.  Not again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well . . .  I can see your reasoning there,\" Kagome conceded.  Inuyasha nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides Kagome, you saw my father's grave,\" Inuyasha said.  \"I've always wanted to be as powerful as him.  He would protect his men with his life.  Now I'm on my way to being just like him.\"  Kagome said nothing as she thought about that.  Feeling faint from this sudden change, she walked over and leaned against the massive foot.  It had a soft, warm quality despitr the heavy burdens it must carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<sub>\"Look, we need to find out what's making him grow,\"</sub> Miroku whispered to Sango.  Sango nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't,\" Inuyasha said.  The two humans jumped and turned around.  They saw his massive and cute ears twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Inuyasha, we don't want our enemies becoming like you, do we?\" Miroku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.  I mean Inuyasha, what if Naraku finds it and becomes even stronger?\" Sango asked.  Inuyahsa grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you make a good point,\" Inuyasha admitted.  He began to laugh and looked at his foot where Kagome had begun to stroke the foot.  \"Hey, stop that please?\"  Kagome blinked and blushed at what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.   So what happened to you when you went to see Shippo?\" Kagome asked, hoping Inuyasha wouldn't pick on her for  what she had just done.  The massive half-demon closed his eyes to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, there was some mint I tasted.  I figured I could put it on the food you got if it didn't taste very good.\"  Kagome felt anger at the idea she wouldn't bring good food.  \"Then I found Shippo by this hot spring he found.  We were in that . . . Hey Shippo, how long do you think we were in there?\"  Shippo woke from his stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What?\" the tiny fox demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long were you in the hot spring?\" Kagome asked as she was leaning against Inuyasha's ankle.  It felt . . . . nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh maybe ten to twenty minutes,\" Shippo said, wondering if he should tell the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirara, let's go,\" Sango said, \"We can track their trail.\"  The tiny demon transformed and Sango and Miroku climbed on before riding off into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha smiled back down to Kagome.  \"So, sorry I ripped your gift,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right Inuyasha,\" Kagome said before turning away from her massive, hulking friend.  \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Inuyasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's coming.  I can sense the jewel shards,\" Kagome said.</span></div></div>",

She wrapped her arm around his ankle again, not only for protection but also because she just couldn't get enough of touching them! Shippo, on the other hand, had settled for hopping up on Kagome's shoulder. All three of them were focused in the same direction Kagome looked. After all, she was the one who could tell where it was coming from! Inuyasha stood up and kept his eyes focused forward before glancing down, his view blocked only slightly by the swell of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mere minutes, a small whirlwind was coming there way! It slowed to a stop, and there stood the leader of the wolf demon tribe, Kouga. He started walking right for Kagome with a confident smile on his face. As soon as he was close enough, he grabber her hands, and said, \"Ah, Kagome. Did that damned mutt leave you all alone out here in the wilderness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, Kouga, Inuyasha'll--\" Shippo said, trying to get a word in before Kouga interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he left the squirrel with you.\" Kouga said, gazing back at Kagome. She soon jerked he hands away from Kouga, backing away from him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, d-don't worry, I'm not alone...\" Kagome told Kouga with a somewhat sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadd'ya mean?\" Kouga asked with a raised eyebrow and slight scowl. In response, Kagome and Shippo seemed to point upward in unison. Kouga looked up, and started to realize just what he was standing under! Taking a few steps backwards, away from the two pillars that were Inuyasha's legs, past his admirable bulge. Along his ripped abs and pumped pecs, Kouga soon found himself looking into the eyes of an Inuyasha who was grinning down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there wolf cub.\" Inuyasha said in a rather cocky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa... Hey! How did Inu-mutt get so huge?!\" He said, looking at Kagome and Shippo for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two could utter a word, Inuyasha interrupted by saying, \"It doesn't matter how I got so huge!\" He took a step forward, making the ground shake a little bit underneath his foot! \"You came all the way here, so how about you and I have a little battle?\" He asked before cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga gulped a little before reassuring himself. \"Y-Yeah!\" He stammered, \"It doesn't matter how big you get, there's no way that I'm going to lose to you!\" Kouga pulled back his fist and jumped up at Inuyasha! He shot his fist right into Inuyasha's abs as hard as he could! Kouga may have had powerful strength, but his fist barely even put a dent in the rock-hard muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Was that your attack?\" Inuyasha laughed the hit right off like it was nothing! \"You'd better try a little harder if you wanna hurt me!\" He said, puffing out his chest proudly. Kouga shook his hand a little. That actually hurt! He cracked his wrist a little and looked back up at Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're so tough just because you're big?! I've taken down demons three times your size!\" He said, springing back up and striking Inuyasha in his chin! He managed to get Inuyasha to turn his head, but barely. As Kouga landed back on the ground, he looked back up at Inuyasha who was still grinning wickedly down at Kouga!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn!\" Inuyasha said. Slowly, his huge foot rose up, casting a shadow over Kouga! Kouga gulped, and was about to make a run for it before Inuyasha brought his foot down and stamped Kouga into the ground! Kouga was buried underneath Inuyasha's huge foot, save for his face. Inuyasha didn't put enough pressure to crush him, but it was enough to keep him in place and hurt him just a little. Kouga groaned miserably, and started to wiggle around. \"Heh,\" Inuyasha chuckled, \"What's wrong? I thought you said you weren't gonna lose to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't lost... Grr... Yet!\" Kouga replied, trying to push himself out from under Inuyasha's feet, though he didn't make much progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've lost to me.\" Inuyasha said, putting a little more pressure, just to make Kouga whine and put him in his place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn aaaarrgh!\" Kouga shouted, holding still as the pressure was put on him. \"O-Okay! Okay! You win!\" He said, swallowing his pride to save himself from some broken bones. Inuyasha let his foot up off of Kouga with a cocky smirk on his face. He had won in the most satisfying way he possibly could! Kouga winced a little as he got to his feet. \"Augh, man, what's that smell!?\" He groaned, taking a whiff of his body. It was subtle, but addicting! He couldn't stop smelling! Though he restrained himself in front of Inuyasha, lest he make himself look like an idiot.</span></div></div>",

And?\" Inuyasha said, barely interested in what Kouga had to say. He had won, and that was all that mattered to him right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna stick around for a little while! You guys could use more muscle like me!\" Kouga finished, a proud smile on his face as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-What?!\" Inuyasha sputtered, looking down at the little wolf man. \"Like hell we do! I'm all the muscle we need around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a good idea.\" Kagome said, butting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Inuyasha repeated. He crouched down next to Kagoma, his large face staring her down, \"It's a terrible idea!\" He insisted. With his new size, it was like he was yelling at Kagome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Kagoma shouted, covering her ears. \"Sit boy!\" As soon as she spoke those words, Inuyasha's necklace flashed, and he hit the ground hard! \"I say it's a good idea! You're too big to keep track of everything! If Kouga's around, he can make sure everything's fine down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's what we have Miroku for!\" Inuyasha said, careful to keep his voice down this time. \"We don't need this dirty mutt following us around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who's a mutt.\" Kouga said, though his comment went largely unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miroku <i>is</i> capable, but he can't watch over me, Shippo AND Sango!\" Kagome replied to Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... I'm huge! I can take care of everyone!\" Inuyasha insisted, trying to pull off whatever reason he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're huge.\" Kagome replied, \"That means you won't always be able to watch over us below you.\" Inuyasha bit his lower lip. unsure of how to reply back to that. He thought his logic was pretty sound, but it just wasn't enough to satisfy Kagome. Kagome walked over to Kouga, grabbing his hand. \"We'd be glad to have you along.\" She said with a smile. Kouga blushed a little as Kagome held onto his hands. They were so soft... She soon let go and turned around, pointing off into the forest, \"Alright! Now let's go catch up with Sango and Miroku!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha, who was looking at Kagome, used lone finger to adjust Kagome's arm so she was pointing in the correct direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" She said, blushing a little in embarrassment, though her energy didn't falter! \"Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, dammit!\" Inuyasha groaned as he was forced to move his way through the trees. Shippo was now resting on Kouga's shoulder, whom was petting him gently under his chin. However, both Shippo and Kagome's eye were trained on the giant Inuyasha as he forced his way through the forest! It was amazing to see such a huge, powerful man easily push such thick branches aside with the greatest of ease. It was even hard to walk when you got too close to Inuyasha, since his large footsteps made the ground quake a little every time they hit the earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it had slowed down considerably, Inuyasha was still growing bit by bit. Whatever was in that spring was some powerful stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Inuyasha was so tall, he was able to travel faster, and forced his friends plus Kouga to keep up! It took them about fifteen minutes, until they ran into Miroku and Sango...</span></div></div>",

The waters before the muscular Inuyasha, curse-free Miroku, wolf demon Kouga, youthful Shippo, concerned Sango, and wise Kagome were just like that.  When one who bathes in these mystical water wishes to protect the power will flow into himself and enhance himself the more he wants to protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, a selfish user, one who seeks to empower for their own sake, their own domination and do not consider others, will not be empowered in the same way.  Few who were cursed tended to live, so what became of them was a true mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Shippo saw the mystical water just heal an curse with what originally had just one escape clause he was angry.  Why Miroku and not him?  Why Inuyasha and not him?  What did he have to to get that power?  Drink it?  Shippo's eyes widened as a sly smile appeared on his face as Miroku was distracting the others with his cured hand.  Even Kouga was not paying the spring much mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he moved close and then jumped into the water.  The splash made all turn to him as he started to drink from the water.  He didn't see a long arm reach for him.  The mighty hand grabbed him as he continued to gulp down more and more of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shippo!

The humans and demons turned to see several clothes laid out next to the spring and a nude Koga in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll grow bigger than you Inuyasha!\" Koga yelled, \"I'll show you who's the strongest!\"</span></div></div>",

But from our tracks, we've been moving in circles.  Whatever Kirara is sensing won't let us get near it,\" Sango said before they shook from small tremors.  Turning to behind them, they saw a wall of muscular perfection coming towards them.  They felt their worries slowly vanish.  There was a large crash as Inuyasha dropped to one knee and looked at his small friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Find anything?\" Inuyasha asked.  Sango and Miroku looked over his sculpted body and resisted an urge to get closer.  They saw Kagome, Shippo, and Koga appear but paid them no mind.  Inuyasha was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kirara keeps trying to take us on a trail that way,\" Sango said, pointing up the mountain.  \"Your scent is there but for some reason we cannot get any further up the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A barrier?\" Inuyasha guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our assessment.

If he pleased Inuyasha, Kagome could be happy as well.  Their pleasure was what he wanted.  Before Inuyasha could stop him, Koga ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speedy wolf-demon tracked his Inuyasha's heavy scent.  It was one of the best trails he had tracked.  It was almost as good as Kagome's scent.  His enhanced legs  slowed as he came to the small clearing the hot spring was waiting for him.  Looking at the ground, he could see the soft indents where Inuyasha had been far larger than he was before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking carefully, he could even see the before and after-growth imprints.  His tiny dainty feet and the larger majestic ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be the spring itself?\" Koga asked himself.  He looked into the bubbling water.  He closed his eyes and thought about Inuyasha.  The half-mutt turned muscular wonder.  Kagome obviously wanted to be held in those strong arms.  She wanted to kiss those beautifully sculpted muscles.  She would rather be protected by him than Koga.  Even her reasons for letting him stay, he was to be her back-up protector.  Second fiddle to Inuyasha as he took on the stronger, more dangerous foes.  Koga felt anger as his mind slowly cleared up from being away from Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like a child meant to protect the weaker child while father goes take care of business,\" Koga growled.  His eyes opened with a hint of anger.  \"Well, two can play at this growing game.\"  He chuckled.  Stripping quickly, as it was evident by Inuyasha his old clothes won't fit anymore, and jumped in.  \"I'll become a better protector than you ever were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot water covered much of his body but didn't seem to rise up despite him getting in.  He shrugged and just relaxed.  After a minute, he began to wonder if he was growing.  It was hard to tell.  He glanced to the side of the spring and picked up a rock and looked at it in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds but his demon eyes could see the rock slowly shrink in his hands.  Glancing down, he watched as his abs became more sculpted.  His arms were slowly puffing up more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Koga said before jumping out of the wonderful water.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouga started walking back to his friends, holding that rock in his hand with a smile on his face. His body was starting to get bigger, his chest swelling outward as his abs were a tight, defined six pack. Kouga felt more powerful than he ever had before, and he was loving every second of it! He started getting taller and taller, his height seeming to increase in inches with every step he took! In moments he was a whole foot taller, and soon enough, two feet! \"Aw yeah... This feels great...\" He said under his breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga soon had to put up with an issue that Inuyasha had to face, and that was making his way through the trees! Thankfully most of the path had already been cleared by the gigantic half demon, but he still got poked by the ocassional branch and it quickly became annoying! Kouga just kept thinking to himself of the look on Inuyasha's face when he returned, huge, if not even huger than Inuyasha himself! To have everyone worshipping him for being the biggest and the strongest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much longer do you think Kouga will take?\" Asked a curious Kagome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be TOO long.\" Shippo replied, \"It didn't take us long to get there, and besides! He can run really fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose...\" Kagome replied, twiddling her fingers together, \"I just think that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Inuyasha interrupted, \"Don't tell me you actually CARE what happens to him?\" He told Kagome, feeling a bit jealous. After all, he was here and he was huge! Why worry over puny little Kouga when there was a huge hunk of a man right before her very eyes? \"I mean really...!\" Inuyasha grumbled. As soon as he saw that Kagome was looking up at him, he flexed one of his arms for her! The bicep pumped up, nearly to the size of a beach ball! Kagome blushed a little, feeling as her heart beat a little faster at the sight of such a man! Sango, too, was looking, through trying her best to stay out of Inuyasha and Kagome's little discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? You can't even look away from me now!\" Inuyasha said suddenly. A sort of sweet scent wafted down to Kagome's nose, making her feel a little light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Ah...\" Kagome stammered, but before she could say another word, the ground beneath them started to rumble! Birds flew in fright and leaves fell from the trees. As the gang looked at the source of it all, the soon saw a gargantuan Kouga, grinning down at them! He must have been at least twice Inuyasha's size, with muscles that made Inuyasha's look like a kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Kouga said with a sly look on his face, \"What do you think of the NEW me?\" Kouga lifted his arms and flexed them as he puffed out his chest! He was a colossus of muscle, with a cocky grin on his face! His manhood had grown quite large, putting even Inuyasha's to shame! Sango gulped a little bit just looking at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you don't mind...\" Kouga reached down and plucked Kagome right off the ground! \"I'l juist be taking this!\" He said with a devious smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" Inuyasha shouted, reaching up at him and Kagome! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inuyasha looked up at the forty foot wolf demon and felt anger.  Not at this guy finding the magic which made them grow.  Not even at him becoming so large and muscular.  No.  It was the the fact this guy took Kagome from him.  Even as she moved past him he could smell Kagome's fear.  She was scared and this guy was the cause.  This guy was scaring his Kagome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would punish Kouga for this transgression.  He would show him who was truly meant to protect Kagome.  And he would do it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha took in deep breaths.  With each large breath his body expanded quickly.  He was growing faster now, edging up on the slower growing demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can beat me?\" Kouga laughed as he held Kagome in one hand.  With his mighty foot, he kicked Inuyasha.  The growing half-demon caught the foot and felt his claws extend,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back Kagome!\" Inuyasha yelled as his nails ripped into the foot's flesh.  Kouga howled in pain as Inuyasha pressed on and pushed him back, to throw him off balance.  Inuyasha was now equal to the full demon in size.  Snarling, Kouga held Kagome close to the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mutt,\" Kouga growled back.  He set his foot down on the ground, completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving moved back from the others, Shippo, Miroku, Sango, and Kirara watched as the titanic demons went at it.  They watched with open mouths as Inuyasha stare down Kouga.  It was only Kirara who noticed a strange sound coming from nearby.  She turned and looked at Shippo.  The young fox demon was getting taller.  He now stood equal to Miroku's waist!  She made her trilling sound and looked at her growing friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shippo!\" Sango yelled as she noticed the growing boy.  His clothes were tight as his tiny body was developing some serious muscles despite the small frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm growing?\" he said in disbelief.  He smiled.  \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Miroku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spring Inuyasha found.  He started growing when he was in it,\" Shippo said as he reached Sango's chest.  His abbs were visible now as he continued to inch taller and taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you mention that before?\" Sango asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well . . .\" Shippo started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget that.  Why didn't you grow earlier?\" Miroku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I just noticed Inuyasha growing slightly bigger and so I wanted to be bigger so he couldn't pick on me,\" Shippo said as he looked Miroku in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe intent is important?\" Miroku suggested when the earth shook.  The three turned their eyes to the growing demons and Kagome being held high above Inuyasha by Koga's longer limb.  The massive Inuyasha and Kouga must have been fifty feet tall as the former tried to overpower the demon.  But it was obvious he didn't use his full power out of fear of harming Kagome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate she'll be squeezed like a peach!\" Sango yelled.  Miroku looked at the now taller Shippo, his child-size clothes having long since given up on him, revealing some very nice looking muscles and foxy equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if someone can pull her out of there,\" Miroku said.  Shippo turned with confusion before he realized both Sango and Miroku were looking at him.  He smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn to protect Kagome!\" he announced as he grew taller.  He raced at the growing Titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoua growled as he held back Inuyasha.  This wasn't how things were supposed to be.  \"I will beat you Mutt!\" he growled.  \"You will not win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give . . . Me . .  . Kagome!\" Inuyasha growled back as he continued to get taller and stronger.  He felt something run up his sculpted leg and then his back.  He felt feet on his neck then head (and what he was sure was a kick or two).  He looked up at the small figure launch itself at Kouga's hand and bite the wolf demon's hand hard.  Kouga screamed and released Kagome as  Shippo grabbed her and transformed into a big balloon.  He lifted Kagome high into the air, away from the titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Shippo!\" Inuyasha called as now he could give Koga his full intention.  He would prove who was the better protector.  He felt his body continue grow larger as he continued to hold Kouga close.</span></div></div>",
