You two had taken the day to visit your local flea market and in her excitement to see and touch all the little knick-knacks for sale had managed to cut her finger on the sharp edge of a broken teapot. Who's trying to sell a broken teapot anyways?<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     Alyssa kept whining in pain as she took her finger out of her mouth. \"Owww sweetie I cut myself!\" She said. It probably wasn't as bad as she was making it out to be. \"Alyssa I doubt it's as bad-\" You start to say before Alyssa brings up her bleeding finger.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"YEESH!\" You exclaim! Seems she cut herself deeper than you thought. A good portion of the skin on the tip of her index finger was hanging loose with copious amounts of blood leaking from her wound. \"Q-quick get something to cover it up!\" She whimpers, burying her finger in her light blue skirt, anything to keep it from bleeding anymore.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"Hang on hang on!\" You grab Alyssa's hand and put your fingers around her wound. \"You've got make sure that little bit of skin gets...\" Then the strangest hing happened. As you run your finger across your girlfriend's wound it began to glow. Faintly, but enough for you and Alyssa to notice. You both stare in awe and amazement as, just like magic, the bit of skin dangling from Alyssa's gashed index finger began to fold itself in to place. Slowly the cut began to heal as if her skin was stitching itself back together. In a split second the wound had completely healed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You and Alyssa stand there, awestruck. \"Did you... did that just happen? It's like... like it was never there! It doesn't even hurt anymore!\" Alyssa said, being the first to snap out of it. Indeed she was. Except for the drying blood on her hand and skirt all evidence that she ever cut herself was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah... Did I do that? How did I do that?\" You ask as if either you or Alyssa would have any answers. \"I don't know but, oh drat.\" Alyssa patted the light blue t-shirt she was wearing to match her skirt, smearing even more of her clothing with blood. \"I'm still covered in all this blood. Look sweetie I've gotta go back home and change before anyone starts freaking.\" She takes a moment to give you a kiss on the cheek. \"I don't know how you did it but you must have some kind of magic power! We can talk later but...\" She looked around at the people passing by giving the two of you strange looks. \"All these people are staring at us!\" She ran off, waving to you as she makes her way to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Right. I'll, errrr, see you later then I guess.\" You say, left alone with your thoughts to make your way back home. You too make your way to the exit and within a few minutes you're approaching your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So, you don't know how or why you have healing powers. You don't know how long you've had them and why they're only showing up now but your eager to test them out again. You can heal cuts so far, but what else can you heal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     First, you must decide who you will test your powers on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you were heading home you wondered just what you could do with this power, and how far you could take it.  You wanting to put anyone in danger, least of all Alyssa, so you decide to experiment on yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into your living room you see a note left by the TV.  \"Hi honey.  Joyce and I are having a girls day out see you in a few hours love mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, you're alone in the house, for a while at least, and can experiment.  You head upstairs to your room and close the door.  Going to your dressed you get out a pocket knife you keep there, and sit on your bed.  Opening it you sit down and gingerly run the blade across a finger.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Its sharp and cuts a slice into your finger, though not enough to draw blood.  You place your hand over the cut, there is a glow and the cut is gone.  \"Wow!\" you say to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut again, deeper this time, it hurts and the pain makes you stop.  Blood seeps out of the wound you cover it with your other hand.  The glow appears again and the pain disappears along with the cut.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what would happen if you cut it off, but you realize the pain would be intense.  Maybe too much, and there would be a mess.  You go to the kitchen, and get a meat cleaver, and some paper towel.  Sitting down at your desk you put your hand on the desk, with one finger stretched out.  Taking a deep breath you raise the cleaver, and chop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain explodes in your had as your finger is severed, you grab your had holding your stump, and the pain fades.  Grabbing the paper towel you clean off the blood to fine skin sealing your stump.  You didn't notice the glow because of the pain.  You pick up the finger laying on the desk, the glow starts and you see skin grow over the stump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't feel it though and now you have a new problem, if anyone came home, they would certainly freak out about you severed your finger.  You decide to try to put it back on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up you places it stump to stump and it joins on, the feeling from the tip rushing back into your mind.  This is great!  You can fix anything you do to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the cleaver back to the kitchen and rinse it off, and put it away.  Then you clean up the mess in your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what do you do?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you call Alyssa or do you tell you mom, or sister about what you can do?<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know she's probably still shaken up by the incident earlier but at least she's knows you have healing powers and might be more willing to go along with what you have planned next. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You dial her number. \"Hey Alyssa, feeling better?\" You ask her as she picks up the phone with a \"Helloooo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh I'm doing fine dear! Just a little scare is all. So what's up? You find out more about that neat healing power you got?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well that's the thing.\" You respond. \"I really doubt anyone would know how these powers work. I've gotta figure them out on my own. So... I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There was silence on the other end. \"You, want me yo help?\" Alyssa asked. \"Yeah. What I had in mind might hurt you.\" You say nervously. Are you really willing to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure! Whatever you want to do I'm down for it!\" Wait what? \"I've seen your healing in action so I'm pretty sure I can survive whatever you do!\" Okay she was sounding a little too enthusiastic about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow? Really?! I'll be over at your place then!\" You say with a bit of excitement as you bolt down the street to Alyssa's apartment. In no time at all your running in that Alyssa's kitchen where she's waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh there you are!\" She says hugging you. She's changed out of her old bloody clothes in to a tank top and short shorts. \"Ready to start??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow you really are ready to start aren't you- wait what are you doing?\" You start to say as Alyssa let's go of you and pulls out a large collection of knives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Welp what did you have in mind\" she asks all cute like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would mean going zero to sixty from a finger cut to... chopping off your arm...\" You say nervously, ashamed that you would even think about subjecting your girlfriend to such an ordeal. \"I doubt you even have a knife big enough to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And like that Alyssa pulled a large Machete out from under the counter you two are leaning on, slapping it down with a loud thump! \"I don't have a what now?\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Okay something's up. You seem way too eager to do this. Is there something I should know? Something, say, about any weird shit you might be in to-\" you start to say a bit excitedly with the shock of what your girlfriend is willing to do. \"Hold on.\" She starts to say with a pout \"You wanted to do this in the first place! Okay you got me, the idea of being cut up excites me a little... But only because I trust your healing powers. And I trust you.\" She said with a smile, batting her eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Not exactly put at ease by what she said, you grab a hold of the Machete and lift it up. \"You're really sure about this Alyssa?\" You ask one more time just to be safe. \"Ugggghhh!\" Alyssa moans in frustration, laying her arm flat on the table. \"I am 100% sure about this sweetie if not why would have I pulled out that gigantic freaking machere!?\" She whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well then.\" In one quick motion, eyes partially closed, you raise the machete high in to the air and bring it down on Alyssa's arm with all your strength. In one clean cut you sever Alyssa's forearm, an inch below her elbow, from the rest of her body. Blood, more than you were expecting, squirts from both her severed right arm and the fresh stump the arm used to be connected. You're in shock at just how it easy it was... how cleanly you cut through Alyssa's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You take a moment to look up at your girlfriend's face. She's not screaming in pain or anything, just staring in absolute shock at her arm laying limp on the table, the steady flow of blood still squirting out from both ends of her new wound. \"W-woah... did you just... is that my arm?\" She stammers, mouth agap. \"I... I don't even feel it. Why don't I...\" She raises the stump that used to be her forearm. \"O-oh... n-now I feel it. Ow ow oOOOWWW OWWW!\" She screams as the initial shock wears off, clutching what was left of her arm in pain. \"GAAHHH! IT HURTS! DO SOMETHING ALREADY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Quickly you leap in to action, grabbing your girlfriend's arm stump. \"Stand still I'm trying to fix it! STAY! STILL!\" You grab ahold of the stump, rubbing your hand over the wound amidst the flow of blood still pouring out of it. \"Please work please work please work...\" You say over and over. Like that, to your relief, your hand and your girlfriend's wound begin to glow bright. \"Alyssa look it's working!\" You say as skin starts wrap itself around the wound, a flat surface where an arm should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Alyssa, sweating nervously and laughing goes on \"Heheheee! Hey look it is healing! A-and it doesn't even hurt anymore!\" She feels her arm. \"It feels so weird... Hey! Go get the rest of my arm and heal it! What do you think it'll do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nervously you pick up the rest of Alyssa's arm, still bleeding and limp in your hands. \"Heal it? Just like that?\" you run your hand across the wound. To your surprise your hand and the arm begin to glow again. As the arm completely heals:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course I can't feel anything below my right elbow.\" She rubs her stump \"But it doesn't hurt at all anymore.\" She giggles \"I knew it would work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You smile back. This was definitely strange, scary even, but if it made your girlfriend happy then you were happy. \"Glad you're, errr, enjoying it. But what should we do about your arm? I mean it's still there. What do you want to do about it?\" You ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Alyssa thinks for a moment. \"Hmm... We could try and see if your healing powers can reattach limbs that have been cut off!\" She said. \"Who knows what else you can do!\" She says picking up her own arm and placing it back to its rightful place. \"Try it I'll hold my arm in place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You oblige of course.

She was a few years older than you but it didn't really matter to either of you. You were sure if there was anybody that would believe your newfound powers it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Marie didn't live too far from your own home. A few blocks down she had managed to nab a pretty decent house, what with how much her modeling agency was paying. Swimsuit models must make a killing you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     In no time at all you were knocking on her door. Shortly it is answered by a tall, beautiful woman with long, flowing black hair, a gorgeous curvy body, and the face of a lady at least 3 years younger than she really was. She had a pair of loose jeans on with a crop top tank-top, you could see she was also wearing a blue and white patterned Bikini underneath (She must be getting ready for work). A good combination of both cute and sexy. She was hogging all the beauty genes in the family you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oooh hey there cuz!\" Marie exclaims, wrapping you in a tight hug. \"Too tight too tight!\" You try to scream, your voice muffled from her massive chest. She giggles at your attempts, letting you go to take a few deep breaths. \"Well it's about time you come around for a visit\" She says, leading you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hehe, yeah. Been kinda busy lately. Especially with, eh, something that come up recently.\" You start to tell her, easing in to the story of how you discovered your powers. Marie takes a seat on a nearby chair facing you. \"Ahhh, would you like to tell me about this 'something' that happened?\" She asks you with genuine curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So you take a seat across from you. \"Well, you're not going to believe this Marie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You take your time explaining the events that went down earlier that morning. Going to the flea market with Alyssa, healing her wound, the glowing hands, all of it. Throughout the entire explanation Marie listened intensely, leaning forward more and more as you go over the details. She seemed really interested in your story where others would be calling BS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At the end of it she sat up and let out a little sigh. \"Well... I believe it.\" She says to your surprise. \"H-HUH?\" You ask her, making sure she wasn't mocking you or anything. Then again she wasn't exactly the joking type. \"For real I totally believe. You wouldn't be the first person in the family with the Healing Hands...\" She looks around, turning back to you as you stare at her in confusion. \"I-i'm not?\" You start to ask Marie. \"Nope! I promised not tell anyone else but since you have the same powers you deserve to know.\" She responded. \"Grandad had the exact same powers. He would show them off to me when we were younger. He fixed a lot of things I didn't like about my body... It's why I grew up to have this kind of body\" She sighed, patting her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No. Way.\" You say in excitement. You weren't the only one in the family that had these powers. Marie smiles, \"Yes way! Your powers work exactly like his. But just to be sure...\" She pondered. \"Let's try them out on me. It wouldn't be the first time after all!\" Marie says with excitement. \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"O-oh? Sure sure! What should we do then.\" You ask her, a little nervous. But you figure if it's been done before then whatever she asks for wouldn't be hard to pull off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How about you...\" </span></div></div>",

An old laundry sink is in a corner, though the washing machine is on the first floor.  There are boxes and old trunks piled up along the walls.  Marie opens a chest and removes a something long and curved wrapped in a fine blue cloth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask curious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe unwraps it to reveal a katana sword.  \"This has been in our family for years.  Grandpa gave it to me some year ago.\"  she hands it to you.  \"Its very sharp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unsheathe it partly, and in the light you see the folds in the steel.  It was real alright,  You are very nervous now, wondering what was it she wanted you to do to her. You had a guess though, but given you only just discovered your new powers, you hoped she wasn't going to suggest what you were thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is real I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, \"Grandpa used it on me a few times.\"  She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're really getting nervous, she was thinking of you chopping off something.  \"Wha... Wha...  What would you like me to do?\"  you stammer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chop off my head of course.\"  she smiled and a look of horror crosses your face.  \"Don't worry, you can heal me.\"  She fished out a large plastic tarp and unrolled it on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mine reals at this.  \"Have you been planning this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew someone in the family would have those same powers, so yes.\"  She smoothed out the tarp and knelt down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.  \"I don't know about this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just heal my head first, my body can wait.  If I can't talk just kiss me.  And you better stand behind me to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was wrong and freaky on so many levels.  \"Have you ever been beheaded before?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, how do you think I know about this stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you move behind her and in sheathe the sword completely.  \"Ok Marie here it comes.\" You raise the sword and swing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade slices through her neck like butter, bright red blood sprays out as her head drops to the floor.  Her body falls next to it continuing to spirt blood for a second or two.   You drop the sword and rush over to you cousin's head and pick her up.   Her eyes are closed, your hands begin to glow, and she wakes up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You really didn't want to hurt your cousin, but she insisted on you chopping off her head with that katana.  \"I'm just glad you're not dead.\" You say breathing heavily.  You tremble with horror at what you just did, from beheading your cousin, to healing her head with a touch of your hands.  I t takes a few moments to calm down.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you.  \"So am I.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any limitations to this power I have?\" you ask as you sit on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well If I'm dead for more that two or three days, it's sayonara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill remember that.  Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's basically it, my body can lie there for a while before you will need to heal it, whether I'm in control or not I can't say.  That sort of thing was always quirky.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so, what next?  I mean what else can I do to or with you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can chop off and attach other parts to my head, or body.  You can also attach new parts, from other people or fix parts to what ever you want.  You know make them prettier, change their shape or even blend mismatched skin tones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was news, I knew a little about science, and tissue matching.  If My power fixes that I wondered what else it could do.  \"How long can you remain a detached head?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indefinitely I think.  Grandpa said he was a lot older than he looked, and he had me detach him a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could that happen?\"  Your confusion growing with this new information.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My headless body seemed to be able to heal too, after it was revived.  But only while my head or other parts were detached.\"  Marie seemed sincere and clearly knew much more about this than you do.  And considering what you have witnessed so far, you have no choice but to believe her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever been detached for a long time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for more than a day, and if I can't feel my body while it's being worked on that's a plus.  But as I said sometimes I can. \"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a few minutes on this,  you know you have to revive her body, but would you let her chop your own head off if she offered?  And what happens if she's not in control then who is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been detached before, could you control your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not every time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened when your weren't in control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not quite sure, my body moved and even got up on its own.  It seemed to navigate ok too, though how it could with out eyes I don't know.  It could also respond to sound, and obeyed commands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woe that's sort of cool!\"   The possibilities began to filter through your mind, you could command her body to do anything.  or even Alyssa's.  Putting Marie's head down, you go to her headless body laying dead on the floor.  You lay your hands on her chest and they glow, her chest heaves with her first breath, and skin seals the stump. Her turns from blue to a healthy pink and she sits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Still you're relieved she's alive, then you remember what she told you and you kiss her.  \"See,\" she chokes out her voice horse, \"I'm ok now.\" her voice quickly gets stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you're alive,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too cousin.  Now you know your healing power is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe too great.\"  You look at her head held in your hands.  \"What's it like for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a severed head you mean?\"  You nod.  \"It's like this is all I've ever been, I don't feel horror at what just happened.  I think its your power, keeping me from panicking.  But not sure myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so what happens when I awaken your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well If I'm in control we could experiment farther, by switching heads or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and shake your head.  \"Ok now I'm curious.  How can we switch head if mine gets lopped off?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its something we found out playing around, grandpa and I.  You see while I'm headless, I can heal too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we could switch parts around.\" You think aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MmmmHmm, and add extra parts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An extra hand or leg, borrowed from someone of course, or even a head.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok like if I called Alyssa over her and cut her in half, I could add her upper half to her neck?\" you say not quite believing what you're hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would guess so, I saw grandma once with her head mounted on her hips walking around one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there mouth agape. You had no idea this sort of thing was even possible outside some sick fantasy world, and now you find, not only is it real but you could do it too.  \"How come I didn't know about all of this sort of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its kind of a family secret, since very few have had this power.  And most people find it a little frightening.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not to mention disturbing.'  You think silently.  \"This is like out of some sort of fairy story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked thoughtful for a moment.  \"There are fairy stories of people being severed heads, and still alive.  It could be that the healers that saved them from death, were members of our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder about that a moment.  \"Well id I'm going to experiment on you or anyone else I think I should do so in privet.  Ah why use a katana anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It cuts clean, for one thing, and you can cut through any part of a body.  It's a four body sword after all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four body sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Japan they would test these swords by stacking condemned prisoners on top of each other and cutting them in half.  that sword can go through four bodies before it stops.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other reason is we don't have a guillotine, which I think I would like for this sort of thing.\"  You look at her like she's grown a third eye.  \"Easier to control where the cut is going to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose I'd better get your body awakened.\"  You say getting up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Alyssa knows you can heal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not invite her over here?  You can experiment on the two of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's willing maybe.  But I'll have to restore the both of you before one of us has to go to work or something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, I know you're off the weekend, and so am I, but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa may not be.\"  You finish.  \"And we have to keep this thing a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are you going to do?\"  She asks.  'Good question.'   You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

YOU CAN ADD MORE CHAPTERS FOR MORE POINTS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is largely based on \"The Healer\", an interactive story now long gone where the main character had a magic kiss that could heal any wound no matter how serious. This story is no longer available and doesn't seem to be coming back so I've written this one as a spiritual successor with my own personal twists and touches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe set up: You (the main character) has recently awakened your hidden ability to heal wounds whenever you touch the affected area. Can be a light touch, a rub, or even a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these new powers you are eager to see how far you can go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Violence and mild gore is allowed. These wounds you will be healing have to come from somewhere after all.<br>\r\n2. Characters CAN be killed off with the reader being the only exception. IE what happens if you've reached the limits of your powers? Be creative though.<br>\r\n3. Swearing aloud. Make these characters feel real. Just don't be blatantly racist or hateful for the sake of it okay? <br>\r\n4. Sexual situations are allowed. Feel free to avoid them or feel free to go at it. Avoid being overtly abusive though<br>\r\n5. At it's most basic you have the power to heal wounds with a touch of your fingers, lips, hands, hell even feet. How these powers affect the target past that is up to you guys.<br>\r\n(Rules subject to change)<br>\r\n6. The main character is supposed to be you. Use neutral language to describe the main character so anyone can insert themselves in to the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters: (more will be added as the story goes on)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Main Protagonist. Adult age<br>\r\nThis is your self insert. This character looks and acts like you do. Can be female or male, whatever you prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa: Your girlfriend. 19 Years old<br>\r\nShe's been your gf for some time now. She will be the first person to see your power and the most eager to see what you can do with it. She's quite adventurous. Alyssa is of average height for a girl with red hair, decent bust, and shapely rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie: Your Cousin. 22 Years old<br>\r\nClose relative of yours. She is a swimsuit model with a gorgeous body and a cute face. She also seems to have some experience with the healing hands power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore to be added. </td>",
