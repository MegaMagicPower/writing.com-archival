Curious inhabitants approached these portals and a few even entered the portals. With a loud whoosh the inhabitants found themselves moving at high speed to a distant planet. On the distant planet whose day until then had been normal portals began to appear. Bizarrely the portals opened and exited in similar areas (desert to desert, jungle to jungle etc.) Much to the terror of the inhabitants on the exiting side was the giant animals coming out of the portals. To the 'giants' they were confused at their now shrunken surroundings.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the fun begins and where in the 'small' world are we?</span></div></div>",

Nobody was prepared for what was about to happen, as somewhere in the middle of the city a mysterious giant portal appeared. Suddenly something pops out of the portal as it closes with a loud sound, as everybody looked up they all uttered two words. \u201cA Doberman\u201d even though what they were seeing was plain as day the people still had troubles perceiving it, thoughts like how was this even possible crossed their minds. But one thought persisted over all else \u201cwhat is going to happen\u201d, as if answering the questions the giant raises his paw while all the people below look up with awe speechless. Then with speeds almost not matching it\u2019s incredible height it lowers the paw smashing it right in the middle of downtown. The resulting impact creating a shockwave that envelopes everything within range, then the 500 foot tall canine barks out which causes people all over the city to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog hasn\u2019t even noticed the people or even the city right underneath him, though the people didn\u2019t know whether that was a good or bad thing. The Doberman slowly lifts the other massive paw up and again puts it back down, this doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of effort is put into it but the effects on the world below is anything but harmless. And now with two massive craters and a whole lot of destruction underpaw he finally takes notice of the world below him, The giant dog...</span></div></div>",

As the massive Doberman looked down at all the tiny people and buildings a wicked grin appeared on its muzzle, this in turn caused the humans in the city to panic. The dog crushes an overpass with his humongous black paw pads, then with a loud deafening howl he smashes his muscled leg through a row of high rises. Licking his lips the Doberman crushes several cars in a parking lot, as the police start to show up he looks down to a blockade of police and SWAT cars with officers hiding behind cars and firing their pistols. Although the most the bullets can do is provide a minor annoyance about on par with a bug bite, growling menacingly the huge canine pounces down onto the blockade crushing the cars and officers in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly so as to enjoy the feeling of everything under his mighty paws, he stomps through the blockade watching the whole police force run from him. Then he walks over to where all the tallest buildings are, with every single step crushing multiple people and cars. You arrive in a short amount of time looking down at what was supposed to be the crowning achievement of the whole city, but as it was grand for human standards the dog couldn\u2019t help but think how pathetic it looked in his presence.

She has thick, soft purple fur a thick white mane of fur around her head. She carries her thick bushy tail curled up over her back. She loves to be given treats! All that feed her are friends. She loves to give sloppy kisses and hugs. Her belly is huge, she's over twice her ideal weight. She likes it that way. More room for treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment she was strolling along through a field the next there was a flash and she was in a different place! She looked around. The field was now covered in little houses, streets, cars and lights. In the distance she could see taller buildings. It looked like a normal city, but a toy sized one?! She had no idea that this was no toy city... Yet. She was now standing 750ft at the shoulders. Houses were barely half the height of one of her mighty paws. She yipped when she saw little creatures running about. They wore clothes, stood on two legs and had two arms like the masters back home. But they lacked their own fur, apart from on their heads and they was the size of bugs? Curious she lowered her head over a nearby group of these little creatures and sniffed. They screamed as her suction pulled them up towards her massive wet nose. A few even got sucked right up into her nose! She whined and sneezed violently. The creatures were jettisoned at very high speed with a liberal amount of snot. Their bodies crushed on impact with the ground and coasted in green slimy gunk. The ones who hadn't been sucked into her nose were blown away. Along with nearby cars. The car alarms blared and annoyed her ears! She lifted a paw and smashed it down on the cars, silencing them for good. Her paw let off a loud boom, shattering most windows within a few miles and alerting more to her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to flee in their cars, the streets soon gridlocked. Meanwhile she looked down at the group she had sniffed and sneezed upon. They looked like they needed to calm down.... A big sloppy lick should do the trick! She opens her maw and out slides her saliva coated tongue. The people scream at the sight of her open jaws over them. Her tongue slides out and with a heavy wet slap hits the street. Cracking it under its immense weight. The tongue slides at them people. They scream and run. But the tongue is to fast and wider than the street... Her tongue was 50ft wide! People stick to the great muscle and are dragged under it as it slides along, pulverising them instantly. The tongue leaves a trail of saliva, cracked tarmac, ripped up earth and crushed vehicles. The tongue returns to her maw and she yips. Where had the creatures gone?! But she now had treats to swallow. She gulps loudly and licks her chops. Yummy! If she licked them, they gave her treats! The fact the humans WERE the 'treats' didn't cross her primitive feral mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her head to study the area around her. The streets are packed with these lovely little creatures. Her tongue lulled, her belly rumbled in anticipation of treats. She also had so much more lovely sloppy kisses to give out! But where to head to first? There was so many choices! There was the highway, jam packed with tens of thousands of cars. The train station was quite busy, there was several trains at the station or just pulling away. Some taller buildings nearby more her height appeared to be full of these creatures. There was the very tall skyscrapers in the city centre and there was also the airport, lots of planes were taking off. She decided to head for... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She finally heads for...</span></div></div>",

She loved to chase them down, Lay on them with her big fat belly and slobber all over them, much to masters annoyance. But he always let her off and gave her treats. But master wasn't here, the train were packed with the little creatures who would surely reward her with treats? A chance to play and eat without being scolded?! She panted merrily as she strolled towards the train station. Her massive paws smashing apart houses and crushing many people and cars. She didn't notice, she was purely focused on the trains. Also she was under the belief that the little creatures would get out of her way. It wasn't her responsibility to step around them... So she ended up crushing thousands without a hint of malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people at the train station really start to panic when they see her stomping this way. Smashing her way through everything in her path. Some push onto the awaiting train whilst others run. The train driver sees her coming right for his train. He ignores the red light and opens the throttle. ''Come on!'' He cried as his heavily loaded train started to slowly accelerate away. The giant canine was still coming right at him. The beast was panting heavily and it's tail wagged. As it smashed on through the train station and came on after his train. Passengers screamed as the ground started to shake with her heavy paw steps. Overhead her fat belly blocked out the sky as she grunted and began to lay down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda had caught up with the train. Like with masters toy trains she would step ahead then lay down to pin it under her body. Then she would lovingly slobber over every carriage. Soaking them in drool. She rarely chewed. She groaned and laid down, expecting the usual result. But with a mighty thoom and quake her body slams upon the train and ground. She felt a crunch and yelped. Normally that doesn't happen. Confused she stood back up. The train was gone! Only a strange thin metal oozing blood was beneath her?! She whined. That wasn't fun! She wanted to lick it all over and get some treats! But another train is coming at her. She barks happily and lays down, waiting for it to approach her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver couldn't believe his eyes at first. Emerging around the tall buildings he had laid eyes upon a giant canine up ahead! He had seen the giant canine crush the other train. He slammed on the emergency brakes hoping to stop before the giant canine. Which had stood back up, studied the mess then spotted his train and laid back down. ''Please stop!'' He begged as his train approached the awaiting giant. His train passed the outstretched legs and stopped short of the beast's chest. A great maw and slobbering tongue fills his vision as he screamed in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train had stopped right before her muzzle! So thoughtful! She opened her jaws and released her tongue. SLURP! She dragged her mighty muscle lovingly over the locomotive. It groaned and collapsed under the assault. She licks over and over. It felt so good and she got a little treat in the process (the driver). Passengers started to fell out of the train. She saw this and brought her thick legs and paws together. To avoid being crushed the people had no choice to get back on the train. She held the whole train between her long and thick legs. There was no escape, all would be lovingly licked and slobbed upon. Oh and give her treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted her head to uncouple the locomotive and spit it aside. She brought her maw over the first carriage and wrapped her tongue around it. Slurping loudly her powerful tongue crushes the carriage in its tight and loving embrace. The windows explode and thick saliva oozes in. Passengers fall out and stick to the tongue. Andromeda swallowed constantly. So many tasty treats! So much to slob over. She continued to slob and suck over every carriage. All the passengers ended up in her fat belly. She finished the last carriage and dropped it. The train was a mangled mess covered in her thick saliva. She whined. The trains weren't usually so fragile. But she got to give out loving sloppy kisses and the creatures had given her loads of treats! It was time to find something else to slob over and to get more treats... She looked around for something else to interact with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue lulled out of her mouth oozing drool and tail wagged rapidly. If it wasn't for the destruction and deaths she would look quite cute. Andromeda finally sets her eyes upon...</span></div></div>",

Her ears pricked up and she looked at the stadium. She whined. What was causing this commotion. Surely not her, she may be big and powerful but she was just a big cuddly pup? She would have to help calm them all down it seems. She trotted towards the stadium, crushing dozens of cars without noticing. Her tongue lulled and tail wagging. She wanted to look as goofy and friendly as possible. Maybe if she calmed them down they would give her treats? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a great crowd of them running from the stadium before her.

She whined as she would of liked them to give more belly rubs. The creatures buildings looked like they would be nice to rub herself against. She looks around for a suitable building. Her tail wags and she yips happily when she sets eyes upon the perhaps structure. A building as thick as her body and even taller than her grabbed her attention.  The fact I was made of highly reflective glass added to it's attraction.. It was perfect! She strolled on over. Squishing many people under her paws without realising. The whole building shook as she came over. Inside people and furniture fly about as her paw steps reverberate throughout the structure. Built to withstand earthquakes the building is at no risk of collapse, nor does any of the glass break... Yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at the building and with a grunt she lifts up onto her hind legs. She brings her paws around the side of the building high up and with a great smash her paws grip either side of the building tightly. Shattering the extra tough glass with ease. Her paws sink in as she grips the structure. Many people are crushed by her paws of fall through the large openings to their deaths on the ground below. She shuffles her hind paws so her belly slams into the building. The glass cracks in places but manages to remain intact. She holds her head back, looking up into the sky as she also pants heavily as she hugs the building. She grunts and drags her belly up and down, grinding against the building. It groans in protest. Glass breaks in places. The building constantly shakes as she lovingly hugs it. People struggle to flee from the structure. But they start piling out of the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people watch with shock and awe from within their offices. The belly of the canine like a great fluffy curtain. The view of the city now a wall of thick purple fur. The windows cracked and shattered under the immense pressure. The canine's heavy panting audible over her groans and the groans of the building. Outside people who chose the wrong exit had to run under her. Her massive hind paws shifted slightly as she rubbed against the building. There was also the falling debris to content with. But out of desperation many run under her. Some made it, overs were hit by falling shards of razor sharp glass which acted like swords. Furniture was also falling out of the building. Her teats had penetrated a little deeper, and were tearing through floors as she dragged her body up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people who had ran under stopped to look up at her. They was greeted with the sight of her massive fluffy butt cheeks and thick legs. Her thick tail curled up and wagged slowly, revealing her two holes. Her wrinkled tailhole puckered occasionally. Her vagina was small and dry, she wasn't close to being in heat. They gawped up in shock and awe. Some even took out there phones and filmed her hind wriggling about over them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda was lost in ecstasy. The building was so fun to hug! It groaned in protest at her hug but it held. She looked about as she continued her hug. Something catches her attention, There was little creatures standing right under her lovely big fluffy butt! She grinned and wriggled her backside. Giving a little show. After belly rubs she always loved a good butt scratch and it looks like these creatures wanted to give her one! She released the building as she let her hind legs slide aside, dropping her sexy big butt on them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people scream as her butt comes over them. Staying to take photos was not such a good idea after all! They ran but it was to late. WHUMPF! Her butt slams onto the ground. Crushing many under her cheeks. Two unlucky people were not squished but instead ended up her anus! She moaned with pleasure as she could feel the struggles within her arse! She couldn't believe this, so much pleasure all in such a short time. She was really loving this new place and she had so much to explore! She for now sat contently and let the creatures wriggle within her arse. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the 'massage.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in pleasure she hadn't noticed the ________ approaching her at first!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw blue and red flashing lights from down one street. Soon the wailing things appear with the blue and red lights flashing on top. She was now very interested in these wailing things. She releases her butt toys. They were alive, but covered in shit and had a few broken bones. She started to approach them slowly. She cocked her head with curiosity as she approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReports of the giant canine demolishing the city had been believed as a joke at first. Until the police had seen her first hand. Unsure what to do they had waited until a sizable amount of them had gathered. It took a while, the streets in grid lock. They had to guide people out of the city. The canine having been left on her 'rampage' they now headed for her. She was demolishing a building by wrapping herself around it seemed. Equipped with shotguns the convoy of fifty police vehicles emerge down the street from the giant canine. She was sat by the building now, which was damaged but still standing. She was grinding her backside against the ground and groaning contently. She stood up, two people dropped out of her rear, covered in a brown substance often found in bottoms... ''Set up here! Weapons out!'' Ordered the commanding officer. The police pile out of their vehicles and aim their shotguns at her. She was coming at them slowly. The ground shook under each of her steps, they waited for the order to fire. In total there was five hundred of them. Could they stop these monster? They wasn't sure but they had their duty to do. The army was expected to arrive soon as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her amazement hundreds of the little creatures emerge from the wailing flashing things. They all pointed black sticks up at her. She lulled her tongue and wagged her tail. Sticks? Did they want her to play fetch?! She was always happy to play games! She growled playfully and slammed down into a play bow. The ferocious impact knocked many of them over and the wailing things. Huge fissures tore up the street and levelled nearby buildings. The creatures stood back up shouting and aiming their sticks at her.  Their sticks started to pop and burst fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, do the guns hurt her or is her fur to thick to penetrate with standard weaponry?    </span></div></div>",

Before arriving here she had drunk quite a large quantity of water and now it wanted to come out! She was going to have to take a leak. But she wasn't just going to squat down any where! How gross! She looked for a suitable place to relieve herself. Buildings crumbling as she casually strolled through them. She stepped on humans without the slightest notice. She looked to an fro for a peeing spot. But all she could see were buildings, streets, humans and raised light transit systems. She whined again as she was now gagging to piss. But with a happy bark she sees a suitable place. There appeared to be a 'burrow' that went under the ground. She could see humans going down there. She bounded on over to the hole and sniffed. She could smell many humans but also waste. Maybe this is where they went to relieve themselves? She'd be a very good girl and pee here, in the right place! She turned around and squatted over the hole. Shifting her paws as she got her rear in the correct position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the subway many hid from the giant stomping about above. her heavy  paw steps echoing throughout the tunnels and stations. The lights flickered as the power supply was disrupted with every step. Years of collected dust fell from the ceilings as she stomped about. The trains had stopped, the constant power disruptions disabling them. Many had derailed thanks to the quakes created by her foot steps. On one station they could hear her right overhead. Cowering in fear the humans prey she would move on. But the paw steps stop and it goes quiet. A few brave people ascend the stairs to look outside. They were greeted with the sight of her gigantic fluffy backside looming over them. The air reeked of smoke and fire. All around was destruction. Demolished buildings, crushed cars, downed powerlines and fire hydrants gushed out great geysers of water. Her vagina winked and she let off a loud grunt. The people scream and run. Smart ones run onto the devastated streets. Not so wise ones run back into the subway. A stream of red hot, highly corrosive and green stinky piss erupts from the canines vagina. Thousands of gallons of the canines waste envelops those on the stairs, they were almost instantly killed. Bones shattered by the powerful stream but worse their flesh was burnt off in seconds.  The tsunami of lethal piss splashes onto the platform. Smashing through pillars, ticket booths, gates the piss was unstoppable. It envelops thousands and eats away at the station. The track and concrete walls even start to dissolve in the potent piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda groaned as she pissed into the opening. It was a perfect shot and it felt so good to relieve herself. And she was being a clever girl by peeing where the creatures would! Her tail wagged as she completely emptied her gigantic bladder. She thought she heard muffled screams, but she must of imagined it. She finished urinating and stood back up. Her pee was quite stinky. It may even attract a male. She wondered if more of her kind were about? Her thoughts interrupted by a loud crash as some nearby buildings collapsed without warning! She strolled over to investigate. The ground had caved in beneath these buildings. Within the crater of rubble was a large quantity of her piss. She must of overfilled the creatures latrine. Oh well, at least she was relieved now. But then she felt something from her anus. She now need to defecate! She whined as she would have to find a place to drop her logs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more she strolled on, looking for a place to shit. She wasn't going to do it anywhere. She was a good girl and would do it in an appropriate place. She saw the perfect spot to take a dump. The river. She walked on over, carving another trail of destruction. By the river was a ferry terminal. Which was busy with fleeing people. Most ferries had left. The last was just about to depart when she approached. She stomped onto the terminal and watched the ferry as it pulled away. There was plenty of creatures onboard. She may play with them in a minute. But right now she really need to shit. She turns around and squats down, positioning her butt over the river and ferry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the ferry panic as they saw the giant canine approach. The ferry's captain saw her coming and quickly he ordered the ferry to depart. But as they had barely pulled away the giant smashed through the terminal and looked down at them. Her tongue lulled with great brown puppy eyes looking at them lovingly. But she turned and presented her rear. Her tailhole was huge and with a grunt a giant turd appeared. People jumped overboard as it looked as though the turd would hit the ferry. The great logs breaks free and with a loud splash it land in the water. Just metres from the ferry. It sank quickly but also produced a great wave. Many were swept over board. Some who had jumped before the turd drop ended up being crushed under the great turd. She dropped two more logs, splashing the ferry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda groaned as she squeezed out the third and final turd. She turned to study the water. Her logs had sunk into the river. The ferry was untouched, apart from being splashed with water. Many of the creatures had jumped into the water. She looked down at them and barked to say hello cuties! She wasn't to keen to wade about in water. But she could always make an exception. She really wanted to play with these creatures and the ferry! She briefly looked back at her trail of destruction the scent of her piss filled the air. Maybe a male or another of her kind  would join her soon? She thought nothing of the death and destruction she had caused. It was time to play!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared to step into the river...   </span></div></div>",

She turned to face her trail. She could see him in the distance. He had a great black coat. His eyes a deep blue. He was following her trail. He was coming to her! He was stunning. Whilst she was over weight he was athletic and bulging with muscle, not fat. His claws long and sharp. His mane was braided in several in places. His top canines jutted out of his mouth like sabres. He must of been used by a warrior. She was only kept as a companion. She waited for him to approach her. She wagged her tail and lulled her tongue as he raised his head to look at her. He stopped following her trail and instead ploughed a new trail of destruction through the city. He tore through buildings effortlessly, his razor sharp claws easily sliced through steel and his bulging muscles propelled him through concrete as though it was tissue paper. Thousand more were killed by him, he couldn't care less. He was a warrior, he'd killed many in his lifetime and he had no second thought a about snuffing out bugs. His thick pads soon coated in debris and blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped by her pool of piss to sniff it. Andromeda watched him intently. He grunted and cocked his hind leg. Revealing his thick sheath and massive testicles. He started to piss atop her pool. Flooding the crater and nearby streets. His piss reeked. He was a big male and of course he had to mark everything that he considered his. She rolled her eyes. Males, so predictable! But his piss did smell good and he was so strong and sexy! She started to walk towards him. Tail wagging and tongue lulled. He stopped and stared at her. She submissively lowered her ears and crouched a little. She knew he was above her in status. He growled at her, baring his fangs. She yelped and laid down. Crushing a few buildings under her fat belly. He glared down at her, fangs still bared and he growled continuously. She whined at him and gave him her puppy eyes expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male who is called Orion and used as a mount by a warrior finally acts towards Andromeda. He _______ her.</span></div></div>",

He flicked his tail as he walked through some nearby buildings, levelling them with his mighty paws and legs. He snarled and lowered his head and with a loud chomp  snapped up some people in the street. Andromeda whined as she watched him. Clearly he wasn't interested in her nay more and he was not being very nice to the little creatures. She stood up and decided to leave him to it. She turned back to the river. The ferry was a short distance away, but she'd easily be bale to catch up with it. She stepped into the river, being careful not to step on her submerged turds. She produced small waves, as she was being so careful not to produce tsunamis. To her amazement the river only just submerged her paws, It was so shallow! But it would be easy for her to wade on through. She waded after the ferry, tongue lulled as she prepared to show it some love and affection. And all the little creatures on board would give her even more treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the ferry sighed in relief when they saw the giant canine turn away from them as something else caught her attention. The heavy thumps and quakes indicating there was another giant out there! Soon they saw a great muscular black furred male canine approach her. Panicking that they was about to be set up by two giants. The female approached the male who growled at her. She was all submissive and even laid down. The male soon turned away and stomped off elsewhere. Leaving the female alone. She turned and started to approach them. Screams of panic filled the ferry as the great fat female stepped into the river and she started to wade after them. She was gaining fast. Some jumped over board. They didn't get far as she stepped on them or drowned them with the waves her steps were making. The rest ran into the ferry, hoping that would save them. Her great paws land beside the ferry. Rocking it violently and splashing great waves into the sides. People were thrown about violently. Bashing into the walls, chairs, each other. The coxswain who had been gunning the engines to max was knocked clean out. His limp body pulling the throttles back to idle. The ferry was going nowhere, it was trapped between two thick legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda panted down at the ferry. She had caught it between her forepaws. It was no longer trying to get away. It was all hers to play with! It was so small, only being 90ft long, or shorter than one of her paws! She found it quite cute, a big sloppy kiss was in order she thinks! Lowering her head she released her tongue and slapped it onto the ferry. Crushing the small bridge in the process. Her saliva oozes all over the ferry, it dribbles down all the windows and even pour within. Much to the passengers disgust. She could fit it in her mouth is she wanted.... Yes, she would scoop into her mouth! She carefully laid down and opened her jaws wide she shoved her tongue into the water under the ferry and with ease she lifted the vessel up upon her slobbering tongue. Her tongue and the ferry withdraw into her maw. She sealed her jaws, surrounding the ferry in darkness.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passengers screamed as there was loud wet slap and the roof groaned as something heavy drags over it. Thick drool oozed down the windows and through the doors. ''She's licking us!'' Someone cried as the drool started to ooze into the ferry. It pooled around people. Some of whom stood on chairs to avoid the thick sticky stuff. But worse was to come the canine backed up and laid down. She somehow produced no wave but there was worse to come. Her massive jaws appear wide apart and showing off the huge cave that was her mouth! Her tongue slides out and dives into the water. ''She's going to eat us!'' Screamed a lady but before anybody could attempt to flee the tongue comes up under the ferry, rocking it violently upon the squishy saliva coated muscle. The tongue takes them back into the maw. Rancid hot dog breath fills the air. The jaws close around the ferry and plunges them into darkness. They was trapped in the ferry in the maw of a giant fat canine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda moaned as she lovingly pushed the ferry into her hard ridges. She slurped her tongue all over it and much to her delight she started to receive treats! This ferry was even more fun to play with than the train. She wished master would invest in model boats, then she could have them to play about with too! But she was a little to rough. The windows shattered, the super structure collapsed under the immense pressure her tongue was applying. All the passengers and crew ended up being devoured. The ferry was a twisted mess. She stuck her tongue out to study it. It was unrecognisable to her and she was not getting any more treats. She whined and spat the slobbery wreckage out. She looked about for a larger more stronger boat to interact with. She yips happily when she spots just the vessel...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quite the attraction and a colossal overweight canine had her eyes set right on it. She waded on over tongue lulled and tail wagging furiously. It was the perfect size for her! Unlike the little ferry that was smaller than a paw she could practically lay on the aircraft carrier with room to spare! The people on board had been watching her as she stomped about the city and then entered the river to wreck the river ferry. They screamed and ran. But her heavy paw steps had shaken away the gangplanks. They were trapped on the carrier as she soon loomed over head. She gazed down at the carrier and eyed up the aircraft and humans. She was panting merrily. Blobs of drool splattering everywhere. She lowered her head and used her tongue to scoop up a fighter jet. Playfully she nommed on it then spat the mangled wreck out. She was just being playful, no harm in playing with toys, right?! But she wasn't just going to nom the aircraft. She had another plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carrier was the perfect size to lay on! She stepped over it, positioning it between her legs. It was long enough but her great fat belly was wider. But she should be able to lay upon it comfortably. She lowers herself onto the vessel. With a crash her fat belly crushes the island and soon all the aircraft under its sheer bulk. Many people were squished. She groaned contently as she fully laid on the deck. Her great weight pushing the carrier into the water. She panted contently as she slowly pushed the carrier into the water. Already the lower decks were flooded. People drowning within the dark interior as the power was knocked out. She was oblivious to the carnage beneath. As far as she was concerned she was giving a harmless 'hug' to the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the carrier hit the bottom. Now her body began to press down on the ship, crushing one deck after another after another. Within moments she found her self lying in the water. She whined. The ship should of kept her dry. But it had vanished! She stood up and looked around, confused. How could something so big vanish?! She didn't realised it was now a compressed sheet of metal upon the riverbed beneath her gigantic fat belly. She stepped back upon dry land, crushing the carriers visitor centre and many hiding people. She grumbled and shook the water off of her belly and legs. Covering many nearby buildings. She looked into the city and yipped. Whilst she had been messing about in the river more giant canines had appeared apart from her and Orion, the muscular male who had ignored her ten minutes ago. She could see at least six others now. One of whom was coming her way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda is about to be joined by another giant dire wolf to accompany her on exploring the little city. What character shall be joining her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nugget - A golden brown furred male. Who is even fatter than Andromeda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Shadow - A black coated young male. Muscular but less so than Orion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Altair - A white and black coated female. Long mane, feathered paws and tail fur. Used in shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Fang - A grey coated old male. A grumpy aging Warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Mila - A pure white female. She has a thick silky lion like mane.  </span></div></div>",

But by larger not only was he taller he had a far wider girth to match and he had a truly huge fat belly, that made her look slim! She wagged her tail and lulled her tongue. What a sexy beast, just her sort! She even glimpsed his naughty bits. Two large fluffy orbs swinging majestically between his chubby hind legs and a long thick mound in front. He looked at her briefly as he started to approach. She watched him intently. She yipped when he lowered his head to the street below. He was panting heavily. Great blobs of drool spilt onto the street below. Covering many humans. But what amazed her the most was his steps. She just walked through the buildings. He was carefully stepping over them, his gigantic paws slowly came down on the street. Giving humans time to flee from under them. Lightly they touched down. Crushing cars with ease and cracking the tarmac. But nothing more. Apart from a light thud and crunch his paw steps hardly made a sound. It made his progress slow, but non deadly. He lovingly panted over all the humans beneath his head as he passed overhead. The worse he done directly to humans was drool on them, but it was only done lovingly. His tail, thick and curled up over his back like Andromeda wagged rapidly from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had a pair large leather bag hanging over each flank. Clearly he was used to carry things for his master. Andromeda still watched him intently, waiting for him to reach her. She yipped when he stopped and used his tongue to pull up a bus. He took the bus back and dropped it into one of the bags. He brought his head back to the street as he scanned it closely. Still drooling excessively. He licked up a few more vehicles. A Yellow Taxi, a white mail truck and red sports car were carefully picked up and dropped into the bag. No doubt damaging them despite his gentle handling. He stopped over a crowd of humans and whined at them. They screamed and ran. But he tipped his head on it's side and scooped them up with his tongue. Unlike Andromeda who had dragged her tongue over thousands crushing them instantly his sideways lick was non lethal. Though the humans were now stuck to the massive saliva soaked muscle. He carefully took them to the other bag and dropped them in! He strolled on. Stopping to collect more humans and vehicles. Which he kept separate. Despite being focused in the street below his head he still managed to not damage any building or kill a single human. He was a true gentle giant. Like Andromeda he loved to give hugs and sloppy licks but he was well aware of his great bulk, he never wanted to hurt anybody or thing. He always checked there were no insects under him before lying down or walking through. Though in a new exiting place he wasn't going to break his habit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he clears the buildings and walks on up to Andromeda. She looked up at him, whining. He also whined as he lowered his head to her. They sniffed at each other and released there tongues. With a loud wet slap they slap together. Saliva splatters everywhere, covering many nearby buildings and vehicles. As the two giants 'kissed' Their tails wagged furiously. They eagerly curled there tongues  around each other and squeezed. Waves of pleasure shot through both canines. It was the first time they'd met another overweigh canine of the opposite sex. They would make good mates... Releasing each others tongues they step back and admire each others body. Nugget grins as he carefully pulled the bags of humans and vehicles off of his large leather harness. The bags had handles for him to carry them and flaps to cover the contents. He carefully set them aside on an empty car park and covered them so the humans couldn't get out. Then he turned his attention back to Andromeda. Now he didn't have the humans to worry about he could interact a bit more lively with her...      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda and Nugget both engage in....</span></div></div>",

His backside held high in the air, his thick tail wagged rapidly as he lulled his tongue, oozing long strands of saliva. Andromeda grinned and barked once. Nugget turned and with a grunt pushed off the ground. His four paws ripping up large chunks of earth as he leapt into the river. With a mighty splash he landed. Producing four large waves that rippled out in all directions. 'Luckily' for the little humans there was no boats, ships or swimmers close to the two fat canines. He started to wade rapidly through the water. Looking playfully over his shoulder at Andromeda. She barked and leapt after him. Producing four smaller waves. The worse that happened was some flooding on the streets. But few people were left in the area, having already fled or been lapped up by Nugget. The two giants were playing chase. Andromeda followed after Nugget. Admiring his large fluffy backside as they ran. His cheeks were even fluffier than hers, she was a little jealous of that but what really grabbed her attention was the two giant orbs swaying about between his thick hind legs. They smacked loudly against the thighs as they swung wildly back and forth. She drooled at the sight of those balls. He would be a good mate. When she came into season next. She couldn't wait! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda slowly caught on Nugget. She released her tongue to 'tag' him. She aimed for his massive sacks. With one push she reached them. Giving them a good sloppy lick! Nugget moaned contently and turned. Time for him to chase her! He'd loved her lick on his privates. His time to lick her naughty bits! He ran after her, easily keeping up. He let her stay ahead. To admire her backside like she had with him. He couldn't wait for her to come into heat. Her vagina was dry and small. Not ready for mating. But he still wouldn't say no to a taste! He released his tongue and gave her vagina a sloppy lick. Andromeda came to a halt and howled out with pleasure. Nugget moaned and thrust his tongue in deeper. She groaned and squeezed his tongue as it penetrated deep. Her vagina was soon well lubricated with liberal amounts of drool. Nugget withdraws his tongue and savours her flavour. She turned to face him. She barked and he obliged. Turning he ran again. With Andromeda in hot pursuit. She once again aimed for his balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever their game of play chase is about to be interrupted. What is the interruption? </span></div></div>",

He barked and headed right for the ship. His tongue lulled and tail wagging furiously. He could smell thousand of humans within, he really had to go and say hello! He forgot about the game of chase. Andromeda right behind him and oblivious to the novel object that had attracted Nugget's attention. In just a few leaps he was just a few steps away from the cruise ship. He could smell the humans fear. He of course loomed over the vessel, he would have to put on his best puppy dog behaviour. He was really a very big friendly boy after all. He came to a halt and was about to put on his act when... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped as Andromeda ploughed right into his backside! She had not been prepared for him to come to a complete stop. Her head goes under his privates, lifting his hind into the air whilst slamming down his front. She to yelped as she was pinned under the males privates. The impact released a tsunami that slammed into the cruise ship side (they had approached from the ship's port side). The ship was violently keeled to starboard. Those on deck were washed overboard by the wave. Within people and furniture tumble violently onto the starboard side of the vessel. It looked like it was going to roll right over Poseidon style, but luckily it was left at a severe list. People were hopelessly trapped against the walls. The floor angle to steep to climb. The furniture was piled on them. Everybody was injured by the impact. Several were knocked out but luckily there was no fatalities. Several people were in the water, looking up at the ship tipping towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget realised the ship was in danger. It had to help! He got up off of Andromeda, who gasped as her head had been forced under the water by his heavy backside. He quickly lifts a massive paw over the starboard side of the ship and carefully places it on the side. With a grunt he pulled the ship upright. Handling the hundred thousand ton vessel like a sack of feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin all the people could see was a giant paw pad coming at them. They screamed in terror but with a soft thump the pad just covered the windows as the gigantic canine pulled the ship back upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget having righted the ship spots the people in the water. He lowers his large head and released his giant wet tongue. The people screamed as his tongue curled under them and lift them up out of the water. Thinking they was about to be swallowed to their shock the canine carefully drops them back on the deck of the ship. He doesn't stop until everybody he fell into the water was back on board. Safe and sound. Apart from being wet and soaked in his thick saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd finished his rescue mission. Nugget lowered his head and sniffed at the humans. Making sure none were injured. He whined softly as he smelt their fear. They didn't need to be afraid, he was their friend! He laid down and gave his best puppy eyes expression. He held his muzzle inches from the ship. Hoping one of them would give it a scratch. Much to his delight one man bravely approaches him and reaches out. Nugget moaned contently as he felt the little hands stroke his fur. Soon more people approach and stroke his muzzle. He groaned and lulled his tongue. Oozing long trails of saliva into the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising the giant canine was friendly. His action so far proving so, many people pluck up the courage to approach and stroke his presented muzzle. But soon there was to many people and not enough muzzle! Nugget realised this. He would have to present more of himself. His great fat belly should do! Carefully he turned and with the upmost of care he rested his belly alongside the ship. Like a great mountain of fur. The people stroked at it. His warm soft fur enveloping them. Waves of pleasure shot through his body. He couldn't believe this! He groaned constantly. Andromeda watched Nugget intently as he saved the ship and passengers. They were rewarding him with strokes! She had to have in on that! She came up alongside the other side of the vessel and rested her belly alongside. Sandwiched between giants. The passengers were spoilt for choice. They brought their heads together and once again kissed. Thrusting their tongues together and into each others mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed with the ship for half an hour. loving every second of the contact. But they soon had to get moving. They carefully backed away from the ship. Andromeda had really liked that, she would try to more like Nugget in her interactions from now on. Apart from many videos of destruction. Ones of love and care would go on from the giant fluffy pair. They look for their next destination...   </span></div></div>",

The smoke irritated both of their noses. They snorted and waded on further out to sea. Nugget started to approach another ship. Andromeda barked at him. She wanted to see what lies further down the coast. The large male whined but obeyed. He walked alongside her so that he could see what lies ahead. A few boats were in their path. Carefully they stepped over the boats. The people on board bravely (or foolishly) filmed the giants as they approached and passed right overhead. Those under Andromeda only getting shots of her belly. But Nugget being a very well endowed male presented a further view. His musky and massive genitals pass with just inches to spare in some cases. The people choking on the musk or trying to push the giant bits away. Which was a futile effort due to their extreme weight and the fact it sent waves of pleasure through Nuggets massive body. Nugget was loving it, he made sure to pass over as much boats as possible for a cheeky genital stroke. Both their tails wagged rapidly, producing strong gale like winds that blew the people into the water, but nobody was seriously injured by the two canines. They wade on, following the coast away from the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they walk alongside cliffs. Chalk white and around 500 ft tall, or half Nuggets height. The cliffs were nothing to the two canines. Though they could see humans walking along the top. Beyond the cliffside walks they could see jam packed roads and small villages. The small villages deeply interested the two giants. But they would rather find a bigger settlement to explore. There must be another untouched one further along the coast! Eagerly they wade on. Looking ahead for the sight of a city or at least a town. They encounter a few more boats. Nugget making sure each one ended up giving him a cheeky rub down under. He got a little carried away, his fat pink tip poked out of its sheath. Andromeda saw this and lowered her head to give it a slobbery lick. Much to his delight! But they had to find more humans, kinky fun could come later... On they walk, his slobber coated dick returning to its sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their nostrils start to bring in the scent of thousands upon thousands of humans. They also could smell buildings and vehicles. They was so close to reaching another large human settlement! They pant heavily and lull their great slobbering tongues as they ran around a cliff to face a large bay with a ______________. </span></div></div>",

Most of the buildings were tiny, not even passing the top of their paws! There was the odd tall building. But even the tallest wouldn't reach past his ankle! How cute! The two giants thought as they made their approach. People started to panic and flee at the sight of the two approaching giants. Reports from the city and across the globe showed cities being razed by giant creatures. Evacuations were already underway but were about to ramp up for the town. The only way out were four roads that left the valley the town was situated in. Already at near gridlock. People took to running on foot, as if they could outrun any giants that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful not to flood the city with thee wavs their paws produced they had to slow right down for the last few steps. The town had a large sandy beach. Now it was covered in abandoned towels, wind breakers, and a few people who were to shocked to run or had some weird macro fetish and were coming to 'welcome' the giants. One crowd waved up at the biggest, Nugget. He looked down at the crowd, panting heavily. Drool splattering around them. ''Eat me!'' Cried one man as the giant canine opened his jaws over them. Andromeda watched Nugget intently as he lowered his head at the humans. He turned his head on its side and obligingly lapped up his willing 'snacks' though he was of course not going to eat them. He moaned contently as he sealed them in his mouth and swished them about, gently. Well to him gently but it was like being stuck in a stormy sea for the humans. Slathered in drool, bashed into his teeth and hard roof ridges... Some how no breakages or accident swallows occurred. Andromeda having watched Nuggets catching technique decided to try it out herself. Finding another willing crowd she lowered her head and tipped it on its side. Releasing her tongue she curled it around the humans. As opposed to dragging it over them, which was always fatal (but unknown to her). She was surprised not to receive treats for the lick but now she had the sensation of wriggling humans on her tongue! She sealed them in her jaws and let them wriggle. She moaned contently as waves of pleasure filled her body. This felt so good! No tasty treats but a pleasurable experience instead, she should of done this from the start! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget went to spit the people out into his bag... Oh no! He'd left it in the last city! He whined, he wanted to keep these humans for later. He could carry them on his back but they might fall off. Oh well he reluctantly lowered his head and spat them out. Leaving them in a pool of his saliva. He whined at them as to say sorry for not keeping them. He looked at Andromeda. Who had a mouthful of humans and she seemed to be enjoying the experience greatly. He barked at her. She whined and like him spat the humans out. He didn't want her to go to far and hurt them. Now they looked at the town and it's panic stricken populace The strong scent of fear hit their nostrils. Nugget really did not like the scent at all. They should be happy to see them, not scared! He and Andromeda had already given some love to some of the humans. They had much more to give! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget stepped forwards, planting a paw on the beach. The warm soft sand felt so good. But he had to move on. He looked into the town and whined. The streets were tighter here. He couldn't make a step without causing damage. He was well to soft natured to even think of just bulldozing through, how rude that would be! Andromeda could fit however, thanks to her slightly smaller stature. She stepped on in. Whilst in the city she had been rude and walked on through buildings now she knew to take care. She let people run before planting a paw. She lowered her head and started to lovingly lap up people non lethally. Poor Nugget felt left out. But then he saw the roads leading out of the town. He could walk around and interact with the humans there! He turned and quickly bound around the outskirts of the town. He reached the road, which was at total gridlock now. Seeing him people abandoned their cars and ran of foot. Making it easy for him to lap them up. He lowers his head and slurps up hundreds. All getting a good slobbering in his maw before people released. None would get away, he would slob them all lovingly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda meanwhile steadily walked across the town. She was slobbering over anybody she could catch. Like Nugget, she would leave none un slobbed! Within an hour thousands of people were slathered in drool. Only a few who had hidden in the buildings escaped the sticky and wet canines maws. Having had their 'fun' with the town they walked on once more. Heading inland. They followed a road, lovingly turning it into a drool soaked mess as they went. Soon the road takes them to... <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

But Nugget whined as he wanted to fetch his two bags full of humans and vehicles. The larger male wins the argument. Andromeda reluctantly follows. The traffic still at a standstill, mainly as they city they was heading for was pretty much destroyed. Still the two giant lowered their great heads to give everyone a sloppy lick.

They watched a lankily built canine with long fur and feathering strut along over a road. Her paws kicking up clouds of dust but squishing nothing. Clearly used in conformation shows the canine was showing off to the humans below. A old male, grey furred was lying across a road. In his mouth was a bus. Which he was casually slobbering all over. Under his paws and belly were humans, pinned down but not crushed amazingly. Orion, the big muscular male was going down another road. Stomping on every car and swiping at humans. His claws red with blood! Andromeda growled, how disgusting! Nugget whined, he didn't like it but he was not the fighting  type. Andromeda wanted to go sort Orion out, but Nugget refused to fight. She growled with annoyance. Nugget quickly headed into the city towards where he'd left his bags. Andromeda followed, but was still itching for a fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke stung their eyes and nostrils. They were terrified of the fires, having to take long detours around the ruined city. The streets gone, buried under rubble from levelled buildings. The odd paw print was visible. As well as patches of blood. The sight saddened the two giants, especially the every gentle Nugget. But he had to rescue the humans in his bag! Soon they reached the docks. The bags were still there, un burnt. But are the contents of the bags still there? </span></div></div>",

The fur strands and saliva indicating who had eaten the humans. Orion! Andromeda whined when she released what happened. Nugget backed up and lifted his head slowly. He threw back his head and let off along sad howl. Andromeda joined him. Singing their sorrow together. Once the howl had finished Nugget turned around and Snarled viscously. Andromeda yelped. The mellow gentle giant was pissed, big time! His fangs glistening with his saliva, he chomps angrily and charges. He was heading right for Orion. He smashed through the remains of the city without care. He hurt no humans, they were all dead or gone. Even raging infernos who smashed through. Andromeda ran after him, but struggled to keep up with the larger incensed male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget cleared the city and tore up the earth between him and his target Orion. Orion was to focused on nomming up a bus load of humans to notice the great furry enraged mass barrelling towards him at high speed. He finally took notice of Nugget. But to late. He'd barely stood up when millions of tons of flesh slams into him at hundreds of miles an hour. The violent impact threw Orion hundreds of feet. With a violent quake his body slams into the ground. Kicking up a great cloud of dust and shaking the ground violently. He slides along due to the momentum, but is stopped by Nuggets fangs clamping onto his ruff. Nugget pulled his head back, easily lifting Orion. He threw the muscular male over his back. Orion yelped as he somersaulted through the air. But he managed to land on all fours with a heavy thump. Nugget turned to face him. The two giants snarled viscously at each other.

Nuggets fat belly absorbing the impact whilst Orion's tough muscular build absorbed the impact. They ferociously snapped at each others muzzles. Nugget yelped as Orion's fangs bit into his muzzle. Blood oozed from the puncture wounds but he shook his muzzle free and returned the favour. Sinking his fangs into Orion's muzzle. More blood sprays. Their huge forepaws slash and push at each other. They remained standing up on their hind legs as they grappled, slashed and bit each other. Blood flowing down their coats and onto the ground. Andromeda whined at the sight, she didn't want to interfere. Nearby giant canines and even humans watched the two beasts fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were also trying to push the other onto their back. Finally Nugget with his sheer bulk pushes Orion back. Orion yelped as his hind paws slid out from under him and he fell onto his back. With a mighty thump his body slams onto the ground. Shaking the ground, producing many fissures and kicking up a cloud of dust that covered both canines. Nugget didn't wait his jaws snap down towards Orion's exposed throat. With a powerful chomp his jaws bite into Orion's throat and with a sickeningly loud snap his bones snap, killing the muscular male. Nugget released his grip and backed away. Blood poured from many slashes on his belly and his muzzle. He flicked his blood coat tongue out. His anger subsiding and vision returning to normal.

Curious he looks around to see he was surrounded by humans! Several were right up close and stroking him. He moaned contently. The humans backed up. He panted merrily and lowered his head and gave those closest to his slobbering more a big sloppy lick! As if to say thanks cuties! The humans petting him continue to do so. He groaned contently. Damn, it felt so good and to have them trust him. Just what he wanted. In bliss he laid his head on his leg and let the humans continue. Down under he was getting a little hard, but he managed to resist getting a full erection. He just lulled his tongue, oozing thousands of gallons of drool that formed in a large pool. He looked around to see what was happening with Andromeda and the other canines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda was still fast asleep. Few humans were near her. Many were wary as they remembered her rather destructive stroll from earlier and she had eaten thousands. But it was sort of obvious now that she had been completely oblivious. Nugget having helped stop her unintentional killing and destroying. A few humans were petting her fat belly. But that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old grey furred male was still nearby, laying partly on his side. His legs sprawled out sideways. The bus he'd been slobbering all over was sat in a pool of saliva near to him. He had many humans pinned under him. But he was not squishing them. They seemed happy, as they stroked at him. What made Nugget yip was the males cock, it was fully erect and oozing pre. Some humans were actually stroking the old males balls. Nugget was a little jealous. Having experienced humans rubbing down there he wished the ones petting him would do the same to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on to the final canine, the lanky female. She was sat down with many humans pointing up at her. Her long fur trailed on the ground. Humans stroked at he soft and luxurious coat. Some even becoming entangled in her feathering. She was panting softly. Clearly loving the attention the little humans were giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, some of the humans had realised that the only safety from the giants was the giants themselves. Or at least the ones that had shown to be friendly. All over the world reports of giant animals of various species rampaging about filled the news channels. Videos of destruction and death from all over. These humans had seen their city be attacked first hand. The odd video, showing friendlier giants also filled the news channels. Nugget and Andromeda of course feature in such videos. There was several of them just lovingly slobbering over the queues of traffic. And so when he also appeared and killed the aggressive canine the humans knew now they had a guardian. A few other canines who were acting more friendly were nearby. The lanky female had just strolled about, crushing the odd car but clearly just eager to show off her body. The old male seemed content with soaking buses in drool then setting them back down. So now they stroked there giant 'guardians' and the giants seemed to appreciate the attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the peaceful interaction wouldn't last. For finally after half an hour of stroking, loving sloppy licks and admiration came something to put a stop to all of this...</span></div></div>",

Confused they look around and realise all the little humans were gone. It was life back to normal for them!

She was oblivious to the carnage she was causing. She finally fixed her eyes on her next target. She unfolded her wings, casting a shadow over a large area as with one powerful flap she took off. The beat of her wings produced Mach 4 speed winds, destroying houses and blasting anything a great distance. She flew over the city, each wing beat causing carnage. She finally lands near to her target a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The sunlight reflecting off the structure was what had caught her attention. She just had to check out the shiny hive! In just a few seconds she had flown over. Beside the office block was a large car park. Packed full of cars. She landed on the car park. Crushing cars with ease under her massive paws. She groaned ''Ooh... They feel so nice and crunchy!'' She laughed as she found the sensation of cars under her paws to be quite pleasant. She looked into the office building. She could see and smell hundreds of humans. They screamed and ran about in panic. ''Awww. I only want to say hello cuties!'' She laughed as stopped beside the building and peered in. Intently watching the humans. Her tail once again swished about. Sending cars flying as it smashed into them. 'I want a closer look' she decided. Lifting a paw she tore into the side of the building with ease. Her talons easily smashing through the glass. Her talons sunk into the floor, crushing computers and desks. She slashed downwards. With ease slicing through the floors. A chain reaction ensured, the floors on that side of the building collapsing right down to the ground. Causing millions in damage and hundreds of humans fell to there deaths or were crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Woops!'' She giggled as she looked down at the mess. The building was still standing and full of humans. She laughed as she got a cheeky and playful idea. Placing her paws atop the building she grunted and leapt up on to the roof. The building groaned in protests under her weight. But by some miracle it held. She looked around the city atop of her perch. Her tongue lulled as she sniffed the air and looked about. ''So much to explore! So much to play with!'' She giggled with excitement. She was so excited she started to jump up and down. The building collapsed under her one floor at a time. Within humans tried to flee but it was difficult. The lifts were broken, several stairs were blocked and the impact of her paws was shaking the building violently. Throwing people off balance as well as dislodging lights, fixtures and furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had leapt up six times, levelling the top six floors when finally the building couldn't stand any more. With a roar it collapsed violently. She yelped as she fell with the building but using her wings she hovered in the air. The beat of her wings accelerating the collapse and blasting debris and the dust cloud outwards. ''Aww. It wasn't very strong!'' She whined. ''Oh well. Where to next?!'' She looked for the next place to check out...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

People were walking, sunbathing, cycling, boating, playing and just having a good time. They had not seen Umbra as she was blocked out by the skyscrapers. But now she was flying there way. First they heard the gust of wind. Then came the crashing as cars were tossed about like leaves by her beating wings. She flew past the skyscrapers, they look interesting but the large park full of people had her attention. She'll check them out later. She lands with a thump on the far side of the park. Blasting people aside and crushing many under her paws. ''Woops!'' She said as she lifted a paw, covered with squished remains. But never mind, she had more people to check out! She walked on, politely stepping over people. ''Hi cuties! Don't mind me!'' She giggled as she walked by. Her eyes were fixed on the play park and the children. ''Aww younglings!'' She cooed as she approached. Below people screamed as she stepped over them. All they saw was her scale covered belly and long tail whizz by overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the play park the children watched the behemoth approach. Some ran but most stayed stuck on the spot. She stopped overhead and laid down. Ignoring the screams beneath her as she   laid down. CRUNCH. She heard the many crunches as she pulverised a few dozen humans under her belly. ''oops! Sorry!'' She whined as she realised her mistake. But her attention soon returned to the children. She lowered her head to them. ''Aww, so cute and tiny!'' She found them to be utterly adorable! She would love to give them a hug, but that would be impossible at her great size. She released her tongue for a lick. They backed away. ''Aww! I'll be gentle!'' She whined. To them her reassurance came out as a growl and she was showing off her fang filled maw... They all screamed and ran. She whined and lowered her ears. That hadn't gone to plan... She stood back up and noticed a twinge from her back end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back and whined. ''Going into heat again!'' She said. As her lips began to moisten and swell. She whined again as now she was feeling lustful. She needed to drag her vagina over something or find something to shove up it. She desperately looked for something to use to sate her sexual appetite...</span></div></div>",

She whined as her arousal and lust increased. ''Damn, always getting into heat so easy!'' She growled. Dragon Wolves would go into heat in just about any sexual situation or when feeling broody. Seeing the human children was more than a sufficient trigger. She yipped. ''Yes! The humans!'' She barked as she looked down at them running about. One wouldn't be enough, she needed a group. She walked on, looking for a big enough group. She wasn't watching where she was stepping. Many were crushed or skewered by her talons. Trees were knocked aside as were lamp posts. The lawns ruined with deep foot prints. Some humans who were in her way were not killed by her paws but instead got to watch her mighty body pass overhead. Her tail raised showing off her swollen dripping vulva. Her juices red hot splattered on people. Painfully burning them to death. Behind she left not only a trail of death and destruction. But one of her enticing juices. Any male within twenty miles, or a few hundred on this world would pick up her scent. She whined ''please be a big male for me out there!'' As she walked on and finally she found a big enough group of humans! She barked happily and bound over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd screamed as they saw her coming after them. Her powerful footsteps shook the ground, knocking many over. With one big leap she lands over the group. Knocking them all down. She grins down at them happily. Her slobbering tongue lulled and fangs displayed in a toothy grin. ''Hi cuties! Want to have some fun with a big sexy girl?!'' She said happily. She stepped on over them, presenting her backside. The humans screamed or silently stared up in shock at the sight over them. Her vulva swollen and moist. Her wrinkled tailhole puckered and either side of the holes was her large butt cheeks. She wriggled her backside, teasingly. ''Ooh. Time for some fun!'' She giggled as she folded her hindlegs. Dropping her backside onto the crowd. They tried to run but it was to late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMPF! SQUELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who ended up under her two fluffy cheeks were instantly turned into paste. Those who ended up under her hard moist lips were crushed. Though under her anus or under her slit were swallowed by the two orifices. those in her anus were instantly hit by the smell of shit. The air thin and rancid. Her walls covered in dried shit coating the people. Those in her vagina were smothered by smooth warm flesh. She howled out in ecstasy as she swallowed and crushed the humans. ''Fuck!'' She growled as she sucked them in deeper. The humans struggles sending waves of pleasure throughout her body!  She gritted her fangs as she felt like she was going to burst! ''Ooh yeah.... Tickle me... Fuck yeah!'' She whined as she neared climax. She ground her backside over the ground, adding to the pleasure. Her vagina began to contract violently, crushing the humans within. They screamed as they was steadily crushed by each contraction. Finally she gave one big heave and the humans were all crushed by her powerful vagina. She snarled lustfully as she stood up and blasted out her thick hot female juices. The humans crushed remains blasted out. Those in her anus were all unconscious,. thanks to the powerful stench. She let off a small fart, which blasted the humans out at great speed. Smashing their little bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood panting, her vagina dripping. Behind her little sex toys were all dead. She looked back and whined ''So fun, but to fragile!'' She had really enjoyed that. But she was still feeling horny. She needed more release. She walked on looking for something to pleasure herself with. The humans whilst fun were just to fragile. Maybe one of their creations would be of use. She leapt up into the air and beating her great wings gained enough altitude to hover over the city. From up here she could see for dozens of miles. Her keen eyes scanned the city for a suitable sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her eyes spot the perfect object...        </span></div></div>",

There had been many protests about the explicitly shaped house, but so far it had remained standing. But now it had caught the eye of Umbra. Who was in need of such a building. She flew on over as fast as she could. Her tongue lulled and splattering saliva onto the city. Her vagina still oozed her juices. Which also splattered onto the city. Her drool harmlessly stuck on vehicles and humans but her love juices burnt who or whatever, they landed upon. She couldn't believe her luck! ''It's the perfect size for me!'' She laughed as she approached the phallus house. 'How thoughtful of them!' She thought as she landed near to the house. On landing she crushed several others houses, but she didn't really notice or care. her tail swayed about rapidly. Adding to the destruction. She eyed up the house as she stepped on over it. ''Perfect! Thanks for the toy cuties!'' She giggled as she thanked the nearby humans who hadn't ran or been blasted away. Lining up her vagina she squatted onto the building. Her moist wet lips sliding over it with ease. She tipped her head back and moaned as she pushed down further. Swallowing the house within her hot slimy  passage. Once again waves of pleasure shot through her body. She gritted her fangs as she would rise up then push back down, going lower each time. The house for now was withstanding her insertion. But soon she'd do more to test it's strength...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she managed to fully insert the building. Her lips touching the ground. She grunted and squeezed. The house groaned. The second squeeze it cracked. The windows shattered and her juices started to flood into the house. The house's owner was still inside. All he could see was a great pink blanket of smooth flesh smothering the windows. His house groaning around him. The air getting hot and stinking of her juices. When she started to squeeze he screamed as the windows shattered and hot burning juices enveloped him. Her third squeeze and the house started to crumble. The fourth and final contraction shatters the house. It crumbles into a pile of rubble soaked in her thick juices. She howled as she crushed the house. ''Fuck!'' She cried as she felt the tumbling bricks crash down her vagina. Sending more waves of pleasure through her body. But the fun was other, the house now finally demolished, though not how protestors would of expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and looked back at the slimy rubble. ''Ooh that was better. But not strong enough for me little cuties!'' She laughed as she looked at the odd human who rather than running had watched her lewd act. She was still feeling horny. But it seemed she'd attracted some attention. Her nostrils flare as she takes in the scent. Her ears swivel on the sound and she looks at the thing she'd attracted... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon she saw him, flying over the city. He was huge! His legs thick and muscular. But the massive sheath and balls between his hind legs was what had most of her attention. ''What a stud!'' She said in awe. The male was grinning as he approached her. In his fore paws he was carrying a bus in each. Packed full of humans. He landed a short distance from her. He stood up on his hind legs. His great wings spread to support him and show off his body. Umbra was fixed on his massive balls and sheath. ''Like what you see babe?'' He said seductively. She panted ''Ooh yes! What a stud!'' He grinned but brought his attention to the bus in each paw. ''Sorry cuties. We shall have fun later!'' He licked each bus, soaking it in drool before carefully setting them down. He now dropped onto all fours as his paws were free. The humans on the buses quickly piled out as he approached the female. He smashed through the few standing houses without care. She turned and presented her backside. ''Show me what you've got!'' She giggled as she wriggled her hips. He licked his lips and pounced on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his forepaws around her waist and used his wings to stabilise himself as he began to thrust into her. She groaned as he inserted himself into her. In just a few humps his cock was fully erect and tied. His massive ponderous balls loudly slapped into her cheeks. With every thrust. She squeezed on his member. ''So big'' She whined. The male snarled as he orgasmed. Filling her with his fertile cum. He blew into her several times. Ensuring insemination took place. Once spent rather than lifting his leg other like a canine. He simply remained standing over her with is cock tied. ''An hour of this my love!'' Panted the male. The female whined but said nothing. unlike canines who remain tied for around half an hour Dragon Wolves take around an hour. This did give them a very high success rate and this time was no failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of onlookers had gather to film the two mating giants. They spotted their admirers. ''Aww we'll soon be with you!'' Panted the female. The male grinned ''Oh yes. We shall have some fun with them next!''

Fifty minutes pass, the male groans as he finally feels his boner was going down. ''Soon be free!'' he pants...</span></div></div>",

She moaned with pleasure. ''So big, powerful and sexy!'' She said softly to her large mate. He came up alongside her and licked her muzzle. She released her tongue and they wrapped in a big sloppy mess. Both groaning as it was their way of kissing. Finally the release each others tongues. ''Oh I forgot I'm umbra, what's your name big boy?'' Umbra asked the big male. He grinned ''Umbra? Lovely name as for me, I am called Tenebris.'' Tenebris looked down at the crowd of humans, who still were filming them or watching. ''Now, time to spread the love with the little ones!'' He licked his lips as he headed for a nearby crowd. They screamed and ran. He giggled ''Wanna play chase huh?!'' He crouched down ad with a grunt he leapt forwards. His fore paws tearing up large chunks of earth and wreckage. He landed over the group. His fore paws slamming down either side of them. The violent impact shaking the ground. The humans fell over, nearby buildings fell and great fissures appeared from under his paws. He grinned down at the crowd. His fangs on display as he licked his muzzle. ''Hee hee gotcha!'' He laughed. To the humans it sounded more like a roar. He stepped over them. All they could do was gawp up at his scaled belly but then his still erect member and large testicles sway overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teasingly spread his hind legs and wriggled his hips, to make his large genital sway. His potent musk made the humans choke. Some started to run, others were to shocked or injured to move. ''Like what you say? What about a closer look?!'' He laughed as he squatted down. Lowering his privates onto the dazed crowd. More ran or tried to crawl away as his monstrously big genitals were coming down on them. But it was to late... His heavy fat balls land first. As he was lowering them slowly they was hardly a sound as they touched down. Apart from the crunching of several people who had been directly under the testicles. A few were smothered by his thick and heavy scrotum. His cock however he was very careful and precise. rather than letting it slam down he manged to hold it just inches from the ground. Now his cock, blue slightly barded was also very sticky. All those under his member found themselves sticking to it! ''Ahhhh....'' Moaned Tenebris as he felt the many hands struggling against his member. Those in his scrotum were just as ticklish. Great waves of pleasure shot through his body once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up, the humans screamed as they rose up high into the air, still stuck on the bottom of his dick. He looked over at Umbra. Who watched him intently. ''Aww sorry babe! Want to join in?'' He dropped onto his side, crushing more houses and many unlucky people. His 'passengers' were jolted about by his flopping cock, but it was so sticky they weren't shaken free. He rolled right onto his back. His legs sprawled out along with his massive wings. More destruction was caused by his wings. But he didn't really notice or care. His dick stood up to attention. The female giggled and strolled on over. She stepped over him with her head over his genitals and her vagina over his head. ''Lovely!'' They said together as they both released their forked tongues. Both moaned with ecstasy as their tongues probed at each other's genitals. He thrust his tongue in deep to her slick love tunnel. She wrapped her tongue tight around his cock and squeezed. Several humans crushed under her tongue as the two giants sixty nine each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few humans on the cock screamed as her powerful slobbering tongue slid ever closer. Behind her wide fang filled maw loomed as she took the tip of his cock into her mouth and then she started to suck. Tenebris snarled as he was given a blow job by Umbra. He released his tongue from her vagina and panted heavily. ''Ohh... Yeah....'' He panted in ecstasy. He couldn't hold back. Though largely spent he still had a small reserve of cum left. Umbra had managed to suck the humans free into her maw. But she hadn't swallowed... Yet. He couldn't hold it. With a ferocious snarl he blew his load. Filling her maw with his thick, creamy love sauce. Umbra moaned and swallowed his sauce along with the little treats, the humans. She released his cock and stood panting over him. ''Fuck, that was good!'' She panted. Her mouth dripping the odd drop of cum. The big male under her grinned. ''Ooh yes! And there's so much more to play with! I'm loving this place and these funny little creatures!'' She stepped off over him so he could get back up. ''Ooh where to next?!'' Groaned Umbra as Tenebris came up beside her. The two giants study the city. Full of lust the two horny giants look for something else to 'play' with...   </span></div></div>",

Barked Tenebris. He leapt into the air and flapped his mighty wings. The ferocious winds pick up even more destructive than Umbra's. Buildings, cars, humans were brutally blown aside or apart as he flew overhead. Nothing survived in his wake. Umbra followed right behind the larger male. She was more focused on his balls than the destruction and chaos below. In just a few seconds they had reached the skyscrapers and other taller buildings. Tenebris stopped and landed onto his hind legs. He was straddling a tall building, that fit in between his legs. His hind paws having crushed several cars and sunk deep into the surface. Using his tail and wings to support his standing body as he took a more bi pedal stance. He still had an erection. His dick and balls swung about as he balanced. ''Hi cuties! Don't worry! Soon be your time to join in with the fun, with this big sexy boy!'' Laughed Tenebris as he addressed the humans. Of course all they heard was growls and snarls. He looked back at Umbra, who was still in the air. ''Hey babe, why not choose the first one for me?!'' He asked. She nodded and flew around the centre as she eyed up each skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest easily stood out. She landed on the street before it. Crushing several cars and humans. But she didn't notice or care. She walked up to the skyscraper, it towered over her and even Tenebris. ''Nice big and strong!'' She muttered as she peered in through the windows. Many humans ran about in terror. ''Hi cuties! Don' panic, just a bit of fun!'' She giggled as she turned around and showed off her backside. She backed up and grunted as her hot wet lips hit as did her puckering ring and fluffy cheeks. She dragged her backside sideways and up and down. The glass shattering under the pressure. Furniture and the unlucky human tumbled out. Tickling her two holes. She shivered with pleasure but she was about to get to watch the big stud nearby work his magic. She walked forwards and found a perfect sized building to sit on. The building groaned under her, she lifted up a little and used her wings to support her weight. She watched Tenebris as he made his approach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now my turn!'' He giggled as he walked on up to the skyscraper. His bigger girth meant he had to tear through several smaller buildings to reach his target. But he wasn't bothered. though debris hit his cock, which made him groan with pleasure. He lowered his head to sniff at the hole Umbra had made. He could smell humans and see them. ''Hi little ones!'' He laughed. His hot breath blasting furniture everywhere and creating a storm of loose paper. He lifted his head and studied the undamaged area before him. More humans ran about in terror. Below they piled out onto the streets. He grinned ''aww. No need to be scared, only a bit of fun!'' He giggled as he lifted onto his hind legs. His massive wings unfolded to balance him. They smashed into adjacent buildings with ease. He wrapped his forelegs around the building and sunk his talons in. Shattering the glass and spilling out more occupants and furniture. the falling debris struck fleeing people below. Killing many. His tail whipped about, tearing through dozens of buildings with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock, still erect juts out of it's sheath before him. He snarled and gave one big thrust forwards. His dick smashes into the scraper violently. Smashing through steel beams  with ease. Furniture was crushed or knocked aside as his cock burrows in deep. He pulled back and thrust again. His balls swung back and forth and like demolition balls they destroyed anything they slammed into. He had squished several humans, but he didn't care or notice. He held his head back and howled as he gave a third thrust and he blew his load. His rich thick seed engulfing several floors and then it began to flood down through the stairwells and lift shafts. Thousands of humans were engulfed and drowned in his thick hot love sauce. To him it had only been a 'small' ejaculation, as he was already heavily spent. But it was still thousands upon thousands of gallons. Floor by floor is flooded, the clear windows turning a murky white as his seed reaches the street and oozes out. By some miracle the building had so far withstood his penetration and filling. The windows epically held out against the pressure of his cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris backed out panting heavily. He looked back at Umbra, who had been watching intently. Her tail whipped about, destroying buildings and killing hundreds. ''I'm done! Enough sex for today!'' He panted. She grinned ''Aw, but what a show! I think the little one liked it!'' He grinned ''Aww. But we can still have fun with them!'' He laughed as he turned and took off into the sky. His wing beat violently blasted out the skyscrapers windows. His seed now oozed out and down all the sides. Umbra followed. Her wing beat demolishing the building that she had been sat on. Now they hovered high over the city. Giving them a good view of the sprawling metropolis and surrounding area. Their trail of destruction clearly visible from up here. Below a great cloud of dust was enveloping downtown, thanks to all the buildings they had demolished. The skyscraper still stood, though windowless and gutted. Tenebris's fat cock finally returned to it's sheath. Umbra's vagina drying as she came out of heat as quick as she came in. She was now pregnant thanks to the big male. They looked about as they looked for the next thing to interact with. This time their interaction would be non sexual. They set their eyes upon...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenebris's eyes lit up when he spotted the cities largest train station. Twenty platforms, it was a huge transport hub and used by hundreds of thousands daily. Now it was especially busy as people tried to fell the city. Dozens of trains were already moving away. At nearly every platform another train was being loaded up by the fleeing crowds. They packed in like sardines, discomfort of no issue they just wanted to get away! The two giant Dragon Wolves sensitive noses easily locating the large concentration of humans. ''There they are! Let's go say hello!'' Laughed Tenebris as he started to glide down to the station. Umbra quickly glided after him. At first nobody noticed them approach, as they were so silent now that their gigantic wings were not beating. But soon the two giants cast a large shadow that swallows the entire station. The hysteria increases as the people at the station realise that the two giants are coming right for them. Most of whom had witnessed first hand their previous lewd actions with the skyscraper and each other. People either turn to run away on foot or still try and board the trains. One by one the trains start to pull away. Slow due to their heavily overloaded carriages.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris is the first to land. He lands right beside the station, standing adjacent to the platforms.. Crushing buildings under his mighty paws. His talons tearing through steel and concrete with ease. Many humans were killed either under his paws or by falling debris. He didn't notice, he looked down and grinned ''Hi cuties! Were are you going?!'' He giggled. To him this was just a game. His tail whips about slightly. Smashing through even more buildings. On the opposite side Umbra lands. Crushing buildings under her paws. She grins at Tenebris ''Maybe we should show them we are just playing?'' The big male nods. ''Oh yes!'' He groaned and laid down partially on his side. His massive body crushing everything underneath. His great wings he left half folded as his legs sprawl out. His hind paws rip through even more buildings. But his forelegs and paws. slide onto several tracks. The trains on those lines bash harmlessly into him. They were only going slow, so all that happened was they derailed and the passengers were tossed into each other. They all scream when they see the beast granny at them. His paw that had stopped them lifts and reaches for one of the locomotives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris grinned as he had his toys trapped. He reaches for the first locomotive. His fore paws toes were long and not webbed, so he could grip things. He grabs the locomotive and lifts it with ease. The coupling broke as he brought it to his face. He peeked in. Seeing the driver. ''Aww! Hi there little one. Want to see my mouth?!'' He teased as he brought the loco before his mouth and opened wide. His great fangs on display to the terrified driver who screamed and opens the door and leaps. He screamed as he fell but with a quick flick Tenebris catches the driver with his long forked tongue. He takes the man into his mouth and seals him in. He groaned and swished him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbra decided to join in with the fun. She walks forwards and sits on the tracks. She caught a few trains under her backside. She groaned as she felt them crunch under her butt. ''Oops!'' She laughed as she looked down at the many carriages before her. screams from within excited her. Her tail swished about behind. Swatting several other trains that had departed earlier. The carriages scatter across a wide area, smashing into buildings the locomotives explode on landing. She didn't notice or care about the death and destruction behind her. She had enough to focus on below! She licked her lips and lowered her head. She released her tongue and dragged it sloppily along the carriages. They groaned under the pressure and were left with a thick layer of saliva, which oozed down the windows. She spat ''Eurgh! Not very nice tasting!'' She whined. But the humans started to pile out and she laughed. ''Aww. So you want to be licked as well?!'' She eagerly lowered her head and thrust her tongue into the humans. Catching hundreds. She took them into her mouth and sealed them in. She moaned as they struggled about. 'ooh feels so good'... She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants now had humans trapped in their mouths. Tenebris, the big male having only the one. Whilst Umbra has hundreds struggling about. They both moaned and wagged their tails with excitement. To them the humans struggles was almost as pleasurable as sex. Waves of pleasure fill their large bodies. Tenebris flopped fully onto his side as he continued to play with the human. His body pulverising more buildings. Umbra fell onto her back. Crushing the tracks. Her long tail whips forth into the station. It whipped about with wild abandon. Reducing the station to rubble and throwing the carriages everywhere. Thousands more die, but the two giants are once again lost in bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question is, what fate awaits the humans within their gigantic maws? </span></div></div>",

She remembered having the humans in her anus, that had felt good and why shouldn't these humans get a go in there as well?! She groaned and rolled over. Pulverising several trackside buildings as she rolled onto them. Now the right way up she stood up and shook herself. All the debris that had became stuck to her fur and scales flies off. thousands of missiles fly far into the city. Laying waste to untouched areas and killing any human that were hit by debris. Which in most cases consisted of great chunks of concrete. She stretched her head back to her backside and she released her tongue with the humans stuck to it. The humans gasped at the fresh air. For like all canines her breath was hot, humid and stank. But their reprieve was only a slight one. Before they saw her great wrinkled ring. They scream and struggle to no avail. Umbra moaned then shoved her tongue deep into her anus. She shivered as it felt so good! She wiped all of the humans off within her slick poo tube. Withdrawing her tongue she sealed her ring, trapping the humans within. ''That's it, struggle cuties!'' She giggled. She looked over at Tenebris he had a look of shock upon his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dith yew real e justh do thath?'' He asked, His words slurred as he still had his human stuck upon his tongue. Umbra laughed and wriggled her but at him. ''Oh yeah! It feels so good! They seem to enjoy it to. Oh my are they ticklish!'' She lulled her tongue and drooled heavily. Tenebris pondered. Should he give it a go? He huffs. Just as well have a go... He stretched his head back to his butt. His long tongue slides out, the human stuck near the tip. The man screamed as the great ring puckered before him, blasting shitty air over him. He was just inches from the disgusting orifice when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKABOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA explosion erupts upon Tenebris's tongue. Instantly vaporising the man and stinging the great Beast. He yipped in surprise. There was a whistle then another explosion erupts on his belly scales. Umbra was yelping as three explosions went off over her body. She spread her wings and snarled. ''We're being attacked!'' Tenebris growled and looked up. In the sky coming at them were eight fighter jets. Already several missiles had been released and struck there mark, to no effect. The big male stood up, his hackles raised and ferocious fangs bared he unfolded his massive wings. With one powerful beat he took off. Sending a tsunami of debris back into the city. Causing ever more destruction. Umbra followed. Her wing beat kicking up nothing but dust. They both headed for the jets, ready to tear them apart. Nobody attacks them and gets away with it! Tenebris particularly was pissed as 'his' human had been blown to bits before he could have more fun with him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question is, is it just these jets to deal with or has the country's military finally responding on a large scale towards these two giants?  </span></div></div>",

He positions himself over the building, with his great swinging orbs positioned over one end of the motel. He grunts and sits... Slowly. ''He's sitting on us!'' Cry several of the people. They run for their lives, exposing themselves for the Wolf. He pants happily as his plan is working. But he won't feast until he has them all out... With a loud crunch his orbs land on the roof and push down.  With ease his nuts crush the motel under their bulk. He howls out contently. More people run, as the Wolf began to drag himself forwards. His balls smashing through the motel like giant furry demolition balls. He stops halfway along the building and pitches forwards. Letting his sheathed boner slam down. He howls again as his cock crushed  yet more of the structure and more people run. He snarls and releases his seed. Thin, sticky and hot the seedless cum blasts its way right on through the motel, sweeping up the few who had not yet ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motel was pretty much demolished, the small section still standing was wrecked by the cum oozing though it. The Wolf, having spent his load stand s up. His balls swinging about and loudly smacking into his thighs. He looks at his cum with the humans within. He licks his lips and lowers his head. Ignoring their screams and pleas he laps them up and swallows. He growls with dissatisfaction. They weren't that filling. But there were several more nearby. He stalks after the other occupants and within five minutes all are digesting in his belly. He burps, they were nice but his belly was hardly full. He likes the humans taste and wants more... Many more! He sniffs the air, hoping to find more. And his sensitive nose does pick up the scent of more humans. Eagerly he heads for the humans. His tongue lulled, tail lifted and wagging. Balls and erect cock swinging wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf has discovered more humans at... </span></div></div>",

He has to travel several dozen miles, to reach the scent of humans. Passing through near deserted land he stops atop a hill and looks into the valley. Below is a hotel, it was quite tall, nearly as big as him. Beyond the valley was the lights of a city shining in the sky. He lulls his tongue. So much to eat and entertain himself with. He'll deal with the hotel first then move onto the city. He decides to announce his presence. He throws back his head and howls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis howl, as loud as thunder attracts many of the hotels occupants attention. Many look out the windows and scream at the sight. The Wolf began to descend towards the hotel. Slowly as if teasing the smaller humans. His dick hardening as he approaches. People pile out of the hotel and get into their vehicles. Many crash into each other trying to leave. The Wolf snarls and squats down, ready to pounce. Muscles flexing he lifts off the ground and comes down on the parking lot. With an ear-splitting boom his paws smash into the asphalt, crushing many cars and shattering the surface. Most of the hotels windows shatter from the impact. The Wolf growls and lowers his head. Jaws snapping up vehicles and people whole. He greedily swallows all that he catches. People scream and run, to no avail. All those outside the hotel end up in his belly. It took only five minutes to catch all the humans. Many had ran into the 'safety' of the hotel. A few had managed to drive away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf looks at the hotel and sniffs.

A feline with two long sabre like canines jutting out of his mouth. He was none other than a Smilodon Populator, or the sabre toothed tiger as many would call his kind. More robustly built than a modern Lion or Tiger. His shoulders huge and bulging with muscle. He had a spotted coat, to blend in with his usual habitat. Whilst back 'home' he was already a particularly large specimen of his kind. Now he stood close to 400ft tall and about 650ft long. His large paws, 60ft tall, 100 ft long and 80ft wide. Smash down into the forest. Trees being crushed under his thick pads. His claws tearing through trunks like a hot knife through butter. He looks about and snarls. This place doesn't smell, feel or look right. Why was everything so small? He strolled on carving a trail of destruction through the once pristine forest. Birds squawked and flew away in their droves. Other wildlife letting off cries of alarm as they fled from his approaching form.  His footsteps sounded like thunder as his mighty felid form carves its ever destructive way through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe constantly sniffs at the air and looks about as he ploughs on. He could smell the wildlife and hear their cries of alarm. He snorted, so they should run from him. He was the predator, they the prey. But, right now he was more interested in working out where the hell he was. He walked for twenty minutes, nothing but constant forest filled his vision. But he smelt something... Different. Stopping he sniffed at the air powerfully. A scent, he'd never smelt it before, but it had his interest. He licked his lips and turned towards the scent, his curiosity piqued. The scent grew stronger and ever more interesting. Soon he could see little brightly coloured creatures within the forest. Just what where they?! He had to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the hikers the walk through the forest had been uneventful and to be honest boring. But the 'thunder' had them confused. There was no clouds in the clear blue sky. The sound of crashing trees, squawking birds and when the ground started to shake they really panicked. When they saw the gigantic Smilodon coming right at him they screamed and ran...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures ran, but they was small and slow. The Smilodon growled and started to run. Ripping up the forest on a far more destructive scale. He caught the creatures in just a few steps. His heavy footsteps had knocked them over. He lowers his head and sniffs the creatures. His suction pulls them towards his nostrils. He exhales, blowing them away. They screamed and tried to run. He tips his head on its side and opens his mighty jaws wide. His tongue, a gigantic sandpaper like slug. Emerges from his mouth and curls around the creatures. He pulls them into his maw and seals his jaws. Levelling his head he swishes and licks them against his ridges. Tearing flesh from bone and coating his tongue with blood. He reduces the creatures to saliva soaked piles of mush. He swallows and burps... Tasty! He licks his lips and sniffs for more of these creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up more of these creatures, humans a few miles away (or dozen on the worlds scale). He makes his way for the humans. He finally comes across...  </span></div></div>",

He did feel a little horny, he was the biggest and most powerful predator here. All should tremble before him! He heard a strange cry, a train horn. He could smell the creatures and another strange smoky stench, diesel fumes. He saw the lights of the train in the distance. He stopped near the tracks and laid down. he was an ambush predator, he would wait for his prey to get close, then he would strike. His large from was still easy to see, it appeared like a giant furry mound to the approaching train...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver hadn't seen the Smilodon when he was approached. But now he could see a strange furry mound about a mile ahead and near the track. ''What is that?!'' He muttered. When he was half a mile away he could see it was an gigantic creature, a big cat! He panicked and slammed on the emergency brakes. With a loud screech the brakes apply, sending up sparks and throwing most of the passengers forwards. The train slows, the passengers look to see why the train has so violently braked. they couldn't believe what they could see lurking in the forest. Panic ensures as the train comes to a stop and the beast stands up, revealing itself as a gigantic Sabre toothed Tiger! The beast opened it's jaws and Roared. The horrific sound cracked the windows and blew out everybody's ear drums, leaving them wincing in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prey stops right before him! How easy and convenient! He stands up and lets off a mighty roar. He can smell the fear. It excites him. He stomps towards his prey eagerly. He lifts his left forepaw and slams it on the locomotive. Crushing it flat under his mighty pad. It exploded, but all it did was tickle his paw, much to his delight! He'd killed the head of the 'snake' within was the tasty little creatures. They started to pour out of the sides. Screaming in terror at him. He turned so that the train ran between his legs. He roared again down at the creatures, blowing them all over. He was in charge here and they were his food. But the thought of his dominance made him feel even hornier. His balls ached, his short fat barbed cock slipped from it's sheath. He had hunger in his belly and his genitals. What hunger to satisfy first?!</span></div></div>",

People in the carriage heard the roof and sides groan as a fleshy curtain smothered the windows. Outside those next to the carriage screamed as the giant orbs came down on them. With a wet squish his testicles crush dozens. His cock comes down on the carriage, crushing it under it's bulk. He groaned loudly and lulled his tongue. Feeling the people and carriage being crushed under his lovely big nuts and thick dick was so intoxicating!  He scoots forwards. Crushing more under his bulk. People flee before him and within the carriages. Those within fighting with other to get out or further up the train before the genitals reach them. Dozens were being squished every second. The giant predator didn't care. Killing was his life, these creature were nothing but toys... And food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving crushed a quarter of the train he lifts up. His dick and balls swaying about, coated in blood. The humans sighed in relief, thinking they wouldn't be crushed under the giants huge genitals but crushing wasn't the only thing he could use his dick for. A thick substance oozed from the tip. Peoples faces sunk when they saw the Cat's giant prick aiming itself at them. He grunted and his dick exploded forth a long, thick, hot and suffocating stream of cum! It splattered all over a carriage and surrounding people. It completely envelops them and floods the carriage. Those caught in the stream find themselves being suffocating in the thick love sauce. But the big cat wasn't going to let off one stream. Oh no big cats will fuck dozens of times in quick succession. His 'gun' was cocked and loaded. He walked forwards. Firing off load after load after load. The train was completely engulfed in the thick sauce, as were the passengers. It oozed outwards rapidly, catching the few that had managed to get away. The Smilodon snorted with triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the creatures as they struggled futilely to escape his lovely cum. The struggles stopped as they suffocated one by one. He licks his lips. He now has creamy treats to slurp up! He lowers his head and eagerly laps up his treat of his own making. So creamy and delicious! He slurps up everybody and every drop of cum. Nothing was wasted. He finally sniffed the train. No food remained. Now it could be disposed of. Razor sharp claws slip out of his toes and the shredding begins. He reduces the train to ribbons and finally he squats and sprays a mist of piss. To mark it as his. His belly rumbles. Still not fully satisfied. He wants more! He follows the tracks, maybe they would lead him to more of these creatures! He started to run, wanting to find more to play with and eat! His genitals still ache, he's still not fully spent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic hungry and horny beast soon comes across...</span></div></div>",

His aching balls jiggling about wildly, ready to release more of his seed. His dick poke out of his sheath once more in anticipation. He soon saw the train, it was even longer than the first! More for him to play with and devour! He couldn't wait! His great rough tongue lulled with excitement. His paws ripped up the track and left deep prints. He didn't care, after all the train was ahead of him. It was heading away from him, but his great size meant he was catching up rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the train couldn't hear his footsteps due to the noise of the rails, radio's and conversations. Though they could feel the pounding of his paws. Which grew more violent as he came ever closer. Some looked out of the windows in confusion. But nobody looked back. He was just a few steps away when finally the passengers in the last carriage spotted his massive paws and thick muscular legs. They screamed and filed forwards up the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was over the rear of the train now. He was thinking of a way to stop it. Last time it stopped for him but this one had learnt its lesson it seems. He decided to go for the head, kill the head and the rest of the body will stop. His paws steps caused the trains wheels to lift off the track, but by some miracle it didn't derail. He was halfway up the train, not long to go before he could stop it. His dick slipping further out of his sheath as he knew he was about to catch his prey for some food and fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarls and leaps onto the locomotive, paws fully outstretched with his razor sharp claws out of their sheaths. With a crunch his claws slice into the locomotive, destroying the motor and starting a fire. The flames lick his face. He yelps in alarm and trips. His legs splay out and with a crash his body slams down hard on the train. Crushing most of it under his bulk. The remaining carriages derail and pile up behind him. They smack into his balls and cock, which made him grunt with delight. The last carriage rode up on the piled up ones and actually enters his tail hole, which made him snarl with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mishap whilst destroying most of his food and given him some unexpected pleasure. His powerful wrinkled ring squeezes and suck, pulling the carriage deeper. His cock, buried in the piled up coaches leaks pre. People in the wreckage struggle to escape, many inadvertently stroked his orbs or even touched his cock, which they found themselves stuck to thanks to it's stickiness. He couldn't believe this! It was so pleasurable he couldn't hold back. He snarled and blew his load. The piled up carriages are violently pushed aside by his powerful stream of cum. Many people are crushed by the carriages or like before smothered in his cum. He blew a few more loads then lifted up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back at the mess his cum had made. Licking his lips he turns and eagerly lowers his head to feast. His tongue mercilessly slides around carriages to scoop up people. He groaned contently as he filled his belly some more. It was a shame he had killed so many by accident. But there would be more for him to eat, he was sure of it! Having devoured everybody. He focuses on the carriage in his butt. He grunted and squeezed, crushing it within. Finally he squats down and pushes the carriage out. It had caused him great pleasure but he now wants to focus on eating. He once again follows the track and it lead him right into:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The forest ended and started to turn into small hives, houses. He stopped before the first ones and roared. Announcing his presence to all the cities inhabitants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inhabitants of the city had no idea of who was approaching their city, the capital with a population of eight million. The suburbs closest to the beast. Were the first to find out. At first they thought a storm was coming, thanks to his thunderous footsteps. But when they went outside to investigate (the forecast didn't mention thunder storms?!) They saw him rapidly approaching. In shock at first they soon started to flee. Getting in their cars and speeding away. Gridlock ensured, cars crashed, people fought with each other and soon the shadow of the beast washed over them. They all looked up at him, looming over them. His legs thick and bulging with muscle. Two long shining sabres jutting out of his mouth. The beast eyes glaring down at them before its jaws part and ROAR! The beast roars, shattering windows and blowing out ear drums. The people cringe in agony. When they look up the beast is moving. A colossal paw lifts over the first house and hovers briefly. Toes wriggling then the beast snarled and slammed the paw down. The house was completely flattened, the shockwave blows people over and destroys several houses. The beast takes another step, causing more destruction. But then it lowered its head, jaws parting wide revealing his massive humid and saliva coated maw. The tongue slides out over the lethal incisors and thrusts itself into the closest crowd. Greedily it returns to the mouth, he doesn't even chew he swallows them whole and alive. To die in his digestive juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolls on, smushing house after house with out care. His head lowered as he slurps up his food. Their screams of terror amuse him as he feats. Under his tail his balls start to ache yet again. His fat pricked dick sliding free of its sheath. Oh damn he was enjoying this! But his arousal was urging him to get frisky once again. There was some bigger buildings ahead. They looked perfect for mounting... He made his way to the buildings, slurping up more people on the way. His dick oozing pre onto the street below, leaving a sticky trail behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow does he reach the buildings undisturbed or does something show up to distract him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All that remained was prints with compacted debris in his wake. He doesn't care about the destruction he's causing, all he wants is to eat and have sex. though for now sex would have to be replaced with humping things to provide release. He reaches the first tall building, an office block. It was the perfect height, the roof just reaching his belly. But it was wider than his body, so he couldn't mount it like he would a female. He snorted and sniffed the building. He came up with an idea! He lifts a paw onto the roof, it groaned under his weight. Satisfied it would support his whole weight he leaps up to stand upon the roof. With a crash his paws slam down upon the roof, which partially collapses. The top three floors pancake onto each other, crushing dozens of people within. The Smilodon didn't care, he had a more pressing concern and it was aching under his tail. He laid down upon the roof. The building groaned in protest, another floor was lost as his weight pushed down.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the streets people pointed up at the titanic ancient big cat who having strolled through the city devouring people was now lying atop a office block. The building was struggling to hold the weight. Cracks formed from the top floors and slowly expanded downwards. Rubble  and dust rained down on the street around the building, knocking out many. The big question was what was the Smilodon doing?! They soon got there answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smilodon had a hard on yet again. His thick barbed cock pointed downwards as he lifted his hind and with a grunt he slams his dick down <i>into</i> the building. With ease it penetrates the structure. His balls slap down loudly, kicking up clouds of dust. He snarls and thrusts over and over. The building groans louder as it was humped by the horny beast. Within office staff tried to flee. But the whole structure was shaking violently with every one of his thrusts. They fell on each other, or were knocked out by falling lights and fixtures. His dick oozed pre into the building, it began to flow down the corridors, lift shafts and stairways. Several were swept up in the flow. But his pre was the least of their worries. He gives one extra strong thrust. Penetrating deep and with a snarl he orgasms violently. The tsunami of cum violently blasts its way through the building. It smashes through doors, envelops people and office furniture. It smashes out of windows, carrying many to there deaths. It even forces its way through the ever expanding cracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building could take no more, with a roar it crumbles. The Smilodon growls in surprise as he falls down with the collapsing structure. With a thump he lands on the ground, laying atop a mound of cum soaked rubble. A large cloud of dust envelops him and the area. He sneezes violently several times. Quickly he gets up and runs away from the destroyed building. He sneezed one last time, coating a few people in his snot. He realises this and 'politely' cleans them with one lick and gulp. He looked back at the cloud of dust. He snarled. So weak and pathetic! He still needed release. He looks around for another stronger target to fuck..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles when he sees something that looks more suitable... </span></div></div>",

His thick muscular legs bulldoze through smaller buildings. He doesn't care, these buildings aren't big enough for him to fuck. He soon reaches the skyscraper. He stops and snarls. Looking at him was another Smilodon! It snarled back at him! He couldn't believe that he hadn't already smelt this other Smilodon. He sniffs the air... He still smells no other Smilodon?! He walked forwards, closer to the building. The other Smilodon did the same. He bared his fangs, as did the other Smilodon. But then the beast finally recognises himself. It was a mere reflection in the skyscrapers glass sides. He snorts and gets ready to mount the skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople within the skyscraper desperately fled as the giant sabre tooth terrorising the city came this way. The beast snarled and bared it's mighty fangs at them several times as it approached. Further increasing the panic. The beast was just seconds way when he reared up onto his hind legs. His thick and powerful forelegs wrap around the skyscraper with a heavy thud. Many people were knocked over along with furniture. Lights flickered and several lifts jammed in the shafts. His forepaws grip the skyscraper tightly. His ferocious claws smash through the glass with ease. Many fell out of the holes made by his claws. A few were even skewered on the claws, coating them in blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLower down his genitals press against the building as he grips it tightly. He lifts back and thrusts. His balls smash windows, more people fall out to their deaths. His cock, fully erect penetrates deeper. Oozing pre once again down corridors. But after just three more thrusts he cums. With a snarl he blows his load. The tsunami of cum sweeping up all in its path. Unlike the small office building the skyscraper was more robustly built. The cum was contained by the windows and instead it had to travel to the ground via other routes. Stairwells, lifts shafts, ventilation shafts corridors... The cum fills them all, suffocating those who were in any level at or below his genitals. The cum finally reaches the ground floor and erupts out of the doors and onto the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smilodon blows two more loads. Before he backs up. With a crash his paws land back on the ground. Crushing more cars and even a few people. He panted heavily. That had ben good and it held out this time! His sexual desires were fulfilled for now. His belly rumbled, this fucking and destroying was hungry work. He had a nice creamy treat below to devour. Eagerly he licks his cum and the humans who had been caught in the flow. He burped loudly as he finished his cum soaked treat. He was fairly satisfied for now. But he still wanted to eat more. He started to walk along with his head lowered yet again.

Debris trapped in his fur flies off at high speed, damaging more structures and killing many unlucky people who were within range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scent grows stronger. He can tell she was in heat! Her potent pheromones fill the air. His balls and cock tingle once more. He was getting horny once again. He really wanted to reach her at any cost! He started to run. The destruction he caused was in the billions and thousands of lives lost. He tore apart buildings like tissue paper. Deep prints were covering many streets. Water pipes gushed out great fountains of water, Downed power lines sparked and crackled. Fires erupted in thousands of places. He wasn't the least bit concerned about his trail of death and destruction. His eyes were on the gorgeous female up ahead. He could see her now. She was in the suburbs, she was staring intently at the approaching male. She had a lighter build than the male and her coat was not as heavily spotted. Her fur was a pale yellow. Her eyes an unusual blue colour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon reached her. He stopped short and they stared at each other more closely. Sniffing and grunting. He starts to walk around to her backside. She turns and squats her fore legs, lifting her hind high into the air. She raises her tail to fully expose her backside. Her pussy swollen and moist. He released his tongue and eagerly licked her vagina. She grunted as his sloppy tongue coasted her pussy with his saliva. He forced his tongue in deep, for a real good taste. She grunted and squeezed on his tongue. She panted heavily, a house before her blasted apart by her humid and hot breath. He lifts his head away and mounts her. He snarls and bites onto the back of her neck as he thrusts into her. She roars as he orgasms, filling her pussy with his fertile seed. He pulls out, waits for a second and then plunges into her. Like all big cats he would mate multiple times in rapid succession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty orgasms and mating's the pair are done  He gets off her and they lay side by side. Lovingly they licks each others faces and nuzzle. Tired from his rampaging, fucking and full belly the male decides to have a nap. The female despite being a new arrival and not so full decides to sleep as well. The two giant felines snooze in the suburbs. Inhabitants fleeing whilst they had the chance. But the two cats peaceful slumber was to be rudely interrupted by... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the two giants woke up and snarled at the people before them. they both stood up stretched and went to give chase when a great pink swirling light appeared before them. the cats couldn't stop, they hit the light and with a whoosh they are whisked away. They both arrive back home, in roughly the same place they left. Sniffing around they can find no more humans or their creations to destroy and eat. They soon settle back to their 'old' and 'small' routine. Meanwhile the planet they had briefly visited had faced attacks all over before the giants vanished as abruptly as they arrived. The countries repaired and then prepared for future giant attacks but they never came and within generations, all was forgotten.  </span></div></div>",

But the peace was interrupted by a great swirling purple light. The animals fled from the strange light and just as well. Emerging from the light was hour gigantic paws. They landed on the ground with a thump. Kicking up a cloud of dust. The Paws owner a huge female Pachycrocuta studied the scene before her. The sight looked wrong but the scents were familiar. She grunted, this didn't feel right. Looking down she could see what appeared to be prey, but it was now not even bite sized?! Behind her the portal flickers as three more Pachycrocuta join her. They weren't quite as tall and were all males. She stood out by her greater size and pseudo-penis hanging between her hind legs. The portal flickered and vanished. Leaving the four giants towering over all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males, hungrily eyed up the smaller creatures. They drooled and held up their tails as they started to whoop and chase down the prey. The ground shook violently under their heavy footsteps. They left deep paw prints that squished anything they came down on. Trees, rocks, animals. All ended up looking like pancakes within the prints. They lowered their heads and began greedily gobbling up all creatures with range. The Matriarch did not move, she watched the three males as the made quick work of devouring every living creature within a few mile radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three males had finished she groaned, calling the them back. They obeyed, coming up to her. Flicking their tails and lowering themselves in submission. They all had erections, a sign of submission in Hyena's. She cocked her leg, one of the males came up parallel to her in the opposite direction and did the same. Lower each others head they licked at each others penises. Fat tongues curling and fondling each others penises, covering them both in drool. The male submissively backed away from his matriarch. She snapped at him with a loud CHOMP! Of Her bone crushing teeth. He giggled and ran a short distance away.   She stared at the next male, who approached her and again the two licked each others penises and then same with the third male. having shown deference to their Matriarch she leads the clan on. She was hungry herself and the greedy males had scoffed down on the nearby food! There must be more food out there for her to devour... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed an interesting scent trail.

Taking photos and selfies. Little did they now what was about to ruin their day. It started as distant thunder that grew louder and louder. The ground started to shake with each crack of thunder. Believing that it was due to a para military group they started to drive away. But the thunder continued to grow louder and the shakes grew in severity. looking around for the sight of explosions people scream as they see the true course merging over a small hill. Four gigantic Hyenas are running this way! The monsters where whooping, a sign of attack! The buses drove flat out but the beasts superior size meant they caught up with ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch led the attack. One of the males tried to overtake she snapped at him. He giggled and backed up. She made it clear. These were for her to eat! She reaches the first bus. She overestimated her speed. She plants a paw on the bus, instantly crushing it and the occupants. A few people had jumped out, but to late. They still ended up under her paw to be turned into paste. The impact made the next bus loose control. It skidded sideways and rolled over. The people screamed as they were tosses out or crushed under the vehicle. But worse was to come. A pair of ferocious jaws comes over them and SNAP! The jaws slam together, crushing many and trapping the rest in her maw. Her powerful tongue lurches and she chews. She's not fussy. She chewed up the bus and people and swallows. Her bone crushing jaws making easy work of the buses thin metal. She licked her lips, that was tasty and she still had two more to devour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males watched intently. But didn't dare interrupt their matriarch. She charged over the next bus. The driver struggled to remain in control, but he was fairly skilled unlike the last and didn't crash. People tried to jump, A large tongue politely caught them and took them into the awaiting jaws above. She lowers her head after the bus and opens her maw wide. Foul hot and humid breath assault the passengers. Her saliva coasted tongue lovingly slides out and stretches after the bus. It slaps down on the rear with a loud wet slurp she drags her tongue forwards. The bus violently stopped as its rear was crushed under her mighty muscle. The front lifts up, tossing the passengers to the rear. She dragged her tongue forwards. Crushing more of the bus and occupants. Within seconds it was bloody saliva soaked sheet metal. She pried it up and with a few chomps the bus was also in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne to go! She chased after it. Slowly and teasingly. The thought of being in so much power over these puny creatures excited her. She had an erection. Her penis flopped about wildly as she ran. The males also felt horny watching their beautiful and big matriarch make such quick work of the strange little creatures. their shells useless at stopping her. The males eagerly followed watching their matriarch's lovely penis swinging about. Oh would they love to have some sex. Maybe later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bus was putting up more of a fight. It swerved every time she came in for a  crushing lick. Then it braked hard. Not so nice for the passengers but the Matriarch overshot the vehicle and tried to turn around. She yelped as she lost her footing and fell over. She kicked up a great cloud of dust and crushed many trees. She quickly got up and resumed the chase. Even more determined to catch her prey! But the bus had managed to reach a nearby abandoned mine. Realising it was going to enter a 'burrow' She gave one final burst of speed and opened her jaws in preparation of a chomp. But the bus reached the mine shaft It smashed through the gates and entered the long dark tunnel. Her jaws chomping shut just inches behind. The chomp echoed throughout the mine. The bus went in as deep as possible. Well out of range of the Hyena. She angrily growled after the bus. She wasn't just going to let it escape! Her belly still eager for more food. She looked at the males and their erect dicks. She thought of a plan to get at the bus... </span></div></div>",

Obeying their matriarch each male steps over one of the ventilation shafts and positions their dick over the opening. They squat down, lowering their cocks into the holes. Their cocks barely fitting in. But with a grunt they managed to push their cocks all the way in. One male had to thrust a few times to get in, his balls loudly slapping on the ground as he fully inserted himself. In position they groan and began to piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands of gallons of hot, salty, stinking and corrosive urine thunders down into the mine. The humans intently listened to the Hyena's outside. Hearing and feeling the beasts heavy footsteps. They felt some rapid thumps, that was the one male's balls slamming into the ground above. They all thought they was safe, but an ominous rumble filled the mine. It sounded like a large waterfall. Their was loud splashes and the shattering of timbers echoed throughout the mine. The disgusting smell hit them first, making them all choke on it's overpowering scent. The humans ran when they saw a great torrent of green liquid thunder out of an overhead shaft and smash into the tunnel they was in. The great torrent was joined by a second and then third torrent of piss that came at them like a tsunami. It travelled fast, sweeping up all in its path. Upon contact the humans screamed briefly as the hot corrosive liquid ate away immediately at their flesh. Within seconds, all were caught in the flow and carried out of the mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone lived when the piss poured out of the mine by the matriarchs paws. She watched the flow intently. Seeing her little snacks within. They were dead, partly burnt away and drenched in salty piss but she was not fussy. She lowers her head and licks up her treats. She didn't mind the piss like taste of her snacks. She chewed them up and swallowed greedily. Once she'd ate all the humans she turned and walked off. Looking for more. The males, still laying with their spent bladders and dicks shoved deep in the ground see her leave. They whined and quickly stood back up. Their erect dicks flopping about wildly as they chased after their matriarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked on at a brisk pace. She wanted to devour more of the little creatures! She could smell them...

With a giggle, she signaled the clan to turn and run. The males obeyed immediately. The Lions watch the group of Hyenas take off. They were happy to avoid fighting to defend their new territory. However, the Lions were annoyed that creatures decided to approach them in the first place. They decided to fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two males lifted their great tails. Under each tail were two mighty testicles. They sat loosely in a thick, musky pouch. Under that was his sheath, which held his feline barbed penis. The penis inside slid out slightly, making a small bit of pink visible. The humans in the city had been frozen. They were not sure why the Lions had stopped their assault, deeply hoping they were deciding to leave. Unfortunately for them, the Lions were about to make the human's home far more inviting for their pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, a blast of urine sprayed out of the males penis. The mist like liquid sprayed all throughout the city, covering many city blocks at a time. The males would then simply walk to a different location and spray again, ensuring they covered their entire new territory. Humans gagged and coughed at the disgusting smell, and were blinded if it got in their eyes. Indoors were also not safe, as if a Lion just so happened to have his genitals aimed at the side of a building, the blast would smash through windows, permanently staining everything inside. The Lionesses decided to join in. They walked to various parts of the city and squatted down. Out of their moist slits, they unleashed a torrent of pee. Unlike the males spray, the female streams could easily flood entire streets and buildings, drowning hundreds in their rancid liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the pride to have coated the city in their smelly urine. One by one the humans are knocked out by the stench, laying motionlessly on the ground. The Lions did take notice that the humans had stopped moving, but did not care why. They simply proceeded to continue the feast on the many lifeless bodies, as well as resuming with leveling the rest of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther away, the fleeing Hyena's picked up the now strong scent of the Lions markings. Frustrated that the Lions have claimed that area as their territory, the female Hyena sniffs around to try and find another \"hive\" of those tasty creatures.

Smaller wild animals are able to use their instincts to get out of the way in time. However, any human creature they came across ended up as a stain at the bottom of one of the Hyena's paws. Roads, farmhouses, vehicles and the occasional small village were completely wiped out without care. The female didn't bother to pay attention to those few creatures.

Upon reaching the first building, she stopped in her tracks. The building was a department store, it came up to about her belly in height. Sure she had seen the Lions crushing these things under paw without issue, but she wanted to make sure it was safe for her and the males. She gingerly placed her paw on top of the roof and began to add pressure. She felt the structure crack and crumble as she added more of her weight. Before the humans inside could even think about evacuating, the female simply fully stomped the building, killing all within. The Matriarch noted the satisfying \"crunch\" under her paw, but more importantly felt no creatures biting or stinging her. This was important to check, specifically when she had the misfortune of stepping on a termite mound back in her world. With a whoop she signaled to the rest of her clan that it was safe. Sure, her little test just ruined a bunch of potential snacks, but their were a lot more on the menu ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan finally entered the city limits. The female opted to walk in between the mounds, crushing hundreds of vehicles under her paws. The males on the other hand decided to plow right through the various buildings, killing hundreds. The citizens hiding inside the buildings could hear and feel the carnage and started to flood into the streets, screaming wildly! The female watched in amazement how the thin path she was on became flooded with those tasty creatures! Without hesitation the female began to lap up the humans. Her canine tongue was able to scoop up hundreds at a time, swallowing them whole without chewing. Any humans she had missed were simply crushed under her paws, but their were so many, she had no need to be careful. As she was just scooping up her sixth mouthful, she cunningly noticed it was the males who were stomping on the other buildings, that were scaring out the current humans she was feasting on. She just learned how to get these creatures out of hiding! She grinned as she swallowed, these human creatures sure aren't very intelligent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Hyenas had been watching the female intently. They were completely unaware that with every step, they created millions of dollars in damages and ended the lives of many humans. The female must be getting close to having her fill, and her pseudo-penis was still flapping around so invitingly. She must be in the mood to mate, right? All three males still had erections, swinging under them, clipping the occasional building that they missed stepping on. One of the males built up the courage and attempted to mount the female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female turned around and snapped her jaws at him, growling. She had definitely not had her fill, and even if she did, she was not in the mood for sex. The male cowered away in fear, giggling. The two males quite clearly got the message, lowering their heads in submission. The female then turned back around and resumed devouring the packed street. The males needed some form of relief! If only there was something else to mount. Just as that thought crossed their minds, they noticed the buildings around them were getting larger, taller, thicker, and about the size of a female Hyena. Those would do perfectly to release their sexual frustration! Walking ahead a little, the first male decides to hump: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many executives and other wealthy people used this hotel when visiting the bustling metropolis. And it just so happened that every room was booked and occupied. All of the guests had heard the news that disaster had struck a neighboring city, so they had all returned to their rooms. Suddenly, they felt the ground shake.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe first male Hyena decided that this structure would do. It reach just over his head, and about the same width and length as him. He quickly tore through all the small buildings in his way. His erection was completely at full mass, and dripping pre. Arriving at the building, the male sniffed around. He could tell it was chocked full of those human creatures, and no termites, meaning it should be safe to \"plunge in\" without getting bitten. He gave another deep whiff, shattering a bunch of the windows with his suction. He could hear the creatures inside scream in fear. This amused the male, as he knows they will be screaming a lot louder once he got started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male then proceeded to finally mount the building. He raised his front paws and rested them on the roof. The top floors began to cave in, leaving two very large indentations where he was resting each front leg. People in the top rooms were instantly killed. Guest began to rapidly flee down to the lower parts of the hotel, thinking it would be safer. Unfortunately for them, many ended up at the same floor level as the Hyenas throbbing genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a grunt, he plunges his dick straight into the side of the building. The thick, bulbus tip easily tears through the luxury interiors and the pampered guests. With one thrust, the male was able to fully insert himself, reaching his penis all the way to the center of the hotel. With another satisfying grunt, the male then started twisting his hips to better position himself. Despite all the sounds of crashing and screaming, the Hyena was really enjoying himself! First off, the building was a lot easier to penetrate, when compared to lining up with the female Hyena's pseudo-penis. Secondly, he was initially worried the inside of the small creature's mount was going to be dry and chalky, but the combination of his precum and the crushed humans \"guts\" coating his penis actually kept him quite lubricated. It did not take long for the male to feel his orgasm building up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans inside were having a much less pleasurable experience then the Hyena. A large majority of the guests were crushed when the Hyena inserted his \"goods\". Those who were not killed were treated to a healthy dose of his male musk, which caused them all to gag violently, making escape even more difficult. Elevators where destroyed and the stairways had collapsed, further thwarting the humans escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final grunt, the male felt his twitching penis fire a load of hot, creamy goodness into the center of the building. The force was so strong it ripped through the rest of the rooms on the center levels. Humans in these rooms were instantly killed, snuffed out by the orgasm. The cumshot was so strong, it even broke the windows on the opposite side of the building! Unfortunately for the survivors, the male let out another, then another! His furry testicles contracting with every additional load of cum. The hot mucus flowed through the lower level, suffocating everyone in its path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there motionless, still inserted in the building, feeling the warmth of his own cum enveloping his softening genitals. He definitely earned that release. After a few more moments of basking in post orgasmic bliss, the male finally pulled out of the ruined structure. With a squelch, his penis flopped out, leaving a massive dripping hole in the side of the defiled building. The males penis was completely covered in tiny red stains, prior humans that were used as nothing more then lubrication. A very small amount of people inside were still alive, and most of them were taking their last breaths as they suffocated in the males thick seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other males had watched excitingly, they wanted to have some fun as well! There was no point having sloppy seconds, especially when there were so many other fresh buildings around! The second male looks around and decides to violate:</span></div></div>",

It was made of very strange abstract shapes. \"Hopefully the insides will feel as interesting as the outsides look\", the Hyena thought. He stomped his way over to the building, wiping out all the smaller ones that don't have his attention. In addition to the trail of destruction, he was also leaving a sticky trail of precum, which was leaking from his excited penis. Meanwhile, inside the art gallery, various people had gathered to see a new exhibit that was opening that day. The many rooms of the building were lined with various paintings and sculptures. Security was very tight, as many of the works ranged from tens of thousands to multi millions of dollars. Suddenly everything started to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the male was up close, he was confused on how to mount this thing. Sniffing around the building, he noticed one section had two large columns of building jutting out. It looked a bit like the hind legs of a female! This must be the correct place to thrust in. But first, the male began to lick in between the sections, as he wanted to add some lubrication. His massive tongue tore through the windows with ease! Thick drool poured in, destroying all the artworks on that wall. People froze in shock, they could not believe what they were seeing! Soon the male was satisfied with the amount of licking, and proceeded to line up his throbbing dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena penis tore through the side of the building and crashed into many nearby exhibits. Paintings were torn, sculptures smashed and people crushed. The strong musk of the males genitals quickly spread throughout the entire gallery. Unlike the hotel the other Hyena had enjoyed, the art gallery was quite hollow, with very large open areas. This meant there were fewer objects to stimulate his cock. To remedy this issue, the male rocked his hips side to side. This caused his member to tear through multiple walls inside the gallery. The male also raised his hind leg, resting in on the roof of the building. This allowed him to get a better angle and penetrate way further inside. This caused further destruction to the priceless artworks, as well as killed even more of the visitors, but gave him way more sexual pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople inside tried desperately to escape, but all the exits were blocked by falling debris. Some even tried to save various paintings, only to be struck by a certain sexual organ. Various artworks and humans got stuck to his dick, which was now coated in a generous amounts of precum. The humans couldn't take much more of this! But the Hyena knew it was about to be over soon, as he readied to unleash his pent up load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the males penis began to twitch violently. Massive ropes of cum squirted from his tip! They flew through out the art gallery, giving all the paintings a fresh coat of white paint. He let out blast after blast, almost as if the male wasn't satisfied until he coated the entire gallery. Any humans survivors hit were instantly coated and many drowned. Finally, the male could feel each squirt becoming weaker and weaker, until the last one dribbled from his tip. All of the remaining artworks had been completely destroyed by is thick, sticky seed. The male just stood their silently, still enjoying the feeling of his intense orgasm, completely unaware of the untold amounts of damages he had caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff, the male finally pulled out of what was left of the violated building. Like the first male, he too left a gaping, dripping hole. He gave his dick a shake, sending various human limbs and other once beautiful pieces of artwork onto the streets below. \"These mounds are amazing!\" The Hyena thought to himself, looking forward to the next time he would mount one of these human structures. The third male was drooling at this point. He needed his release now! He quickly decided to fuck:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frantically scanning the area, the Hyena quickly spotted the largest structure nearest to him. It was a massive warehouse, slightly outside the core of the city. He carelessly rushed over as fast as he could, leaving a much larger trail of destruction then the other two. His paw prints impacted much deeper into the ground, and smaller buildings were send flying, smashing into their neighboring structures. His penis couldn't be any harder! It flapped around wildly as the Hyena ran. His swollen testicles also flopped around in their tight sack, ready to blast out their load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warehouse he had picked was the cities main shipping facility. All of the various packages for the city were processed there before being sent off to get delivered to their respected owners. Inside contained endless rows of conveyor belts and heavy duty shelving. The building was chocked full of the citizens many online orders and other important mailed documents. Everything was being sorted with incredible accuracy, as even one misplaced parcel would bring everything to a screeching halt. Suddenly all of the packages began to vibrate, prompting the many workers to frantically try to keep them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Hyena approached the building, he showed no signs of slowing down. He tore through the parking lot full of delivery vehicles and loaded trucks, spilling their contents everywhere as he smashed them with his paws. Still running, the Hyena used his forward momentum to shove this dick deep into the side of the building. His body flopping onto the roof, almost caving it in. Thousands of packages inside were instantly crushed by the males powerful tool. Many carefully placed and calibrated conveyor belts were sent flying as their bolts were torn from the ground. Various workers were crushed under falling shelving and heavy boxes. Those who survived had no choice but to witness all their organizational work go to waste as they tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough! The male needed more stimulation! Taking a page from his fellow clan-mate, he began to twist his hips, letting his dick flop around inside the structure. His penis tore through shelving unit after shelving unit, causing waves of pleasure to shoot through his entire body. The contents of the warehouse were either crushed under the Hyena's rod or sent flying in every direction. Precum was oozing rapidly, soaking any packages that had not been destroyed. His sexual fluids were so potent, that any packages touched by the precum had their contents permanently stained by his odor. The Hyena seemed hell bent on ensuring no citizen of the city would get their online orders. In reality, he had no idea of the magnitude of damage he was causing. Although, even if he knew, he had no reason to care about these insect's possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male could finally feel his release approaching! Heavy amounts of drool started to drip from his mouth, leaking through the collapsing roof and onto the humans within trying to escape. The structure had sustained so much damage, it started to create moaning sounds, almost as if it was a female bracing itself for the males hot, sticky load! Edged on even further, the males mind was completely overtaken by pleasure. But, does something interrupt the males much needed release?: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let out another whoop, signaling all the males to come join her. With great reluctance, the male pulls himself out of the defiled warehouse, having just missed his chance. He was desperate to have his orgasm, but he didn't dare ignore a order from the Matriarch. The male could feel his climax slightly fading as he walked over to the females location. His large erection bobbed side to side as he walked, still leaking potent pre on the buildings being crushed below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the female had finished having quite the fill of humans. Her belly was slightly swollen with the sheer number she had devoured. She could feel them wiggling within her, moving less and less as her digestive juices did their work. As the males made their way over to her, she sniffed the air. She was surprised to have noticed the strong sent of Hyena sperm. Looking at the start of the closest males current path of destruction, she noticed a building with a massive hole, leaking cum. \"Looks like the males found quite the use for the small creatures homes\", she amusingly thought to herself. This was quite handy for the female, as at times the horny males constant pestering did get annoying. She thought it was fantastic that the males could use the humans hives as a release to give her a break. Another reason to make this place their new home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the reason the Matriarch was calling the males over. She wanted them to help her claim this territory as theirs! There was no need to hunt or scavenge, as the millions of humans would provide an abundance of food. All they had to do was scare the humans out of a nearby hive, and then lap them all up. Sure the humans were small, but gobbling down a few thousand was roughly the same amount of meat as catching larger prey. Their insect like size also made her believe these creatures would repopulate fast enough to keep up with their appetites. \"I mean, ant eaters don't worry about running out of ants?\" the female thought to herself. In addition to the tasty humans, their was of course the added discovery that the males could use the buildings to release their sexual urges when she was not \"in the mood\". This place was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the males finally finished making their way to her, each leaving three fresh trails of devastation throughout the once pristine city. They lined up in front of the Matriarch, shoulder to shoulder, sitting obediently. Each Hyena casually crushing a different building under their behinds. She noticed two of the males had softening erections, but one male was still incredibly hard. He whined slightly as his penis drooled on the street below. This amused the female greatly. She walked over to his erection and began to sloppily lap at it. This increased the volume and pitch of the males whines significantly. The male felt his orgasm building up again, only to have her stop licking right as he was again on the cusp of cumming. She had purposely stopped to keep this male on edge. She could have pushed him over the finish, but she knew keeping the males slightly pent up like this, would provide her with bigger loads when they finally mated. She decided to save this males load for later, much to his displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the whining males saliva soaked boner, the female was about to instruct the males to start claiming this human city as their territory.

All around them were packed with tall skyscrapers, many of them double the height of the Hyenas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female then started to dig up the center of an intersection. Her paws easily tore through the asphalt. Having marked the area to dig, the males quickly took over. The three males surrounded the spot, each at a third interval to each other. The horny male was actually thankful for a monotonous task, as this would distract him from his lustful urges. The males started vigorously digging away, their paws ripping up massive chunks of road. The debris was sent flying under their bellies. It crashed into the surrounding buildings and killed anyone in its path. Offices, condos and stores all had massive chunks of debris lodged into them. It did not take long for the males to uncover an underground subway station, which they simply dug through without care. They sent chunks of the station and trains flying, not to mention ended the lives of all the riders. It only took moments for the once untouched section of city to look like a war zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily watched the males continue their work. Being a clever and intelligent Hyena, the female had strategically picked this spot, and it was more then just easy access to food. She had noticed the small humans made a shrieking noise when a creature smashed into their homes or crushed them under paw. By placing their new burrow in the middle of the human's hive, they surrounded themselves with the humans structures. This meant if another creature was trying to sneak up and attack the Hyenas, the human's cries would alert the clan of the danger. For example, if a Lion decided to sneak up on their burrow, they would hear the humans cry out as they were crushed under the Lions paws. This would alert the group to the invaders presence, allowing them to counter attack. Humans, while not very smart, were sure useful, she thought to herself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the female suddenly thought of an issue with her plan. These small insect creatures seem easily spooked and like to flee, even if it means into danger (or a hungry Hyena maw). Digging the den is sure to kill countless humans. What if that causes them all to run away from this hive and start another elsewhere? The Matriarch wouldn't stand for that! She decided to work on fixing this problem, leaving the males to continue digging the burrow. Her plan to stop the humans from escaping the city is:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The female began to casually stroll away from the males, leaving them to their work. She opted to walk along a different \"path\" in between the human structures, which led to a fresh part of the city. The Hyena found the roadways quite convenient, compared to slogging through the buildings. \"These trails must have been carved out by the past animals that fed on these creatures\", she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite walking along a road and taking a less destructive route then the males, the female still left quite an \"impact\" on the city. Road surfaces shattered, building's facades cracked and hundreds of cars as well as humans were flattened. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep the damage to the humans somewhat minimal, since they would be serving as the clans food source. But the destruction caused by simply walking around couldn't be helped, the humans would just have to deal with it. \"These creatures probably won't take long to adjust to our presence\" she said to herself, casually slicing an apartment building in half with her tail as she continued on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a bit of walking, but the female finally noticed that the size and frequency of the human mounds were becoming smaller and fewer, giving way to more natural looking plant life and rock. She stopped and sat down, surveying the area. She had traversed to the outskirts of the city. Looking back, the Hyena could see smoke rising from her destruction, clearly marking the path she took. The paw prints the female left were very deep, rendering the entire road completely unusable for the humans. She could also just barely see the raised behinds of the three male Hyenas, still digging out the den in the cities core. A massive skyscraper near them suddenly started to crumble and collapse, killing hundreds and burying more. This was no doubt a result of the males somewhat messy antics. \"Oh well, at least the den will be completed by tonight\", she thought to herself. The female casually dismissed the destruction, they couldn't live without a den!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena then looks to her side, seeing many different paths leading out of the city. She would need to somehow block these paths to prevent the humans from escaping. The female hadn't seen any humans with wings when she was gobbling them down, so she wouldn't have to worry about them \"flying away\". Looking at the nearest path, she could see it was full of those small colorful crunchy objects that seemed to litter the pathways. Except this time they were on the move! The highway ahead of her was packed with vehicles trying to evacuate the city, just as she had predicted. The female let out a giggle, how dare they try to escape! She raced over to the motorway, destroying all in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the road were desperate. They had seen and felt the destruction happening to their beloved city, and were fleeing for their lives. Suddenly, they felt the ground shake. The vibrations caused multiple cars to lose control, colliding with each other. The female Hyena leaped, diving her front paws onto the motorway. She instantly crushed multiple vehicles and their drivers. She continued to stomp the escapees mercilessly, growling as if trying to say \"Grr! I'm scary, time to go back and stay in your burrows\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people tried to floor it, thinking they could still manage their escape. Unfortunately, in their hasty actions, they failed to notice the ten foot deep paw print that lay ahead of them. Vehicles crashed head first into the pit the Hyena had made. Before they could even attempt climbing out, the female slammed back down, mushing them to paste. Predictably, the majority of the humans who hadn't been killed by the onslaught, turned around and raced back to the city. The Hyena was once again pleased with how easy it was to manipulate these dumb creatures. She was also happy to see those who tried to traverse her paw print get trapped in them, confirming this path was now blocked for the humans. She made sure to crush any of the survivors still trying to escape. The female didn't want any getting out and attracting other animals to the Hyena's territory. Once she ensured all survivors were killed, she trotted off to destroy the next roadway. Even her paw prints on the countryside between roads were deep enough to make escape impossible for even the best off road vehicles, or even on foot. She had also unknowingly crushed multiple railroad lines, not even feeling the tracks bend out of shape under her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female continued on her way, ripping up the countryside, stomping out the roadways and scaring the humans back into the city. She always made sure to crush a healthy amount, using them as an example to scare back the other humans. Any stubborn humans that failed to turn around were quickly snuffed out. Does the female run into anything interesting as she lays waste to the cities perimeter? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The female Hyena was quite worn out. She had stomped out countless motorways and crushed an unfathomable amount of fleeing vehicles. She needed a rest, and possibly, a good fuck. The males should just be about done digging the den. The Hyena began to make her way back to the males, stomping through yet another untouched section of city. In her tired state, she was not in the mood to reduce her destructive impact on the humans. She had opted to simply cut through the odd building to shorten her path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the females work was not in vain. She had successfully destroyed all the cities escape routes!  Many people had  attempted escape again after the female moved on to the next motorway. These humans were thwarted once more, as they found the road covered in pawprints much deeper then their entire vehicle. Even traveling within the city itself was becoming more difficult. Any road the female or the other males had trotted on within the city was turned into a crater-y mess, and was completely undrivable. This sealed the fate of the humans, as escape was now impossible! Her work had also unknowingly knocked down all communication lines, so their was no way for the city to call for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight was just about approaching. To the females surprise, she noticed the human structures were glowing. \"Probably using some kind of bioluminescence\", she thought. The female did appreciate how this made it easier to navigate paths. Although it was annoying how the lights went out so easily once she stomped on them. After once again reducing the amount of untouched city, the female finally arrived back where she had left the males. Only a large clothing store stood in her way, which she lazily plowed through. The Hyena was too tired to find a way around at this point! Their was of course no harm in creating a few shortcuts. Looking forward the female could see the finished product of the males work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area had been devastated. Entire chunks of skyscraper had been sent crashing into other buildings. Hundreds of tons of debris had been flung, burying massive parts of the city. Tens of thousands of people ended up being killed, and many more were injured. Despite the damage to the local human ecology, the female was quite happy with the males work! The den consisted of a large opening in the ground. Inside, the males had hollowed out a small cave like structure, which was more then enough room for the entire clan to fit. Roughly a full city block was wiped out to create the entrance. Many of the once tall 100 story buildings were leveled to make room. The buildings that stood on the surface of the hollowed out area were mostly intact, only sustaining various cracks and fissures. However, the males digging had also unknowingly severed various underground water, electricity, phone and internet lines, which cut off those utilities for large chunks of the city. This further made life more unpleasant for the humans populous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan lined up, ready to greet each other in the traditional Hyena fashion. The female, still standing in the ruins of the clothing store, raised a hind leg. The closest male quickly approached her, keeping his head down to show submission. He began to lick the females pseudo-penis, while also raising his hind leg for her. She also began to work over the males penis with her tongue. Both genitals were soon coated in drool. She whoops to call over the second male, repeating the same process. Sounds of their wet licks could be heard all throughout the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the third males turn. He quickly rushed over to her as soon has he was signaled. He lapped eagerly, loving every second of having the females scent and taste overwhelm his nose and mouth. His penis was far more erect then during the other two males greeting. She thoroughly worked his swollen penis over, giving it great sloppy licks from the base, all the way to the bulbous tip. She could feel it twitching greatly! Once again, she pushed him quite close to release, only to pull her tongue away. The male whined, he couldn't take much more of this teasing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whoop she told the three males to go ravish the city for food. She decided to instruct them about only walking on paths and keeping overall destruction to a minimum later. Tonight she will let them have their fun. They earned it after digging out such a nice den! She was still full from overeating before, so she was not interested in food. Two of the males instantly took off, ripping through multiple buildings. The destruction causes everyone in that area to evacuate into the streets, which made them easy pickings for the Hyenas to simply lap up. Despite scarfing down mouthful after mouthful, they actually ended up crushing more humans then they swallowed. The third male still stood in front of the Matriarch. He was also hungry, but a different hunger had overtaken him. His dick was still hard as a rock, drooling precum into the street below. He looked right at the female and whined in submission, hoping she would give in and finally have sex. Sighing, the female decides to: </span></div></div>",

She was purposely guiding him away from the area where the other two males were feasting. She wanted to avoid the other males trying to join in and mount her. She was in the mood for receiving just one load. Although, judging from the sounds of the pent up males whines, it is going to be extra large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male was completely infatuated. He could barely pay attention to anything around him. He almost tripped a couple of times as he trampled over various small structures without notice. The female could hear the heavy destruction behind her, but once again chose to ignore it. She still had to teach the males about keeping damage to the humans and their structures to a minimum. She did not care about helping the humans, she only wanted to keep them to use as a source of food. She looked behind her, just in time to see him smash through a shopping center, completely distracted. His eyes were still lazily focused on her backside. \"It's not like he's in any position to listen anyway\" she thought to herself slightly amused. She then continued onward, with the male quickly following, tearing through even more buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a random area of the city, the female ended up leading the male to the untouched financial district. Tall, modern looking buildings stood all around them, coming up to about their heads. Each one representing a major bank or investment firm. The buildings were actually still decently full of humans. The employees were told not to leave, as their were reports of a disaster happening in the downtown core. The area was quiet, well it was, until a crashing sound filled the air. The male had run into one of the tall buildings, ripping through half of it like tissue paper. He didn't even break line of sight with the female as he tore through. He also didn't even notice the structure collapse behind him, killing all within.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTrying to ignore the mess the male was making, she looked around. They were both quite hidden by the buildings in the area. They were also a decent distance away from the other two male Hyenas. She could see great pillars of smoke rising from the region of city that the males were in. They were continuing to indulge on humans and laying waste to the city. She could just barely hear the human cries as they were gobbled up. The females observations were quickly interrupted as she felt a sloppy lick against her genitals. This caused her to snap back at the male, barring her jaws. She was the one in charge here! The male immediately backed down in submission. With the male put in his place, and the fact they were in the perfect location to mate, the female got things started. With a grunt the female proceeded to lower her head to the ground, feeling a few vehicles get crushed under her bottom jaw. She then raised her rump slightly, aimed right at the pent up male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the male finally get to mount her or are they interrupted?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sight and scent almost made his twitching shaft cum right then and there! He was so excited he quickly rushed to the female and attempted to mount her. But in his excitement and nervousness, the male quickly slipped off her side, crashing into another building. The humans inside screamed as their vision was filled with Hyena fur, seconds before it smashed into them. Quickly shaking off the rubble and dead humans of the now leveled building, the male had a second attempt. This time he was able to fully get in position and mount her. Unfortunately, the male was now struggling to get his penis inserted. Hyena sex was quite awkward, and this was no exception!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male began to thrust in hopes of inserting into her lovely pseudo-penis. These motions began to inadvertently push the female forward, causing them to both walk a few steps. The females mighty paws easily tore through a few more of the financial district buildings that stood in her way. At this point she was so horny, she couldn't care less. The males sharp and fidgety movements also caused heavy vibrations, collapsing a few more buildings. Finally after much crushing, thrusting, and lots of spilled pre, the male finally enters the females flaccid pseudo-penis. This causes both creatures to cry out loudly, shattering all nearby windows and human eardrums. Almost immediately after penetrating, he blasts load after load into her. The excess began to spill out, flooding streets with his creamy goodness. After a few more splurts, the male rested himself onto the females back and began to lovingly lick in between her shoulders. He was in absolute ecstasy. The female simply panted happily, it felt great getting filled up by such a pent up male! The female then wondered if she would be having pups soon. With so much easy to catch prey, offspring could learn to feed themselves in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male finally pulled himself free with a rather loud \"squelch\", causing both Hyenas to grunt. The entire area now reeked heavily of Hyena lovemaking. This was much to the dismay of the humans taking shelter in buildings with blasted out windows. Although they didn't have long to cough and gag. With a whoop the female gave permission to the male to finally eat. With his sex drive finally fulfilled, he realized just how hungry he was! The male opted to simply scarf down the remaining survivors of the financial district, leveling the remaining buildings in doing so. The female simply sprawled out, casually crushing many vehicles, and watched the male. She could see hoards of screaming humans get scared out of hiding in their pathetically weak structures, only to get lapped up and disappear down the male Hyenas throat. \"These creatures are truly the most stupid and pathetic I've ever seen\", the female thought to herself. \"Oh well, at least they taste good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the male had his fill, both Hyenas left the area. The financial district was barely recognizable, all that remain were crushed debris, paw prints, and pools of cum. They both made their way back to the den, finding the other two males waiting at the entrance. Their mouths and paws were coated in the red remains of crushed humans. The three males follow the female into the den, where they all finally went to sleep. The day had been very fun and exciting for the Hyenas! On the other hand, it was a living nightmare for the humans. Sperm still leaked from buildings the males had violated, many sections of city had been laid to waste and a large chunk of the population was currently being digested alive in the Hyenas stomachs. But worst of all, their was no escape and the Hyenas were soon going to be ready for another exciting day! Do the Hyena sleep peacefully or are they interrupted?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The citizens had barely slept, many of them trying in vain to call for help outside the city or had been driving around all night to try and find an intact road to escape. Eventually all the humans realized their plans had been thwarted by the clever female Hyena. All they could do now is take shelter in various buildings and pray they would be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight eventually made its way into the Hyena's den. The female was the first to wake. She walked out and stood in what was once a main intersection of the city. She let out a whoop, which woke the three males. They quickly exited the den and joined the female outside. They were excited for another fun day! Still groggy, the males let out various stretches and yawns. One male stretched out in the typical canine fashion, letting his front legs rest flat onto the ground. His behind was also stretched outwards, right up against a nearby building! The humans inside screamed as his fluffy butt smashed into the side of their apartment building. People living on that side of the structure were instantly crushed. The Hyena stretched out further, destroying more units as he dug in deeper. Even his musky testicles caused destruction, as each one smash through the lower floors as if they were wrecking balls! With half the building caved in, the Hyena pulled back from his stretch. The damage was too great, the building moaned and collapsed, killing any survivors that the Hyena had not smothered. He wasn't even aware of the destruction and deaths he had caused, he was too focused on the nice feeling of stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch on the other hand had definitely taken notice. She yelped as she observed the building collapse. \"What a shame, another hive of tasty humans lost\", she thought to herself. She then decided now would be the perfect time to lay down the new rules to her clan about keeping the damage to the humans at a minimum. Otherwise, knowing the males rowdy antics, the city would be wiped out before the days end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whoop, she told the males to line up. The three males immediately stopped what they were doing and submissively sat in front of the female. With a series of whoops, grunts, snarls and whines, the female roughly communicated her new orders about not letting humans go to waste, to ensure they have a healthy stock to fill their bellies. The males would have to now only walk on the paths (roads) instead of plowing through blocks of city. They would also need to scare the humans out of the buildings to feed on them, not tear the whole thing down. The female figured the more of the hives they left in tact, the faster the humans would repopulate. She then gave a quick example of this, the female walked up to a nearby untouched building and rested her foreleg on it. She rubbed the top of the building, causing the entire thing to sway. Cracks formed and windows shattered all along the structure. The people inside had no choice but to evacuate, as they feared the building was going to crumble ontop of them. The female simply smirked as predictably, humans started to flee outside the entrance. She simply lapped up the group of people and swallowed them whole. She then removed her paw, saving the building and the remaining humans inside for later. The males observed her intently, taking the new information in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hyena animal language and examples can only go so far, as it was impossible for her to communicate specific details. She would simply reprimand the males if they mistakenly caused too much destruction. Sure that would mean many humans would die in the learning process, but the female saw this as necessary and was unbothered by it. With the males mostly caught up to speed, the clan decides to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little did they know they was about to meet a 'new' species. The Fox could see the tents atop a ridge ahead. Curious he walked right on toward s them, slowly. His foot steps let off loud booms that echoed throughout the valley. the camera crew were roused by the Foxes footsteps. They left their tents and gasped at the sight in the valley. ''Quick! Get the camera rolling!'' Yelled the presenter. Who was excited rather than frightened to see a giant anthro Fox walking towards him. The crew, despite their fear obeyed and filmed the presenter and approaching giant anthro Fox. The presenter excitedly going on about this amazing discovery and so on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox meanwhile saw little two legged creatures emerge from the tents. He was amazed and curious at what these creature were. They didn't resemble prey, who walked on four legs. They looked more like his kind if anything... How curious.  He continued his approach. The crew and presenter stayed put, filming and talking excitedly about the Fox who was now walking up the ridge. He towered over the people. He carefully walked beside the crew and sat down. His two legs going down into both valleys. He looked down between his thighs at the humans. He grinned softly. They weren't running from him. One was pointing up at him and talking to the others. Another pointed an object at the talking one. Two others held sticks into the air. The Fox was amazed at what was happening to him. The people were no bigger than one of his eyes, he could easily crush them but he wasn't going to. Not yet anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox reached down for the presenter and picked him up between two fingers. He was careful not to squeeze to hard, for he might injure or kill him. The Fox lifted the man before his face and studied him intently. ''Keep filming! Easy there big fella!'' Said the presenter to the Fox and his filming crew below. The Fox could not understand him. But the Fox did realise that the people were talking. He became even more curious. Just what to do with these creatures? He thought briefly then decided what to do with them...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The camera crew filmed him as he stroked him self before them. He groaned as his sheath parted. His member peaking out. He lowered the presenter to his erecting cock. ''Not in there!'' cried the presenter to no avail. He was shoved feet first into the cock's slit. The Fox moaned in pleasure. He released the presenter, who was gripped up to his waist in the Fox's Cock. Stroking his balls with the one hand he used his free hand to pump his member. The camera crew still staying put filming the lewd seen before and above them. The Fox's erection grew to its full length, knot and all. Pre oozed out, smothering the presenter. He was sliding into the lubricated urethra, His struggles giving the Fox untold pleasure and quickening his descent into the abyss below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox felt himself getting close to orgasm.

Two large hands come down either side of her. The Wolf looks down at her, grinning. She faints when his tongue flicks out and laps her up into his maw. He sealed her in his jaws and murred softly. ''Nice and warm in there!'' He moaned. He sat up and swished the woman about in his mouth to get a good taste. The young male spotted this. ''What the heck?! Are you going to eat her?!'' He gasped. The old male moaned ''nah, just having a taste'' he then spat the woman unconmcious out into his palm. He stood up and took her to the cloest building. Gently laying her by the door.

Aren't I friendly?'' He said happily, lulling his tongue and wagging his tail. The humans just screamed and cowered in fear. He whined ''Ah don't be frightened!'' He lifted them upto his face he smiled again then it occured to him. 'My fangs are bigger than this creatures. When I grin or talk all they must see is fangs.

The beach was a lot smaller, so small in fact barely his rump could fit upon the sand. ''Why is everything small and where are my clothes?!'' Asked the Sitatunga. It was at this point he saw the people, to him they were the size of beetles. ''What are these creatures?'' He muttered as he reached for them with his hand. He easily caught several people and lifted them up to his face. He studied them intently. ''oh, they have two legs, two arms and hands. Ooh is that clothes they're wearing?'' He said to himself as he looked the people over. ''Aw you're all so small! How amazing!'' He laughed. The little people ran about his large hand, looking for a way off. Swampy groaned ''I wouldn't jump! Actually I better do something''. He sealed his hand, trapping the people within. He did not crush them however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned stood up to his full height. He towered over everything in the area. The trees were more like really small bonsai trees to him. His horns were exceptionally long ones even by Sitatunga standards, now they were hundreds of feet long. He could see little ships in the sea, just like back home. Inland he could see roads and buildings. 'I must be on a planet like mine, just everything is smaller!' He thought. He looked down at himself, he was of course completely naked he remembered the little people he still had sealed in his hand. ''Oh well. I'd better do something'' he sighed. He opened up his hand to study the people once more. They reeked of fear. They seemed to speak, but he couldn't understand a word of it. ''Ooh mm I scary?'' He asked. ''Well maybe I should let you go'' he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets the people go by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think nothing of it but some of the other passengers seem to be pointing out the windows and the volume in the cabin starts to rise as many people start to talk, first at a whisper but soon growing louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as these conditions are not conductive of sleep, you take a look outside of the window yourself and gasp at what you see. A massive bird is hovering in the air not too far off from the plane. It looks confused and is turning it's head from left to right as if it is trying to gain back it's bearings. It is impossible to judge how big the bird is from your point of view but from the looks of it, it is at least large enough that it would make you have a pretty bad time should it notice the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that is exactly what it does. The bird locks eyes on the plane and it seems to look at your in particular, though that could be a mere coincidence. The canary starts to fly towards the plane at a rapid pace. It looks like it would easily able to outstrip all but the fastest fighter jets, though even those could be hard pressed to beat the massive bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume in the cabin continues to rise as the canary gets closer to the plane, first starting at a curious whisper and soon growing to shocked yelling. The canary quickly catches up to the plane and catches it in it's claws, the hull of the plane denting heavily and the wings being crushed under the powerful talons of the far to big to exist bird. You can see where the canary's talons are as there are huge portions of the metal protruding a good foot inwards. But strangely enough the bird, despite being more than capable of it, does not crush the plane any more than it had already done so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canary starts to fly off with the plane and it's screaming passengers in it's claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does it take the plane?</span></div></div>",

Looking back she saw she had left a trail of fire. Her attention was then drawn to the ground as she saw little insect type creatures running around in a panic. She cocked her head, \"Could these mounds be their homes?\" she thought. She sniffed a few of them and their clothes lit ablaze, making them run faster in various directions.

Unfortunately, she failed to notice the humans collapsing once they burned to death, as she lost interest by the time they began to slow down running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhound continued her romp around the suburb, crushing/burning homes under paw and making sure to sniff any of those strange insect to see them do their little funny dance when on fire.

The asphalt road cracked and burned underneath each step. Many abandoned cars simply melted and exploded from her intense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at a building that was slightly taller than her head. She sniffed it, only to have the side windows explode from her heat. Through the broken glass she could see more of those creatures inside! She took her two front paws and began to dig out the side of the building. Debris fell down as violent flames shot upwards. Her glowing eyes widened as she realized these small creatures were everywhere inside this thing. She let out a grin and barked, almost trying to say \"hello cuties!\". She then opened her maw and let her rancid, impossibly hot breath into the building, lighting everything and everyone ablaze. She giggled as she saw the humans running around, jumping and falling. She turned away from the inferno, not noticing it collapse behind her, killing everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued this for the next five or so buildings, setting them all ablaze. She was happy that all the humans got to experience the heat of her flames. It must be hard living in this environment, she thought, no smoke in the air, no glowing charcoal to rest on, no lava pools to lay in. That's it! She can dig up a lava pool, that would sure make things better for everyone. Back home, all it involves is a bit of digging to expose an underground lava stream.

She had stepped on multiple of these things before on the paths, but she was amazed at such a large gathering of them.

Without warning she suddenly dropped onto her belly and began to roll on top of all the vehicles! She was like a dog rolling around in the fall leaves! The cars were not only instantly crushed, but the fuel in the tanks ignited, this gave her a wonderful massage type feeling as it exploded. The vehicles all continued to explode like popcorn. She started moaning greatly, and even drooled a bit whenever a car exploded near her \"private area\". It did not take her long to reduce hundreds of cars into thin sheets of molten metal.

Metric tons of molten asphalt crashed into the high end clothing store behind her, setting it ablaze. This of course did not concern the Hellhound, who was in fact worried at the fact the ground underneath grew moist. She expected it to be rough, dry and hot, like back in her world. Luckily her paws quickly evaporated any water on her, but that still didn't solve the problem at hand. \"Just what kind of ground is this?\" the Hellhound thought to herself. \"Maybe...\" her feral mind tried to process the information \"maybe the insects have built these mounds where it's the warmest, meaning that's where the underground lava streams must flow!\" She yelped happily with excitement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout wasting any more time, she walked over to the nearest mound, an electronic store, and began to unceremoniously dig on the roof. She was able to tear through it with ease, followed by the second floor. Incredibly expensive TV's, computers and other technology was not only burned, but send flying through the air, damaging more of the shopping center when it landed. Finally with all that \"junk\" out of the way, the Hellhound could get to the good stuff, the dirt underneath! With the base of the store ripped away she was finally able to dig into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her disappointment, it was still just more moist dirt. She backed up a bit and sat down, her rump crushing the store front of a Jewelry store. Her intense heat inadvertently caused all the necklaces, rings, and bracelets to melt inside.

These creatures are probably not very intelligent and simply built some of their mounds in the wrong spot. I just need to dig everything up to be sure!\" With renewed vigor, she got up (knocking down the store behind her) and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTons of merchandise and chunks of building were ignited and sent flying in the air from her digging. Furniture, appliances, bicycles, artwork, nothing was safe from her digging paws. Every swipe of her paw created tens of thousands of dollars in damages, yet the Hellhound showed no sign of slowing down. She didn't notice, but many humans were also sent flying in the air to their doom. Anyone unfortunate enough to still be alive after getting flung and burned by the Hellhound were treated to death by violent impact. They had no choice but to continue hiding in the stores as their vehicles were destroyed when the Hellhound rolled in them earlier. All they could do is hope that the Hellhound skipped the store they are hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff the Hellhound cleared away the last of the stores, a luxury watch boutique. She had dug up so many buildings she had lost count. Despite her turning everything into a flaming ruin, she still could not find a lava stream. Discouraged, she left the once beautiful shopping district to look elsewhere. She walked down another crunchy path. All that digging left her exhausted and a bit sore. \"Hopefully all the small insects appreciate my hard work\" she thought to herself. She stopped walking and stretched out, with her behind pressing against a fine dining restaurant, setting the insides aflame. Her canine vulva actually left a molten imprint onto the cracked brick, which was quite visible as she pulled away. It seems that she is starting to enter heat, causing her genitals to begin to swell. The Hellhound had been so enthralled with this new world, she had yet to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched upwards, she noticed something in the distance:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew if the Lava stream was going to be under something, it was going to be that. Unfortunately, digging up the mall was going to be a considerably large task for her and she was already quite worn out. Suddenly, she felt her backside become irritated, specifically her \"private area\".

The front of the building caved in and ruined many extremely expensive vehicles. The Hellhound once again did not seem to care about the destruction as she put 100% of her attention to her female genitals. Stretching her head below, she extended her warm, slobbering tongue and gave herself a lick. She continued to push her tongue deep within her folds, getting a strong taste of her feminine juices. Pleasure shot through her entire body, making her pant heavily. Her \"lips\" were starting to get very swollen, making the distinct shape like a fortune cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, going into heat again\", she said to herself as she pulled her tongue away. A large glob of both saliva and female juices flew off her tongue and landed on the cell phone store across the street, instantly igniting it. \"How the heck am I suppose to find a male around here\" she thought angrily. Her fiery eyes then settled back on the mall in the distance. The last stores she dug up had a nice \"crunchy\" feeling to them. Rubbing her behind over such a large structure could probably satisfy her, for now. Or she could try to find something longer and thicker, resembling what a male keeps in his sheath.

She once again made a beeline to her destination, simply plowing through anything standing in her way. The quicker pace also meant every paw impact created considerably more damage, but she was getting hornier by the second and had to hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the office building she just tore through, the Hellhound reached the mall parking lot. It was also packed with vehicles like the shopping center was. Although this time she was not interested in the cars and simply let her paws take care of flattening them. The flames from the burning gas tanks rose up and licked her body, giving her quite a tease as the flames passed between her legs. She couldn't take much more of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the mall itself, she was surprised how short it was. It was about as tall as the first mounts she stomped through when she first entered this world. The main difference to her was that it was all one massive interconnected chunk. The Hellhound licked her chops and raised her tail, \"this thing should do nicely\" she thought to herself. She lowered her behind, crushing the asphalt and a few cars she had missed. With her puffy slit sitting against the ground, she began to pull herself forward. Her front paws crashed into the side of the mall as she dragged herself in the classic canine fashion. She made sure to keep her front paws to the side, as not to disturb the section of mall that was headed for her sensitive rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products were rubbed up against her drooling vagina. Her juices were like lava, everything not crushed was incinerated. But not before giving her a satisfying sensation. Her tongue lulled out of her mouth, she was really enjoying herself. To her surprise, each time she dragged herself forward she felt a slightly different kind of pleasure, this was of course because she was smothering a different type of store. Clothing stores had all the fabric flame up, giving a warm feeling to her pussy while something like a camera store felt more firm on her snatch. Regardless, each section offered its own unique way of satisfying her genitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of humans were hiding in the center of the mall. They heard crazy amounts of crashing and then smelled a particularly musky odor? Before they even had a chance to react, the scooting Hellhound was right on top of them. She didn't even notice that she \"ran over\" something different compared to the many other stores in the mall. Only charred husks remained after her pussy was done with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got to the end of the mall, she simply rotated herself to do another \"lap\" on the untouched areas. She ensured every square inch of mall was used to the fullest. Eventually, the entire mall was leveled, converted into a burning pit. With damages reaching the hundred's of million's and the death toll off the chart, she finally lifted herself off what use to be the mall. She gave her behind a shake, trying to get the last few pieces of debris off of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything reeked of burning, not to mention a healthy amount of musk. Her tongue lay out of her mouth as she panted and drooled heavily. \"Ahhh, that felt so goooood! That should hopefully keep me satisfied until I fine a mate, for a little while at least!\" she said to herself, as she trotted absentmindedly through a adjacent parking lot, igniting all the parked cars with each step.

She took a deep breath of the smoke and growled happily. Sure, she didn't end up finding any lava, but she still felt happy that her flames had helped fix such a gross and inhospitable moist environment. She hoped the small creatures appreciated her work in improving their home. Of course she had no idea not a single one survived her little visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sky growing dark, she decided to leave what was left of the burning town. With most of the structures destroyed, she wanted to explore some place new and untouched. She noticed another flat smooth path, but this one was much wider and leading away from the town. She began to walk along the highway with her paws digging into the asphalt. She liked how this path was illuminated by these small twigs, it made it much easier to see where she was going! Of course she failed to realize all the streetlights were collapsing behind her from the heat of her body. She also left massive molten craters with her paws, making the road impossible for cars to drive on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side of the path were no longer human made hives, but rather strange green plant things. They did ignite if she sniffed them, but she could tell they contained a large amount of moisture and wanted to avoid them. She walked for a couple of hours without incident. The highway would usually be busy with the towns population, that is if the Hellhound hadn't wiped them all out. She did occasionally see a vehicle coming her way, which she excitingly chased down and squashed with her front paws. It offered a bit of excitement on this otherwise boring journey.

The Hellhound noticed more structures and figured she could use them for shelter. She ran off the highway, stepping on the muddy grass that further hurt her paws! Luckily, it was just a few short steps until she was back onto a hard surface, the runway. To her surprise she noticed that there where bird-like creatures laying about. One of these creatures seemed to be approaching her, letting out a loud screech! Her predator instincts suddenly went into overdrive, \"How dare this creature try to challenge me!!!\" She ran full force at the \"bird\" and it did the same to her. Fangs bearing, she grabbed the bird by the neck, tearing into the fuselage. The massive airliner came to a halt as the Hellhound bit into it. To her surprise, she was able to rip off the creatures \"head\" with ease, killing it. She almost wondered why something this weak would have challenged her in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, she noticed humans falling out of the wound. \"I guess this bird creature feeds on the humans\" she thought to herself. Which made sense as the human insect creatures seemed very much like a prey species, so it was only natural they are meant to be a food source for larger creatures, she figured. Tossing the carcass aside (which killed the planes passengers), she eyed a massive airplane hanger. It should be big enough to take shelter in! The \"battle\" that had taken place had distracted her from the pain as she ran over to the entrance of this den. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed another metallic bird like creature was inside. Knowing how weak the last one was, she bared her fangs and barked, as if saying \"This is my den now!\". She then proceeded to grab the plane by its \"neck\" and rip it apart. Tossing the now dead creature aside, she began to squeeze herself into the hanger. Various different pieces of equipment and smaller aircraft lit aflame. Despite the roof of the hanger heating up, the rain on the outside was actually able to cool it back down, keeping the entire structure intact. The Hellhound lay down, stretching her legs out, crushing more of the equipment inside. She laid her head on top of her front paws as she looked out the opening \"hopefully the sky stops peeing soon\" she said with a whine, not knowing what rain was.

She sat and gazed around the airport, unknowingly crushing a line of luggage carts with her behind.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe looked around and saw all of the bird like creatures were sleeping, they simply laid in the sun motionless. She also noticed none of those human insect creatures were around. \"I guess the bird's gobbled them all up\", the Hellhound thought to herself. She felt a bit sad, thinking about just how many humans these metallic birds must devour, especially judging from how many were in the gullet of the bird she killed yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her fiery eyes went wide. She could help the small humans by killing off a few of the bird predators who feed on them! She knew it's not her place to mess with the natural order of things, but she wanted to help the adorable insect creatures out.  She sees the airplanes in question were sitting there, still motionlessly asleep, now would be the perfect time to strike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhound gingerly walked over to the closest aircraft and sank her burning fangs in the planes \"neck\", killing it. The weak metal tore open with ease, splitting the fuselage into two. She sniffed inside and noticed no humans, she figured they have all been digested and the birds haven't woken to eat yet. The Hellhound moved from airplane to airplane, ripping open the fuselage, crushing the wings and leaving a burning carcass. She was surprised none of the bird creatures woke up during her assault. Finally she finish ripping apart the last airplane in the airport. The Hellhound is happy to have killed off all of the human's predators, but in reality, she created hundreds of millions in damages and cut off an escape root many were hoping to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds and hundreds of people were watching the Hellhound in terror as she destroyed all the airplanes. They were all hiding in the airport's terminals, and were hoping to catch a flight to escape as they heard a disaster had struck the nearby town. Of course they never imagined the disaster would be stomping around right in front of them. They were all told by the airport's security to stay hidden in the terminal and not to leave.

She walked over to the edge of the terminals, casually crushing various airport vehicles along the way. Once she reached the edge of the buildings, she turned around and lifted her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrine sprayed out of her swollen canine vagina. The fowl burning liquid was lava hot, it immediately set anything it touched ablaze. The stream of urine arced and perfectly hit the control tower, it then flowed downward and flooded all the terminals. The force alone cut massive grooves into the control tower and the urine burned all the humans alive. People further away from the center tried to run, but collapsed gagging at the strong smell until the expanding puddle of liquid enveloped them. The Hellhound just kept peeing away, completely unaware of the death and destruction she was causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter emptying only a portion of her bladder, the Hellhound lowered her tail and turned around.

She can clearly smell the smoke emanating from the various crushed buildings. Sniffing further she can make out the distinct scent of not only another Hellhound, but the fragrance of musky male genitals! Her eyes light up and her backside pulsates, a male is just what she needs to help satisfy her heat! Without delay she sets off from the remains of the airport toward the human hive at full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to find and follow another crunchy road like before, so she was opting to just run straight through the country side. Luckily the ground was less \"green\" and more brown and dry. Hundreds of acres of ready to harvest crops were set ablaze as she passed through them. As she got closer to the city, she noticed that the ground was starting to feel more \"crunchy\". The soft fields gave way to more human made structures that she was trampling over. Various suburbs were destroyed as she carved her own trail of fiery destruction, similar to the other Hellhounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she started to slow down as the buildings around her became taller, this forced her to walk along the paths as trying to plow through these buildings would have just slowed her down. She began to walk deeper into the the city, crushing various vehicles under her paws. The glass on the sides of the buildings began to crack from her intense heat. Her excited tail also crashed around, taking out huge chunks of buildings it impacted. Usually she would be very interested in the various human hives around her, but right now the nearby male was the only thing on her mind. Walking deeper still, the buildings around her now stood just past her head. She couldn't see the male, but she could definitely smell him nearby. She began to heavily drool as she took another deep whiff of his musk. She could also feel her genitals starting to moisten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole place was like a maze! To get a better view, she began to use her paws and dig out the side of a building to collapse it. Cracks spread their way from where she was digging. Eventually the building moaned and fell over, killing all the humans within. Once the dust settled, she realized her view was blocked by even more buildings behind it. Changing tactics, she then tried to climb a different building to get a higher view. Her paws dug deeply into the side of the structure, killing many humans who were on that side of the building. Despite the destruction, it appeared like the building was going to hold her weight. Just as she was about to poke her head over the top, she felt everything crumble underneath her. This caused her to yelp as she fell backwards! Humans in a nearby building screamed in horror as the last thing they saw was the moist backside of the Hellhound. She toppled backwards onto two other buildings, completely leveling them. \"At least those hives softened my fall\" she thought to herself as she got up from the crushed remains of the buildings. She then shook off the rubble. Burning chunks of building went flying and impacted the nearby structures as she shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, she needed to pick a way to get the other Hellhounds attention and get him to come to her. She had two in mind, but unbeknownst to her, both methods would be heavily lowering the local human population numbers: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew the one thing males could not get enough of, the wonderful scent of a female in heat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down (while also unknowingly flattening a few buses full of people) and began to lick her private area. The smell of her heat was quite strong, but not strong enough to travel around all these tall \"hives\". \"They must be blocking the smell\" she thought to herself. This was quite true, her potent odor of her heat was getting trapped filtering inside the buildings, which caused people inside to gag at her stench. She looked again at the tall structures. She began to realize how they looked like perfect objects to mark. But with so many around, which one should she choose... \"I know!\" she barked happily as she got up, \"I'll just mark them all, that will get the males attention for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, she turned her behind to the closest building, raised her tail, and peed away. The powerful stream ripped through the building and instantly drenched everything inside. The fowl liquid quickly made its way to the lower floors, soaking everything until the ground level. She quickly cut off her stream, as she didn't want to empty her entire bladder. She looked back at the building to see a massive gaping hole carved out where her urine sprayed. The entire structure was also ablaze from the intense heat of her liquid. \"I'm sure these small creatures don't mind a little pee\", she said to herself reassuringly, as she walked over and began to casually drench another building with similar destructive results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the entire street's buildings were soaked and aflame. The Hellhound shook her backside as she squirted out the last bit of urine she could muster. Truthfully, she didn't have to mark so many buildings, but she wanted to be more safe then sorry when it came to attracting the male Hellhound. Humans poured out onto the streets as they tried to escape the hellish inferno (and smell) the Hellhound had caused. \"Hehe, helping me find the male little ones?\" she barked softly, only to unknowingly crush dozens under each paw as she walked along the street. Satisfied with her work, she laid down, turning a large chunk of the packed street into a fine red paste under her belly. She looked up at the pheromone infused burning structures, quietly whining to herself \"Please show up. Please show Up. Please show up.\" Does her plan work? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The structures the Hellhound had marked started to collapse, burying the humans in the street trying to escape. Ignoring the humans, the Hellhound got to her feet and started looking around anxiously. She noticed a large smoke plume approaching from the distance. Excitingly, she took another whiff of the air. The males scent was as strong as its ever been! Around her, the sides of the unmarked hives now began to crack, with various vehicles making loud high pitch noises. \"It's as if the entire insect colony is excited as well!\" she thought to herself. Looking at the path of the smoke, it was going to appear in the next street over. She quickly scrambled to that relatively untouched street, which quickly lost its untouched status as the female entered it. She crushed various vehicles and small structures under her paws as she made her way over. At the end of this street, sat a massive skyscraper, twice as tall as the other ones she had urinated on. It was blocking her view of the approaching smoke plume. She stood there watching intently, frozen in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the massive structure ahead of her began to collapse, with chunks falling into the streets below. With a crash the entire thing came down. Destroying a hive that large would be very difficult for the female Hellhound, and she just saw it get taken down with such ease! She could make out two glowing eyes from the massive cloud of dust. Finally, the male revealed himself. He was massive, considerably larger then the female. He had jet black fur all over his body. Like the female he was fire based, which was quite apparent from the burning trail of destruction behind him, and the lava hot saliva leaking from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He look's amazing!\" the female said to herself. She then lowered her head and caught sight of the males package. Two massive testicles swayed lazily from side to side as he walked. In front of them was a thick looking sheath, with a tip of pink peaking out. At this point the female could not contain herself any longer. She got up and raced towards the male, instantly putting her head in-between his legs and started sloppily licking his sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the male by surprise, but he was definitely not going to argue. He simply spread his legs more and panted heavily, letting out the occasional grown. The female was in heaven, her senses were doused with the overwhelming power of the males musk and flavor. More of the males penis began to slide out of his sheath, and she was happy to coat it in her saliva as well. She thought things couldn't get any better, until she felt a long, thick, sloppy lick against her swollen, now dripping pussy. She let out a long whine as the male worked her over with his tongue. Both their tails where furiously wagging, slicing deeply into any buildings they hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious both creatures wanted sex, but where should they do it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These instincts told them to go find a roughly hidden place to mate, so they are not attacked by another animal during the process. The female looked around. Looking down the males trail of destruction gave her a much better view of the hive. She could make out what looks like the center of the hive, as well as an easy path to get there. At this location, she could see massive insect mounds that would tower over both of them. That place would be perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, the female saw the male lazily raise his hind leg. Out of the tip of his penis sprayed a thick stream of urine that drenched a nearby building. The stream was so strong it eroded away most of the structure, spilling piss out into the street below. The flow of the liquid crashed into other buildings and vehicles, burning the humans inside alive. The smell was so strong it covered up all of the females various markings. \"Males\", she said to herself almost rolling her eyes. He couldn't have an area smell like a creature other then himself! The female raised her tail high in the air and walked down the road towards her destination. Catching another sight of her swollen, wet lips, the male quickly followed, infatuated. He quickly grew a massive erection that bobbed side to side as he walked, leaking lava hot pre. The female laughed to herself, she knew who was really in charge! Although that didn't stop her from letting out a whine whenever the male gave her an occasional lick on her private area. Despite her desire to have another taste of the males genitals or to check out all the new insect mounts she was passing by, she was hard set on getting both of them to their destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations of both incoming Hellhounds had some humans trying to evacuate, meaning the roads were now completely clogged with traffic. The female simply trampled on-top of hundreds of stuck vehicles packed with humans without issue or care. Any survivors she had missed with her paws were quickly finished off by the larger male following her. Only paw prints with thin sheets of metal were left after the Hellhounds passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stomped further into the hive, the roads began to narrow. Since the female was smaller, she was able to squeeze by most of the buildings with just the glass cracking from her fiery heat. The larger male on the other hand, ended up fully ripping out the sides of the buildings with his larger girth. Humans trying to hide in the buildings would breathe a sigh of relief after the female walked by, only to have their lives ended by the following horny male. His massive shoulders dug into the sides of the buildings like they were tissue paper, crushing and then spilling the buildings contents onto the street. The male groaned deeply when chunks of debris would hit his erection, sending waves of pleasure throughout his body. By now he would have happily plunged his penis into any one of the surrounding buildings and humped away (something he had already done to other parts of the city earlier that day), but he had is eye on the moist, female prize in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for them to get to the epicenter of the human colony. The buildings all around them were reaching far beyond the heights of either Hellhounds. Usually the female would be very interested in checking out all of these cool insect creations, but she was far from caring about that. She only had one thing on her mind and she wanted it plunged DEEP into her pussy. They then decided to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The male didn't need any more of an invitation then that! He quickly gave her a few more wet licks in her folds for good measure, then proceeded to mount her. It took a few tries to get his penis in, with precum dripping everywhere. A few of the stray strands of cum landed on nearby luxury cars and limos, causing them to instantly explode. He eventually got himself lined up and penetrated her throbbing pussy, with a satisfying \"squelch\". Wasting no time, he started humping away vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Hellhounds began panting and drooling heavily. \"This is way better then those crumbly things\", the male thought to himself, briefly remembering the buildings he had humped earlier that day in attempt to relieve his arousal. While he had barely been able to work up an orgasm with even the biggest of the buildings, he could barely hold back his load inside the females wet, warm, musky insides. The female on the other hand could barely think, she was in such need of this relief, her mind was completely lost in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans could not believe what they were seeing! The two massive dogs were now doing such a vile act right in the center of their precious city! Unfortunately for the humans, they were about to get a first hand lesson on the Hellhound mating process. Suddenly, the heat of the Hellhound's bodies began to increased by 10 fold. Everything within a 100 meter radius started to ignite from the intense heat. Vehicles melted/exploded, buildings were set aflame, humans suddenly found themselves on fire and burning to death. Unfortunately for the city, the Hellhounds were just getting started. The male began to hump faster, causing both their bodies to now glow a fiery red. More of the city started to crumble/burn, with humans desperately trying to escape. The vibration from the humping also caused various burning buildings to prematurely collapse, killing all within. Completely oblivious to the destruction and death around them, the two kept on mating, with the male increasing speed yet again. With all nearby humans burned up, only the sound of the males ballsack slapping his thigh could be heard as fires raged on. Both Hellhounds could now feel they were very close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final thrust, the male knotted the female, causing them both to orgasm. Impossibly hot shots of cum were squirted deep into the female. Simultaneously, a massive blast of heat emanated from both of their genitals, sending out a shock wave. This blast tore through the city, leveling anything in a 10 km radius. All the humans in that range were instantly turned to dust, and others were burned to death as the blast kept going on further. Both Hellhounds were so caught up in there mating they didn't even notice they completely wiped out the city. After some time, the male turned himself over and both Hellhounds stood behind to behind, still tied. The male was still sending squirts of hot love juice inside the female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female looked around, finally coming down from her intense orgasm, \"I thought there were big hives around here?...oh well I guess we can try to find more once the knot is out\" she said, trying to remember if the city had even existed at all. Her heat had greatly clouded her mind. Eventually the males knot shrunk enough that his dick plopped out with a wet squelch. The male walked over and nuzzled next to the female. Both fell into a deep sleep, surrounded by the charred remains of what use to be the metropolis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, both Hellhounds awoke to find:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scanning around she noticed what was making the noise that woke her. In front of her was the male, who was very much awake, licking his private area. Slobbering sounds could be heard as he intently licked his sheath and balls, coating them in saliva. The female laughed quietly to herself, \"I guess he didn't get a chance to lick himself after we mated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the fires around them had finish burning. The female was surprised how the area they were in looked very much like the rocky, chard environment that was their home. She of course didn't realize everything once was human structures, that they had destroyed in their mating process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female let out a large stretch and walked over to the male. Suddenly, the females stomach let out a large rumbling sound. She wined softly as the feeling of hunger was finally hitting her, she hadn't eaten since entering this world and was starving! The male immediately took notice and began to sniff the air. He was more then ready and willing to provide for his new mate! He suddenly caught whiff of what he had been searching for, and set off at full speed. The female quickly followed, her instincts telling her to join the hunt for food. With that, both Hellhounds set off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after their journey started, the female was quite disappointed that their little oasis of \"chard ground\" soon ended. Her paws were back to stepping in that dreaded soft, moist, green stuff. The burned remains of the city felt great crunching under her paws. But luckily for her, the male was leading the way, and his paw prints were instantly drying out the ground before she stepped on it. Also not to mention, she had a great view of the males orbs, which she gave the occasional sniff as they ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled for quite a while without encountering any of the humans. Sure, they saw the occasional small, lone hive, but the female didn't really care for them. She barely took noticed as they tore through a few of them that were in their path. Despite her view being blocked by the male, and his goods, the female Hellhound could tell they were approaching another city. She could feel the number of small hives she was crushing under her paws was increasing, meaning the humans structures were becoming more concentrated. She figured the male was bringing her to a colony so they could hunt regular sized creatures that prey on the small human insects. With how easy it is to stomp through their hives, surely their is a large number of local fauna (and maybe even flora) that use the humans as nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted as she noticed that she was stepping on solely small hives. At this point she opted to run alongside the male, as stepping on the untouched hives was more fun. The humans inside these homes had no time to react. One minute it sounded like a freight train was approaching, and the next they found themselves, and all their possessions, as stains on the Hellhounds paws. Those who were spared becoming paw prints found themselves caught in a blazing inferno, spreading from their trail of destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this clearer view of the approaching city, the female realized: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahead of them was a city, just like the female had predicted. It was smaller then the last one they mated in, but was still a considerable size. What was also a considerable size was the creature that was stomping around in the middle of it! A male Warthog, roughly twice the size as the male Hellhound, was just visible over the tallest skyscrapers. Crashing and faint humans screams could be heard from the city as he ravaged it. He was creating millions of dollars in damages by the minute! Smoke was billowing from multiple different areas, suggesting he had already been their quite a while and had definitely lowered the local human population numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female became quite curious as she watched the creature lay waste to the city. This was the first time they ran into a regularly sized creature of this world that wasn't made of that strange metallic flesh. The female had always been quite curious of the humans, and to extend to their predators. How could these creatures, with no natural defenses, survive against regular sized animals? At least ants live underground and wasps have stingers. Perhaps they breed a lot and have very short life spans, she thought to herself. She sniffed the air, picking up a very pungent odor from the city. The Warthog had DEFINITELY marked the city multiple times with his urine, as well as had a couple of healthy sized bowel movements. Strange that none of the other colonies they had explored were marked with these odors, perhaps the humans had cleared up the animal waste by feeding on it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes then widened. Could the humans be purposely attracting animals with their easy to ravage hives, only to hope that the creature will relieve itself, so the human insects could feed on the droppings? These creatures were insects after all, and insects love animal feces! Her behind then pulsated, she would definitely test this theory next time they found an untouched colony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her deep thought was interrupted as her stomach growled again, reminding her of her hunger. She then realized that the birds (airliners) she had encountered at the airport were made of inedible flesh, but this Warthog was something they could EAT! She crouched down, to be more stealthy, crushing a large luxury home with her behind. The male had already been in a crouched position, crushing a garage full of sport cars under his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the female didn't realize, is that the Warthog was of course not native to this world. It had also come through a portal and had been spending his time exploring around, much to the human's dismay. Unlike the Hellhound's fire based world, this creature hailed from a very moist, jungle type environment. This also explains why he was slightly larger then even the mighty male Hellhound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hellhounds continue to observe the Warthog. The male Hellhound was trying to calculate a plan of attack, while the female, despite being the hungry one, was still curious how exactly it was plundering the human hives. Suddenly, a massive skyscraper shifted and fell over, knocking down two others with it. Happy with the better view, both Hellhounds could see what the Warthog was doing to wreck the city.

From what they could tell, he was covered in thin brown hairs. The reason it was hard to tell the Warthog's color, was the fact that he was mostly coated in some kind of grey mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, why would the humans build a hive around a puddle of mud?\" The female thought to herself. \"Usually, humans liked their hives to be very dry and clean.\" The female then got her answer, as she saw the Warthog slash a building of luxury condos with his tusk, bringing it crashing down. He then appeared to be stomping on the wrecked structure? \"Oh I get it!\" The female thought to herself, \"He's converting the human habitat into his own!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the female Hellhound was quite correct in her assumptions. The Warthog had been quite busy transforming the human's sprawling city into nothing more then a mud pit. In the Warthog's world, he would wallow in piles of mud to protect himself from insects and the harsh sun. After stomping around a bit, the Warthog discovered the human city. The inhabitants of this city were getting ready to enjoy a fun day by the lake that sat at the cities edge. Unfortunately for them, the Warthog saw their city's buildings as nothing more then dry dirt deposits. Once the Warthog noticed the \"puddle\" next to them, his instincts told him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warthog had waded into the shallow puddle. The stench of the Warthogs body alone started to get the citizens attention, as they began to plug their noses. Suddenly the Warthog began to splash great waves of water onto the city. Streets flooded and many people outside drowned, but overall the city was unscathed. Well, it didn't stay that way for long, as the mighty Warthog then trotted his way into the city. He used his mighty tusks, snout and feet, to crush and ground up the buildings, an inadvertently, their occupants. The Warthog was also happy to see with a bit of digging, natural springs spurt out more water, as he broke various water mains. Once he started mixing the crumbling debris of the buildings with the water from the lake, it didn't take long for him to create the consistency of mud he was looking for. With that, he got started on wiping out the rest of the city, doing his best to ignore the annoying human cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhounds now felt confident enough to begin their approach. They started to crawl forward, still crouched down, towards the Warthog. They could feel the homes of the residential area getting crushed beneath them. Despite their best effort to crawl carefully, they were still leaving a large trail of burning flattened homes. They had to be very careful as the smoke could easily give their position away to the Warthog. The males predatory mind had an idea. Looking around, he spotted a massive 500ft tall Ferris wheel. It was part of a huge amusement park on the other edge of the city. The male stood up, facing the area. Suddenly the flames in his eyes grew more intense, and a fierce glow could be seen from his opened mouth! A massive ball of fire shot out of the males chops and silently went flying toward the Ferris wheel, hitting it right in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of fire exploded, covering the entire area with flame! Thousands of humans in the park screamed in pain as they were all brutally burned to death. The male Hellhound then saw the Ferris wheel buckle and collapse from the heat. He looked over to the female Hellhound. He was happy to see she looked impressed, as she wagged her tail, wrecking more homes. Roller coasters, rides and other attractions all burned to create a massive, thick, dark, smoke plume. Does the burning amusement park work as a distraction for the Warthog?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Warthog suddenly stopped demolishing a multilevel car park and looked intently at the fire. He wanted to make sure whatever creature was razing the area didn't notice or approach him. Both Hellhounds took notice that the Warthogs attention was drawn away and continued on their approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Hellhounds made it into the city, they could get a good view of the fruit of the Warthog's labor. Most of the center part of the city had been leveled and grounded into moist looking mud. The colony was barely recognizable. Only a thin layer of skyscrapers around the edge of the city remained, and they reeked of the Warthog's urine. \"He is definitely trying to mark the human's hives as his!\" the female thought. She then looked at the soup of mud and cringed, not only would it be painful for the fire based Hellhounds to get the mud on them, but it would also be hard to get out of their fur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked directly at the Warthog itself, finally getting a full unobstructed view. By now he had lost interest in the amusement park, no longer seeing it as a threat. The Warthog had gone back to his destructive work, grunting happily. He was so focused on smashing up a bank, that he did not notice the two Hellhounds. He used his large tusks and snout to tear the building down. Money and gold bars spilled out as the Warthog tore open the vault, only to have him stomp it down into his muddy concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, the Hellhounds could see the mud coating on the Warthog. They could easily see that it was made up of chunks of building, flattened vehicles, sections of road and many MANY other human made objects. These were all stuck to the Warthogs back, sides, face and genitals. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of human creations, all turned into a simple mud coating. The Warthog was also dotted with thousands and thousands of small red stains, crushed humans. \"How interesting that this creature evolved to use the humans in this way\", the female Hellhound thinks to herself. She is sad to see so many of them die, but she knows she can't get upset as it must be the natural order of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of natural order, the Hellhound's had their own part to keep, as they proceeded with hunting the Warthog. With a grunt from the male, both Hellhounds separated and began to surround the Warthog. They walked on the outskirts of the city, hidden behind a few of the remaining skyscrapers, and avoiding the wet mud. They walk softly and slowly with their paws. They were so deep in concentration, they didn't even feel the many humans trying to flee the city, getting trampled under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hellhound's stealthily position themselves to the left and right of the Warthog, with only an office building hiding each of them from view. The Hellhounds peered through the building's windows. They see humans inside shivering in fear, as well as the Warthog through the windows on the other side. The female grunts quietly, as if to say \"Wish me luck humans\". She then crouches down, ready to pounce. On the males mark, both Hellhounds leap, ripping through the buildings hiding them. The Warthog squeals in surprise! The male has his jaws open, going for the Warthog's neck! The female aims for his back! Do their attacks land?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Industrial buildings and smokestacks that emitted great plumes of smoke drew her attention so she wandered nearer to investigate. The acrid air around the area reminded her of her original habitat and she figured that this would be the best spot to dig. Just to make sure, she stuck her noise against the ground and took a deep whiff, her heated presence creating volatile reactions in the buildings below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a surprised yelp when one of the buildings suddenly exploded, coating her in a plume of powerful fire, the flames wrapping around her in a strange mixture of yellow and green before dispersing into a sickly grey cloud. Taking another step, a similar event happened as a bunch of cylindrical containers near her paw began to violently combust. This must be the place, she thought. With this much smoke and fire bursting from the ground, magma had to be just below the surface!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling over the district and leaning down, she began to dig her paws into the ground. The crunchy buildings were instantly demolished and the topsoil was flung off to the far side of the city as she rapidly battered the ground with her front paws. Even though her repeated scratching against the harder stones below was slowly melting the strata into lava, she was disappointed that she was not greeted with a violent burst of the thick, hot liquid. She moved from one spot to another, eliciting more extravagant explosions from the chemicals stored below while she searched for a good spot to bring heat to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was determined to bring warmth to this cold world.

The Hellhound snarled with pleasure. having the train pushed up her cunt really made her day! She groaned and murred as she squeezed her cunt around the train. Already it was melting in her lava like fluids. The heat she let off ignited the trains fuel, it burst into flames incinerating everybody on board. She didn't care, she wasn't after food right now, there was still plenty of people in the town for her to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get up whilst the train was up her cunt.

The hellhound grinned, he was a giant looming over a tiny little town! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in the town noticed that something strange was happening. Two green glowing orbs hovered high in the sky.

He loved the scent of it, he lulled his shadowy tongue as he just inhaled the little humans fear. The people were pushing past each other and driving madly for the roads out of town. It was anarchy.

However, the size scale needs to stay the same for a storyline. <br>\r\nUnless of course there is a 'normal' size difference A 3ft Feral Wolf to a 8ft anthro Lion. But no 200ft Wolves with a 2500ft one in<br>\r\nthe same storyline! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Anthros &amp; Taurs can be from any time period/culture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral animals maybe either wild, pet/companions for the anthros/Taurs or sentient. <br>\r\nPets/companions may have collars, harnesses saddles etc. Whilst wild of course won't have anything artificial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanguage - For simplicity <i>all</i> characters 'speak' English. Though in reality the giants have their own languages it will<br>\r\nbe difficult to make up several new languages. Humans won't understand a giant and vice versa though to us they would both<br>\r\nbe talking clear English <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'small' planet is basically modern Earth with humans but it's not Earth Itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal places, landmarks, buildings etc. Can be used as a reference in the story though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew portals may open up to remove/add giants, for some reason humans can't be transported through the portals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story can change to follow a new giant instead, but try to leave an option to still follow the previous giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny theme allowed. The giants can be harmed/ killed by each other or by humans, they aren't invincible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and 'attack' isn't always accurate. The giants could be friendly or curious but a 500ft tall giant is going to cause some damage even if it's unintentional. </td>",
