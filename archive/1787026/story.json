When one of them accidentally drops it, a ghostly figure comes out and disappears. The ghostly figure is a nameless, mischievous spirit with the ability to swap things between people. The Spirit never changes people physically. Because they found and freed the Spirit, Bill and the group are always aware of the kinds of changes that take place, but they are not completely immune. The Spirit can still preform swaps on them, and while they are aware of what might have changed with them, they are still affected. The Spirit can swap lives, wardrobes, relationships, personalities, and work/school between people. It can also do partial versions of swaps like relationship, work/school and aspects of personalities. Reality adjusts for each of the Sprit's swaps, and everyone other than Bill and his friends view the changes as completely normal. The Spirit also usually follows one of the group, and performs swaps in area they are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lost and Found</b> - Bill, his friends, their families, and others find lost items. Though they're not ordinary items. They compel the one who finds them to pick them up and while the person who finds it originally intends to turn them in, they forget about the item and end up taking it home, and eventually decide to keep it. Their personality will then slowly start to change to reflect what they found(Ex: Bill finds a doll, he will slowly gain the personality of a little girl.). No physical transformations, only mental. No one will find their change of personality to be odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Hotel of Swapping</b> - The Sanders, the Sato, the Daniels, the Thomas families, and Jenny all go on vacation together. During their stay at the hotel, the families begin to act differently. The hotel is actually cursed, and guests who stay there start to slowly swap personalities with other guests. The Hotel is run by a woman named Ms. Sterious. No physical transformations, only mental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Body Swap Story</b> - Due to a magical artifact that they found, Bill and Yuki, and Megan and Adam swap bodies respectively. Both groups try to pretend to be the other without anyone finding out until they fix this mess, and neither know that the other group has swapped. Other body swaps are allowed.</span></div></div>",

As they made their way there, Bill caught sight of something, and walked over to pick it up.

However, as she was giving it to her, the statue emitted a faint glow, startling the two girls, and the both let go, and it fell to the ground, and broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops...\" Kyoko said, embarrassed by what she had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the statue began to glow brightly, and the seven of them thought they saw a ghostly figure rise up out of it, but it quickly disappeared.</span></div></div>",

They were here on a big vacation, and would be staying for the next two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank god for that.\" Megan said as she exited the car. \"Another hour in there and I might have died of boredom.\" She looked around and saw another car pull up behind their families. \"Ah, looks like Kyoko's family just got here. Mom, dad, I'm gonna see if they need any help.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats fine, just make sure you grab your bag as well.\" their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she said as she headed over to the Sato families car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's mother Michelle then looked up and admired the place. \"I can't believe that this place was so cheap!

A pool, various clubs and activities, a great restaurant and other eating facilities, and even a small underground shopping complex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds pretty cool, dad.\" Chris said. After a bit of unloading, Bill, his brother Chris, and their father wheeled a cart with their baggage into the front desk to check in, while Bill's mother Michelle stayed behind to talk with Irene, Narumi, and Pam while his younger sister Becky play with Julie and Akari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to this fine hotel.\" the woman at the front desk greeted them. \"I'm the owner, Ms. Sterious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm James Sanders. I've got a reservation here.\" he said and Ms. Sterious typed in the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. It says here you'll be staying here a month. Your room number is 487 on the 4th floor.\" Ms. Sterious said as she handed him several keys, each of them had a number 487 on them. \"Here you are, your room keys. They'll make sure you're always able to get in the right room for you.\" she said slyly, though no one seemed to notice. \"I hope you'll enjoy your stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" James said as he handed two keys to Chris. \"Here, give one to your mother and wait here to give her the room number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, dad.\" Chris agreed as Bill and his dad then wheeled the cart over to the elevator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, when everyone was situated in their rooms, Bill exited his family's with Megan, and Ken, Kyoko, Yuki, Adam, and Jenny were waiting for them.

Since the four families had booked at the same time, they were able to get rooms that were right next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Our vacation officially starts now!\" Kyoko loudly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what should we do first?\" Yuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go for a walk around the hotel and get to know where everything is first.\" Megan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Bill agreed. \"Lets head down to the lobby and check things out.\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes lingered on one of the models in particular, a very attractive young brunette woman who was just walking onto the stage. She appeared to be in her early twenties. She also looked around, and seemed to stare in his direction. If he didn't know any better, he might have thought that she was looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, I'm hungry, lets get something to eat.\" Adam suggested, and everyone agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all made their way to a nearby place and walked in. The interior resembled a fast food place. Making their way to the counter, they each ordered something. When it was Bill's turn, he was hungry, but he didn't want any of the greasy, fatty foods on the menu. \"I'll just take a salad. I need to watch my figure.\" he said, adding the reason absentmindedly. No one seemed to notice the oddity of what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat and ate, they all talked for a bit, and decided to split up and look around. Once they were done, Megan, Kyoko, Yuki, and Jenny left together, leaving the guys to themselves for now. \"So, what should we do?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Bill knew exactly what he wanted to do. \"Hey, lets head back and watch that fashion show for a bit. I couldn't care less about the actual show itself, but some of those women were freaking hot as hell.\" He was hoping to see that brunette one again in particular. She was absolute beautiful, and he wouldn't mind looking at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it like that, I'm never against staring at hot women.\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen closed his eyes, and shook his head, a mocking smirk on his face. \"Ah, the desperation of being single. I suppose that I have no choice but to come with you as you ogle those women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up Ken! Don't act like you're taking the moral high ground, your motives are the same as ours.\" Adam said with a laugh. The three of them then got up and headed back to where the models were.</span></div></div>",

Ken and Adam both enjoyed starring at each woman who came out, but Bill wasn't paying as much attention as they were, and was surveying the area for one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't see the brunette woman from earlier.'  Bill thought as he noticed he seemed to be looking for her more than he was paying attention to the other models. 'Ah well, I'll just enjoy looking at the rest of them.' he thought. However, not long after, he needed to use the bthroom, and excused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the bathroom, he stood at the urinal, and his thoughts drifted back to the brunette woman. If he didn't know any better, he would have thought he was becoming obsessed with her. Not taking long, he washed his hands and exited the bathroom, coincidentally at the same time as someone was coming out of the woman's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same brunette woman that he had seen earlier, and had seemed to be caught up in seeing her again. Bill was so surprised that he was nearly speechless. The woman in question looked him over. \"I recognize you. I saw you looking at me earlier.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? No, I wasn't, er, I mean I was, but uh...\" Bill stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled at the boy's nervousness. \"Its okay. Trust me, you aren't the first person to ever stare at me, and I'm used to guys ogling me by now.\" she said. \"Anyway, I'm Natalie. Its nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bill.\" he introduced himself nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are you heading?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, I was kinda with my friends, and well, we were watching the girls at the fashion show...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, you don't strike me as the type to be interested in the kind fashion on display.\" Natalie said jokingly. She then giggled at the boys embarrassment. \"Oh, don't worry. Trust me, you're not the only guy ever to watch something like that to watch attractive woman.\" she said. \"Hey, do you want to make your friends jealous?\" she asked, and Bill looked a bit confused. \"C'mon, I'll let you in back stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure its no problem.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm just gonna relax for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" they agreed. As they set up, Bill looked around at all the people around the pool. He noticed an attractive girl that was maybe a year or two older than him sunbathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group keeps walking around, Bill sees a couple of young girls, maybe around 7 or 8 years old, playing together in the shallow end of the pool, splashing each other and such.</span></div></div>",

It was a large area with a fenced off area. There were multiple rooms that led inside for kids to play and have fun with various activities, toys, and games. The group found themselves watching the kids play. In particular, Bill seemed to pay the most attention to a little girl that looked to be about 7 or 8. She was wearing a frilly pink dress, and had her hair in pigtails, and she was playing with some other girls her age. Ken and Adam also found themselves watching those group of girls, though were watching different girls. As for Megan, Kyoko, Yuki, and Jenny, they were watching a group of boys playing. Unknown to the seven of them, they had began the process of swapping personalities with kid they were watching most, with the three boys swapping with three of the little girls, and the four girls swapping with four of the little boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't realize it, but they kept watching for a few minutes. A few times, the kids they had been watching took notice, and would lock eyes with them for a bit. After a few more minutes, three of the little girls that they had been watching, like the one Bill had been paying the most attention to, stopped playing. The same went for the four little boys that Megan and the girls had been paying attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing out here?\" they suddenly heard someone say to them, and turned to see one of the daycare attendants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all know your not allowed to wander around. You have to stay in the area until your parents return to pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Bill said, confused as the attendant ushered them all into the eclosed area. As they were lead in, Bill watched as the kids they had been watching earlier walked passed them out of the play area. The attendant didn't say anything to them as they passes, though after they left he wondered aloud what they had been doing there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangeness of the situation wore off, and as they stood in the daycare area, Bill turned to his friends. \"So, what should we do until our parents come get us?\" he asked them. They had forgotten that they had been wandering around, and now believed that they had been dropped off by their parents earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" Megan replied, and everyone else shrugged as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll figure something out.\" Bill said as they decied to split up. Ken and Adam tagged along behind him. As they walked, Bill noticed the remaining girls that they had been watching, and felt compelled to walk over to them. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" one girl said. \"Wanna play with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you playing?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're playing with dolls!\" another girl said as she held some up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Bill sat down. \"Sure, I guess we could.\" he said as he picked up a doll that he thought was particularly cute. Ken and Adam joined him, and the three teens started playing dolls with the little girls. As they did, they found themselves enjoying it. Bill started to \"remember\" how much he actually enjoyed playing with dolls. The three boys were unaware of their change as they slowly began to aquire the interests of little girls as the start of their personality swap.</span></div></div>",

Bill and Megan's girly little sister. Best friends with Julie and Akari.<br>\r\nChris Sanders - Age 19.

Theres only four ideas for now, but I'll add more \"episodes\" as I come up with them.<br>\r\nAlso, I may take suggestions for other episodes, so you can send me any you want. However, I won't take many \"standard transformation\" stories, like for example, Bill slowly transforms into a woman and his mind adjusts to the change. In fact, I'm more likely to accept ideas that don't involve any physical changes at all. That said, I will include a few standard types, like a body swap storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules for the story vary depending on what \"episode\" you select, but rules that apply to all paths:<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nNo one option paths. Always leave at least two options<br>\r\nTry to have good grammar. <br>\r\nWhile its okay in early parts of the story, as it goes on, no one line additions. Try to write at least a paragraph<br>\r\nKeep thing consistent with what happened in the path, and read to make sure you don't contradict things before you post<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
