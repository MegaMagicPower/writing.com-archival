Megan looked up nervous at her dad being so much bigger than her, he tried giving her a comforting smile, and she shyly and nervously reciprocated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they go to the room, Charles set Megan on his work desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put sweetie. Daddy needs a couple of things.\" Her father ducked under the desk and pulled out both a magnifying glass and what looked like a tiny jewelry box. He opened up the little box and revealed a large assortment of little doll outfits for five inches tall dolls. \"Tah dah. What do you think, Megan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Megan curiously walked over to the giant jewelry box and admired the variety of different outfits for a doll or a person her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still princess.\" He lightly picked her up with his massive fingers being carefully not to crush her little head. He loved how easy she was to pick up. With gentle care, he lightly tugged at Megan's white shirt and pulled it over her head revealing her bare chest to him. He tossed it aside, only casually taking a glance at the girl's cute nipples. He then turned his attention to her soft long black pants, and slid those off leaving her only in a white pair of panties. Megan felt awkward wearing so little at her size. He set the mostly nude girl onto the desk and pulled out a little blue dress like Alice from Alice in Wonderland. He put it on his little girl and admired how pretty she looked. He put the magnifying glass over her as she walked around nervous. She did like the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a twirl sweetie.\" Charles said. Megan obeyed doing a graceful little spin in her light blue dress. He went through the process again with several different outfits. The process was the same, Charles would gently remove his daughter's current outfit and lightly replace it with another cute one. He would then have her walk around and model as he eyed her with his magnifying glass. The assortments included a cowgirl outfit, a green tinkerbell outfit, a pink princess dress, a soccer uniform with a green jersey and black shorts, and a little white wedding dress. Each one made Charles swoon. He loved watching his ten year old dolly try on these cute little outfits. <br>\r\n\"She is the cutest thing on the planet.\" He picked up Megan as she was wearing her wedding dress and lifted the veil over her head while humming Here Comes the Bride, which made Megan giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you like your outfits, Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Dad\" Megan said after a small shy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look very cute.\" Charles said teasingly to his five inch daughter. Megan felt this was a little strange but tried to be open minded, she was still having a hard time adjusting to only being five inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles couldn't get enough of putting Megan in different little outfits. She was his to play with and he was loving every minute of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Charles say next? </span></div></div>",

To her horror Tessa realized she had not only shrank, but was in fact a cockroach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix multi jointed legs rotated Tessa's new long slender body. Her eyes still seemed to be able to see as well as before. Unfortunately what she saw was her son looking towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom ?\" He asked unsure, and in as much shock as Tessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! It's me!\" Tessa screamed, but only insect noises escaped her new mandibles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart raced out of control as Josh pushed to his feet. His giant form dominated her vision as he moved towards her. His bare feet causing ominous booms with each step on the carpeted floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa looked up at her son, terrified to move. His presence was so overwhelming to the bug woman.  She hated to admit it, but she was scared for her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real.\" Josh said staring down at the roach. \"There's just no way that you're mom. You're just a roach. Right ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me! It's me! Please help!\" Tessa begged, but Josh was unable to hear her true voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knelt down, causing Tessa to scurry away backwards. Her survival instincts told her to keep running, but she stopped instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reached out with his right hand, laying it palm up on the ground in front of Tessa. \"God, I must be crazy.\" He said under his breath. \"If you're mom, crawl onto my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa moved forward quickly. She was surprised at how smoothly her new body traversed the carpet fibers. Reaching Josh's fingers she used her six tiny legs to easily climb up onto his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments as Josh finally accepted that his mom was no a roach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he spoke. \"I can't believe you're a roach. This is so weird!\" He said, his voice beginning to fill with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me! Call your Aunt Rose!\" Tessa screamed up at her giant son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I did this.\" Josh said outloud. \"I wanted to be in charge.\" A slight grin forming at the corners of his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa was feeling uneasy in her son's giant palm. She unconsciously began to back away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am now. It's not like you can actually tell me what to do now.\" Josh said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! This is serious! Get help!\" Tessa screamed, in frustration and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed loudly. \"I bet you're yelling at me right now.\" He said smugly. \"A roach is yelling at me. I can't believe it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa was equally scared, and angry at how immature Josh was behaving. For her this was the most serious situation possible. For him it was a joke. \"Josh, I'm not a roach! I'm your mother!\" She hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as of he understood her Josh replied to her tiny hiss. \"Because you know, you're not my mom now. You're just a bug.\" Josh callously turned his hand over, dumping Tessa back to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa screamed as her tiny body fell unceremoniously onto the floor. She landed with little impact. Her body had far too little mass to fall with any force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom would be so upset that there was a bug in her house!\" Josh said mockingly. \"Should I do what she would want, and squish it.\" He lifted his foot threateningly. \"Or should I just let the little bug fend for itself ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She adjusted herself in her seat to realize it was just as  she thought--She might have gone just a little in her panties too early. It sure felt like it as she contniually re-adjusted her seat, trying to get the scent to stop. The other kids certainly noticed something in the air, but not quite able to put their finger on it. Luckily, it wasn't too bad. But it was just about to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled as she had to make a decision. The teacher seems like they're in the middle of a lesson, but it kind of looks like you may be able to hold it until recess.</span></div></div>",

But really it was just unfair. Why is it that the girls restroom line is always long, but the boys is not existent. I was currently at the mall on my way to a job interview. My first job interview to be exact. I planned on being the newest team member at Mix it up, a local yogurt shop. The only thing standing in my way was the fact that I was nervous and really had to go. Okay so the truth is I have a nervous bladder. There is no way I could make it through an interview without emptying my bladder. Unfortunately by the look of this line I would be late to my interview<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope that could not happen. I had too many plans for the money from this job. Plus having a job is a necessity for my future college applications. I was making it to the toilet. One way or another. The way I see it there was only one viable option:</span></div></div>",

The whole family while bending and sweating a bit with one or two hands on their groins said these words. Lynn Loud Sr:Sorry guys Rita:Looks like we\u2019ll either have to hold it in or find another place to pee. Lori:This is literally so painful and embarrassing to pee toward something else. Leni:Please don\u2019t say pee please. Luna:Yeah dudette I don\u2019t know how longer we can hang on. Luan: I\u2019d make a joke about this but I need to go really bad. Lynn:Yeah holding it in not only hurts it\u2019s also unhealthy. Lincoln:I just hope we don\u2019t hold it in to the point to where we all get a bladder infection. Lucy:My pee is like a thousand tormented souls desperate to escape. Lana:Don\u2019t worry guys I think I can get the toilet working again provided I or anybody else don\u2019t wet themselves. Lola:Please hurry I don\u2019t want to wet my gown or pee anywhere else except a toilet. Lisa:Theres an equal chance we would either pee toward a non toilet, hold it in until the toilet is fixed, or wet ourselves while waiting. Lincoln:I\u2019m just thankful that at least Lily doesn\u2019t have to worry about being in the same situation as the rest of us. Lily:Poo Poo.

Not only did life suck but it had turned into a cross between an episode of the \"Big Bang Theory\" and Superman - the characters sourced exclusively from the Big Bang the situation based on Superman. A month ago she had been an economics student at Oxford University and today she was sitting on a roof surrounded by an elf, a gargoyle and a nerd (though that appellation might have applied to the non-human members of her team as well) trying to control a full out mob - WITH HER MIND. Could life get any stranger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Janna. You are Spock without the touching! Mind meld already!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved Charlie, her childhood friend, her confidante - but at the moment she would have cheerfully thrown him off the roof. Mind meld? Spock? God, how did he come up with these things? And the fact that Xkaltr, gargoyle by race and curious by nature, jumped onto the incomprehensible Star Trek reference like a starving bear on a salmon run, dissecting and questioning the comment, did not help her concentration. The rain was cold, the voices around her began to mirror the angry shouts of the crowd below her and if she did not manage to calm down that mob soon there would be more than property damage. The low levels of terror in her gut, a constant companion of the last few weeks, was quickly blooming into all out panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A strong arm came around her middle, pulling her against a warm form. Sheltered against the rain by Geriel's body it was easier to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrate, Janna. You can feel their emotions, that means you can also influence them. Ignore everything else. Ignore the voices, ignore the cold - just feel them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried. She really tried. She let her mind clear, let it empty and reach. It was hard. She was battered by all the anger and frustration, the fear and violence experienced by everyone below. But for a moment, just a moment, she thought she could feel the sliver of awareness to grasp, to influence ....</span></div></div>",

It was in different colours. Geriel had said that each person with the same ability as hers would perceive and see in their own different way. She hadn't expected this but it wasn't a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart beat had started running a thousand miles per second as she looked around. She could see the people around her, Geriel, Charlie and Xkaltr but above their heads was a cloud, different coloured showing the emotion they were feeling. She saw that Xkaltr and Charlie had started arguing about the star trek reference Charlie had used and there was a purple cloud on top of both their heads. She eased herself inside Geriel's embrace and turned around to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cloud above his head too, it was not a single colour, it was a mixture of red and pink. A beautiful blend. She raised her hand to touch the cloud. Since Geriel couldn't know what she was going to touch, his shoulders tensed, wondering what Janna might be doing. His tensed shoulders and expression soon changed into one of a confused when he saw Janna waving and tapping her hand over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janna?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Janna had touched the cloud over his head, the cloud colour changed to yellow. She turned her head upwards and saw hers was yellow too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you did but I feel curious and intrigued even though there is nothing new here. . ., \" Geriel said as his eyebrows came together and he looked at Janna, confused why he was feeling the way he was. Something must have clicked in his mind because his eyes opened wide and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Janna. You influenced by emotions. You felt curious and when you touched me, the same emotion transferred into me. How about you go to the two idiots over there and try to calm them, pacify them without touching, hmm? Let's see how much you have progressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanna wasn't sure what Geriel was talking about but upon hearing Charlie's and Xkaltr's voices, she turned her head towards their direction and walked. She looked back at Geledriel and the cloud had changed its colour back to violet and pink shade as Geledriel looked at her, his eyes devoid of any emotions but there was something else. She didn't know what but she was sure there was something. She just couldn't point it out. Geledriel signalled her to continue towards Charlie and Xkaltr and so she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear your mind.\" She heard Geledriel's voice. She turned around and was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear your mind and concentrate, you can do this,\" she heard his voice again but she was looking right at him and his lips weren't moving, not a bit. They were talking through telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeledriel's gaze bore into hers and for some stupid reason, she blushed and quickly turned around towards Charlie and Xkaltr. She cleared her throat and then thought of wishing that they had stopped fighting. She imagined that she was touching the clouds above their heads. Suddenly, the noise stopped and she opened her eyes to see both Charlie and Xkaltr staring at her, dumbfounded and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds above their heads had changed its colour to one of a blue - ish, white. She heard footsteps come close and someone pat her on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around to see Geledriel, smiling, pleased with whatever she had done. She closed her eyes again and thought of getting out of this version of the world where she could see the emotions and when she opened her eyes a little later, the clouds had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get something to eat, Xkaltr and Charlie, fetch her some boiled water with lemon grass leaves, mint, honey and cidar,\" Geledriel instructed and both of them, though grumbling, went away to get the stuff they were asked to get and come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanna suddenly felt her vision blur and her knees lose strength, she lost her balance and just as she was about to fall on the group, strong arms gripped her and balanced her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" Geledriel helped Janna get near a wall and then had Janna lean against the wall to sit. He took a spot next to her and just looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess,\" Janna smiled weakly as she gazed in Geledriel's green eyes, \"You said that everyone saw emotions differently right? Well, I saw them as differently coloured clouds above everyone's heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that was what you were doing,\" he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, I have understood that yellow is for curiosity, white and bluish are for calmness and purple for anger or argument. There was another colour that kept appearing on top of you. I didn't understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What colour was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, red and pink, it was a very beautiful, soothing blend. I tried to understand what it meant but I don't know . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't be of much help to you but we'll head to the library to see if there are any books that discuss seeing emotions as colours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realise, Geledriel, that libraries in my world, that is the human world, do not contain such -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we are going to my world tonight, Janna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them felt silent. Janna felt very tired and she yawned, her head slowly falling on Geledriel's shoulder and eyes closed. She was asleep. Her breathing slowed into a rhythmic one, soft and slow as her chest moved up and down. Geledriel sighed heavily and looked up at the sky, wondering about something, quite deeply.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n953 words</span></div></div>",
