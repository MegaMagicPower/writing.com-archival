At 5 millimeters tall he's barely half a centimeter tall and tough to spot for most people without visual aide, unless they're looking for bugs that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Abducted- Sarah Tompkins- After shrinking to one centimeter tall Sarah was kidnapped to be put up for online auction through the dark web, where she is purchased for fun by another woman.

The infected's size ranging between a height of 1 millimeter and 3 inches tall. With 750,000 people currently missing it's impossible to know for sure if these citizens of the world have been abducted, stepped on, or lost by mysterious means. Some scientists suspect that the disease may be progressive, causing the subject to shrink further after a certain period. However, no cases of this happening have been confirmed by scientists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow professionals in their field as they must adapt to a new way of tackling a world bigger than themselves.</td>",
