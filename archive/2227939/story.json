The four had been inseparable in school but had drifted apart after graduation, they had kept in contact, pairs meeting up over the years but all four never being in the same place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Until now. Their 20 year high school reunion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0None of them knew what to expect from this. For the first time since Ty joined the military fresh out of high school, they were all living in the same town but Derek, the last to return, had not had a chance to meet up again until that night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Liam! It's great to see you! The gang's back together as of tonight!\" Jonas cheered as they grabbed their name tags and giving his old friend a hug.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's great to see you too Jonas.\" Liam groaned, not returning the hug. He'd always hated Jonas's touchy-feely nature. It drove him nuts since he didn't even like bumping into people by accident. It wasn't even until his fifth date with his wife that he'd finally steeled himself up enough to kiss her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jonas! Liam! Is Derek here yet?\" Ty joined the others to grab his name tag which he promptly stuffed into his dress uniform's pocket so he wouldn't be out of uniform.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liam rolled his eyes. \"Really Ty? Your dress uniform? You realize it's been years since you wore that right? You at least could have gotten it fitted.\" He glanced at Ty's gut that bulged some, straining the buttons just a tiny bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like you're one to talk!\" He poked Liam's much more pronounced gut that was amplified by his tailored suit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but I didn't join a career that requires physical perfection.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey. The military doesn't require perfection, just some degree of human fitness.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah. Anyone know when Derek is supposed to get here?\" Jonas interrupted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right now!\" He jumped onto Jonas's back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get off you monkey! You weigh a ton!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm the monkey and yet your the ones wearing monkey suits!\" He laughed. Ty chuckled. Out of all of them, only Derek, in his own fashion, hadn't worn some sort of suit, instead opting for jeans and a t-shirt. \"So what have you guys been up to over the years?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Military, obviously.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"CPA.\" Liam stated.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Teacher and coach at the high school.\" Jonas informed. \"And what about you? None of us have any idea what you've been up to for years. Even Ty came around more often than you. And he was in the military.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, I was acting.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Acting? You? You hated drama class in school.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you just thought I did. You remember all those \"band practices\" and \"out of town gigs\" I went to? Play rehearsals.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? Seriously? You kept that from us all this time? Why didn't you tell us?\" Ty demanded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You guys only thought the arts were good for getting girls. I wasn't interested in that. I just wanted to express myself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude! You knew you could tell us anything. We're practically family.\" Jonas told him, putting an arm around his shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I know. Now let's go party!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone cheered and headed into the gym to party through the night until they all had to get home in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now you get to decide who's going to be followed as the pounds start packing on, all the guys are 38 except Derek who's 39:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ty- 6'3\", 229 pounds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mostly muscular with some fat creeping onto his gut<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Retired from the military four years ago, now a manager at the local super market as well as a volunteer fire fighter<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Single but ready to settle down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liam- 5'11\", 236 pounds<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chubby all over<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CPA<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Married with one son<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0severely dislikes physical contact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jonas- 6', 199 pounds<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skinny with a slight starter gut<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0High school geometry teacher as well as the baseball coach<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Single, looking to adopt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Derek- 5'9\", 186 pounds<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Muscular, very athletic<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Former actor, mainly a backup dancer.
