In fact, she had been wearing this specific outfit for so long that the clothing was starting to get worn down and raw in some places. But Crystal didn't care about that, they still worked just fine. She was there to play and put on a show like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she got on to the outdoor stage, got the cue, and began to perform.

Amiee, however, would vouch for it and the couple songs similar to it on the same disc; saying that \u2018Shotgun Shockers,\u2019 while still being upbeat and punchy, would ease newcomers into the band\u2019s antics and allow Crystal to conserve her energy for later.

She never gave much of a thought about how a near cloudless rain might feel like but the current sensation was invigorating. The cool winds and the sun battled it out while water seemingly continued to fall down from a clear blue sky. The mind of the blue haired girl didn\u2019t know whether to make heads or tails on how it felt but Crystal didn\u2019t really need to use her mind on this matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree songs later and the freaky weather was still as strong as ever. Crystal was loving it and so was the crowd: dancing, cheering and screaming what the lead guitarist assumed was the lyrics to the song they were playing. She didn\u2019t want to think about it but the blue haired girl felt her band was failing to meet the level of excitement coming from the crowd. Sure, she could tell that they were having a good time but security had already positioned themselves to contain the frenzy below and the sun was still out. This concern wasn\u2019t really about competing with her audience, while her wishes did entail doing just that, but wanting to keep the people entertained and proving to them that Total Breakdown was as wild as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly consumed with thought, Crystal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sound sent excited chills through her mind that sent her hopping and playing hard, left, then right. She moved closer to the crowd as she jumped, but her left heel did not hold. A small puddle had formed in a dent along the stage floor, and she slipped sideways. Agile as she was, she turned her hip to move with it, her fingers somehow still playing the tune. If anything, it almost looked planned. Only she noticed the small feedback as the bottom of the guitar tapped the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to keep the energy in her small dive, she sprung back to her feet, but as she did, pushed her weight down on her guitar for balancing help onto the heels. As she swung her left leg up, she felt a hem give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt was pleated, and when she stood up it was not particularly noticeable, however a slit now formed from the front-left side of her left leg, all the way from the bottom to just a inch below the waistband. The pleats folded over the seam, but she immediately felt conscious about what would happen if she moved too quickly to the left. To make up lost time, she bounded herself to the right, fearing moving a direction entirely. She knew, however, she could not spend a whole performance standing still, or never moving left. As an experiment, she gave a small jolt of her hip to the left with a step, looking down to see just how bad it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part did not fully appear up to the edge, but the pleats did part enough to show far past her stocking and up the side of her leg. She was at an awkward angle to look, but she was fairly sure no underwear was on display, and so decided to attempt to carry on with the same fervor as before. She did hear with that hip jolt a small swell from the crowd, and felt a flush in her cheeks. Was it because some of them noticed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was becoming far too distracted from the performance - the real purpose of being here. Now slightly more wary of her surroundings, she attempted to carry on as she did before, though ground was still a bit wet, and her clothes still quite old.</span></div></div>",

She thought of sweaters and how it shrunk-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and belted out more lyrics. She had to keep focus, because the crowd was excited and she was not. She had to keep them going, to match their enthusiasm at any cost. Anyone could be watching, after all, that could affect their careers forever! She could not let them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rocked. She danced. She moved and thrust herself as fast as she did before. She felt a slight extra weight on her clothes, but no chill from the brief rain at all - she was moving too much for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the bit of apprehension, though, she still had that kept her from jutting out with her left leg. If the split was visible, it was not bad, however. Certainly it was not. It couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized her thoughts were distracted again, and moved even harder, jumping in the air (putting her guitar against her skirt to keep it from flaring up) and landing on her knees. As she did, she felt something off the moment she stood back up. No one except her had really noticed, but as she pressed her guitar against her skirt, the end of it slipped against the waist line of her skirt on the right side - the side with the belt buckles for her skirt. Her movement pushed the buckle back, and  her jolt up in the air slipped the prong loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt sat loose, once placed underneath her fishnet and shirt, just half an inch below her belly button, but now was sagging just one more inch to the tops of her bony hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in the crowd could see, but Crystal was all the more nervous. If she moved too much without keeping her legs apart, the skirt could slip down further. If she focused on too much awkward movement, she could easily fall, however.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crystal's skirt wobbled at the width of her hips, so she attempted to keep her pose wide and proud. She found this strange, as she typically would jump and sway with her knees closer together. Either that, or being so conscious of her stance now just made every step feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still tried to keep the crowd going. They were ecstatic - crazed with each wave of bravado between her voice and hands. Each leap make half the audience jump in the air. She knew another jump would jostle her skirt a bit, but she just went half a minute without it budging at all - she decided she needed to keep the audience going. All she had to do was land with a wide stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to imagine gymnasts. They often landed with their legs together, though, which would not bode well for her. She attempted to land with her feet a bit in front and behind her, around shoulder length apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt immediately plummeted. She gasped at that, a slight mistake into her microphone, and knelt just slightly. The skirt did not fall all the way, but now sat below her prominent hip bones. Her light blue panties could be seen above them, though still slightly covered by the black shirt she wore. She continued to play, clearly distracted, and wondered what her band mates were thinking she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now realized her skirt was much heavier than it was. The rain did that, and it also wet the rest of her fairly well. Everything she wore was at least a bit wet, and sitting downward. Her top was still entirely fine, and she knew she had to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up a bit slow, and tried to make it seem she did it for effect in the song. The effect seemed more sultry than she intended, but she decided that was not an inherently bad. Her hips stuck to the side prominently, and she almost rolled to a standing position. Her skirt pressed down against the tops of her thighs, and almost an inch of her panties were visible. From the front, both her guitar and the bottom of her black shirt kept it well covered, although from the back Aimee's eyes were drawn to the hint of light blue, bouncing and bounding to the beat of the song.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The skirt did not seem to be going down any further, and Crystal took that as a safer sign. Her hips and thighs were not wide, but did have enough angle and curve to them to prevent them from sneaking down any further. Nothing was noticeable, at least from up front, and so she did not care. She moved and she jumped. A bit of her leg showed as the slit of prominent, but why did that even matter? It was hardly anything. She had a more important thing to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she was getting out of breath. Perhaps she had panicked too much for those moments and forgot to breath, but she was losing energy by the end of the song. She moved to stage left and continued, deciding to remember to signal Allison to wait a few extra seconds for her to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered she was supposed to avoid this part of the stage. It dipped down slightly with uneven floor boards, and that was why they did not space out as large. She immediately began to move back with the end of the song now happening, and slipped on a small pool of water that formed right before the stage regained its true altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on her butt on the edge, which gave a short sharp pain up her tailbone. The crowd was unsure if it was just another move for the climatic end, but her band mates were looking, a little worried. Crystal looked to Allison, who gave her a quizzical look in return. Crystal shook her head, indicated she needed a few moments, so as the crowd still cheered and waited, Crystal knew she had a few seconds. She began to slide up and stand, but felt a strong pull, and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties caught against the unfinished, revealed edge of the floor board. When she slid upward, they rode down, strained in stretch, and she might have felt a vibration. Maybe it came from the crowd reverberating the stage itself, but she was unsure. It was well localized to her waist. The elastic might have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt was still on, of course, but it was no longer tight, which meant if the elastic did go, her panties could fall almost any moment. That would be a larger issue in terms of moving around, as well as even trying to keep still.</span></div></div>",

She decided to wiggle here while most could not see exactly what she was doing, and she took her left thumb and pulled down at her panties. As she thought, it slipped off all too easily, the elastic far gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood back up slowly, bending and moving while thinking of each motion. She decided not to get too close to the edge of the stage - now would be an awful time. She pulled on her skirt to get it up some, but it fell back down. It really was riding low, and she could not fumble the buckle back without making it obvious.  She glanced under her guitar at what was on show, and realized her guitar did not completely cover all of her exposed hip. She adjusted her strap down just slightly to help. Now, the skirt was low enough to show the beginning of the bikini bridge between her hips below her toned stomach. Aspects of exposure were fine, but only if <i>she</i> controlled it! That, and exposing herself without panties was a bit farther than she ever wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved back up front to prepare for the next song, and noticed someone at the side of the panties in the crowd was now pointing at the dent, seeing something. Her mind flashed in horror and worry, afraid more would now take note. The man then tried to move up the stage, clearly trying to grab for it despite it being several feet across the stage, and security made their move downward to stop him. More of the crowd took notice, as there was a ruckus and no song. The crowd did not quite yet know why a kerfuffle was happening, but it was clear something was. The bumping of the people moving against the stage to see, as well as the extra bodies moving hard across the faltering area of the stage caused the entire area to move - the cheap equipment even shaking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the stage rocked, the janky equipment began to feel the effects. A rope in the back kept one of the film colored lights in place just above the center of the stage, used to accentuate their looks when it became darker and the songs a bit slower. Since the usage of the stage was a bit condensed, both Jen, Aimee, and Crystal were fairly close to the light when it fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash was insurmountably loud, and even caused feedback in their microphones. A lot of the audience groaned and looked among themselves, the band members, or simply shut their eyes hard as if it would help. The shattered glass ended before it reached any of Total Breakdown, however Crystal was closest to the fall, and jumped backward into Aimee. Jen was incredibly startled and simply fell on her back, though did manage to make sure no damage happened to her bass. Allison was furthest back, and while she jumped a little, was otherwise unphased. The song did end, however, and people in the crowd grew a bit silent in wonder. Security should have come out to check on the girls, but they were busy pulling back the man who climbed on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jump rode the slit on the right side of Crystal's skirt up, exposing her leg as it was bent upward in its entirety. Her skirt itself was folded upward a bit, and the bottom hem barely was long enough to cover between her legs as it draped. Her back was pressed against Aimee, who had fallen with Crystal. Aimee apologized at first and tried to back away from Crystal, but held just a moment. It was kind of nice to have Crystal lean against her like this. Instead, she just sat up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal sat up as well, rather cushioned and fine. She slid down from Aimee a bit, and felt herself a bit attached. As Aimee looked down, she noticed the back of Crystal's fishnet shirt had interlodged itself in the buckles of her large belt. Aimee was a bit startled and confused at first, and tried to move back from Crystal, which only made Crystal fall back, her back pulled into Aimee's thighs. There was the sound of a tear of the fishnet, and Aimee felt her own belt tug at her long pants, riding them down just a bit off her left hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal reached behind her and gave a small chuckle as she dislodged the shirt from the belt. She was not completely sure what it was attached to, but she was sure she was free, and stood again, looking back to see if Aimee was alright. The rip on the back of the fishnet shirt was rather small, and in the center of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee, all the while, stared at the length of what she considered a perfect leg, bending and then standing in its entirely so close to her. When Crystal asked if she was alright, she just nodded, and stood up quickly. The movement, though, drove her belt and pants a bit further down her hip. She normally kept her pose inward and reserved, and as such, the pants slipped another half inch lower before Aimee noticed more than Crystal's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was in a different situation. Her hard hit on the ground caught her thong against one of the floorboards. As she stood up, even slowly, she felt the thin garment snap. Wary of her own situation, and while most attention was in between the two band mates interacting, she stuffed the ends of the thong under the folds of the waist line of her low pants, not wanting it to really be noticed. Seeing a thong was fine, but seeing some loose strands of elastic sticking up seemed a bit gross. As she stuffed the ends of her thong out of sight, the pressure pushed her own pants lower. The back was designed to be higher than the front, but it was low enough to show just the top crease of her butt, and along the front and sides her pants were as low on her as the skirt was on Crystal, now showing the beginning hint of her mound. For Jen, though, it was hardly noticeable, but she did feel her chest a bit more loose. She could not really check, but she thought perhaps something had happened to the laces on her bodice. The ties would be fine, though, surely, and it might have just knocked a little loose from the fall. She shrugged it out of mind.</span></div></div>",

Looking too closely at the ground exactly where her feet landed, she was not watching completely where her feet were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot bumped into an amp at the last chord, and on instinct she wanted to stick her hands up in defense, though remembered her guitar. Instead, she tilted her body so her back would hit the amp. There was a clumsy clunk and some feedback, but it blended into the noise of the end of the song just fine. People cheered and jumped, and Crystal, a little winded from the events of the last song, needed to match them. She jumped up with the crowd and moved back toward the center of the stage, but felt, this time even heard, a rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rips of her shirt got caught against the edge of the old amp. Most of the back of the shirt, and a good portion of the front, simply came off. It was already old, as well as ripped. There were the straps over her shoulders still, and enough down her front to cover her light blue bra, though her back was exposed aside from the fishnet shirt. She kept her pose a few moments, unsure what to do. Exposing the back of her bra was not that bad of a thing, but now only her guitar was hiding the fact her skirt was riding the top of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind her to her band mates and saw Aimee a little alarmed, and Allison was giving a quizzical look. She was asking a question with her eyes and Crystal, not wanting to let them down, just nodded. She did not know what it all meant, but Allison gave a smirk, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison clicked off her sticks to the beat of the next song, and Crystal immediately had to play. Why was she doing this? Did she not notice? Surely the freshly ripped shirt would have given away something was amiss. Crystal did not even have time to fix her skirt now, and her attire was not quite as well attached to her as Jen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Crystal <i>did</i> just nod, and both Allison and Jen had said Crystal was too energetic on stage, and something could happen if she got carried away. How could she help it, though? The crowd was so very intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still plenty of the set left, however.</span></div></div>",

Carefully watching the floor, Crystal backed up to be closer to the rest of her bandmates. This allowed her to keep the audience from seeing her shirt's severe damage in the back and her exposed bra straps while also bringing everything closer in to keep the audience's attention on the band as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a terrible waste of all that stage space, but that seemed to be the only real answer to the situation. Of course... there was always the possibility of Jen or Aimee stepping up and amping up the crowd with their own performances. The energetic act was normally Crystal's domain, but she knew the rest of the band had seen it more than enough times to have a general idea of what the audience was expecting. All it would take was a subtle hand signal for the other girls to get the message and hopefully step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal continued to focus on her guitar work, but couldn't help wondering why she seemed to be having such awful luck with her outfit tonight. One or two minor things could be written off as a coincidence, but the seemingly constant mishaps her wardrobe was experiencing seemed less like coincidence and more like some kind of curse. Of course such a notion was nonsense, curses weren't real and luck was just an abstract concept to justify coincidence... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRationally that made perfect sense, but the events that were soon to follow in the wake of Crystal's signal to Aimee and Jen would seem to defy rationality and firmly support not only the idea of bad luck, but that it was contagious.

It looked tacky, if not embarrassing, where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did only have a few seconds, so she had to move quickly. She was glad, though still uneasy, to feel the skirt had found a stopping place at the round of her thighs. There was a bit of underwear showing, but it was not too bad.

Things could have calmed down, but was that was Crystal wanted for the show?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal moved to the front of the amp, off to the side of the stage and out of the way.

It bit into the fishnet, and as she staggered to get back up, she noticed she was quite stuck. In a quick panic, she reached her hand behind her back and ripped whatever was attached to the amp and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still on her back and away from the crowd, but she noticed what was wrong: she had undone her own bra. Combined with that the fishnet was ripped from the small of her back down the path it scrapped the amp, even the form-fitting fishnet was not covering much from her back to her right hip. Her bra was still on, however, and even covered in front due to the bit of shirt she had left, but as she moved she felt it jostle and shift.</span></div></div>",

Except now wasn't intimate. Was it? It was passionate, if anything. She had fantasized about this very thing, though this was admittedly a sort of strange way to achieve the fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee clipped off the straps from behind, and pulled the bra out sideways. As she did, Crystal snapped around with a crazed, \"WTF?!\" face. The light blue bra was clearly visible from the crowd, and they came up with a huge cheer. Aside from the top of Crystal's ripped black shirt and half of her form fitting fishnet, her back was bare, and her skirt low enough to show some of her panties. As Crystal whipped around to look at the audience with her guitar close to her chest, they could see her shirt was still up front, in various ripped loops that draped over her chest rather well. Underneath that was still the fishnet, see through enough to see her skin tone, and fitting tightly around the top of her stomach, and on up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt was ripped and loose, so too much jumping could be bad, even if the fish net was well put together. Exposing some skin for the crowd, not even all too much skin a bikini would not show, was not that horrible, but Crystal needed at least a semblance of control to be comfortable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, though, was even more wild than before.

It was only a few seconds, but she thought it might be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers, though, fumbled as she moved. She did imagine before messing with Crystal's bra, though not really in a situation like this, and not quite so much putting it on. The mere thought of touching Crystal's bra made Aimee all the more nervous, and her fingers staggered some. She pulled and pushed on the back of the bra in her fixing, and noticed she had clasped in some of the fishnet shirt. She decided to quickly fix it, grabbing the fishnet to pull out, but then Crystal jumped forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal had thought Aimee was done. She could not see, after all, and it felt all secured once again. When she moved forward, however, there was another rip. The already ripped fishnet continued to pull off, removing all of it across her back, now sitting in Aimee's stunned hands. Crystal's bra was indeed back on, but now the rest of her back was revealed aside from the bra, the very top of her fishnet shirt at the back of her neck, and the very top of the loop of her shirt. The effects played across her front as well. The bra was there, as well as a few loose strands of fishnet, and just enough loops of ripped shirt to cover most of the hints of light blue cups. Her stomach was now completely exposed, which only further accentuated the lowered state of her skirt and the reveal of an inch of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal, not quite thinking, spun around to show her back to the audience. She did it to give Aimee the biggest, \"WTF\" face she could, but then turned back forward, knowing she showed everyone, band mates and crowd, what sort of state she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was a little confused, at best. Many were cheering for the show of skin. There was underwear, after all, and maybe it was all planned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she knelt, she felt the looseness of her chest dangle, and her bra came a bit loose around her shoulders. The straps fell to her elbows, and her black shirt, ripped well aside from the front, hung forward so it did not cover her chest. She did not really notice, though, but much of the crowd watched the form fit fishnet jiggle back and forth, getting a good view of the now exposed sides of her chest as they moved with her hops. She jammed hard on her guitar, sang a verse, and then took a chance on her band mates. It was a short bridge, which could be played by anyone. She whipped off her guitar, set it on the stand beside her, and jumped into the crowd back first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was caught. Everyone had been gathering. She heard Aimee pick up with louder chords, and Allison pressed a beat that would drown out any mistakes the sudden change would cause. Crystal felt hands all across her body, pressing against the bottom of her thighs, her butt, and her near naked back as she was taken back and forth, around in a circle in the crowd. People yelled and swelled closer, trying to have one moment of lifting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt things pull on her. It might have been intentional, but there were many hands reaching and grabbing. With her back on the crowd, she was safe from the majority of anyone trying something too funny, and she had rarely encountered a crowd surf with anyone that ended in a very poor experience. After all, security was not too far, and she could always twist and struggle - it would be a sign to cut the song and retrieve her in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not struggle much, however, aside from a short twist to see what was happening, as a finger looped around the bra strap across her right elbow. The hand seemed to be simply reaching for her, and she did not want to really cut something short just because of an accident. The pull was rather short, but the elastic drew taut and wrapped down her wrist. She thought she could fight it, but she was moving away. It was almost a natural action that she pulled out of the strap, leaving only her left strap around her elbow. Her right breast was still under its cup, but now as loose as ever, bouncing and turning as she surfed across the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stockings were a bit tight on her, but with all the motion and dragging fingers across her legs, they lowered to her calves in a pool She also felt a drag across her skirt. The belt was not buckled to keep it on, after all, and continued to get caught or grabbed by people wanting to hold her. She felt it ride lower and lower. Her panties were still in a good spot, but the skirt was half way down her butt, and even brought the front of her skirt to the very crest of her mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a brief touch press between her clothed butt and knew it was time. She twisted a bit toward the stage, and the crowd complied, keeping the show going. She reached the edge, and began to climb up, a few hands still loosely holding her.</span></div></div>",

She did not even feel too embarrassed one of the straps was off her arm. This was for the crowd, and she was not uncovered.

There were spare clothes in their tour bus, and they could stall for Crystal, but at the moment she did not exactly have much that was concert-appropriate. Allison figured to carry on, skirt or not, and tried to relay that with her eyes to Crystal, but they did not exactly have a signal to each other that meant, \"I need clothes.\" or \"I don't care if you are missing a skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal cared, however, and without even standing back up she turned around and went face first back into the crowd. People yelled again, excited once more she had returned. Their hands pushed up against her stomach, her thighs, and against her chest as they led her just a few feet in - she was running on as much anger and steam as she could. She saw the skirt held up in triumph in someone's hands. They were turned away, and Crystal used that moment to grab the skirt and pull. She did not have much support for pulling, and wobbled over the crowd. She felt hands kneed against her thighs, and one was placed around the underboob of her left breast, the cup of her bra slightly out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt was held out to for a moment, but the surprise paid off, and she had it in her hand again.

Not wanting to show the entirety (though part of her was certain people were already recording her) of the concert of her predicament, she began to try and slip the skirt back on awkwardly as she went. She noticed then the skirt indeed had ripped, this time following the hem all the way up the waistband. It was now more of a thick pleated scarf than a proper skirt. As she began to be deposited on the stage itself, she did the best thing she could think of and tied the skirt around her waist like a sarong. The ball it made on her hip was a little large, and it did expose the entirety of her left leg and shorten the skirt a couple inches, now it retracting up to the bottom of the curve of her butt, but it was tighter than it was before, so long as her knot held. It did not have enough slack to double knot, but it still had plenty of friction to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a familiar set of fingers push the back of her thigh to help her up from behind then, and then continue to move up further. She almost reached back or kicked right then, but it was awkward to move quickly when she had so much uneven support. She then felt a finger loop around the side of her panties, and pull. She initially thought of spinning and fighting, but the motion was so fast the most she could do was cover herself with her hands, as she turned, keeping the sarong down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time as she glanced back, she noticed no upward display of the prize. Her panties might be in the crowd somewhere, but there seemed a slim chance she would ever find it. She stuck her thighs close together, her sarong already pressed down to cover herself. Because of the knot and the lack of panties, she was showing all of her hip and thigh on the left leg. The curve of the sarong moving into the knot also meant she showed the very beginnings of her inner thigh, as well as the outside curve of her butt. Her right leg had a normal, short skirt look to it, and it was pressed against her hips, just slightly below the top angle of the bone. The center of the sarong being slightly shorter than the skirt was before from the knot, and only reached four or five inches below her vagina, which meant any amount of sitting was a problem. She knew then the back of the sarong would be similar, only covering just below her butt as it rested slightly higher to cover all of her crack. In front, the sarong rested two inches or so below her navel - perhaps a little higher than it was before, but still where the tops of panties usually were.</span></div></div>",

She left her arm behind her a little, touching the fingers of those who helped her as she crawled up. She figured as she did this crowd surfing a few might have seen her panty-clad butt, but she felt rather okay with that. It was her decision, and she made the crowd excited from a controlled response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand was at her bicep, then slide down her arm with a hooked finger. She barely felt it at first, but in a swift motion, the strap on her arm was pulled across her wrist, and then her entire bra, the other strap off and the back unclasped, slide right out of the side of her fishnet shirt. She pulled back instinctively, and was sitting on the stage before the crowd in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torn shirt was still before her chest, looping its tatters loosely over the curves of her form. Her form fit fishnet also was there, though everything felt so much more airy and free. The simple motion of sitting with such hardness caused a bounce that could be seen by the first few rows in the crowd. Her fishnet was a bit ripped in the back, but up front it still reached down toward her belly button. She knew if she moved too much, however, the shirt could shift and she could show certain colors she did not wish. Folded fishnet, however, was nowhere near as transparent, though she did not have much to work with.</span></div></div>",

It was getting a bit slippery being covered in a mixture of sweat and rain. The crowd started to become quite before coming back with distinguishable woots and cat calls. The lead guitarist looked around to see what was the matter and found her bandmates staring right back at her. Each of them sported pink cheeks and wide grins which told the blue haired girl to look herself over immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was clear. Actually, that was the problem. Her fishnet shirt didn\u2019t do much to cover anything and her blue bra had lost its opacity in the rain. It was easy for Crystal to see that her nipples were poking though the material along with everybody else. The blue haired girl wanted to shriek but she held herself as she observed her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamera phones were everywhere. The spotlight was on her once again. The lead guitarist could feel herself getting hotter by the attention. She always performed with the goal to give her fans a show to remember but baring her breasts, even if not entirely, never crossed her mind. Crystal desperately wanted to put her shirt back on before people could capture another second of thinly covered nipples but she couldn\u2019t ignore the crowd\u2019s cheering on this development. She could pass it off as a part of her act but then what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be a chicken or embrace the stares?</i> The blue haired girl could feel time dwindle with the audience\u2019s initial enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal decided to...</span></div></div>",

However, in this moment, all eyes are on her and for many moments to come. This is one of the perks of being the lead guitarist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSporting a tight fishnet shirt underneath a fake blood-stained tube top, she smiles as she catches some guys envying her guitar. The blue haired girl practically skips around the stage, a task difficult to achieve in two inch lifts, working her body with the blaring music. She knows that she\u2019s shouting even though her voice sounds faint to her. Sweat pours from her face as she readies herself for her solo. She can hear her guitar get louder with each second. Her vision blurs and all bets are made on muscle memory. Her fingers grip the neck too hard and she hears a couple of sloppy notes but the crowd hasn\u2019t noticed. Additional distractions take place when the cardboard sewage plant behind the drummer, Allison, erupts with green smoke. Orange and pink smoke invade from the sides of the stage. So many colors. The world is spinning. Finishing her last verse, Crystal closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cCrystal? Crystal!

This happens a couple of times to her, especially in the case of interrupted sleep. It wasn\u2019t painful but it did shock her every time, making her brace for impact. Her eyes finally fixated on the person talking to her: Jen, the bass player of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d Crystal asked the brunette while spitting out a few strands of dyed-blue hair.

Come on.\u201d Jen replied, already making her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal began to reposition herself right-side up when she realized she was in the basement of a diner. The blue haired girl shifted uncomfortably in her clothes. An oversized maroon hoodie branded with the initials of a high school set for demolishing in March hung loosely on her figure, the cuffs weighted with years of sweat and grime. Underneath was a white tank-top great for practicing her performances in. However, the reason why she wasn\u2019t ditching her jacket right now was because her shirt allowed dark colors to peak through and her navy blue bra could be seen a mile away. Plus, it was cold outside anyway. On the subject of the weather, Crystal decided to take a chance and wear her fingerless gloves she received from her mother. The green was nice shade and the wool felt good on her palms but the gloves completed the homeless-look she was desperately trying to avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday wasn\u2019t working out so well. In addition to the weather, Crystal could feel herself becoming ill. She started to sniffle after every few seconds by the end of their third song. She couldn\u2019t sing any more by the fourth. Next thing she knew, she was on a quilt-covered couch in the basement of the diner. Allison was probably pissed. Crystal wouldn\u2019t blame her. Not really. <i>Richard\u2019s</i> was actually a bit of a gig stepping stone in this town. Every Sunday night, the restaurant would transform into miniature rock venue with some upstart band trying to reach a bigger audience than just family and a couple of nice police officers. The place would be packed most of the time. Crystal was surprised that <i>Richard\u2019s</i> sold out on occasion. Hell, she was surprised that <i>Richard\u2019s</i> sold tickets! The blue haired girl thought tragedy would strike when the man himself, Richard Maroose, was going on vacation the week of their supposed performance; however, not only did he tell them that the show would go on, he allowed them to utilize the diner for practice on Saturday with his son\u2019s supervision. The guitarist made a mental note to thank Jen the umpteenth time for being the family\u2019s friend for twenty years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal stood up and made her way upstairs, tying to ignore how itchy the couch was. The girl\u2019s illness seemed to migrate to her forehead as light pulses occurred to the beat of her heart. The guitarist massaged her eyebrows for a bit at the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe awakens!\u201d Alison shouted from halfway across the room. Crystal groaned and dug her fingers into her gloves to prevent herself from making an obscene gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still closed, the blue haired girl could hear an instrument be placed down and the squeak of new sneakers approach her. The lead guitarist began grin as she reflected on how Aimee still managed to show her timidness in the sound of her footsteps. She guessed the second guitar player was about three feet way before inquiring \u201ch-how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal let go of her eyebrows, opened her eyes, and said \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks, Aimee!\u201d She was greeted with the image of redhead a few years younger than her dressed like it was the first day of school. The blue haired girl couldn\u2019t help but smile at how delicate the were laced in the redhead\u2019s hair. Crystal really didn\u2019t have the patience for things like that, a reason for the braid punishment, but on Aimee, it looked great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guitarist turned to face her other bandmates. Jen was pretty plain compared to her stage outfit, nearly business-like. While she still wore her favorite boots, the brunette was decked out in black slacks and a white dress shirt. Her attire would seem formal to formal to most; however, Crystal sensed a \u201cprofessional partier\u201d duality in the bass player which fit her nicely. Alison was already in her stage outfit. Okay, so Alison never really changed out of her stage outfit. The difference between her stage persona and her real self was how short of a skirt she wore which Crystal couldn\u2019t tell due to the drum set. The lead guitarist thought her bandmates were all dressed beautifully, despite the varied choices in clothing. She groaned when she glanced down at herself again. <i>Yep...... Still a hobo..........</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to pick up her guitar case, Crystal noticed that there was no one behind the register or anyone else except her band in the immediate area. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d she asked, wondering where their \u201csupervisor\u201d had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison\u2019s grin grew wider as she replied,</span></div></div>",

Despite the stress that Jack Maroose must have been going through, his current predicament was pretty funny. The restrooms of <i>Richard\u2019s</i> tended to be clean for the most part and Jack intended to keep it that way during his father\u2019s absence; however, things changed in the last twenty-four hours. The story goes that Jack was manning the cash register in the last hour of service when a female customer walked up to him completely drenched. She directed him to a stall in the women\u2019s restroom whose door had been blasted off its hinges and the only remains of a toilet was a tank that was bolted to the wall and a few pieces of porcelain surrounding a three foot hole leading to the pipes below. Luckily, the rest of the facility looked fine but that didn\u2019t stop Jack from locking the room up and scouring the Internet to find a team to do a full inspection of each stall before tomorrow. With some maneuvering of furniture, the diner could hold nearly two-hundred and fifty screaming fans that would keep up-to-date posts on their experience on social media. Exploding toilettes usually meant bad news for any business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad news for <i>Richard\u2019s</i> probably meant bad news for <i>Total Breakdown</i> as well, so Crystal didn\u2019t mind the extra precaution Jack was taking. She just wished he didn\u2019t block off the other stalls like they were a crime scene as well, fake police tape and all. The thought of the blocked off toilets made sweat form on the guitarist brow, expecting the worst out of this situation and hoped that Jack would return sooner rather than later. The blue haired girl decided that playing her guitar for a bit would put any more urges out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal made a mental note that the power of guitar playing could not overcome any urges after two and a half hours of waiting and the five cups of tea Jen made for her, which she reluctantly accepted to sooth her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the guitarist\u2019s nails were beginning to make small carvings on her instrument as she sat hunched over with her cheeks almost as red as her jacked. She tried to muffle her huffs as she prepped up to play 'Pressure,' a slow song about drowning in water and other stuff that Crystal really couldn\u2019t remember right now. She thought that her ears would ignite when she heard Alison cue the tempo for the third time in-between her constant giggling. The blue-haired girl questioned if her urges could be fought by thinking about the numerous ways she would torture her drummer after she finished the song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question soon became whether she could finish the song or not as her fingers were unwilling to play the intricate guitar lead-in no matter how hard Crystal tried. After her forth attempt, the guitarist settled to play the chords along with Aimee instead. She didn\u2019t face the younger-guitar player or any of her other bandmates out of sheer embarrassment. The blue haired girl realized that the group had been playing the  intro three times over, waiting for her to start singing. Crystal swallowed hard as she tried to recall the lyrics as they played the intro one more time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I died today...<br>\r\nThe waves crash against my frozen body.<br>\r\nSending me far away from land<br>\r\nWas this tattered thing really me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, were those my words?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe believed those were the words she wrote down but she wasn\u2019t sure anymore and couldn\u2019t remember the rest of the sheet anyway. Not wanting for the other to repeat the same few seconds of the song until she remembered again, Crystal pressed on-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I....... As I........ Uh... \u2018Submerge?\u2019 No, not yet.... Um....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- and figuratively fell flat on her face. Her cheeks sported a brighter shade that ever before as her right foot scratched up and down her other leg. The motion tugged on her jeans which had been uncomfortable for the last three songs. The last chord she played faded and gave way to the amplified sound of strings being tightly messaged by fingers eager to carve into the back of the guitar neck once more. The blue haired girl was unwilling to face her band members who ceased playing a few seconds after but she had yet to find method to trick herself in to believing that they were not right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear Alison stumble as she fell backwards laughing, struggling to find the right quip for her lead guitarist\u2019s situation. <i>I will make you suffer one day, Alison.</i> She could hear the clanking of Jen\u2019s boots pass by her towards the counter for some reason Crystal couldn\u2019t understand. The familiar squeak of new sneakers became louder as the blue haired girl could feel Aimee reach around to grab hold of her friend\u2019s guitar, pressing her head against the side of Crystal\u2019s neck. The guitarist released her grip, watching her legs jet out and quickly wrap around themselves to provide more protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal put a hand to her face to cover her blush and tears. With her friend\u2019s guitar firmly in her possession, Aimee repositioned herself to whisper the struggling blue haired girl, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The guitarist couldn\u2019t respond. Her jaw had been locked for the past minute. However, her ears were working just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Click!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen. Counter. Bathroom. Locked. Keys. Freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal darted towards Jen who was calmly holding the door for her fellow band member. The door closed and she gathered her surroundings: seven stalls guarded with fake police tape and one without a door or much of a toilet. This was the ladies\u2019 bathroom whose stalls were all locked for inspection. <i>Damnit, Jack!</i> Perhaps she should ask Jen for access to the men\u2019s bathroom? Well, a person really can\u2019t be picky if they\u2019re quivering so much that they can\u2019t even do the \u201cpee-pee dance\u201d properly. Evaluating her options for merely a second, the blue haired girl...</span></div></div>",

Come on.\u201d Jen replied, already making her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal began to reposition herself right-side up when she realized she was sleeping on Jen\u2019s old bed. The room was definitely surreal to the guitarist\u2019s mind. It seemed to depict the evolution of her friend\u2019s personality. A toy chest, unopened for years, doubled as a table for a video game console that had been unplayed for just as long. The pink wooden walls were plastered with layers of band posters, shifting from cute teen heartthrobs to the best rockers of today and yesterday. The top-most layer of posters tended to deviate with some goth bands and close-ups of tanks. Crystal wanted to question Jen why she didn\u2019t place the poster they did for first concert but she never pressed it. It was a bit amateur-looking anyway and the posters would get better once they hired a publicity department. Perhaps they should hire a manager first? Maybe they should get another gig before anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few months since their last performance and college took up most of <i>Total Breakdown</i>\u2019s time. Well, summer was here and that meant that the band could start to build up their reputation once more. It also meant that it was as hot as Hell today. The forecast was a muggy hundred-and-two degrees but that number was surpassed before noon. Luckily, Crystal had dress for the occasion. Clad in only a rainbow tank top and jean shorts, with sunscreen to protect the exposed areas, the guitarist could still feel comfortable despite the heat. However, the blue haired girl felt a bit off sitting on the childhood sheets of her friend in jeans and nothing else. She had a pair of underwear and an extra set of clothes for the sleepover Aimee convinced Jen to host at her parents\u2019 house. The idea seemed a bit childish but nice, nonetheless: practice till three, pizza by five, hang out with the family at six and bandmate bonding time at eight. Honestly, Crystal was thankful that she didn\u2019t need to leave the house to do anything and that no one had discovered how undressed she truly was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guitarist decided get off of her band member\u2019s bed and look around her room once more. It was interesting how secluded it felt. There was half a flight of stairs to climb to reach the rest of the house and a door that opened to a backyard which could fit an additional house in said space but, instead, contained various outdoor activities and a slide. Jen had told her that this room used to be her father\u2019s study where he would write moderate hit after moderate hit. It was his literary success that allowed the family of four to continue living in this house. Of course, the fact that Jen\u2019s mother was the senior executive to his publishing company helped the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal giggled under her breath as she walked up the stairs. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t notice that the exit was being blocked until she happened to bump into the person in question. Both the guitarist and the poor individual tumbled onto the living room carpet. When Crystal opened her eyes, she found herself...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t notice that the exit was being blocked until she happened to bump into the person in question. Both the guitarist and the poor individual tumbled onto the living room carpet. When Crystal opened her eyes, she found herself being groped by a hand in her pants. The mystery as to who was groping her was overshadowed by Crystal\u2019s wishes to get herself out of her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guitarist tried to push herself out of reach but the hands kept a tight grasp, forcing the blue haired girl back onto the body of her captor. Crystal glanced up to see where the arms led and was entranced by a face that Jen had never sported before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes sent daggers at the guitarist. The bass player\u2019s cheeks were puffed and pink as her lips moved erratically, unable to decide on an emotion to convey. Shock? Embarrassment? Disgust? Rage? Rage seemed to be an appropriate reaction; however, the raven haired girl could not form words at the time, so she made incompressible grunts instead with each \u201cUgh.\u201d and \u201cPwa?\u201d blowing hot air into the face of one of her closest friends who was right now way to close for her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal felt all the blood from her face drain from her. She believed most of it was getting dumped into the buttcheek Jen was latching onto, the evidence that the blue haired girl was commando while sleeping in the bed her best friend grew up in. The young woman could feel her posterior growing hotter as the bass player squeezed tighter. The guitarist felt the urge to faint but that might have made things worse seeing that the lips of the two ladies were only separated by millimeters. Unable to think of any other options, Crystal locked eyes with Jen and uttered a soft \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen let go soon after and Crystal felt she could breathe again. She turned to her left and saw her other bandmates, Amiee who was now red as her hair and Allison who was scrambling for her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour and a half was just like any of their previous practice sessions for the guitarist, except with a little more ribbing from Allison and the inability to look Jen in the eye. The bass player kept to herself for the most part, making comments only when they pertained to a bad note or to the sleepover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great! I still have nearly twelve more hours of feeling like a pervert. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was surprised that Jen hadn\u2019t kicked her out of her house the moment after she let go of her cheek which still sore from the incident. The blue haired girl cringed as she felt the remaining imprint of her friend\u2019s palm from inside her shorts. She didn\u2019t want to excuse herself to the check in the bathroom. She really just wanted to leave and call Jen in a day or two, probably five, but guilt forced her to stay put until she had any excuse other than \u2018Guys. I gotta leave. Jen discovered that my naked pussy and her old bed were separated only by a pair of jean shorts when she squeezed my bare ass a while back. Now, I can\u2019t do anything without thinking about how perverted I am. By the way, could you tell that I wasn\u2019t wearing any panties? How erect are my nipples?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah........ I hate my life.........</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal groaned as she held her guitar close. Despite the heat, the blue haired girl shivered as her nipples poked through the t-shirt and  pressed agains the instrument. It was 2:15 in the afternoon and it had finally cooled to a nice ninety-eight degrees. During practice, <i>Total Breakdown</i> had built up a sweat to the point where each member was practically panting by the end of the last song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm..... I would like to ask something..... May we take a break?\u201d Amiee inquired, struggling to keep her head up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in favor?\u201d Alison asked, not counting Jen\u2019s or Crystal\u2019s vote before shouting, \u201cOK! Thirty minutes! What do you guys want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal let the conversation pass her by, preferring to stare at the floor and trying not to think of beds, or her thin clothing or that she was getting warmer in places that she would really not want to mention right now. However, her train of \u2018not-thinking\u2019 stopped when she heard a voice say \u201cCrystal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guitarist turned her head and faced Jen for the first time in nearly two hours. Surprisingly, other than a blush Crystal hoped was from the exercising and heat, Jen looked like her normal self. The bass player continued to smile as she asked the blue haired girl, \u201cCould you.....</span></div></div>",

Crystal was a little worried that they had only caught the station's eye because of their various wardrobe malfunctions at recent shows, which managed to stir up some gossip in local trash-mags. <br>\r\nSomething the band wasn't very happy about. An article about them making trouble is one thing, but it was always just racy pictures and upskirts. Always tagged with comments on their looks and what they would dress down to next! They wanted to move away from that kind of publicity, but it wouldn't look good for the band's image to dress less wildly because of some stupid magazine article. They weren't going to button up to make some no-name writers happy! So they just had to do their best to make sure the crowd weren't getting any special looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their worries all 4 girls agreed to take the plunge for a chance at stardom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the first drink had been served, Total Breakdown agreed that the humidity was unbearable. While the concert had gone off flawlessly and only a handful of people left early, the hall got mercilessly hot. The night was already a little uncomfortable, and playing to a nearly sold out crowd full of energetic fans turned the venue into a sauna. The girls flew through enough water to drown themselves, and each wiped her brow far too often during the night. Thankfully, only the venue was hot. Once the crowd cleared, it was back to just a little uncomfortable. But the alcohol and Aimee's busted air conditioner changed that once again. Total Breakdown resumed sweating bullets, and contemplating a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was wishing she had the good sense of mind to wear a skirt like her bandmates, even the more modest one Aimee was sporting. Not only would her legs be able to breathe, she could fan herself with it like Crystal and Allison were doing. Instead, her jeans forced Jen to drink more often just to be only slightly warmer, and became the only one too hot to want to join their video game session. That said, even the others weren't happy with the sudden spike in temperature, but Jen got it the worst, which fueled the next decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bassist was reaching for her waist, preparing to ditch her jeans and let the air in, when she coincidentally looked out the window. Beyond she saw an immaculate pool of crystal clear water, teasingly inviting her from beyond a chain link fence. The gentle waves were beckoning her to come and become enveloped by their cold touch. And that diving board! She could already feel the air rushing around her as she took flight towards the bracing water. The thought alone was refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh girls!\" Jen called with a thumb pointed to her prize. \"I think I just figured out how to beat the heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of Jen's voice, each of them crossed to the window, and reacted instantly to the sight before them. First was Crystal, who relaxed her muscles and quietly released a contented sigh, her mind racing through Jen's fantasy. Following was Allison, who was fairing better than her bandmates. While less noticeable, the smirk made it clear she had felt that same chilly wave of relief. But then there was Aimee, who only scowled, as if Jen had made things worse with this show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you show us that?\" she said. \"The only swimsuits on hand are mine. They won't fit you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aimee had even finished, Crystal arched backwards in frustration, cursing the alcohol under her breath. How else could they have missed something so obvious? She would have said something about Jen as well, but she had to be dying in her jeans already. Harassing her in this state of weakness was something Crystal couldn't bring herself to do. If anything, comfort and console was what the dejected bassist needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Jen's look remained unchanged, still firm and resolved. And the arched eyebrow and grin proved Allison hadn't lost her elation either. If anything, it had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout flinching, Jen replied, \"Then when go with birthday suits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skinny dipping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal and Aimee had asked it simultaneously, yet the inflections couldn't have had greater contrast. They both felt that naughty tingle of a taboo to break crawling along their skin, but only Crystal got an adventurous glint in her eyes and an excited pitch to her voice, embracing the thrill like a lover. Aimee's cracked as her face flushed deeper, her arms moving to chase away that tickle as her eyes danced in concern. Swimming naked? In public? In another yard? In <i>that</i> yard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, uh, I don't think that's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Crystal whined. \"Live a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they're home and bust us for trespassing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a good sign, the trio silently noted. Aimee made a logical argument against it, not a flat refusal. Total denial usually meant they'd have to scrap the idea or go without her. If she's trying to reason her way out, then it usually just takes a little coaxing. And for this, eagle-eyed Jen was just what they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was no car in the driveway earlier. We'll hear them if they show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I dunno,\" Aimee whined. \"I mean, it's the Bellamy's, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" Crystal called, her hands swatting through the air. \"That's the Bellamy's pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we have to,\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all the shit we've been through, they owe us,\" Allison concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee and I'll grab the beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few tugs to make Crystal's claim true, but the sudden change in the atmosphere seemed to convince Aimee by itself. Then again, her own statement already was extremely coaxing. Just thinking about it made Aimee waver even before her bandmates became adamant. Crystal's request for confirmation only affirmed her belief. She wasn't sure it would be fun, but she definitely wanted some kind of compensation from those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee's neighbors, Ed and Jodie Bellamy, were both on the wrong side of 40, and it showed. Frequently. Anyone who met at Ed would probably guess he was around 60 instead of in his 40's - the price of hard work, he called it. That explained the wizened skin and chrome dome, but it didn't reflect his attitude. Most of the other folks in the neighborhood that complained about their practice had a legitimate case; referencing the late hour, the day of the week, and all that other humdrum nonsense. And even then, those incidents were few, far between, and usually resolved with a pop-in or a phone call. Ed, however, was a typical crank who complained to the police when Aimee tuned an acoustic guitar. In spite of the garage being an amphitheatre situated a mere block from a successful shopping center, Total Breakdown wasn't able to use this blessed accident to boost their popularity without Ed wrecking everything before they finished one song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the objections to \"that racket\" didn't stop the lecherous looks. After he phoned in the noise complaint, he'd always come over and give them a strict talk about their \"inappropriate attire\" and \"loose attitudes\" without even trying to hide his elevator eyes. Once rebutting his arguments proved futile, the band learned to bite their tongues and give him one-finger salutes once he turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut worse than Ed was his wife Jodie. Whereas Ed became an old man before his time, Jodie tried clinging to her youth. Her hair was a poor, home effort of a dye job, complete with a fist-sized gray patch visible during a strong wind, and she insisted on going out clubbing, wearing the latest fashion craze, and all the other activities that she saw as \"dominated by the young.\" And her reaction to Total Breakdown made all four girls cringe. Dropping in on her \"gal pals\" was all too common, and her attempts at fitting in with a punk look and attitude was as refreshing and accurate as a violent blizzard in these lower latitudes. And it wasn't restricted to Aimee's neighborhood. Anywhere she happen to meet with one of them usually led to them doing some activity associated with their generation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, Total Breakdown was losing valuable opportunities. It was getting to the point Aimee would have to sneak in to her own home. The end result was a tremendous debt that needed settling, and use of their pool would be a great starting point. Using it for skinny dipping - something that would make Ed's head explode - made it all the sweeter. And explode it may.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the girls hopped the fence, the fallacy hadn't become apparent, and the alcohol guaranteed it never would. A car only needs one driver, one car's disappearance does not mean two people were in it. Trouble could be waiting to pounce and they would never hear it until it was too late. Of course, they could get lucky. Married couples do date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would that be better? If they continue drinking once they strip bare, an interruption could be the only thing that kept Total Breakdown from total embarrassment. Or would it be the cause?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Woah!\" Aimee shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear the earlier drinking had already gotten the girls a little buzzed. Each of them had their own resultant struggles, but Aimee's near-faceplant into concrete was the clincher. For clarity, she wasn't accustomed to scaling fences, so the hazards of her skirt wouldn't be apparent right away even if she was sober. Although, a sober individual would have noticed the tugging as she tried to slide down and then checked her skirt - both for personal safety and to ensure an inconsequential tear in the stitching doesn't escalate to an extension of the slit. Thankfully, her bandmates were old hands at the art and were at the ready to catch her and set her right with minimal clothing damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we shoulda stripped beforehand,\" Crystal said as she pulled off her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shrugged. \"Eh. Old habits on public nudity I suppose.\" Though done for the situation, the gesture also helped her bra straps fall off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no one takes their clothes off <i>before</i> hoppin a fence,\" Jen added while sliding down her jeans and thong. \"That's the easiest way ta get ya clothes stolen. Ooh. That doesn't really apply here, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whateva,\" the now-naked Aimee said. \"No harm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls paid no mind to their volume. After all, they thought they were alone. Without even so much as a cursory glance, Total Breakdown lined up at the diving board. Each of them was determined to make as big an entrance as possible for their first group skinny dip. It made a splash, but also made sure to keep their audience's rapt attention. Though, their stripping was more than enough motivation for the old letch and his binoculars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee's exclamation caused the ever-prying Ed Bellamy to peek out his window to find its source, and treated him to a sight that has occupied his fantasies since he met his neighbor and her friends. The girls in that noisy band were finally naked for his viewing pleasure. And with his wife out clubbing, his withered dick was free to fill with blood as the big-tittied bassist did a nude back flip off the diving board. Not her most graceful back flip, though. It got her best bits jiggling, but Jen emerged from the pool with her face strained in anguish. Hands quickly shot up to massage her chest and abs while treading over to the side of the pool. She paused only to flash a thumbs up to ease her mates' concern and let them focus on diving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving in from his diving board. That jump-started Ed's brain. His face contorted as he started to grind his teeth. They were trespassing in his pool! Exploiting his hard work for their own self-gratification! For the sake of the drummer's can opener!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dive that left one of her long, slender legs outstretched. Spreading her pussy lips. And she even pushed too hard, enough to make her spin towards the window. It gave him a bird's eye view of her gaping sex. Her shaved mound even rendered her erect love button completely unobstructed until she pierced the water. Her boobs may not be as magnificent as the raven-haired girl's, but seeing them thrust out as she flipped her hair backwards more than made up for it. Then there was the sheer majesty of her free swinging hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her was the blue-haired girl, who sadly chose to jackknife. It stuck her tight bottom up in the air, but only briefly. Since his view was from the side, there was very little worth seeing. Even once she straightened out, his eyes took in about as much as he would from a silhouette. No matter. The image improved once she surfaced, once the water's buoyancy went to work on her free-swinging rack. Plus, he was much more interested in the girl next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Ed whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Aimee did was cannonball. She started while Ed was admiring Crystal, so he didn't see anything until the thump of the board called him. And her form was so tight that all he got was the side of her butt. He saw that much when she went in her backyard to sunbathe. She didn't even bring her chest above water like the others. Her titties may have been the smallest of the bunch, but they were also the ones least flaunted. Oh well. She would have to show more if she was going to continue skinny dipping in his pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pool! Without his permission! How dare they! Why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing every ounce of willpower he had, Ed turned himself away from the bathing intruders. Going back and forth like that wasn't going to help anything. He had to commit. He had to drown out the allure of their frolicking frames. Or override his responsibility as a homeowner and enjoy the show. Is making that choice even possible? It had better be! Otherwise, he wasn't going to accomplish a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind resolved, Ed turned towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the one who can handle alcohol the best, Allison took it upon herself to be responsible before their pool party got underway. Specifically, she went up to Aimee's bathroom and pulled out four large towels. After one game of beer pong ended with her streaking past automatic sprinklers that were poorly placed, she was quite familiar with the aggravation of getting into clothing while soaking wet and then having to spend the rest of the night in them. She wasn't about to let her inexperienced friends learn that firsthand, even if that did mean everyone else was already in the pool by the time she scaled the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to tell the other three all had very little experience with public nudity in any capacity, though this part may have just been the alcohol. Allison discovered their clothes scattered around the Bellamy's aluminum chairs on the patio, left to whatever fate gravity and inertia had given them. That was the easiest way to make redressing much harder than it had to be, or the most difficult way to gather them up if they had to make a mad dash out of here. With a sigh, she dropped the towels onto one of the chairs and started folding their clothes before placing them on the table. It was denying her the chill of the water and killing her buzz, but anything was better than having to run around looking for a pair of panties after the Bellamy's got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delays only cost her about two minutes, and thankfully her bandmates weren't relishing the pool aloud to tease her. Upon turning to jump in and join them, she discovered why. All three girls had taken up positions directly behind her and used her about-face as the signal to hit her with a wall of water. Her freed hair collapsed around her, forming around her curves while also covering her face. The cold wave was a nice change of pace from the humidity, but her agape mouth proved it wasn't how she wanted her relief. And all the while her friends laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal called, \"That's whatcha get for bein last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for turnin ya back on us!\" Jen added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee had no comment. She just kept cackling even as they went in for a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison tossed her hair back, and revealed the face of a demon. She charged the pool, only saying four words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fuckers are dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio scattered instantly, missing both the dive and the resulting splash. In contrast to her opening act, Allison's motives were relatively benign, as her softened features and giggling proved. Since her body blocked the chairs and table from the water, the only harm was to her ego. A few dunks, tickling, and maybe some titty twisters would level the playing field. Although, there was a chance she could find a secondary route for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking they were alone, Total Breakdown figured no one would object to the shouting and splashing, and in fairness they weren't wrong. It wasn't an objection, it was mere curiosity followed by a joyous gasp. Peering out the window was their old pal Jodie, taken aback by their shenanigans. In the back of her mind, she was suddenly thankful that her husband went on a weekend deep sea fishing trip with his friends. Normally she resented Ed never taking her along and leaving her alone for the duration, but this time she had something to do, and he wasn't around to object or break it up. At long last, Jodie could have some uninterrupted fun with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodie's hands were already at her blouse, preparing to strip off and jump in with them. Her fingers couldn't so much as twitch before she stopped herself. Sure, skinny dipping would be fun, and she had no physical reason to hesitate, even if part of it came from a surgeon - \"strictly to keep myself firm and perky,\" as she always reminded Crystal. However, lowering her head caused her eyes to pass the pile of clothes and towels, and notice its close proximity to the patio window. Pranks on naked people were timeless, and especially common in youthful people. Why not prank Total Breakdown? They were trespassing, they didn't invite Jodie to join them, and they didn't seem to realize she was around. That's a prime target if ever there was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? Jodie began to ponder her approach. I gotta leave their shoes, they're outta reach. And it'd be way too mean to leave them naked and streaking around town. Maybe I could leave their towels? That's not so bad. Or maybe make them do stuff around the block to earn their clothes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I'm better off joining them like I wanted...</span></div></div>",

C-cold!\" Crystal cried out as her head breached the surface of the pool. \"Holy crap that's a shock! But it's sooo good! Come on in, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio didn't need their leader's prodding to follow suit, Jen following Crystal's tracks onto the diving board while Allison simply jumped in from the edge, while Aimee took the slow and delicate route of sliding in feet first after gently placing the cooler with their remaining beer by the water's edge. Regardless of their choice of entry, all the girls found themselves reveling in the cold waters of the pool, the chill wonderfully contrasting with the humidity of the summer night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the heat's discomfort beaten by the luxury of the pool, Total Breakdown's alcohol consumption resumed in earnest, with each of the girls downing their fair share of booze. If their inhibitions and situational awareness had been impaired before, it was worse now. Such practical concerns didn't matter to the rockers, of course, engulfed as they were in their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at least partially due to this alcohol-induced haze that-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Aimee was soon clutching the side of the pool while panting. The muddling effects of the pre-dip brews convinced her she could match Allison drink for drink, and that factors like the drummer's status as a lush and their size difference need not be considered. It seemed like a good idea at first, but before long the guitarist's extremities got heavy and her flushed head was knocking every which way. And this only made swimming and treading laborious, even without the encumbrance of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small ledge was erected along the pool wall a few feet below the surface of the water, allowing Aimee to rest comfortably at the water's edge while she caught her breath. The heavy breaths made even her small chest heave, yet she remained oblivious to the feel of the concrete scraping her nipples. All she knew was her lungs were filling with air and the stars in the sky were like stage lights - illuminating her way to stardom while still hiding the hurdles she would climb. Her eyes flew open. There's a song in that, she thought. It could be gold if I work it out. Has anyone tried that before? Could we be the first? ...Damn it! I know all my favs by heart! Why am I drawin a blank?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead turned around to face her bandmates once again. Since the alcohol was impairing her cognition, it was up to one of them to clear the fog in her head, and even help her develop the angle. All she needed was one who wouldn't mind working instead of frolicking like a nymph. ...I shoulda brought my phone, Aimee thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest companion was Jen, and she didn't even hear Aimee call out to her. The bassist was taking a greater interest in backstroking across the pool. No doubt it was all about her boobs bobbing in and out of the water with each stroke. Jen was always much more of a free spirit than the rest of the group. Based on everything they knew, the raven-haired girl would be giving her twin assessts much more air time were it not for modern technology and her rational brain. The alcohol was definitely numbing the latter, Aimee noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clang of two cans led Aimee away from the buoy show and towards the shallow end. Allison and Crystal were standing near the start of the pool's deep end with fresh beer rushing into their bellies. Bottoms up already, Aimee grinned. She'd never passed up a free show before, and she certainly wasn't going to start now. Not when four well-shaped breasts were thrust out at her, and especially when two of them happened to belong to her crush. Of course, the drummer was a vision of loveliness in her own right. Allison had released her hair from its braided confines, and the water allowed it to form a halo around her body. The absence of tan lines only strengthened the allure, especially since her nipples weren't tinted bronze, instead maintaining the dark pink color she chose for her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Crystal definitely dominated Aimee's attention. Even with the pale triangle overlay, her perky peaks retained a perfect shape with a vibrant crimson cap. The water droplets scattered over her toned body made it glisten the night light. And then there's the...devilish glint in her hazel eyes. Oops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aimee could turn away or excuse her gawking, she saw a faint grin spread across the lips of her blue-haired goddess. Crystal whispered into Allison's ears, clearly giggling all the while, until the drummer's own grin made Aimee's stomach churn. She sighed happily once Allison began a stealth approach towards Jen. At first, she looked back to Crystal just as a reflex. Wanting another look at her exposed flesh, and wanting to see if she was off the hook for peeking. Just something to occupy her time until Allison pounced on Jen. But then it was more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an innocuous stretch, as if Crystal had worn her guitar for too long. Like her chest thrusting out was just a happy accident. But the look in her eyes was anything but innocent. That's the face she wears when she wants what she sees more than life itself. It was the glow of unadulterated passion. And it was aimed directly at Aimee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no, Aimee scolded herself, Crystal's just thinkin about tonight's gig while stretching. I happen ta be in the way. Of course that's not what Aimee wanted, but what other explanation was there? Crystal was straight. Wasn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee inhaled sharply. As if to prove her wrong, Crystal cupped her right hand and slowly drizzled water over the left side of her cleavage. The redhead couldn't help but watch each and every drop as it traced across the globular flesh until the cascades ceased. Her eyes stayed glued to the flesh, though. Without missing a beat, Crystal's now-empty hand followed the water's path, treating her captive audience to a caress of her boob and erect teat. And her desirous eyes never left Aimee even once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee licked her lips. That was a definite come-on, she thought. And way more important than...what was I doin before? Ah whateva! Time ta...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Aimee thought no one would notice her disappear. No one was looking, after all. Moreover, she was the smallest of them. It seemed perfectly logical that no one would notice she wasn't above the water with them. Everyone would be oblivious to her butt poking into the air as she dove below to become mound level with her bandmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the alcohol also convinced her that her hair would cling to her shoulders as she swam. Therefore, she could get as close to Crystal as she wanted. It hadn't escaped Aimee's notice that her fellow guitarist had stiff nipples before taking a plunge. Surely her button was stiff, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween no one claiming Aimee's can and the hair tickling her thighs, it took Crystal no time to find the red-head breaking a cardinal rule of skinny dipping. She tapped Allison and Jen on the shoulder before pointing down to Aimee inches away from their pussies. As one, each clamped a hand to the junction of their legs. The busty pair also chose to shield their boobs, but Allison went on the attack. The half-second between six hands moving and Aimee's realization was all she needed. The drummer had a handful of red hair in her clutches before the guitarist could do more than turn. One swift tug later, and Aimee's crimson face breached the chlorine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyin' the view?\" Allison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think that's <i>so funny</i>, \" Crystal said, \"you'll just love this! The cooler's gettin' low, and you just volunteered to refill it. By goin' through the front!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, be nice,\" Jen said. \"I think a spankin'll suffice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle torture all the way,\" Allison said while wiggling her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taunt backfired. Wiggling her fingers loosened Allison's vise grip as well as her free hand. In that moment, Aimee kicked off of Allison's strong legs and swam for freedom. The force may have staggered Allison, but Crystal and Jen were hot on the red head's heels. The head start proved to be insufficient. The pair easily claimed a kicking leg. Despite her thrashing and flailing, Aimee was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't very nice!\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal said, \"Guess now we <i>gotta</i> go with Ally's choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, the two captors began their assault on the redhead's bare soles. Aimee's struggle increased tenfold under the torture. It didn't help. Crystal and Jen only held tighter. The stroking won out. Aimee gasped and gurgled out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost instantly it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Aimee cried, Allison came and swatted away the hands. Aimee was free to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell's wrong with you two?\" Allison asked. \"You don't tickle someone by the feet in a pool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal knocked her head. Before she could ask, Jen directed her to Aimee. Their confusion dissipated as Aimee coughed up more water. That was definitely the booze, they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always go for the neck,\" Allison continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen squealed. In order to make her point, Allison was demonstrating on Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the underarms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DA-DAMN IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen fought to protect her bare skin from Allison's nimble strokes. It was no use. All that time on the drums made her hands lightning fast. All the bassist managed to do was jiggle her boobs. That was enough to stop Aimee, though. Crystal may have been her crush, but the red head wasn't going to pass on big bouncing tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot without interference, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still pervin' on us, huh?\" Crystal said. \"You're still not off the hook y'know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Allison's examples, Crystal resumed her assault on Aimee. There were now two girls hollering in laughter, and two girls focused only on making them cry louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant there were zero girls watching Aimee's house. Zero girls to notice the figure peering over the fence at them. At the lack of clothing surrounding the cooler and empty cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal Breakdown's increasing success was not a secret from the world. Nor was it any secret that the world's affections for them weren't entirely pure. Now that the lot of them had left Aimee's house unattended and themselves vulnerable, someone was taking advantage of a presumably unlocked door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was: who is it?</span></div></div>",

At first, they just bumped into each other or followed their momentum. Once the scattered empty cans along the fence turned into cluster, however, everything got heavier. And the most apparent distortion came from Jen's next can of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents avalanched down on the hapless bassist; the cooler itself remained teetering on the edge of the pool. Thankfully, Total Breakdown's heavy drinking left only a few cans inside, and only one grazed her shoulder. Most of the blast was ice and cold water. The chilling sensation ran from the tip of Jen's head to the rippling surface of the water. Her right hand continued reaching towards the sky through all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Jen finally regained her composure. \"Dat. Waz. AWESHOME! Like da besht fellin eva!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' I got a replashment!\" Crystal added, plucking one of the cans out of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been sober, the problem would have been obvious. After the fall into the pool and getting rocked by the waves generated by the waterfall behind it, that can was a grenade waiting to blow. Sober Crystal would have waited a moment. Drunk Crystal, however, shrieked as her face got blasted with cold beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal'sh had too much!\" Aimee called laughing. \"Ya gotta be tolly blitshed ta not shee dat comin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison swam up to her and grinned. \"Don shweat it. I'll clean ya off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her slurred speech wasn't enough proof even Allison had more than her fair share, the drummer's tongue darted out and started lapping the beer off of her blue-haired friend, much to everyone's delight. Each lick made Crystal's face light up with pure ecstasy, while Jen and Aimee watched with their jaws slack and a gleam in their eyes. Seeing her opportunity, the redhead bolted to Crystal's unoccupied side, and with much less inhibitions. While Allison was content to star at the neck - a moderately safe zone - Aimee, with no nurtured resistance to alcohol, dove straight for Crystal's bouncing right bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone, Allison dropped down to Crystal unmolested boob and joined the foray at Crystal's cleavage. Almost as one, they began ascending up, enjoying the squeals and shudders with each lap. The moderate pace seemed agonizingly slow to their leader and teasingly rapid for Aimee. Regardless of the perception, the beer was cleaned up, and the trio celebrated their enjoyment with a three-way kiss. The presence of another may have been non-canon, but Aimee was still going to chalk this up as a fantasy fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been better, like playful grabs or even just some tongue in that kiss. Unfortunately for Aimee, a metallic click and accompanying call broke the kiss and denied her such pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izat how we're gonna do dish?\" Jen asked. \"Dat our fun fa da night? Well, drink up, shlutsh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls went bug-eyed as Jen took her fresh beer and poured it all over her mammoth mammaries. Her own eyes never left her bandmates, nor did the hungry look in them wither. The message was clear, and no one hesitated to join the raven-haired girl at the side of the pool. They weren't ready to sober up yet, they were still hornier than a a brass band, and there was more than enough flesh for all three. If Jen wanted a taste of their taste buds, then her breasts were theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal and Aimee flanked her and claimed everything outside of her dark nubs while Allison immersed herself in the valley of the gods. The guitarists thought they got the lion's share by annexing each rough nipple, but the scent gathered in a woman's cleft was far more stimulating than sucking on a teat, at least to Allison. Regardless of their turn-ons, each girl was feverishly feasting on their friend's boozy boobies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen moaned into her beer and arched backwards under the tongue lashing. I needed this, she thought. That was no lie. Josh, her ex, had been out of her life for months, but she still couldn't bring herself to see someone new; she did still love him after all, even if his soul did come with a price tag. At first that was no big deal, but eventually her own hands weren't enough, even with a vibrator in it. The only cure for that was another's touch. That would have been resolved after her first month and a half of single life, except the pain in her heart overruled the ache in her loins. Odds are her dry spell would have continued much longer had she not opted for some pool hopping tonight. It seemed doubtful that this drunken fit alone would generate more flirtation than just her playful teasing, never mind get her back on top of someone, but it was a step in the right direction. However, that's the future. In the present, Jen was reveling in pleasure she hoped was endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut beer isn't endless. Eventually, Jen's bust was covered with only saliva, and the cooler was empty. The girls pulled away, even denying Jen a kiss as they slipped away beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio emerged from the depths, but not swimming or treading. Each staggered towards the shallow end and surfaced in order of height with a sharp inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tallest, Allison was the first to catch her breath. \"I dink we're too drunk ta be in a pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're outta beer anyway,\" Jen added. \"Let'sh call it a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing no disagreements, the girls slid over to the edge and attempted to pull themselves out. The alcohol made sure that wouldn't work. Jen pointed over towards the steps in the shallow end, and blazed Total Breakdown's zigzag trail to dry land. A few near-spills later, and the girls were already at the fence with death grips on the links. Even at this level of inebriation, they probably would have taken the trouble with the pool as a sign to go around, but it was the only way out unless they found the gate key. Plus, Aimee's well-maintained lawn was probably softer than Ed's concrete, something Allison confirmed when her climb over turned into a flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen raised her arms in celebration. \"Dis wuz a great idea!\" she yelled to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we gotta do dat again!\" Allison said. She tweaked Jen's nipples and added, \"I like playin wid dese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let'sh shee when dey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal got cut off by Aimee's back door. The alcohol prevented her from noticing the metal knob resisted her hand, but the unyielding oak wood got her attention. Thankfully, the alcohol also slowed her pace, dulled the pain, and already reddened her face. The pressure left as quick as it came, and the effects of the impact would be gone before the alcohol's. The effects of its origin, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee!\" Crystal whined. \"Ya locked ya door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shorry. It'sh a habit,\" she replied. \"Hang on, I'll get da key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee's right hand shot up and started roughly kneading her left breast into her chest. It only took a few moments for Jen to copy her, though the bassist was gentler with her efforts, caressing the flesh while tracing the nub. The chain reaction carried over to Allison and Crystal, each opting to use two hands. The drummer crossed her arms over herself and began to rake her finger nails along the underside of her bust as her thumb nails scraped her nipples, giving into her inner masochist. Conversely, the guitarist elected to leave her cleavage uncovered as she jiggled herself up and down. No matter how, all four drunkards were back to playing with themselves, giggling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why we rubbin our girlsh?\" Aimee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Crystal said. \"You started it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prolly cuz it'sh fun!\" Allison added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee looked down to her groping hand and burst out laughing. \"I forgot I'm not wearin a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls lurched forward in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl!\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Ya carry evyding in dere, doncha?\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal Breakdown kept laughing until Crystal saw their new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee,\" she said, \"when ya took ya bra off, did ya take ya door key out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh right! I tossed it in da coola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of their faces fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da one I tipped into da pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head. \"I dun dink we should try divin for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya got a spare?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One wid Crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls turned to their leader, whose face was buried in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only spare's at my parent's, across town,\" she said. \"I'm not showin up at deir front door in da middle a da night bare ash nekkid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Den we're stuck out ere,\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Aimee continued. \"I got anudda. Wid da Bellamys. We can ask dem when dey get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and Allison threw their hands up in the air. Their options sucked, but they were clear. Wait for Aimee's obnoxious neighbors, streak the long distance to Crystal's parents, or be locked out naked all night. Perhaps drowning in the pool would be easier.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Copious amounts of alcohol was relatively new territory for Total Breakdown, and Crystal especially. As the lead vocalist, corrosives like alcohol would make all the years of practice and research turn to naught, and Aimee and Jen and were no strangers to backup singing, so alcohol abstinence was essentially a must. Even so, they decided to suspend this rule for tonight, figuring one night of hard partying wouldn't destroy them. If parents would let responsible teenagers have a sip on St. Patrick's day or New Year's, why not a little more for adults to celebrate a major success?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the high of the night's triumph turned a little into a lot very quickly. Before long, the girls found themselves staggering about and slurring their words. The lack of experience only compounded their problems even further. This party and its members were certain to hit the floor very quickly unless someone changed their course. For that, there was Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the rest of the girls, Allison's singing time was minimal since she never could get the hang of stick work with a microphone in the way. It allowed her a less restrictive lifestyle, and she enjoyed every moment of the booze-filled freedom she could manage. Among the positive consequences were that she had developed some resistance to the physical effects and had learned to function normally even as it hit her, making her the lone sober-looking girl at this celebration. That said, her mental state would still become quite impaired. This was made most obvious when she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are such amateurs,\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen said, \"Well ekshcushe ush, Abshent Ally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, anyone could 'o thish if they blew off practish ta party ash much ash you,\" Crystal added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a simple way to solve it,\" Allison continued. \"We take a quick jog while you're all still smashed. You'll figure it out through practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shounds good,\" Crystal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing: strip first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah?\" Aimee asked. Though Aimee was blushing the whole time, there was no question in anyone's mind that her face got darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How doesh that help?\" Crystal continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want your clothes and stuff throwing your balance off, do you? Besides, what's a party without some streaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your only shaying that cuz you shuck at beer pong!\" Jen says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison finally joined the crimson cheeks club, recalling a few particularly embarrassing games of beer pong. The guys all insisted that a shut out means the loser does a naked lap, and early on Allison didn't have the know-how to make a shot while sober. Mortifying as it was - especially on the occasion her clothes \"disappeared\" and she needed to call Jen for help - Allison persevered until she could finally hit at least one cup. Add to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I learned to function completely blitzed?\" Allison said. \"No better system than streaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine!\" Crystal concluded. \"I'm the bosh and I shay she'sh right! Now shtrip! You too, Allishon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout flinching, Allison said, \"Wouldn't have it any other way. Someone's gotta take charge of you lightweights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Crystal's command, the girls alternated between filling the tank and shedding their covers, more than enough of the former to have Allison stagger against a leaning room. Even Aimee was coaxed into it after their leader let loose some friendly groping in intimate areas. They didn't bother to keep their shoes since most of them weren't sensible for running, and Allison claimed it would help toughen them up. Besides, the streets around here weren't too littered, especially since the garbage trucks made their rounds today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the floor was dressed, Crystal led the girls on their grand adventure for the evening. Unlike Allison's beer pong losses, she decided this wouldn't be a simple lap. Instead, she blazed a trail at random, leading her bandmates wherever she got the impulse. This led the girls right into trouble as...</span></div></div>",

Holding up a hand to signal the others to stop, Crystal bent over with her hands on her knees to catch her breath. The other three followed suit, the quiet of the night only interrupted by the sound of their panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew. Talk about exciting!\" Crystal said. \"This was a great idea, Allison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smiled, waltzing over to Crystal and giving her a friendly slap on the shoulder. \"Told ya! Nothing to make you feel alive like acting a little crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nothing to make you feel chilly like a naked run in the night...\" Jen chimed in. \"As fun as this was, I think we should head back to the house and get dressed. Warm up a bit, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal turned around to survey the rest of her band. They certainly seemed as tired as she was, and she couldn't deny Jen's comment about the chill of the night air, especially given the physical evidence all four women were sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it <i>is</i> a little nipply.\" Crystal mused. \"Okay, let's head back to Aimee's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid redhead was giggling up a storm at the moment. \"Ahahahahaha! 'Nipply!' I get it!\" Aimee said. As the smallest member of the band, it made sense that she was still the most inebriated, and it would seem that alcohol brought her out of her shell. \"But, Crystal... which way do we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal hesitated at that. \"What... what do you mean? We're going back to your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but where is that?\" Aimee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh...\" Crystal said, trailing off. <i>Oh, crap. Where is it?!</i> she suddenly thought with worry. \"Don't you know the way back to your own house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from here. I've never been here before.\" Aimee said, looking around lazily. \"This is all new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls went quiet as their situation sank in. They had no idea how to get back to Aimee's house. They were stark naked, and the night air served to remind them of this with every little breeze. Things couldn't get much worse than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal knew she had to take control. As the leader of the band, the other girls looked to her for guidance and support. It was time for her to take charge and pick a direction... even if that direction was decided at absolute random and a silent wish for luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't worry. Just follow me and we'll be back at Aimee's in no time.\" Crystal said. \"Now, first off, we're going to go...\"</span></div></div>",

Total Breakdown, bitches!\" Jen shouted to nobody in particular as the band streaked down the streets. \"We rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the baddest and sexiest rockers in the city!\" Allison chimed in, giving Jen a playful swat on her bouncing ass as she ran past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee and Crystal, meanwhile, remained quiet.

Though it was entirely possible that the blush was the result of ogling Crystal's naked body in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, take this left, girls!\" Crystal declared, glancing back at her bandmates behind her.

Or hope these were establishing shots for a pre-recorded newscast to be aired later that could edit them out if they had been captured. Or for a live broadcast, that it would be on delay and they could be covered with a mosaic. But then, if they had been sober, they wouldn't be here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, with the alcohol clouding their minds, all they saw was opportunity. They wanted a live, wanted no delay in the feed. Even if the on-site team was composed enough to react instantly, Crystal and the band's name would still reach out to every viewer. It was a golden ticket to fame that could only be screwed up by an opportunity to edit. The approach would be rude and was bound to cost them a few fans, but publicity was publicity. Plus, by a stroke of good luck, they were even given the chance to piggy back this on the broadcaster's fame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a friendly rival's massive success with culturally and politically motivated, Total Breakdown opted to throw in their two cents and try to fast track their stardom the same way. Step one was, naturally, watch the news more often. This led them right to Mackenzie Fairbairn, a fellow rising star. Between her good looks and her devotion to the truth, she was quickly becoming the most popular newscaster in the city, and some were certain she'd reach the national level within the year. The musicians' political song was still withstanding, but maybe they wouldn't need it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal turned back to her bandmates, nodding her head towards the cameras. A glint appeared in each of their eyes, even Aimee's. A grin spread across each of their faces, silently agreeing to force their way into this broadcast for some free publicity. Be it a surge of adrenaline, the call of the limelight, or just the alcohol, Total Breakdown's bare bodies failed to be factored into this decision. However, three of them had considered Mackenzie's bare body, or soon to be bare anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this and despite the slapping of their feet against the pavement, Mackenzie and the others had yet to notice anything.

She brought her hands slowly, numbly, to her temples and propped her head slowly from where she was. She looked down with squinted vision and noticed she was naked. She was actually not cold, but was rather uncomfortable, as she was on some sort of cheap vinyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she was slowly came to her. The previous hours (possibly night) was still a blur, but she had vague memories of going back outside to their humble, never used tour bus in an attempt to go home, though it did not explain where her clothes had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panicked. Waking naked was fine in her own home, or in the home of her friends, but she was outside someplace, in a nearly empty tour bus, and she was not even sure if she had the keys with her. She looked out the window next to her and noted she was outside, and it was morning. She was high up enough no one would notice her in the street, but that was where she was - in some street somewhere, stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She called, looking up and down the bus. There were two long seats, then the two front seats. There was space to keep things underneath each seat, as well as in the compartments above. They would use the bus to carry equipment to shows, though they had not actually traveled beyond their city - this last show was to change just that, and it was <i>going</i> to, but right now, it was a stalling equipment carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing they were once at Aimee's she looked outside to see if perhaps her house was close by. There was no luck. Someone, hopefully not herself, had driven the bus halfway to Crystal's apartment before stopping at the side of a residential road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a buzz, and looked frantically for her phone. She found it underneath a seat and put it to her ear. \"H-Hello?\" She said. The voice responding cut into her headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Crystal! Where you at?\" It was Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the bus.\" Crystal groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you on your way, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't read the texts yet? Ugh! Did you just wake up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal pulled her phone from her face to glance at it. It was eleven in the morning. \"No. What's going on? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff!\" Allison laughed on the other end. \"Hey, I got to get ready, but I'll tell ya real fast - you need to get to the garage! Jen's already there sobering up, and I think Aimee is on her way, but she didn't answer. We're getting a visit! Maybe you don't remember, but we got a call last night from an agent! You even took the call and everything, but passed it to Jen halfway through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, please, tell me what happened last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno what you did the whole time, but around midnight we drew straws who would have to spend the night at the garage to wait for the agents at noon. Jen had to do it, and Aimee drove you two there. She wasn't near as plastered as us.\" Allison laughed in a memory. \"I went to another bar, but it wasn't as fun without you guys so I crashed at home. Jen sent us all texts as a reminder. I really need to get up, though. Give Aimee a call, would you? She hasn't answered yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, but,\" Crystal started, but Allison gave a loud yawn and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cool, see you there!\" And the line hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked at her phone. Quickly, she dialed Aimee, but there was no answer. Instead, she got a text that read, \"Still asleep. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal felt her head jump with desperation, but remembered Aimee was not keen on the phone - she always felt very awkward. As calm as she could, she texted Aimee. \"I'm still in the bus. Where did you leave me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Aimee was fast at responding. \"You insisted you could get back yourself, since you would need the bus to get to the garage today. Did you not remember? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked around. She was naked, not sure where she was, and not feeling alright at all. In one hour, she had to make it to a their practice room, a large studio garage behind a residential neighborhood, but she did not have a single stitch of clothing on her, and no one else seemed to note she had lost her clothing. Apprehensively, she texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am missing some of my stuff. Do you know where it went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You accidentally spilled stuff on your concert clothes and gave them to me to throw in the wash. Should I check if you left anything in them? Did they have pockets? I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee always worried and apologized, so Crystal quickly replied, \"no, it's fine, there probably isn't anything in them.\" Aimee would not have left Crystal naked driving home, however. She must have done this to herself at some point, but was unsure just how.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing she did not start the evening naked, she decided to look for what clothes were left. Most likely, she chose a band t-shirt they had silk screened and some other back-up clothes for their concerts. They had changes of costumes, after all, although she was not sure where they were anymore. They had not needed them in a month or so, and it was likely Aimee or Jen had taken them back to their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best likely scenario would be to also find the keys, so she could guarantee herself to get to the garage on time. Surely she was not farther than an hour's drive away, but she knew she could not show up at the door with no clothes at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis presented her a short idea. She texted Aimee again, this time asking for a change of clothes (Aimee was not too far a different size than herself) brought to the garage for her so she could change when she got there. That took care of that, but she still had to arrive early to change, and she still had to somehow sneak past her bandmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, more important than her clothes was this opportunity! She <i>had</i> to make it there on time. She used the map application on her phone and checked where she was. The GPS was a little iffy, but she recognized this location as a few blocks off from where she usually used to get home. Chances were she got lost on the way back and decided she was too sleepy or drunk to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few choices of where to look in the bus without going outside. There were sounds out there - it was a hot day and many were out jogging, mowing the lawn, and getting places. She had to keep her search inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, if she stood up on the seats to reach the overhead compartments, even the height of the bus would not shield her naked self to anyone looking inside. The thought drew her in a ball, and she pressed her knees against her chest. She was not too completely timid on stage, and she would sport a fine bikini at the beach, but the last thing she needed in a tender moment like this - hung over, a bit lost, naked, and in a rush for her career, was to have cops called on her, or have some douchebags catcalling her or shaking the bus or anything else. Her mind went to awkward, then sinister, then downright horrible places in fear. She breathed deeply. She had to keep calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now at least anyone who wanted to try and look in could only see the top of her head. She knew there were things often kept up there, but there was also the compartments beneath the seats, the two seats up front with the glove compartment, or the bathroom. If she could find the keys, she could spend all the time searching she wanted. Her map application warned her, though, that if she walked to the garage it would take nearly fifty minutes - not a lot of leeway, especially since she needed time to change when she got there. If she drove, it would take barely fifteen, but that was only if she could <i>find</i> the keys.</span></div></div>",

She reached from the single seat behind the driver's seat to the compartment up front and let it open. The only thing in there was a registration paper and a few arena parking passes. She groaned and looked outside again, leaning farther forward, her breasts pressed hard against the hot vinyl of the chair. She looked at the key hole by the steering wheel and also saw nothing. She slunk back in her chair and felt something a bit cold press against her right butt cheek. She stood up fast, then checked the area between the cushion and the back of the chair to find a quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal groaned and threw the quarter against the floor. The sound of a <i>tang</i> was actually quite loud, and she immediately looked to the door to make sure no one had heard. She did not see anyone at first, but then there was a foot at the edge of the glass door leading outside. Immediately, Crystal pressed herself as far into the corner of the chair, curling her small body up so no one could look diagonally in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older man walked up to the glass and looked inside, seeing her face easily. She was fairly certain she was pressed far back against the bus enough that the length of the seat would cover his view of any other part of her body. He waved a bit nonchalantly, and she gave a weak smile back. She was wildly conscious of her body now, squeezed as small as possible, with her chest almost sore from the pressure of her legs balled against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to continue on his way, she realized this was a man she would never meet again. There was hardly a chance he was a fan of punk rock, and he would never have to enter the bus. The least she could do was ask for a bit of help. What, though, she did not know. A towel might be too obvious, especially since she would just have him leave it outside. She almost laughed at the thought she could ask him for proper clothes from perhaps his wife or child. She then recalled he was wearing a grey sweater. It was hot outside, so it was strange, but maybe he did not notice. She could call out to him from the window, ask him to pass the sweater up to the window, and have at least something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would not solve her current issue. There was 55 minutes left, so she only had time to search once more before she would have to make a break for the garage, naked or not.</span></div></div>",

She brandished it with bravado, seeing it was the key to the bus. Smiling, she knew she had over half an hour now safe, so long as the bus and traffic allowed. Just to be safe, she quickly looked up to see the gas gauge, and tried to remember the last time the bus gave any issues. It was old and janky, sure, but it never really broke down. There was enough gas to take her to the garage, easily. She had 50 minutes left to get to the garage, and it only took 15 to drive. Driving was easy, though with the see-through door anyone to her right would be able to look inside. She knew the glare was pretty bad, especially when driving, and no one could really look in well unless she was in the shade...

If she simply strut her whole way there, she could actually pull something like this off, make it to the garage, sneak in the side possibly, grab the clothes (she decidedly sent a text to Aimee to leave the clothes in the bathroom at the garage for her), change, and be ready!

As she began to wrap the paper about her leg, she wondered if someday int he future she would ever even tell her bandmates. That all depended on the mood, likely, and whether or not this actually went well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began with a V from her hips to her inner thigh. She was not sure what this was for aside from some semblance of panties, but was making it up as she went. She then made a waist line, tucked it in across her stomach, and looked down with a bit of pleasure. This was not so bad. They sort of looked like white short-shorts. She layered a bit more paper on that for good measure, but then found the top layer slightly looser than the bottom. It seemed paper did not stay curved like fabric, so she did not add any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to her top, wrapping her chest like a binder. It reminded her a bit of japanese sarashi, which were sometimes long bandages on the chest to keep things still. She now had an effective tube top stretching from an inch below her armpit to two inches above her belly button, though even as she tucked it in under her arm for support she felt her chest moving in between the layers of four inch toilet paper. She thought of trying to tighten it, but since it was already wrapped as she began to pull she felt the paper grow taught under her finger, but not budge. Paper just had too much friction - she would have to completely unwrap it all to tighten it, and she thought she already did a good job. She tried to gauge her work with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving tried on one of Jen's corsets, it had been joked Crystal simply had too perky of breasts. They were a decent size, which meant they pressed against the fabric, and the friction even threatened to harden some noticeable points - points she dreadfully hoped would not manage to slip through the layers. She put an extra wrap in that spot just in case. Crystal's breasts simply did not want to flatten back, but sort of firmly formed around whatever point they were. She knew she had to keep a close eye on her top. She figured she could try and fashion straps, but that seemed ridiculous, and did not know at all how that would work. That, and she was out of time. She made her choice: it was fifty till twelve. She had to begin to go now to make it.</span></div></div>",

The first thing she noticed was that it was hot. Even the very breeze was hot, and the layered paper made areas of her body almost immediately perspire. Her thighs were skinny, and did not rub much together, but each time they managed to she felt the paper shift slightly, which only made her more nervous. She kept her arms rather still, as she felt her tube top continue to loosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not look and see if anyone was staring actively, but she really only noticed a couple glances. Even from up close looking at herself, she had to admit her job was pretty decent. Due to the bright white nature and the beating sun between the clouds, the layers and folds of the paper were not really noticeable. She looked mostly like she had some white shorts and a white tube top. Perfectly normal for the weather, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest issue, really, was the hot sidewalk. She had no shoes, and almost wished she wrapped her feet (though thought later that that would not have lasted long at all). She glanced at her phone. Things were going fine, though, and she just had to tough it through. She had made up five minutes. She had 35 minutes to her destination, and 40 minutes left till noon, and now she was at the edge of the park.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were dozens of people every few steps. It was not overtly crowded, but it was much more people than Crystal wanted, even as she mentally prepared for it. Half a minute up the path there was a couple of young men setting up some music equipment for a small crowd, just drawing more people. She felt eyes peeled on her, but also felt very little. She might have stood out if people paid attention, but even with her blue hair, most people were simply going about their business here, moving along. The only ones who stared longer than a second were those who sat down, simply watching the people go by. She would move past them fast enough, and never again have to deal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a whistle to her right as she hustled along. She tried to ignore it, already certain it as for her, and found herself cut off by three men. They were not the sort of guys she ever wanted to talk to. The simplest description, between the plaid shorts and expensive sunglasses and bleached gelled hair, was they looked the fitting description of douchebags. Looks were not always what Crystal would judge first, but she was in a bind, and these were the people who first stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this you're wearin' huh?\" The first said. He had high cheek bones and a smile she could not imagine anyone in the world could manage to trust. Crystal merely ignored him and tried to move on forward, though she felt his hand against both the back of her tube top and her shorts. \"Check it out! She's all wrapped up in bandages or somethin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and summoned as much rage as she could. There was a lot she was feeling. \"Leave me the fuck alone!\" She slammed her hands down on his grip, which worked quite well on getting him off of her, but also pulled out the tucked-in paper on both her top and bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the men Ooooed and grabbed for one of the strands, while the third the other. Quickly, she ripped off a foot on each and ran forward, but without shoes, as well as being a mite bit shorter, she was not nearly fast enough. People were <i>watching</i> and no one was doing anything-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men who were setting up for a performance rushed down. The first was wearing glasses, and had arms thick with tattoos. \"Hey!\" He said. His voice was loud, but it was not exactly bouncer quality. The three douchebags regrouped and stood up against the other two musicians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal had her knees bent, her hands up against her chest and legs to take inventory and tuck in the paper. Things had certainly become more breezy, though she did not really lose any layers. The wrappings around her legs felt a bit more loose from the rubbing, and the wrapping at her stomach level and below that finished off the look of shorts were a bit more loose from the pull, but otherwise fine. Her top, however, was in much worse shape, already being a bit loose to begin with. There were so many looking now, and she was painfully aware that the wraps were loose enough to move down just slightly across her breasts, which were firm enough to make the tube top lose the properties of a binder and look more like their natural, perky shape. With the bright light, it could almost be see through down just far enough to see half the top of her breast, and the curve forward before more binded layers killed the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe douchebags and the musicians were having a short argument. \"I don't care if she was walking out here naked, that's no reason to insist she was asking for anything.\" The first musician said. The other was notably larger, with an impressive beard for his younger looking age, but he only stood and looked menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first douchebag scoffed and tried to push past the first musician. A bit of a wrestling, awkward punching match immediately ensued. The bearded musician sent a wide hook that knocked one douchebag out immediately, then was tackling the another. The first douchebag and the first musician got in a scuffle, with the musician clearly in the losing side.</span></div></div>",

She had her own rage in the situation, and she let that carry her fist. She did a wide round punch, right to the left side of the first douchebag's jaw. The movement, with all the adrenaline mixed with anger, made her see things almost in slow motion. The pain was rather satisfying, both in the douche's face, as well as in her own knuckles. She saw floating bits of her own paper, though, also moving with her motion, slightly unraveling and coming loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of time rushed in, and she found herself gripping her clothes to stay in position. The douche was quite phased, and also off the musician. One of the other two douchebags was on the ground cold, the other locked with the bearded man, who, while beating on the douche's back, gave a soft nod to the first musician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first musician looked ready to pounce on the first douchebag, but looked at Crystal for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her paper up was all she could do. Her left arm was across her chest, as it had come nearly completely unraveled. It had draped down both her front and back by a few feet, the bottom most strands reaching around her knees. Her chest was covered mainly by her arm itself, pressing against the thin paper. Her shorts had completely come apart, no longer bound to her thighs or well tied across her waist. Her right hand cupped some remaining paper between her legs, with only a loose set of paper wrapped the front and back of her thighs. It rode low enough in back, not bound at all, that the paper drooped below the majority of her butt, revealing its soft curve, only covering the bottom-most portion in the back. All of the sides of her hips, minus the small loop of paper, were on display, and each breeze kicked most of the airy paper around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musician looked around fast, then pointed to the trees where there were much less people. \"In there.\" He said, and kicked the douche lightly to keep him back. She shuffled ahead, him following just a bit behind, keeping a quick eye over his shoulder to see if his friend was keeping the others in check, all the while stealing short glances at the jiggling butt, only slightly covered at the very bottom, shift along. No one else in the crowd slowed them, and let them make their way in between a number of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musician stopped outside the trees and turned around so one side of him could be seen by her if she turned to see him, though he was not facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal turned when she reached safety and saw the musician looking away. Her breathing was hard, and she really just felt good. It was something to do with adrenaline, but she just plain felt amazing. She gave a sigh and smiled, though a look down reminded herself what sort of position she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I don't have much to help you with.\" The musician said. \"I can leave you alone if you want. Um. I could lend you my shirt, but really it's about all I have to spare. It's a little hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal took a few steps toward him, but still kept a fair distance. Really, she wanted to stay far enough away from the entrance of this thicket of trees so no one else could see her. \"I would like that.\" She said, trying to sound at least a bit pleasant. She noted a shake in her voice, likely as the events were catching up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeled the shirt off his back and half threw it behind himself. He missed her by a mile, but she still gladly took it and slipped it on. It was a t-shirt fitting him, but he was larger. She let the paper drop, useless to the ground. Her top was completely covered now, and the neck hole was not even all too large. The bottom hem reached half way to her knees. Only really the arm holes presented a bit of a problem, being a bit wide for her skinny arms. She knew if she lifted her hands up sideways someone could look in, but she still felt tons better than she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kris.\" He said. \"That's me. I didn't completely mean to intrude or anything, but I just figured... Well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Thank you.\" Crystal could not help but feel fine in the situation. This was the best luck she had in a while. She checked her phone and breathed deep. 35 minutes of walking, and 35 minutes remaining. The woods were closer, luckily, to the garage, but she really had to keep moving.</span></div></div>",

It was a good experience, and she hoped that luck would continue, but unfortunately, it did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt something a bit warm fall on her shoulder, then the center of her head. She looked up and had to blink - it was raining! She touched the top of her chest in defense, hearing the bits of tap-taps across her paper-bandaged body. The rain continued to pick up, just a bit of a dense sprinkle, but still enough to drench her if it went on for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her toilet paper clothes were becoming transparent, and falling apart as it broke away from the wetness. The first layer was already a little gross, and when her fingers came in contact with the paper, it sort of gooped up a little as it ripped. Worse than that, it formed close to her, as well as picked up a little weight to droop on her body. The transparency was building at the edges of the top of her tube top, and falling away bit by bit, drop by drop. The bottom, already coming apart a little at the legs, now sagged further, loosening enough to create thin lines of skin across her thighs and stomach where the toilet paper width did not meet any longer. The zig zags of skin moved across the side of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not sure how long the hot rain would continue. Often it would be quite short, but she had to decide what to do, and fast. Most everyone in the park around her was rather preoccupied with their own rain issues to notice, but that would only last a moment.</span></div></div>",

She felt the ravels of her legs also loosen and fall, and as she ran, more and more water spilled against her, faster than it did before across her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were people who looked at her as she ran, but they did not see her long. She made it to the wooded areas rather quickly just slightly off the sidewalk path, even rather diagonally in the direction she needed to go. As she ran, however, she felt her outfit slip away. Her right arm stayed across her chest, but as the rain fell over the exposed areas of her front, she felt it goop and then tear with the jostling. Her chest bounced just slightly, also lowering the bottom of the tube top, ravel by ravel, and as it exposed to more rain, disintegrated against her stomach. Her left hand stayed over her pelvic area, but she felt that loosening quickly. The rain fell against her hips and thighs, and the paper faded away, transparent and becoming a second skin, then soon either falling off or disappearing entirely. This meant her butt was completely exposed, though at least not with much any goop on it since the paper merely fell off from being loose rather than being exposed to the rain hitting her front as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had a little bit of paper below her stomach that she held on, and it whipped around as she ran, getting shorter and shorter, riding up between her legs until she could feel the tickle on her inner thighs as the paper whisked and moved against them. Her right arm wrapped around her chest also held a bit of paper, but it, too, was useless and merely a pressed mess against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow behind a couple trees, far from any eyes, and even rather far from any voices, she looked at herself. She had bits of paper all over her, and it was mostly translucent, gross, and useless. She plucked a few leaves from the tree to wipe it all off. Part of her merely felt it was better to be naked than look like she came from a sewer. The rain had let up to droplets, and she shoot some branches to help aid in cleaning her. Between a set of trees, she had a couple ways to look out into the park, though nothing too effective. She was working on using some leaves on a freshly dropped branch to clean off bits on her knees, bent just slightly, when she looked up through one of her holes in the trees and saw someone not five yards away looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man was simply walking and took a short reprieve from the rain under some branches when he stumbled on this sight. He did not mean it, and was agape. In the circle of a view made by the surrounding branches, he saw a young lady with blue hair bent over. Her breasts her hanging, and he saw half of her wet, glistening back. The view was a bit remiss due to the fact the leaves did rise and curve in a circle as she bent, covering half of the view of her breasts, though she still saw their firm shape, which he assumed slowly would curve to their rounded points. He saw the top of her flat stomach, toned perfectly even when slightly bent, all of her fresh and clean and wet.</span></div></div>",

She took inventory of what was around her - she knew people could have abandoned some things close by in the rain, but she also had all these branches and leaves, which she saw while she cleaned herself were rather malleable.

Her clothes now more looking like they were made of toilet paper, but they covered her as well as they had before. There was also the problem she only covered up the wetness underneath, and she could feel it spreading to the new paper, but ignored it. It was not all that wet, and would likely be fine. She peeked outside the stall and saw no one, then did the same outside the restrooms themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were people here and there far off, but most appeared to be leaving the park. The rain did help her a little. She watched her time. She was right on schedule, with 35 minutes left till noon. She could cut through the park fairly quickly if she ran, and shave off plenty of minutes by not following the set sidewalk. She took advantage of the lessened people and ran ahead, cutting across wet grass and a few sidewalks. She knew the park fairly well, and trusted in her instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she glided over the grass, however, she hit a flattened wet patch and slipped. She went to her knees quickly and slammed her hands into the ground, and saved her outfit from even touching the floor. She almost felt a bit proud, saving herself from getting quite dirty and a bit wet, but noticed the movement loosened the paper drastically. The wraps around her top let her breasts jiggle a bit too freely as she stood back up, and the paper sagged a bit, showing some of her small cleavage. On the bottom, they were even worse than they were when it was raining, her legs almost completely unraveled aside from the tops of her inner thighs. Still, she made it so far through the park, though she noticed up ahead, toward the corner she was aiming for, was its main entrance square. There were more people there. She could, however, cut to a residential area through a wooded area to her right, and it would barely cost her any time, and she only would have to cross one small sidewalk with plenty of cover.

It was rather degrading to think about, and she did not want to be seen like this by anyone, even a stranger who never would see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way into the woods and bushes, cutting through to the small residential area behind the larger commercial area attached to the park. There was not nearly as many people there, and she would only be adding one small block to her run. She made it to the small sidewalk that people would walk up and down and hid in the bushes for a moment, looking left and right for a time no one would be looking her way. She did not have long to wait, and she knew the bushes were tall enough they would be hard to into. Pressed against the prickly branches, she could see rather well. It was a bit fun sneaking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her moment, and backed up from the bushes to not make too much of a rustle, then she passed in between them to the other side. As she did, though, she felt a tug across her top and bottom. She knew her window may be small, and she rushed through to the other side, diving in to the bushes and woods there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snags caught her paper clothes in multiple locations, making tears all along her stomach (and irritating her skin), loosening the shorts and making them sag as loose bits of papers dangling diagonally from her hips across her front. The wrapping around her thighs was gone, torn from the inside and out, and now the only thing covering both her butt and vagina were those loose dangling pieces, just a few inches long. They flowed loosely like a loincloth, and exposed all of her legs up to her hip bone on both sides. Her tube top had flipped back and forth in the struggle, with long strands even coming loose entirely and flipping over her shoulder. There was really no more wrapping to be had on the top, as it had too many perforations to stay till, and now her chest dangled almost freely, the only thing keeping them covered were the loose strands of paper over her shoulders and draping across the perkiness of the breast themselves. Her back was nearly bare aside from a loose long strange of paper that looped low on her back and high up, loosely covering her chest, resting diagonally in balance above her nipples, and every so slightly conforming with the faintest of wetness to her skin to keep it covered. The wet also meant it was a bit transparent, and very fragile, however, and she could see hints of both her skin around her areola, as well as the slight pink that showed clearly where what needed covering began. Some of the wisps across her shoulders dangled across her nipples with the wind, but that was as fragile as it was - the wind commanded her paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to grasp her chest and cover herself, though she was alone and hidden, and she knew if she touched anything it likely would fall apart completely. The wind indicated if she moved easily, she may still stay covered, though the idea of a small loin cloth and a translucent top only shielded by moving straps was not a good one. The good news was that she was no longer looking like she was wearing toilet paper. She looked more like she was wearing a random tiny white outfit fit for a stripping performance. She moved slowly and easily to the end of the park, where she knew she was half way to the garage. She saw in the street, however, there was a few tables set in a new cafe. A few young people were set up reading or conversing, all in the way of her path to the sets of alleys and street that would take her almost nearly to her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was rather proud of her body, but she always said she needed control over it and its own exposure.</span></div></div>",

Crystal summoned all her pride and power over her body, ripped off what was left of her clothes, made sure nothing remained, and stepped out into the street. She crossed the street and made it to the far sidewalk before anyone really even looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a group of five conversing young people who stopped talking, looked at her, and stared. There were two others who were deep over their books, but as her shadow blocked the light over one, he looked up and gave a soft squint that immediately turned into an open eyed revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was naked, her body completely on show. It was perfect and clean, her angular features, her toned stomach, her rounded breasts. She stood as plain and casual as could be, but then stuck one of her hips to the side as she spoke. \"Take everything out of that suit pocket and give it to me.\" Her voice was a command, plain, but almost a bit sultry. It could have been his imagination. His eyes traced her form, the slight round of her thighs, the inward progression of her pelvis down to her shaved vagina. He looked up and saw the small pink areola, brought to a soft point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man blinked, then his hands worked for him, pulling out his phone and his wallet from the suit he had slung in the chair he sat in. He pulled the suit up and handed it to her. \"Th-thank you.\" He said, but was not sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and gave a wink, slinging the suit over her shoulder as she strutted away on her tip-toes. \"Thank you.\" She said back, letting him stare at her butt the entire walk she took from the table to the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the suit on. It was big for her, with the shoulder comically reaching inches past her shoulders. She could button it in front, but it would show the entire area between her breasts and almost down to her navel. She decided to hold it closed. It reached down almost to her knees, being some sort of long cut, and that was rather pleasing.</span></div></div>",

Having cleared the bushes, she immediately turned to the street and ran. She was farther away from the cafe for sure, but there were people all around in a distance. From their positions, some ten or so yards away, she might not have looked so strangely dressed as she was, but still, they saw something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal did not bother touching her paper, as she knew it would fall apart. Instead, she could only trust the soft wetness would keep it bound to her skin as she ran. Her loin cloth billowed out behind her, giving only minimal cover to the top of her butt. In front, as the breeze whisked across the strands that covered her vagina, the loin cloth moved left and right, tickling her inner thighs, though keeping her covered. The cloth moved to show the V at the top of her right leg moving inward, but still did not move entirely away. Her top was more revealing to her predicament, bouncing freely with her breasts like she was wearing nothing at all. Her breasts were a decent size, and jiggled wildly with each step, but the stickiness of the paper stayed on her breasts. The translucence grew, however, and more and more her pink showed. As she cleared the street, she felt some paper on her left breast rip. It did not remove completely, and still was on her, but it was losing its strength fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached an alley between a commercial and residential district, Crystal had run herself more than half way to the garage. She looked to herself and saw her chest heave as she breathed hard. Her breasts swelled with each breath, each time threatening to push through the thin white layer of paper.</span></div></div>",

She was not entirely sure what businesses she was behind, but she figured there could be at least a little something she could wear. At first, there were wrappers for foot and a ton of plastic bags. She considered them for a second, but for the most part they were far too disgusting, and she thought they would draw too much more attention for all the worse reasons. She kept the trash far from her skin, and was careful to keep the flowing remnants of her clothes away from anything it could stick to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw behind her a couple bags to clear the way, and then found a slightly open bag full of green aprons. It was the only thing she saw that was reminiscent of clothing, and began to reach for it when she heard a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was likely a person, somewhere to her right in the direction she needed to go. Going back was a bad idea, since she was running short on time, but also hiding would not help much in an open alley.

She pulled two out that seemed fine, putting one quickly around her neck and tied to to her back. As she did, the brushing against her chest easily loosened the transparent paper, and it fell away in clumps. Since her back was exposed, she put the second folded across her backside to complete the semblance of a skirt. There were two small slits where the aprons did not quite overlap on the sides of her legs, but the aprons did cover all of her front and back half way to her knees. The side slits were barely shown, and about level with the bottom of the curve of her butt, they joined together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top was a bit more of an issue, as it did not wrap around her chest so well. While there were no account of cleavage or stomach, her shoulders and back were completely bare, and the curving back nature to the ties around her chest only covered the front of her chest. There were no sleeves to an apron, and so from the side if her arms lifted at all all of the curve of her breasts were visible, and if she ever leaned forward, sending the curve of the apron forward, they would easily be exposed. She kept a hand on it to keep it steady, and kept the knot and the neck strap tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she straightened out her apron, however, she heard someone yell, \"Hey!\" She saw a man in his early thirties, also dressed in an apron like hers with a bag of trash. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal shot a glare and began to walk past him, but he moved in front of her. \"You can't be here. And this is stealing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffed. \"Stealing? It was trash.

Still, she peeled off his socks, turned them inside out, and put them over her feet. She would care much more of the grossness of the situation if her own feet were not so dirty, or pained from the rocks and dirt. Even a layer of wool would help tremendously against the heat, or the possibility of something sharp on the ground. As she bent over, she felt the end of the apron on her butt riding higher, as well as the front end drooping. She decided to next go for the pants, yanking them down to reveal his boxers in a few swift tugs. He was not all too too tall or fat, but when she stepped into them they still pooled some at her feet, and it sat very low on her hips. In fact, if she kept her legs together they would surely drop, and she had to keep them held up, but they covered much more than the bottom apron, which she removed. She then began to peel up his shirt, checking every so often if he was waking up, but even with his pasty legs exposed to the gross alley floor, he was not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard the door open again. Someone else was coming from the cafe! Of course - he would not take long to dump some trash. Crystal ran down the alley, plodding past the door where someone else poked their head out. As she went, the pants dropped slightly in the back, and she held them up to her navel in front, her other hand keeping the apron around her neck close to her chest so the sides would not flare out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the end of the alley, still running in fear someone from the cafe would come after her. There was a crash ahead of her, however, and police were making a perimeter. Crystal made a decision to try and rush past, but one of the policemen's shoulders crashed into her and she went down to the ground. It was painful against her bare back, and it also rode the pants down her hips to the point where it dipped to reveal her left thigh, and down far enough on her crotch to show the top of her mound. The apron stayed on well, but her breasts now were under the effect of gravity, and bounced hard with the thud, jiggling to show much of themselves spilling from the side of the apron, nearing the crest of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A policeman said and looked down. \"Indecent-\" He began, but Crystal already stood back up, peeling up her pants and holding her apron, ready to run.</span></div></div>",

She never even made it to the ground before someone else grabbed her arm from the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" She yelled and struggled, her arms pulled from her front and brought behind her. She was immediately dragged toward the car, but with nothing holding the pants, they slipped down behind her, drooping first down her hips to show more and more of her butt, eventually cresting the curve and moving further down her thighs. Her front was rather covered by the apron, still, but to cuff her they bent her over a car, exposing her bend behind to the semi-circle crowd. The apron hung forward, her breasts hanging free to be seen from both sides, her pink nipples swaying an inch away from the inside of the apron. Her crotch was revealed as they kept her legs slightly apart. They cuffed her and put her in the car with a blanket over her lap, and while it covered her legs, the apron had loosened and although she was in the tinted car, she could do nothing to cover the sides of her chest that, no matter how she arranged herself, kept spilling on one side or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was not in the station long. In fact, that night Aimee had come by with clothes for her to change into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were all over the news later, actually.\" Aimee said when Crystal was let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How? With pictures?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Aimee paused, \"I mean, with a news crew and everything there for the crash. There wasn't much, and it was all blurred, but...\" Her eyes went down a little. \"Either way, we found out about it quickly! Our manager was a little nervous with the talent agent at first, but the agent was super impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal shook her head. \"Impressed? What do you mean? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Streaking? Fighting and yelling at police? Punk Rock has to have a 'bad' label, or something, she said. It can't be mainstream, and it has to be challenging. I guess it did pretty well to assure us it wasn't anything like selling out, like our manager initially wanted. Anyway, the agent paid for your bail and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Wait, what does this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we have a bunch of new shows! And a coastal tour!\" Aimee was beaming. \"I hope I didn't ruin anything for you... And I brought the clothes you asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal smiled. \"No, it's fine. I just... Really? Everything worked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. Except the agent DID say you should focus on trying to keep up the same excitement in performances. I don't know if that means streaking, or, -\" Aimee almost stuttered at that, and seemed to trail off in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal wondered what it meant as well.</span></div></div>",

She felt a pull on the back of her apron, and she twisted her head into it. The pull was hard - harder than she knew she should resist, and she let go of the apron to the policeman's grasp while still running, now only with loose pants, and an arm over the center of her breasts.

She tightened her grip over her breasts, her arm covering both areola and much of her breasts, though some still peaked over and under.

Better yet, it went straight to the hallway with the bathroom, which meant she could minimize the time in the open expanse of the practice area. Unfortunately, it was a hallway often used, but she had to go close to there regardless due to that being where her clothes would be. It made plenty of sense, and she snuck down the sidewalk to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the door open slowly and peeked inside, seeing no one in the small hall. She opened the door and stepped inside, though the door closed fast and hard, trapping the end of her loose pant leg. She half tripped and caught the ground with one hand, spilling her breasts into the open. The other still pulled on the pants, which had lowered down the length of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard voices turning down the hall, and she panicked. She shuffled her feet out of the pants and turned her hips to escape to the bathroom, which was just steps away, but ended up losing her balance and falling on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms went over herself and she saw at the end of the hall, frozen, was her manager and who she presumed was the talent agent, looking down at her. Crystal had her left arm over her chest, which was slightly flattened from being on her back, and her right hand cupping over her crotch. From tripping, her legs were slightly parted, and her knees in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry. I fell.\" She said and scooted herself to sit up and shuffle back to the bathroom. She stood, turned, and realized she had to turn the handle. Without much thinking, she took her hand off her chest to do so, already showing her butt to those behind her. Now, her left breast was free and swaying as she rounded the door into the solace and privacy of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes sat folded on the sink, and she sighed and sat straight on the floor, clad only in rather dirtied socks. Outside, she heard voices, but barely heard what they said. It did not matter. At this point, it hardly mattered if she failed or succeeded - she was safe, and had clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the meeting went rather awkwardly, with the talent agent stealing glances of Crystal's reddened face looking out the frosted window. The agent eventually left, and the manager sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" Jen said loudly. She always had that confidence. \"Bastard was trying to sell us out, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the money.\" Their manager whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it! We can do this all just fine, as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did mention knowing another agent looking for shots, though.\" The manager said, slowly looking to Crystal. \"Photo shoots, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Crystal blinked back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What did you do? Flash him to get some attention for something else when we weren't looking?\" Allison teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" Crystal said, incredibly flustered.</span></div></div>",

She peeked inside and saw nothing but their equipment, and gave a happy sigh. The hallway was just to the corner, and behind that, the bathroom where her clothes would be. She began to make her way inside, when Aimee stepped in from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal froze, her hand holding her pants, and the other over her chest. Aimee froze as well, eyes bulging. Behind Aimee, Crystal heard Jen laugh a ways down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh!\" Crystal said, although did not bring a hand to her mouth for the signal - she had none to spare. Aimee, though, was rather preoccupied looking at the curve of the Crystal's ribs down to her stomach and hips, then back up to her breasts only covered by one skinny arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee looked behind her, seeing Jen was not far from coming. She then looked through one of the frosted windows and saw the talent agent with their manager rounding the corner. With just seconds to go and the hallway and the front door compromised, she pointed to the only thing she saw as an escape - a small open window leading to the back alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal noticed the same predicament, and took Aimee's suggestion. She wanted to be clothed, but any direction she went would end with revealing herself to more people. She moved to the window and stuck her head down to go, with Aimee standing by her side to cover her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal pressed her shoulders and chest through, however the curve of her butt with her hips were just slightly too large. She twisted a bit left and right and they almost seemed to fit, but then they wouldn't. She backed up and put her arms in first to give her more room, leaving her chest completely bare. Her nipples dragged against the edge of the cold window and she hunt across the sill to the other side, dangling. She tried to press her hips through again, and felt herself get further. \"Help!\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee turned around and saw Crystal half through the window. Her butt was pressed against the frame, and with nothing holding the pants, they had fallen to her knees, leaving everything bare. Aimee lifted her hands slowly - timidly, unsure what to do. \"Should I, um, push?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Crsytal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee slowly pressed her hands against Crystal's butt, and gave a small push. As she did, she saw clearly her vagina, even with the closed legs, and began to pant and grow red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal kept trying to wiggle through, pushing herself as much as she could. Her breasts were dangling below her, firm but hanging. She felt her thighs suddenly clear, and she landed head first on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzy, Crystal very slowly came to. She saw above her Aimee looking at her through the window. To her right, she saw the lady who sold flowers looking her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was nude aside from the socks on her feet. After landing, she had spread out on her back, covering nothing, the entirety of her body on display. She sat up quickly and covered herself with her hands, looking back to Aimee for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the other door!\" Aimee said, and made her way to it to direct others away. She was still very red, and as she moved past Jen, she was asked what was going on. Still, though, the coast was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal ran around to the other door, where Aimee let her in and closed both the side door, then the bathroom door behind her. Crystal had made it, and everything was fine. She sighed and put a hand over her heart, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal sat down on the bathroom floor, the clothes Aimee brought for her folded on top of the sink counter. She breathed heavy, feeling everything was finally over. Her hands were locked hard on her chest and vagina, and she heard Aimee move down the hall, away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was in no rush after so much running and falling. She spent a minute just sitting there, until the door opened. Allison looked down at her, seeing Crystal sitting on the ground with her hand on her own breast and vagina, completely naked. Of course - Crystal never locked the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the he-? Are you-?\" Allison started, but then shook her head and shut the door. \"Hurry it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was incredibly red to the face. Allison clearly thought she had been here the whole time, masturbating! She laid back on the cold tile and groaned. Of course it had to get worse once more. She put her foot on the door to keep it closed and felt her head still throb. She wanted it to stop. It had been hurting all morning, and now was only worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she COULD actually feel herself some more before getting dressed. That might distract her from some pain. After all, everyone already thought she was, as this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at first, but very quickly after that, Crystal let herself go, her finger curving to play against her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, at this point, she deserved it.</span></div></div>",

She had somewhere to be, and her two aprons would do her fine for now. With a hand on her chest, in fact, to keep the sides of her chest spilling out, she felt quite alright. At least, she felt better than she did the rest of this last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal made her way down the alley, where at the open end of the mouth she saw there was a gathering around a crash, as well as police slowly setting a perimeter. With all the attention on the two cars, she made her way without being noticed around the side. She wanted to give the crash a wide girth, after all, considering there could be something sharp to hit her feet. As she made her way to the other edge of the crowd, she felt a tug and a paw on the back of her leg. Startled, she jumped a bit to see a small dog jumping up her leg, biting and licking a stain on the apron. She was not sure what the stain was, but the dog kept pulling and growling at its prize. She tried to push it off, then shake it, and soon resorted to a small kick. The dog gave a short yelp, and she heard a woman scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dog! What the hell, you bitch?!\" The woman lifted her dog up by the leash, only making it yelp again, and pushed Crystal on the shoulder. She was not quite ready for it, and fell over on her side. Her arm covered her otherwise exposed chest from the loosened apron, however the apron wrapped around her waist shifted from gravity, as well as the apron she had covering her front. They parted along the slit up her leg, showing all of her right leg and butt cheek. If her right leg was not in front of her left as it was, it would have easily exposed all of her crotch, though she was at least slightly twisted out of the way. She pulled the apron back in front of her and stood up. The woman looked fuming, though a bit confused, and Crystal merely flipped her off before running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal's apron covering her top had come loose in the back, and as she ran she felt it sway and shift around her neck. She kept a hand on her chest to keep it in place, though as her legs kicked forward the apron would lift away from her legs, stomach, and crotch for a split second as she went. The glimpses were a blur of skin, but she was surrounded by so many in the crowd as she ran. The arm on her chest did cover the midsection of her breasts and keep the top of the apron still, but much of her right breast was still exposed about her hand, as the apron had shifted to the side, and now stayed there from being held. Her free hand tried desperately to retie the apron, or even tighten the one covering her butt, but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, now, however, she was close to the garage. There was the front entrance, or the side, but considering the time that passed, she was not sure which would be best. She could try and sneak in the front to see where people were, or cut straight to the bathroom and hope for the best.</span></div></div>",

She had to hurry - anyone could round either side of the hall at any point. She began to move the last few steps to the the bathroom door, so close to her now, but felt herself be tugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thought was somehow again of that dog, but as she twisted around she saw it was the door closed on all the loose strings of her aprons. She ducked her head through the hole and jumped out of the aprons to save time pulling, and hopped, naked, into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door had been mostly closed, but Crystal pushed it open and fell directly into Aimee, who had been folding Crystal's clean laundry on the sink. Crystal rested atop Aimee in a tangle, naked, with Aimee's hand pushed against her naked chest, her other draped on the back of her butt. Crystal pushed herself up, now on all fours atop Aimee's surprised gaze, breasts dangling before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm,\" Aimee stammered, then pushed her way past Crystal and out the door. \"I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal regained herself and closed the door. Her clothes were scattered across the bathroom floor, but everything was there. She breathed easy, and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the bathroom, her band mates were standing at the end of the hall, with Aimee looking away, quite red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so you two WERE in the bathroom together!\" Allison teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doin' in there?\" Jen asked, then looked back to Aimee. \"Crystal looks a bit out of breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out!\" Crystal said sharply. \"We have an important meeting coming up. Let's get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh OH mighty leader!\" Allison said, and the two walked back to the main room to clean up. Aimee continued to look away, and Crystal felt the need to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, um, thanks for bringing my clothes.\" She said softly to Aimee. She noticed Aimee was still quite embarrassed, and tried to make a joke. \"Maybe next time you see me naked, ask me out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee gave a slow nod. \"O-okay. I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"</span></div></div>",

She pressed her back against a corner, and kept her eyes occasionally peeled for when the group would leave. She decided she had a few moments alone, and reset her aprons to their previous cover. She looked again, and noticed they were still standing there, deep in conversation. There was not time to circle the entire block, so she breathed deep and kept waiting for another minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on.\" She muttered. She went back to straightening her apron, as each second went by she was more sure she would have to cut through them. Then, she heard a car door open, and as she watched, she saw they were getting into separate cars, starting to leave. She nodded to herself, waited another thirty seconds, then ran to the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the front door, she was immediately greeted by her manager and who she assumed was the talent agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze at the entrance. Her aprons were tight on her, but still the sides of both her breasts showed just slightly on either side, making it clear how naked she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal!\" Her manager stammered. \"W-what are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal took a moment to compose herself, then began to walk by the two. Feeling rather fed up with the day, she headed straight for the bathroom and said, \"Fuck off! I dress however I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she exited the bathroom with her proper clothes on, the agent was talking about how they needed interviews immediately to capitalize on their punk attitude, and more performances in nearby states. Aimee stopped Crystal at the edge of the hall with a smile. \"We're all so excited with whatever you did! The agent is talking about how you need to do the next performance in as strange and confident an outfit as you came in! What did you come in? You already changed!\"</span></div></div>",

She did, however, know her way around a few fighting scenarios, and was not about to let some barista keep her here. She hit his arm hard and pulled herself free before running down the alley past him. She realized she should have given him a push, or anything to keep him off balance as she went. She then felt a tug around her waist, and then a slide across her hips as her second apron covering her butt was pulled away. She kept running, hearing the man fall back from the freedom of the garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the apron in his hands, and after falling back on his butt, he saw her take off with surprising speed. He stood up slowly, watching her go, knowing that running out of his job's area would come up with a pretty quick termination. Instead, he let her go, tossing the apron back in the dumpster, though keeping an eye on the freed butt. The tiny tassels did nothing to hide her crack, or the jiggle it made as she padded away, weaving through the back roads and alleys to lose his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal made it to the main street, less than ten blocks away from her garage. Being so close, she felt a bit of relief, though now kept a hand behind her, right over her crack as cover. She saw there was a crash at the mouth of the alley, with a semicircle of people gathering, and heard sirens approaching to the scene. She had a little bit of time, but all the searching and tying and dealing with the barista kept her at the edge of the slack she gained.</span></div></div>",

She ran across the crash site, hearing two cat calls and a honk coming her way. One man even moved in front of her in the crowd as she ran with a smirk and compliment, and to she spat in his face to back him off. \"The shit?!\" She said, but she was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer running brushed her breasts against the apron hard, causing her nipples to become erect. Each running stride she made kicked up the end of the apron a little higher in her front, showing more of her legs. Her breasts, even under her hand, noticeably bounced and moved from the side. By the time she made it just a block from the garage, she rested a moment beside a flower shop, and saw both her manager and who she assumed was the talent again walk inside. She was too late! When did she lose so much time? She groaned and dropped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, the lady who sold flowers stepped out and saw Crystal. Crystal's nipples had pushed at the side of the apron enough to expose themselves, and the entirety of the curve of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off to impress someone?\" The lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal snapped her head up and stammered. \"U-um, this isn't, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady handed her a rose. \"Here. This will help. On the house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal took the flower, still breathing a bit hard, and gave a soft thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right, though, she did not have much of a choice. She walked to the garage entrance and went straight inside. Her manager and the talent agent turned around, almost at first with a smile of greeting, but then a stunned silence of watching Crystal walk up, her hips swaying slightly. She handed the rose to the agent with a smile. Her breasts were still firm and pushing at the edges of the apron. As she put her arms to her sides, they pushed up on her chest just slightly, causing her nipples to poke out of both sides of the fabric. She walked to the hallway, moving past Aimee with a soft thank you, and went into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all in her own control. Her manager and the agent both looked stunned and timid, following her every move. Surely even they watched her swaying butt walk away. Again in power of her own situation, Crystal gave a smile into the mirror and stripped. It had been an awful hour, and it ended nothing as what she expected, but still, for some reason, she felt good. The results even turned out well. Perhaps she would try something like that again.</span></div></div>",

She decided to go around the crash to avoid all the crowd, but as she made it back just one block, she saw two more of the cafe workers coming her way. \"Hey, stop!\" One said. She did not. She turned right back around and went into the crash site, hearing them catch up quickly. They had shoes, after all, and were larger than her. She tried to make her way around the crowd, but felt a hand on her shoulder. She yelled as another hand pulled back on one of the strings of her apron. She spun around, the apron pulled off by one cafe worker, the other holding her arm, yelling, \"No! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two workers were tackled right then. They fell to the ground under two policemen who witnessed two men chasing a lady down an alley while stripping her. Crystal took a moment to realize what had happened, covered her chest and crotch with her arms, and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept running, even as others asked if she was okay, or needed help, or simply to stop. She went down the alleys at full speed, caring little for the pain in her feet, or the fact she had nothing on. Her chest bounced up and down against her skinny arm, her other hand cupped a bit loosely over her crotch to let her legs move more easily. Her butt jiggled wildly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath, she did not even think as she stormed through the side door of the garage, and collapsed into the bathroom. There was no one there. She had made it in without her band mates noticing! Having no breath, she panted and laid on the ground, her heart beating and beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard someone on the other side of the door moving. \"Crystal, is that you?\" Allison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal tried to say something, but only came out with a small squeak in her haggard breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. Hurry up! They're already here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal slowly pulled clothes onto her body and stood. In the mirror, she saw her hair was a mess (which was alright for her look), and her body was rather sweaty. Everything was sore, but she ignored it and stepped outside. When she went out to the main room where the others looked to her with the manager and the talent agent, everyone was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Crystal said simply. She realized she was slouching a bit, and still breathing quite hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" Jen said. Aimee was quite red, and everyone kept staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Crystal asked and looked down, realizing she had only managed to put on her black shirt, completely forgetting about the other parts of her below the level of the mirror. She screamed and covered herself with her hands, turning back around to show her bottom as she retreated again to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and Allison laughed. \"Well, that goes to show some need to wake up earlier.\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Crystal did not come out for the rest of the meeting, Aimee told her later it as more or less alright. \"We pretty much turned him around the moment he started spouting about how we would be on every radio station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew.\" Crystal acknowledged. \"No. We're not selling out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just means we need a darker, more edgy feel.\" Aimee shrugged. \"I, well, I mean...\" She was silent a bit, then looked off, a bit red again. \"Jen and Allison suggested maybe wearing that outfit you did to performances. I mean, with slight tweaks. I mean. Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked across the room to the others, who continued to laugh. \"What?\" Allison said. \"It would help!\"</span></div></div>",

She kept her hands from her chest, not wanting to make it worse, but put her hands in the front and back of her loincloth to keep things covered. It meant she would run a little more awkwardly, but she expected she would be running for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore through the street, though still gave the crash a bit of room, afraid that if she moved too close her bare feet and the shrapnel would cut her run very short. This meant she had to clear the entirety around the semicircle of the crowd, though everyone was looking at the crash with the two cars, and she made it half way down the street before anyone even looked her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to notice her was a police car coming from her right with the sirens running, arriving to the scene. Him and his partner slowed down and gazed as Crystal ran by, her chest only barely covered with transparent paper just across her nipples, though practically the entire shape and color on bouncing display. The driver kept staring at the sides of her uncovered butt bounce around her covering hand, and slowly bumped his car into the back of one of the already crashed vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal kept going, moving down the busy street and then through a few more alleys before she had to stop. She breathed hard, her feet sore, and her chest heaving. She knelt down and put her back to the wall as she caught her breath, not thinking much aside from the time she saved, and that she had gotten clear of the situation... Until she tried to stand again and realized she had stuck the leftover scraps of paper attached to herself to the wall behind her! She ripped off the bits that made her loin cloth and some remnants of what attached to the front of her chest. In reaction she grabbed what felt vulnerable and moving - her chest and her crotch, but the contact with her fingers only made things worse as she grasped hard. What was on her chest gooped away to nothing as she brushed, leaving it bare in the alley, and when she pressed against her crotch it drove the rest of what paper was left off her waist. The scraps were as useless as her hand, and would not stay put. She slowly let the bits go, and they fell into the small, hot breeze into the alley. She continued to hold herself, however, feeling how hard her own nipples had become from all the exposure to the air, even slightly hot air, as well as all the friction of the sticky, wet paper. Her own crotch was for a long time untouched, but now her hands pressed firmly against it in defense, but she felt almost a little more in control, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal always wanted to feel in control. That had to be a part of it - she could not shield herself well before from the lack of ability to really touch her own attire, but now since it was destroyed, she felt some solace in holding herself. She held herself tighter, pressing her hand against the round of her breasts until they pooled just slightly around the curve of her arm, and as she rid herself of the last of the paper on her crotch, held her vagina tightly, feeling the slightest bit of pressure where she would feel pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went no further, but gave a small sigh, and thought of her predicament. There was a large box beside her, and she was only maybe four or five blocks away. Time wise, however, she was doing alright in, and she knew by this point Aimee had arrived. She could try and contact her to bring her clothes to this alley within minutes, although that meant Aimee would know what was going on... Still, it would be Crystal's choice, and it would only be Aimee. That was a better situation - a controlled situation.</span></div></div>",

She ducked between two dumpsters and waited, slowly hearing them trod along, each step they slowly took signalling another wasted second on her running clock. They passed by her, still conversing and laughing without a notice of her ducked in the shadows. Crystal breathed deeply, realizing she had not as they passed by. She snuck a glance to see if they had made it far enough, then passed to the street, only for her heart to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last block was uncovered. It was a rather open street leading to the smaller street where her garage was. She could simply run there, but the commercial businesses were all running, including the plant shop directly beside her.

Already she had a fairly bad set of luck, and there was no reason pushing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the bus and felt a hot breeze. The sun was beating down between the clouds, and as she moved across the first few blocks, she was glad there were many trees and tall houses to give her shade, otherwise she would be a sticky mess. Her clothes stayed together rather nicely, and even looked decent up close. Just a white tube top and white shorts. Nothing strange about that unless someone within ten feet tried to identify why something was tucked in the tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst thing was her feet. Between the areas with shade, her feet burned across the ground, and she had to scamper to the next area of shade. She had found reprieve only where people had sprinklers running recently. The water soothed her feet greatly, and as she rushed along, she constantly wished for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw sprinklers running. She looked up and down, and saw no one within half a block. This was clearly a good decision, coming this way! Since she was rushing, even moving out this way meant time-wise she had 40 minutes more to walk, and 40 minutes more till noon. The sprinklers looked like they would sooth her feet so much, moving along the grass. It was hot in general, and though she had a lot of shade, she really had not even had a drink this morning...</span></div></div>",

She could try and do something - fashion something out of what she had just found. So long as she made it to the garage, she could change! (She made note to text Aimee to tell her to leave the clothes in the bathroom, sneak in the side door, change, and then be there. It meant she had to be a couple minutes early, but that was fine.) That was the thing - she had to make it there before 12. Everything depended on her not being stopped or arrested along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in deep. She could figure something out with the sheets of music, the cord, the clips, and the wire, or she could break down and search the compartments above the seats where she almost swore there were things kept. She would have to do it fast, though, because both people could look from the outside, and also she could easily run out of time.</span></div></div>",

They were eleven inches long each, and eight inches wide, which meant she could make an eight inch tube top that was twenty two inches long - plenty long enough to wrap around most of her chest and back. She put it along her chest and tied the wires across her back. It did not even have to be too tight - the wires kept their shape without too much prying, and even as she bounced a little, it was fine. Her chest was still a bit loose, and she heard a small crinkle as they moved, but they were completely hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took the extension cord, plugged it into itself as a circle, and used the paper clips to clip the remaining eight pages like a skirt. The cord was a little large, but since it did not change shape too much, she could bend it to an oval and let it sit on her sharp hips easily. The pages made a skirt that was ten or eleven inches long, and since it started at her hips that meant it only went half way to her knees. It was not the shortest skirt she had ever worn, but before she had tights or underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually quite pleased with the outcome. It looked a little ridiculous, but it was half as ridiculous as other fashion she had seen people sport in the city. Now all she had to do was make it to the garage on time, with which she had fifty minutes. Just enough. Phone cradled in her hand, she looked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two ways she could get to the garage. Walking-wise, it was suggested she cut through a park, which would be fastest and if she rushed, would get her there likely with time to spare. She also knew she could cut around the park in residential areas, which meant less people. Just people walking dogs or standing outside. It also meant that even if she rushed, however, she would be just on time.</span></div></div>",

She had to rush to the garage, and it did not matter how ridiculous she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was hot, but her breezy outfit kept her conscious, but cool. The curve of the sheets about her chest stayed perfectly, and the layering of the sheets on her skirt almost felt like the pleated skirt she would wear to concerts. She almost wished she had the guts to take a picture - maybe she would recreate this later for a photo shoot, of course with underwear and a controlled environment. The tube top she created showed only the very top of her cleavage and two inches above her belly button. The hip skirt moved with her walk, not exactly conforming to her form, but keeping a rough oval. She kept checking her back with her hands to see if any crack was showing, as it did ride low as it moved back and forth. She felt no crack, but it was definitely low enough to show off an area below her back dimples. Up front, it would dip below her hip bone with each step before coming back up, showing one side of the V dip below her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished she had shoes, as the heat was bad on her feet, but she could survive it. When she reached the part she saw she was ahead of schedule by five minutes. 35 minutes left to walk to the garage, and 40 minutes until noon. It pressed her on, until she heard a loud blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped and twisted to look, unsure what the sound was - a firecracker? A gunshot? A popped tire? Even a crash, possibly, but it did not matter. She heard a rip, and that was what resonated for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a slight breeze on her right breast and grasped it. There were people around, but no one really was looking at her what with the sudden sound. She rushed to the bathroom, and saw no one inside. She moved into a stall and looked down at her tube top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tear along one of the holes a wire slipped through. It was right in the center of her breast, and moved down half the paper. From her angle, she could make out the slightest hint of her small pink, and she knew she had to do something, though she really had to rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weighed her options. She could condense the size of her tube top by a fourth, letting the left paper take two thirds of the area, and the remaining good right taking the rest. It would expose all of her back, but it would still work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had eight sheets of paper making up her skirt, and they did overlap some in pleats. She did not want to rid the overlap up front of back, though, and make large slits since she had no underwear, but she could easily remove one, say the one on the right, and there would only be an inch width with still plenty of overlap along her front and back (the more important areas), and she would not have a compromised top at all.</span></div></div>",

It took a little time, but as she checked her phone, she knew if she continued to rush she would still be there at noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the tube top was only wide enough to cover her chest to right underneath her arm pit. As she leaned forward slightly, despite how tight she kept the wires, she could feel the very edges of her breasts press against the sides of the sheet paper. Still, that was barely a half centimeter visible, and more could be visible in a sleeveless shirt even with a bra on. She felt confident, and left the bathroom to continue her way across the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still a hot, though nice day, and many were attending the area. She felt awkward still, despite the ingenuity of her outfit, but even stray winds barely rustled the papers of her pleated skirt. She fast walked her way down the sidewalk until she encountered two young female musicians setting up for a little performance. They had set up in the shade, but looked a little concerned. They had a small crowd sitting and waiting for them to set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musicians had a small amp for their guitar, and wanted to set up in the shade which only would draw further away as it neared noon. The amp, however, did not have a long enough cord to reach the power pole by the sidewalk. It was only short a few feet, but there was no more slack between the cord from the amp to the guitar if it was still to be in the shade. The musicians looked about ready to give up.</span></div></div>",

She was tall and a bit gangly, and everything she wore always ended up a bit short due to this, so she usually stuck with long shirts and shorts. She long had a passion for sport-like things, but Ella showed her differently. Ella knew all sorts of instruments, and introduced Aubrey to the skill of guitar playing and singing after hearing Aubrey sing to herself when she thought she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick friendship - Ella was a friendly, helpful sort of person. She had small glasses she never seemed to look through despite being incredibly near-sighted. She said it was from all of her reading, as she constantly attempted to learn. She kept her brown hair back in a ponytail, and always had some sort of impeccable style with a light shirt that was slightly off her shoulder, a small red hat, and a pair of blue shorts with a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching them was something they did not expect. It was a girl with short blue hair dressed in sheet music. She had a tube top skillfully wrapped around her chest, and a pleated sheet skirt. The whole thing was actually a bit cute, though it was still a bit strange and ill-fitting. Her skirt was a bit low, riding down to her pelvic region on occasion with her skirt dipped from its hard oval shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but can you help me?\" Crystal asked. Ella immediately moved closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" She asked. It was a bit hard to keep focus directly on Crystal's eyes when so much of her was exposed - especially her toned stomach. In fact, many others were watching now, and Crystal really wanted to move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I noticed you needed an extension cord. I was wondering if I could trade for, perhaps, any sort of clothes?\" She asked this a bit more hushed. \"I have somewhere I need to be. Fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla did not draw any more attention, merely nodding and leading Crystal to their box, where inside, there were all sorts of shirts with their band name, \"Optimism Notice\" on it. She pulled out one of the larger sizes and handed it over. \"Take your time!\" She said. \"I would love an extension cord...\" She trailed off then, realizing what Crystal had meant. The skirt with its bright orange rim <i>was</i> an extension cord! Her own face actually grew a bit red when she learned this, and just nodded again. \"Um, there are bathrooms not far off. I wish I could help you more, but we don't really have much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal shook her head with a happy face. \"No! This is perfect, thank you! I'll get you this cord right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can,\" Ella said, \"maybe stick around to see some of our set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame.\" Ella sighed and shrugged.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crystal's new shirt was very large, but she knew the lady had given it to her to cover as much of her as possible. As a t-shirt, the neck hole could almost go slightly off one of her shoulders, and the arm holes were maybe three or four times the width of her arm. She took off her wire and paper tube top, since it looked incredibly strange poking out under the fabric, but had to be careful about how she lifted her own arms considering it would be easy to look in and see she was wearing nothing underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of the shirt only reach three inches below her crotch, but that was just about how her original skirt was. Perhaps a bit shorter, though much more proper. She could easily look like she was wearing small shorts underneath, although she was not even wearing panties. She thought of using the wire possibly as some sort of belt to make the shirt look more proper, as if she meant it to be this frumpy, but knew if she did that it would get shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the sheet music out, not wanting to have to carry it around with no pockets and having to hold her phone, and returned to Ella with the extension cord. Ella happily took it and thanked her profusely, moving to the amp. Crystal moved with her to thank her once more before taking off, wanting to get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ella bent down, Crystal spoke. \"Really, thanks so much. I hope this all goes well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it will.\" Ella said as pleasantly as possible, always glad to help anyone. She plugged the cord on one end of the amp, and then moved the extra few feet it gave to her other extension cord that went to the power pole. \"I hope to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal smiled and began to move away, but then heard a loud spark. There was a flash, and something felt hot against her left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extension cord was beyond old, and did not take a surge at all. It created a shower of sparks that welled into a small fire on Crystal's new shirt, as well as the front of Ella's shirt and the right side of her shorts. Both beat at their clothes with their hands in a panic. Neither was burned, though their hands were a bit tingly, and both their clothes now having holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla's shirt got it the worst, with a burnt hole that grew fast along the light fabric from the bottom hem of her shirt up to the bottom band of her bra. It was strapless and gave small support for her D cups, and the band itself was slightly singed. Her stomach was mostly showing, now, as the bottom half of her shirt was gone in front, though still remained in back. Her shorts had small holes from sparks that showed her thighs underneath, as well as her right pant leg grew incredibly shorter with its singed edge, riding up and destroying the small pockets and her entire thigh, even showing bits of the bottom of her lace panties underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal's holes were smaller, being farther away, but her predicament worse - always worse. There were dots of sparks that landed across the entirety of the left side of the band shirt, showing holes from her thigh, ribs, and even a couple small spots beside her left breast. There was one larger hole from what actually became flame that ran from the top of her hip to her third rib, and stretched around her stomach to show the beginning of her navel. It was still a bit more covered than before, but as she bent slightly to pat herself she saw the hole would lower and shift, showing more and more down further her front than she wanted. She stood back up, straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they recovered, they were both hit with a volley of water. A half gallon jug had been opened up by Aubrey, who rushed over when she saw the fires and spilled it over both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla yelled in surprise, and Crystal jumped backward, though both were thoroughly wet before Aubrey managed to pull the water back. Now, Ella's light shirt was quite see through, showing the shape of her darker bra underneath. Her shorts bunched up a bit just a tiny bit across her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Aubrey gasped, \"I just, you were on FIRE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine...\" Ella said, though her voice wavered. She looked to Crystal. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" Crystal looked down on herself, her clothes ragged and wet, though really still covering her. She was not pleased, though, with the fact that the shirt was a bit cream colored, which did give it a bit of a see-through look, though she was not sure if it was because of the shirts tone or her own skin tone that showed. Her nipples were a bit hard, now, giving a slight poke that she covered up with her arm in a feign of cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry.\" Ella said and slowly stood up, covering her front. \"We need to get you dry. Aubrey, can you pack up? And please be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" Aubrey said, a little hesitant. She felt incredibly in the wrong, however, after dumping the water on them, and stared a bit blankly at Ella's bra, only slightly covered by her arm. Did Ella even know, yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about another shirt? I mean, I am in a bit of a hurry.\" Crystal said, maybe a bit too desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla shook her head with a frown. \"We were actually giving them away when you came. While you were changing, they were all given. I can ask someone to give one back-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Crystal said. This was another band, after all. Band shirts were an important thing to give for the band, and to receive for the fans. \"I really do need to go. I have to get to my own band by noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is it far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By foot, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have a car.\" Ella offered. \"Though you may have to wait until Aubrey at least puts things up. We should at least dry up and, well, figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal considered this. She was running a bit behind now, so a ride would be very good to have, however she was always a bit self-supportive. Ella was incredibly considerate, at least.</span></div></div>",

It revealed just a centimeter worth of a slit, but it did move all the way up her thigh to the ill-fitting, protruding extension cord that rested awkwardly on her hipbone without giving any cover at all. She replaced her tubetop's damaged half, and, satisfied, made her way back outside. She had just enough time that if she rushed and this movement continued, she knew she could make it with five or ten minutes to spare. She just had to keep moving - past the park she would be half-way there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gentle breeze that kept her very conscious of her skirt. That and the constant moving of her legs as she walked made her truly feel each brush of the paper back and forth. There were a number of people in the park, it being quite a nice day, and she felt a few eyes stare as she shuffled by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another sharp breeze that picked up underneath the slit of her skirt, lifting it up from the inside out. The skirt raised its pages in front and in back, and her hands moved to push it down, but not before revealing most the entirety of her right butt cheek to everyone behind her, as well as all of her leg right to the very line of the V leading inward to anyone in front of her. Deeply red in the face, Crystal shuffled to the side, moving out of the line of people in the sidewalk, and was where there were a number of less in a slightly wooded area moving diagonally in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less people directly around her, Crystal felt a bit more inclined to check herself. As she pushed down, she noted the skirt was lower than it was before, dangerously pressed against the top of her mound up front making it clear she was shaved. The pressing in front also meant the stiff cord was lifted in the back side, revealing the very bottom of her butt. She straightened this out, but as her hands left the pages she pressed, she realized she had tore them off the clips with the pressure. She quickly pressed the pages against herself again and twisted the skirt so the remaining five pages were now one in the front, since she had one alone after pulling the sheet on the right and the sheet in the front, and four in the back. She wondered if it would have been better the other way around, but it was a bit late to turn it now. Someone people were bound to be watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the sides of her legs were incredibly visible, from the center of the front of her thighs all the way to the beginning of the muscles of her butt. Her butt was rather safe, considering the overlapping papers curved around her skirts form. Her front, though, was a bit more revealing. The paper covered her, starting just at the top of her mound, to half way across each thigh. It was a short loin cloth, only 11 inches long, and it sat a little low with room to move. Her hip bones were visible completely from the front, with the faintest indentation inward of her V on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had the two pages in her hands, but she heard the first whistle of someone beside her. She did not want to stay put, and moved toward the woods to fix her skirt later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment after Crystal adjusted her skirt, she felt the wind pick up again. Pressing the pages against herself, she moved with wide legs, sort of like a frog, toward the trees where fewer were. She noticed there were some people having a picnic to her right, or simply lazing in the shade, but still, there were many less people here. With a swift decision, she made her way in between a few trees to be alone. It was slightly swampish here, and incredibly prickly under her feet, but she was surrounded by bushes and branches in all directions. She sighed, then looked down to fix herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not in as good a spot as she had hoped. In her haste through the bushes, some branches poked holes along her tube top beside her arm as she pushed, shrinking the size of the tube top from its originally wrapping around half her back to now tattered pieces. The front of her chest was still covered, and the wires were still fine, but aside from a few holey scraps, the sides of her breasts were quite visible. She thought about making a fix for this with the two pages she brought with her, but then noticed her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere between the wind and the branches, she was missing more pages. Her single page in front was fine, though a bit appeared to be missing from a corner, that was hardly an inch lost to the side. The four pages along her butt, however, had become two. A look behind herself through the branches did not even show her where they could have ended up - likely up in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had one page up front in a similar situation as before, and two in the back now showing off the muscles and shape of her butt on both sides. Without the weight of the pleats and the following of the curve of the extension cord, the two pieces of paper now also stuck nearly straight down, making it so anyone on her side at thigh-level could see exactly the soft curve going upward half way up her butt. She had a short repair job, but was unsure what to focus on, as she only had resources to fix one potential disaster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crystal peeked outside the window a moment to see if anyone was coming from either direction. There was an old man with a sweater moving past, but aside from him, no one. She stood on the seat and reached upward, now her chest and flat stomach stretched out in front of the bus window. She moved quickly between the bins, accidentally brushing her nipples against the cold steel. It made her gasp slightly and back up. She wanted to cover them with a hand, if anything, but she needed to open the bins and pull anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her clothes, though she could not understand her drunk self and why they were put up here. It was clear she kept her panties to herself, a light blue set. There were also shorts she kept up here as a spare which were white, as well as a tank top. She also found one of Jen's spare tank tops, and pulled that down. Thankfully, she found her shoes, but noted they were a bit wet. Maybe it rained last night? Or perhaps she made a bigger mess with alcohol (judging a bit by the smell) than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard a voice. Someone talking to someone else outside. She dove down with her findings with a hard plop, the items scattering across the seat. The voice chattered away as it went by without any indication of noticing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal sighed and looked at what she had. She noticed now her items were a little different. The pair of shorts were there from maybe months ago, and appeared to be smaller than she remembered. She placed it against her hips and saw they definitely shrunk - this was a problem a while ago when Jen would take some of the laundry to her place, and why she was not allowed to do this anymore. She tended to ruin clothes. As for the panties, they, too, were smaller, but that was likely due to Crystal shrinking them by getting it wet and not taking care of it. She slipped them on, and they sat low on her thighs. It covered her front just enough, but the waistband hung below her hipbone and the back did not, even with stretching, cover her butt at all, leaving half of the crack hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have to do, unfortunately. The shorts would not even get all the way up her legs. She groaned and put on the shoes, then weighed her shirt options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank top was in alright condition, only slightly smaller than normal, but without anything on her waist, the bottom hem would sit just above her bellybutton, leaving her panties and butt out for show. The other option was Jen's tank top, but she was a larger person in general, and the tank did not adjust. She loosely put it on and noticed it hung low in the front and back, and was a bit wide in the shoulders. The good thing was the larger size did mean it ended an inch or two past her pelvis, meaning it could pass as a rather short sundress.</span></div></div>",

Still, it was better than nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal wore it and realized Jen's chest and shoulders were notably larger than her own. She knew it would be large, but immediately the strap on her right shoulder fell and she had to reset it. The arm holes stretched down low enough to catch half an inch of side boob, and if she did not pull the shirt back, the front would dip down dangerously close to her areola, and all of her cleavage. The bottom hem, at least, was the length of a short dress. Maybe even longer, stretching a couple inches past the back of her butt. She felt the tank top as a little thin, but that would do alright. She just had to make it across town, and it was a sunny sort of day. This could be completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked her time to see she was pushing her luck.

So long as she did not slouch at all, the tank top would stay balanced on her shoulders and not dip too far to either side, or in the front. Her decision would leave her hands swinging at her sides, but she thought that was fine - if something happened, they would not be far, and more than that, nothing really was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal?\" She heard a voice, and stopped. She saw two girls and a guy she recognized, Cora, Piper, and Aiden. Cora was a bit short with thick glasses and medium brown hair. Piper had long red hair with several ribbons and flowers in it. Aiden was almost constantly shirtless, and exuded as much I-don't-care with his messy hair and torn shorts. They were a band, themselves, that typically did little get-togethers in parks. It was all boring acoustic stuff, but Crystal was not one to bash fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, Cora was a fan, she knew. Piper and Aiden always seemed a little stuck-up in rich-white don't-care mentality. They were polite, though, but a bit silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cora.\" Crystal said. She knew Cora was there at the performance last night, though she never got a chance to say hi in all the hype. In fact, in the last few months of building a fan base, she saw Cora less and less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you!\" Cora looked like she was blushing slightly, and gave a small wave from her elbow. \"Um, it was a great concert yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she was short on time, Crystal nodded and stuck her tongue out for some attitude. \"Yeah, well, I need to rush to the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora's eyes opened wide in amazement. \"Garage?\" She said a bit dreamily. \"Where you practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked at what they had with them - at least four or five instruments between drums and guitars... \"Cora, do you have a car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" She said and pointed down the park. \"We're just over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal walked up to Cora and took her hand. \"I really need to get to the garage. Can you take me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden gave a soft groan, but Cora cut him short with a glare. \"Is it far?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten or fifteen minutes to drive. Please? It is an emergency. I have to get there by noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora smiled brightly. \"Of course! But, I was supposed to help out here.\" She turned tentatively to Piper, who just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, girl. But hey, if you're going to the car, we still need to be set up here to play. Bring the drum back before you go. We'll get started without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora nodded. \"If I'm only gone half an hour, it'll be fine.\" She said, mostly to herself. \"So, you'll set up now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden spoke, finally. \"I can get it alone if you want, but you gotta help at least unpack things here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper nodded, and Aiden stretched out and began to unpack their instruments. Cora turned to Crystal. \"Can you help me with the drum? It's a bit large - it's for the circle and can be a bit awkward since I'm, well, tiny.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, she was not there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora's trunk opened upward and there was a large drum stuffed inside the width of the car. Cora pulled at it until the top cleared the door, then looked to Crystal in joy. \"Thank you so much for helping out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. You're the one giving me a ride.\" Crystal said, as if to remind herself this would work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drum itself was not heavy, but it was too awkward for them at their size to move it alone. Cora took a moment to straighten her long floral skirt. She always wore more hippie like clothes, even a most brown tied vest. She wore this even to Crystal's concerts ages ago, which definitely made her stand out in a crowd. It was perhaps the only reason Crystal ever noticed her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal took one side, and Cora the other, and they moved toward the others. The drum was easy enough to grip, and as they moved back across the grass to the sidewalk, Crystal found herself bouncing slightly with each step from the uneven ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was hardly anything. Just some bouncing here or there, but she felt her left tank top strap shifting just slightly further and further across her shoulder. Cora was looking behind her to see where they were going for the most part, but still, Crystal's predicament grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentimeter but centimeter, the strap move further across her shoulder, eventually reaching the round of it and showing all of her collar. Crystal almost said something, but they were more than half way there, and she knew she could not keep the drum up steady with only one hand - it just was not weight distributed right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the strap fell. It went down her shoulder and stopped mid-way down her arm. She looked down for a moment to see why, and noticed the tank top's hem had caught itself at the top of her nipple. Each step bounced her chest again, and she breathed shortly each time wondering if it would go further down. It did move, maybe a millimeter at a time, but still stayed up. Its white color looked almost transparent when the sun hit it well from behind, and the very top of her areola was visible under the folds of the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough no one was looking now, Crystal saw Cora beginning to look back to her, who surely would notice her nearly completely exposed chest. Each step bounded her chest again, and she could swear even her other strap was beginning to move. The top of her chest heaved with her breaths, its firm round jiggling slightly as her areola exposed further with the downward pull of the strap, bit by bit...</span></div></div>",

The drum fell, and the handles Cora was holding pressed against the copious fabric of her long skirt. As Cora lost grip of the drum and it fell with a loud thump, she also fell sideways, her knees slightly bend with the pull of the weight. Her skirt was fairly elastic, and pulled easily down her hips. Her thighs were not as thin as Crystal's, despite being a smaller person, and her butt was also quite large. It was normally hidden under all the skirt, but easily showed now in her striped underwear, round and jutting out with her skirt half way to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal knelt down quickly by Cora to apologize, \"I'm so sorry, my hands just slipped.\" She lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora looked up to Crystal, pulling her skirt up to the top of her underwear. With Crystal kneeling down like this, the sun caught her from behind. The low loop of the neckline of the tank top drooped to the point where it showed the entirety of her dangling breasts, aside from where the hem slowly came together in the curve, catching her areola to be shielded by the white thin fabric. Cora could see straight down the middle of Crystal's cleavage, and saw the top of her toned stomach. Crystal's breasts, not quite filling out the tank top, moved just slightly left and right when she talked, each swing slowly bringing the nipples closer and closer to the right or left, they only being shielded from Cora's vision by the slightest perspective from the widening fabric beneath the straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light changed a bit as the sun cleared a cloud, and Cora saw the outline, even the faintest hint of transparency from the fabric, of Crystal's nipple of her right breast. It made her breath in from beauty, seeing Crystal's chest hanging before her, and she forgot to keep hold of her skirt any longer.</span></div></div>",

At first, Cora noticed nothing, but a slight expanse of skin drew her eye. She followed the curve of Crystal's neckline, then down to her collarbones, to the side of her angular shoulder, then down again to her armpit, then the slight bounce and bounce of each step of her breasts.  Her eyes dared down even further without helping it, and she saw the slipped strap, and the low neckline dangerously rubbing against the very top of the point of Crystal's breast. It was not entirely clear where exactly the nipple began, but Cora could see almost the entirely of the breast's firm perky shape that moved forward to where there definitely was something. As she made a slight turn, the light changed, and she could see the outline of somethin-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal's other strap fell, then, and Cora's eyes snapped to the other side. It was higher than the other breast, but now the entirety of Crystal's collar and both her shoulders were bare. Cora stammered, \"I, uh,\" but lost concentration on what she was doing, and tripped backward in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drum fell, rolling to her left with a loud thum that drew a number of eyes. Crystal immediately dropped the drum, herself to straighten her straps, but the handle she held on caught the bottom hem of her tank top and pulled her as it rolled. The tank top lifted up half a foot as Crystal moved with the falling drum, her hands on her straps. Revealed to a half dozen eyes was not the front of her small light blue panties, which did cover everything necessary, but was less than a standard bikini by far. Crystal tried to pull the dress down, but it had no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora on the other side staggered to her feet and tripped over the side of the drum to try and see if Crystal was alright. As she fumbled, the tie of the front of her vest as well as the light colored shirt underneath caught the second handle on the drum Crystal had used. She tried to back some, but the vest became untied up front, and the old shirt ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a cup breasts for being a smaller person, Cora never really bothered with bras. Piper did not either, but that was for her own freedom sorts of reasons. Her vest loose, and her shirt ripped half way down the front, she had to keep it held closed or else her small perky buds would be easily seen. Holding her shirt, she did not hold herself up too well, and she fell over at Crystal's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal smoothed some of her shirt down her crotch for modesty, barely covering the area between her thighs, as the end of the tank top was still attached to the handle. She snapped a red faced glare at everyone around her, who moved on as if they saw nothing. \"Cora, you alright?\" She asked, putting on hand on her cleavage, the other over her crotch to keep the loose fabric still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora felt clumsy, and it only was worse as she tried to make amend of the situation with attitude by sharply pushing the drum away from them. One of the strings to her vest was still attached, and it pulled the side of the vest along with that, sharply extended her left arm with the drum. It was the same arm gripping her shirt together, and as it snapped outward with the vest, she managed to rip her own shirt in half. Now, the center of her flatter chest, down to her stomach where the shirt softly folded back with the tear was visible to Crystal. Cora was not sporting a toned stomach, but she was still slim. The right side of her left breast was now visible, the small curve outward disappearing behind the ripped shirt. Crystal's shirt was pulled up slightly, though her hand kept it down. Cora turned quickly to cover herself again, while Aiden now approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so long?\" He asked with a soft laugh at the look of them tripping just moving a drum. From his side, he could not see they were attached to it.</span></div></div>",

She heard things, which only made the pain worse, and then she felt something cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit pleasant at first, considering the heat and her running, but she quickly realized there was a <i>lot</i> of cold. She opened her eyes and saw she was running in between three sets of sprinklers, zig-zagging water back and forth. She was being hit from front and behind, and while her arm was above her chest, the water drenched her blue hair and it dripped down between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out of the sprinklers and kept moving down the street. She slowed only a moment to give a brief glance at the state she was in. Under her arm, the tank top was wet, and all the white areas were now translucent. The shirt's thin fabric stuck to her skin from top to bottom, clearly showing the outline of her light blue underwear, and in back she was sure the blurry look of half of her butt crack. The fabric clung so well it contorted to each curve of her hips and thighs, her toned stomach up to her chest where it only wrinkled slightly under her arm. She saw clearly the outline of her left nipple pressing, as well as its pink showing through. Her right nipple, however, at least had one of the darker areas of the logo. Its shape was still present, pushing hard from the sudden cold, but there was no color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that, the extra weight pushed down on the tank top, making it sit harder against the back of her neck. Now, as she let her chest go, she saw the loop of the neck hole reached down without any pressure to showcase the entirety of the space in between her breasts, as well as much of her side boob in between. The loop did catch her areola, but the transparency did not help with that. The loop also was low on the sides of the tank top, revealing the entirety of the sides of both breasts any time her arms were not down. As she walked forward, she noted at least the wet fabric clung to her skin, which meant as her nipples bounced and the areas between her breasts heaved with breaths and steps, the fabric stayed where it was, right at the line of her areola. As she watched this, her hand still above her chest, she walked into a young teenager, who stepped back with a short, \"woah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to him in fear, then took off past him. Her chest had been covered, yes, but her stomach and her underwear and her legs were completely easy to see. If he was looking at her now from behind, he would see her wiggling butt that her underwear only half covered.</span></div></div>",

She had left sidewalks for a moment thinking she was cutting through a public grass area, but it turned out to be a fence-less yard. There was a loud bark, and she looked to her right to see a black dog. The dog was not friendly to intruders, and while it was chained to a tree, Crystal did not really notice at first. Immediately, she began to run past the yard in fear, the dog giving chase. Much faster than she was, she heard a snap, then a rip, then a yelp as the chain grew taut. Crystal continued to run, her heart beating for another two blocks, before she finally calmed enough to look back. The dog was practically out of sight now, circling back to the tree. Crystal, however, felt more airy than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the tank top, she saw the dog had grabbed her with its teeth by a seam, and it split up from the bottom hem all the way to the seam of the arm hole. That seam was rather hardy, but now there was a split in her sort-of dress from the right side of her leg all the way to the bottom curve of her breast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried at first to hold it together, or even tie the bottom for some sort of keep-together, but the tank top was not long enough, and would constantly ride up the bottom hem to her light blue panties, which were a bit low on her already. Each time she tried, she revealed a bit of the top right side of her right butt cheek, and that was when she realized she was panicking with this in the middle of a sidewalk. She looked around, only seeing one man watering his car, though looking at her butt the entire time in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew red, and shuffled down the road. She had made up those few minutes, but she was still in line to be exactly on time at twelve, and now had a huge split in her short dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tie the straps around her chest, shielding her breasts well as well as lengthening the whole dress, making it so she could then tie the bottom hem. There would still be a hole on her right side, but it would not have much of a chance to flare up as much, though holes do open as people bend, but it would show her stomach more, and not her under or side boob at least. The top would stay on only by a tie and not straps.</span></div></div>",

It rested its bottom hem an inch above her navel, and followed the contour of her chest to a fine degree, even pushing at the buds of her nipples. It was not cold, luckily, and was not too incredibly noticeable, though still there. Since her panties were in a bad state, she decided to use Jen's tank top straps to tie the large thing like a skirt just below her belly button.

The tie was not obvious, but it was white with an old band logo printed on it, which was not really common for skirts. She knew it would have to do, and from a distance, it would look just fine. No one would really bug her about this outfit, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind her, she noted she had lost a few minutes, and would have to rush to make them up to reach the garage by noon. Dressed fairly normally, she decided to cut through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot day, but there were gathering clouds above. Things smelled humid, and Crystal wondered if there would be a hot rain.</span></div></div>",

Crystal's tight tank top became wet with a gross feeling humid hot rain, and she felt her skirt clinging to her thighs. She made it to a small overhand by a restroom and looked down. There were not many walking by now, but she immediately was self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white tank top was rather transparent, showing off the color of her thighs all the way up to the hinting of light blue where her small panties were. Feeling behind her, she knew that while her butt crack was covered, there would be the blurry semblance of her butt before her underwear finally took over half way down. As for her top, it was already thin, though a deep brown. The fabric became a second skin, though, and conformed directly with her. In the cover, despite the hot rain, a small breeze caused her nipples to grow hard, pressing them against the fabric obviously. The firm round of her chest was already perfectly formed, and now this made nothing aside left to imagination.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wearing completely drenched thin clothes was as good as being naked. She knew she did not have much time, but she went into the bathroom, locked the door, and removed her top. She wrung out the top and hit the air dry machine, shaking it over and over to try and get it dry. It was a little wrinkled even as she shook, and she draped it over the drier and took off her tank top skirt. She did the same with it and felt her panties, seeing they had also gotten rather wet. Her shoes were a bit wet, but she knew there was little that could help them at this point, and simply left them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied after a bit more than five minutes of air drying, she first tried to slip on her panties, and realized something was wrong. Her feet barely fit in both holes. She thought first it might have been that there were shoes in the way, but when she held them up to see closer, she saw they had shrunk. In a quick panic, she looked to both of the other tank tops and saw they had gotten yet smaller as well, while still a little damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and tried to force the panties on. She pulled hard against her thighs, but it never cleared even the bottom cusp of her butt, without the sound of a rip, and she tore them off and threw them in the garbage. She tied the tank on her waist again, but now the straps were only long enough to do a single knot instead of a double, and the skirt itself rested an inch above her knees. It was much more dry, and so it did not show off her skin tone, but was still wet enough to give the silhouette of her legs when light shined through. She tried her top which had already shrunk, but now it was smaller, the straps barely fitting over her shoulders, and the bottom hem resting just an inch below the curve of her breast. She struggled to get her shoulders through the straps comfortably to wear, but they simply were in too small of an area. Eventually, she just pulled down and flexed her back, and she heard a rip and pop. To make room for her chest, the front of the tank top ripped in the center. The taut fabric that already pulled hard against the shape of her chest now had a small tear at her cleavage, and as tight as things were, it only threatened to get worse. More than that, both straps snapped from the back, creating two small tears along the back of the tank top, as well as two dangling strings. Thinking fast, she tied the two straps behind her neck without much issue, and it did also keep the front of the tank top up, though the three tears were a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew now that it was tight enough to not need that much maintenance to at least stay <i>up</i>, which was a good thing. It gave her the idea that should could, perhaps, switch spots. The tank top would be a mini skirt at best, and would have to sit a little high at the small flat of her stomach, but if it wrapped around her chest, it would sit on the top of her hips without issue, and then she could worry less about the three tears. She tried to measure how long it would be, and deduced she would have to be <i>very</i> careful, especially without panties. Then, she could wear the now-shrunk and able to fit normal tank top of Jen's like a normal tank top, though it would no longer be long enough to cover her like a dress, and instead would probably go down the normal length of a tank top. She was a little worried about it being transparent, but it was not that bad on her legs, and her small tank top now already pressed exactly to the form of her chest now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early into the celebration, well before the alcohol claimed Total Breakdown's speech and motor skills, the normally sober band felt the consequences of their inexperience burning in their cheeks. It was that state of inebriation where drunks think they have good ideas, even a sober audience of strangers thinks they thought it through, and they usually get approval to set it in motion, but the reality is that it's a terrible idea they would never so much as concoct sober and their friends would have to be stupid or drunk to go along with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!\" Crystal called, bringing everyone to attention. \"The hell kinda celebration is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good one!\" Jen called grinning and preparing another toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Aimee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name one thing wrong with it?\" Allison continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about no friends congratulating us with honest opinions and preparing to say good-bye as the scouts convince the labels to make us stars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls arched their eyebrows in silent agreement. For a party, this was rather tame. They could have fun by themselves, but as the saying goes, \"the more the merrier.\" Besides, four people could hardly comment absolutely on the entire audience's reactions. Even if the songs were perfectly performed, the on-stage presence is just as important for concerts, and the audience response is critical. And it wasn't like this was the first spontaneous invites the band's ever sent to their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all know the play!\" Allison declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl quickly whipped out her cell phone and sent a mass message. After the third or fourth party they fell into suddenly and the overlap of their contacts became apparent, Crystal proposed they work out a system for invites. Now their mutual friends were divided between them, ensuring no one got multiple messages and they didn't waste some of their minutes. They'd even worked out the message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty at Aimee's! Admission fee is two bottles of booze or a bag of food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of this system, they neglected to add a detail about this being only close friends and those who attended the concert, or that they shouldn't spread the message. They probably would have thought about it before they pressed send, or maybe just after and be forced to send an edit, but the alcohol took that notion off the table. Instead, the word flooded the whole town at break-neck speeds, and liquor stores found their registers filling quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the overflow was initially daunting, Total Breakdown, now in full stagger, decided to roll with it. It wasn't their first wild party, though certainly the first they've hosted. How much different could it be as hostesses? Plus, if the night was merciful, they could give an encore and relive the magical concert. The more the merrier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the noise consideration had escaped them, and some guests were unquestionably not old enough to drink legally. The two details together made for an easy arrest, and possible lawsuits. But that was for later, after the date rolled over and the neighbors' patience wore out. For now, the girls found themselves about to compound their problems.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to nerves and a sense of responsibility, Total Breakdown subconsciously started nursing the alcohol and wanting less in general. Their buzzes began to ease, and their vision started clearing in more ways than one. Their focus had been shifted to monitoring the party, not enjoying it. That had to change, but first each girl had to notice this problem. And first on that list was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat call snapped the redhead out of her daze, and made her realize she spent the past 15 minutes mumbling along with the songs from the speakers while walking around one room. She hadn't been dancing - unless head nods count - and only paused to take a sip of whatever she had on hand. She'd barely noticed any of the people around her despite the vast amounts of eye candy, the few she had were given an automated brush off. It was wrong. Timid as she was, having a good time was not a foreign concept. Her eyes were opened, and now it was time to fix the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee followed the voice to its origin, which just happened to be her fellow guitarist. Along with Crystal was a bottle blonde with a full figure and the outfit to flaunt it. Gathered behind them was a group, though its exact size was impossible to determine in the party's chaos. The only thing she knew for sure was none of the potential members looked familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're lookin for a spare room,\" Crystal said. \"What'll work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you hotboxing?\" she asked the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shook her head. \"Game time. We need a door and open space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The guest room might do. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group followed the two guitarists across the floor, conversing as they went. The redhead never bothered to turn and address the group or ensure they didn't get swept away by the rest of the party, leaving her oblivious to anything about them that wasn't sound. She heard one deep bass conversing with the blonde leader about materials, and there was definitely a tenor boasting about the game hoping to drum up more players, but anything else was indistinguishable from ordinary chatter. So far, all she knew was two boys and two girls, not counting herself and Crystal, had just followed her to the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bed takes up too much space,\" the blonde said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pullout sofa,\" Aimee explained. \"You'll have more room once I fold it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal said, \"I'll give you a hand. Terry, how about you set up around the bed for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do. You in too, Aimee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll start with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry reached into her purse and presented the redhead with a white tablet printed to read \"SNK.\" The act was repeated until the entire group was holding the small gift from their leader. Aimee and Crystal could only eye their own with an arched eyebrow, oblivious to their surroundings. All they cared about was finding out what Terry was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Crystal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to keep the game going,\" Terry answered. \"Just in case someone wimps out. But don't worry. No money's involved. Just possible embarrassment. Fuel up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry gave no oral answer. Instead, all she did was cross her arms in front of her chest. Ecstasy, the rockers concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo exchanged looks, and shrugged their shoulders. This wasn't completely unfamiliar territory. Besides Allison's love of the sauce, Total Breakdown had blazed a few times in their van, and Jen claimed to have written one of their more popular songs while on an acid trip. Ecstasy may have been different, but what could the harm be? Depending on the part of the world, it still ruled parties. Without a word, the guitarists swallowed their aids before returning to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that out of the way,\" Terry said, \"let's move on to the game. Tonight we'll be playing...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the party gathered some momentum and the faces melted together under the dance music, Allison's gaze cycled between her phone and the party. She made sure to invite the friends she gets drunk with, and they've never been ones to pass up a party, but they're also not the types to knowingly exclude a friend. The last contact they had was Allison asking if they made it, and she'd yet to get a text ba-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" she mumbled to her vibrating phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you? You even here yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison rolled her eyes. This crowd was already wearing on her nerves. It's a shame too, there was so much potential. The partiers brought along cards, dice, loads of whiskey and brandy, some cheap wine, huge kegs, and...kegs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison didn't even need to text back. There was a better way to get everyone's attention. She'd already begun berating herself for not realizing this sooner. Although, she was still a little hazy from the drinks before the party. Thankfully, she still had enough of her wits to know drinking protocols - if someone brought kegs, there had to be at least one hose attachment for the nozzles. Which there was, if only due to the presence of another friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluffy mochaccino crown atop pale flesh marked the group's youngest member, Phil. He was built like a greyhound, and probably weighed about as much, too. In spite of that, he could drink a sumo wrestler under the table, though not without repercussions. For all his ability, the stormy haze in his eyes still shot out bolts of youthfulness and inexperience. In particular, he may as well write \"VIRGIN\" on his forehead. His eyes were always roaming, and as a result he frequently found himself winking at his chin. Teasing him at a party into stuttering and sweating was Allison's favorite game. Plus, with all the enhanced chests in the world, it was nice to have someone appreciate her natural girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally!\" Phil said. \"That you textin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Some of the others are here, too. Mind helpin me call em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil grinned as she pointed to the keg. \"That tattoo was a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged the keg across the floor until Allison had enough room behind it while Phil stood to the side. With a quick nod from the beanstalk, Allison was able to nimbly flip herself onto the keg. Just as swiftly, Phil slipped the hose into her mouth and cranked the nozzle before steadying one of her outstretched legs. As if their coordination was nothing, their ability to keg stand by themselves proved experience. Of course, Phil's frame helped. He was the only person capable of reaching all the way to a leggy woman's ankles during a keg stand while still working the nozzle. The drawback to his size was only for a woman in a skirt; the long arms meant he could stand tall enough to gawk at her panties. Even now, Allison could feel his electric eyes bolting along every inch of the lace. She was thankful it wasn't a thong, that would be too much skin, but even these bikini cuts could frame her sex, though the black material would ensure it was only an outline even as she soaked them. No matter. Each chug of the beer helped ease that concern. Plus, his eyes would shift once her shirt inched down enough to flash the matching bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Allison's calves were looming over the room, the message was out for everyone. Most of those close by just some chick trying to be one of the boys and cheered her on, though not without the occasional wolf whistle. On the other hand, her friends would see Allison and her ink. Since they never arrived together (unless they were coming from another party) and occasionally didn't divulge whether or not they made it, the gang frequently had trouble finding each other in crowded locations. Each had come up with their own solution, but Allison's was working the best. Originally she thought her own legs were distinct enough, but only Phil concurred. As such, she made them more distinct by getting two scorpions posed like yin and yang on the back of her left leg - so chosen because a <i>taijitu</i> looked upright no matter which way she was turned. Now she just had to endure long enough to gather them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO AL-<i>LY</i>!\" she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tenor arrived none too soon. Allison's arms trembled beneath her, balancing without Phil became a challenge, and she was dying to cover her bra. She curled her legs and flipped towards her admiring fans with a whoop and double arm pump, each one with a newfound respect for lady drinkers and a gazed locked on the flesh between plunging bra cups. All but one of course, as she made her way to that one, the sepia colored man who had been the only text response of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was the whole reason Allison first approached this group, The strapping man was usually head and shoulders above the crowd, but once he found a song he liked a few inches came off to show the world what rhythm really meant. Every flex of his muscles during those dances provided more than enough eye candy for anyone considering dark meat. Stripping him to his birthday suit became one of Allison's pet projects, especially after she found out strip games and pranks were the only way she'd see the brawny man nude. That is, unless he became single again. And was suddenly attracted to women. Either way, they were on the \"Kiss Hello with Hugging\" phase, so Allison was happy. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, GEOR-<i>GEY</i>!\" Allison called as she fell into a warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally found ya!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we just need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA firm smack against her behind erected Allison's spine. She turned to her pervert fists clenched, and relaxed as soon as she saw the earthy eyes of Isaac. Still a pervert, no question about that - and by extension did no favors to <i>that</i> stereotype of Asian men - but he was one of the more harmless types; though, that may only be due to Allison's ability to kick his ass. In addition, he was also a serious prankster, marking the only reason Allison didn't question why three men were employing the Naked Lap rule before she joined and contributed a woman. Add to it, he could match her punk band for punk band. Totally. Her. Type. That gave him the distinction of being the only member Allison saw during the day as she explored a possible bedmate, even though it hadn't gone that far. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison grimaced as she gave his ribs a lovetap. As much as she liked it when his hands roamed, she still had boundaries to defend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gang's all here,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone,\" George said. \"Emily made it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison lightly groaned and rolled her eyes. It was an unnecessary camouflage, though. The whole group knew she and the new girl felt some sense of competition over status in the group. It was the most pointless squabble ever, but they weren't about to object. It never escalated to violence, and usually served as an excuse for all of them to get tanked and have a good time in the process. As long as they didn't get horny drunk, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone seen her?\" Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison grinned. \"Found her. In the pack dancing. I'll get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge rolled his eyes while Isaac and Phil locked their gazes on Allison's swaying hips as she drew them to the action. Due to all the laughter and teasing during the previous party, Allison was sure her mishap following a Naked Lap was Emily's doing. And in the event Emily wasn't the one who stole her clothes, well...she reveled in Allison's misfortune far too much! Either way, it was time to even the score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison slid through the throng of dancers like a shark in the sea, her eyes never leaving her prey. Even with business at hand, she still licked her lips appreciatively at the show. It was the sort of dancing that attracted the worst type of guys, but it was still tantalizing to the senses. This was especially true for Emily, since these moves demonstrated she was not wearing a bra. Allison confirmed that when saw only toned flesh between the two ties of her halter top. Although, she reasoned, with how big Emily is, she could still be wearing one. Let's be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one swift tug and a sudden gasp, Emily's top slid off her chest and eradicated all contrivances. Cocoa caps graced the dance floor. Though Emily's hands quickly cupped them, it brought out the vulgarity lurking here. Wolf whistles drowned out the speakers. The few sentences formed weren't much better, commenting on the absence of any tan lines along the globes of olive skin. The sudden fervor of the crowd and the overpowering smell of alcohol convinced Allison that the skirt should stay on, even if Emily was wearing panties. Besides, she thought, the night is young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gang's lookin for ya,\" Allison said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair crossed back to the keg, Emily's top now retied, and her eyes now shooting daggers at the beaming Allison. This definitely wasn't over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you've all had your fun,\" George said, \"how about we get a game goin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as...?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shrugged. \"I'm always itchin for Beer Pong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save us the beer and just take your clothes off,\" George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! I can score!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now you get stripped by Death Rings,\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Death Cups,\" Emily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna streak, go ahead,\" Isaac concluded. \"But that's not a penalty for you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir words flushed Allison deeper and deeper until even her neck was crimson. Once the blood flow cleared out her common sense, she spoke up. \"If that's how you feel, then let's raise the penalty for a shutout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only replies were Emily's grin and Phil's tightening pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Isaac said, \"Or, we can have Death Rings with cards, instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a wild idea,\" George said. \"Never Have I Ever. Let's talk for a change, get to know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group put it to a vote, and decided on...</span></div></div>",

Even before the vote was suggested, the trio already knew the game was to be decided by the man panting at the thought of a naked woman, and the woman eager for revenge against the person who untied her top in a crowded room. While Death Ring could help each one's goal, they knew the whole group had high endurance. Between that and Allison's lack of skill at beer pong, the choice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group made their way to the backyard, where Allison had already set up a pong table before guests arrived. Amazingly, it wasn't in use right now, and apparently it hadn't seen any use tonight. Not only were very few people hanging around it, no one brought out a keg or cups to use it. George, wanting no part of the ensuing discussion, went back inside to rectify the latter point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take first game since it was my idea,\" Allison said. \"So what's my punishment if I get shut out? Naked keg stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Isaac said. \"The whole problem is nudity doesn't punish you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be fun to watch,\" Emily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the other half of it. There has to be an entertainment value for the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil cracked out softly, \"Reverse naked keg stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse naked keg stand,\" he repeats louder, his face flushing. \"Ally does the keg stand naked, but instead of her mouth, the nozzle's inserted in her...\" Phil could only bring himself to point to his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK NO!\" Emily yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only have the one hose,\" Allison reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac adds, \"Even if we had more, we all intend to get drunk. How would we remember which hose is which later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Emily said, a grin plastered across her face, \"I don't think anyone would object to muffin flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the suggestion earned some arched eyebrows from Isaac, Allison grimaced and shook het head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No good,\" she said. \"You ever try puttin alcohol up your cooch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High school. We heard the myth of soakin our tampons in vodka and never double checked before tryin or figurin out why it didn't work. I'll get a little more buzzed, but most of it just sloshes around inside. Waste of good beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of backing down, Emily only smiled wider. \"Not necessarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, it finally occurred to the trio what she meant. Phil's face grew several shades darker and his pants were now noticeably tenting. Even Isaac could barely restrain his laughter at the thought. And Allison blushed as deeply as Phil while her hands instinctively covered her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" she said. \"You guys are not drinkin beer from my pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits all the criteria,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac added. \"And the fact that you're so embarrassed by it proves it's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proves what's a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last George returned, a beer keg thrown over his right shoulder and a bag of plastic cups in his left hand. Setting up the table gave Isaac the opportunity to summarize their decision, as well as confirm that George would be part of the punishment. This allowed the big man to point out the very obvious flaw none of them had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge asked, \"And Emily's cool with doin this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, nearly spinning her head completely around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't expect Ally to do this alone, did ya? Her opponent's gotta offer the same punishment. And your the only other girl we got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this idea,\" Allison said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was pretty bad at beer pong herself. If Allison could get an early lead. a shutout was all but guaranteed. And the forfeit would give her the opportunity to see how much Emily liked having her clothes stolen. The thought alone nearly had the drummer licking her lips. Of course, the opposite was also true; an early lead from Emily left Allison naked. And Allison knew that a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not happenin,\" Emily said. \"Find something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Isaac asked. \"We'll just do like a body shot if one of us loses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Phil would enjoy that more than me,\" Allison said. \"I'm not kissin your dicks if ya lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's eyes lit up. Her face twitched as her lips crooked once more. \"Does that mean you would if they win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Ally,\" Isaac said. \"We'd eat you out if you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd still enjoy that too much,\" she countered. \"It's supposed to be punishment. And fun for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we do it naked. Loser strips down and frenches the winner's groin. And for good measure, we streak afterwards. Just to make sure everyone got a good look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Phil cracked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge shook his head. \"I'm still sitting out. But we have our wagers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison mumbled, \"I hate all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she'd never admit it, these forfeits were more than agreeable for the drummer. Besides the chance at revenge if she plays Emily, oral with Isaac or Phil had benefits no matter who she faced. If Phil's virgin dick lasted more than a minute with Allison's experienced tongue, she'd eat her panties. Sucking him off meant a shorter punishment. And that says nothing about the faces he's going to make and the means she has to make him blush. As for Isaac, they were nearing this point in their relationship anyway. She'd already let him reach second. and this was by far the slowest she's ever gone in a relationship. What does this bet really do? Bring her back to speed. Besides, he piled on. If he had a problem with either forfeit, he would have said something, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison didn't bother contemplating a shut out against Phil and Isaac. They were more experienced players, and held their liquor better than she did. The only chance she had of stripping them was if they threw the game. Winning itself was already a challenge. Really, her main focus was to just score against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the terms set, the rest of her friends established her involuntary opponent in a fair manner. It's not the Phil and Isaac didn't want their blowjobs, they just prefered the idea of Emily naked as they held her legs. And the result was...</span></div></div>",

Just a few Roll Backs, and the game was decided. And the redemption was over after two more air balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Emily called. \"Take it off, Ally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Em!\" she hissed as she pulled her shirt over her head. \"I didn't yell 'boobies' when I untied ya, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less complainin, more strippin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" George added. \"The sooner yer paid up, the sooner we move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff, Allison unclasped her bra and tossed it behind the bush with her shirt. While it wasn't exactly safe, the only other hiding spot in Aimee's yard was the branch of her neighbor's tree, which was too high for her to reach, and she could barely climb a tree sober and clothed. She was half hoping they would snag a branch as a cheap means of security, but even just out of sight and in a small area against the fence was plenty. Plus, she'd know where they were once she got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison chose to tear the bandage and yanked down her bottoms as one. Her kick sent her skirt behind the bush, but her panties hooked a branch and remained on top. With the backyard illuminated, the black material stuck out among the green foliage. However, she wasn't going to sweat it. Once she took off running, everyone's attention would be in front of the house, not behind it, she reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing only in a pair of high heels and a blush during a party was easy for Allison these days. Unwelcome, embarrassing, and chilly, but easy. Now came the hard part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep breath, she told herself. This isn't your first blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, quick steps brought her to the side of the house. Thankfully, her friends agreed to spare her from being a spectacle at the patio. Aimee's air conditioner should even hide her from sight. Until she was done, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrave face. Make him happy, and he'll finish faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Allison dropped onto her knees before her opponent. As her hands reached for his fly, she shot a smile up to...</span></div></div>",

Gazing upwards revealed that same wry smile she's seen before. That blend of eager anticipation and nervousness emerging from the hue of an overripe tomato. It was the signature look of a person just before their first sexual encounter. The very look that spawned the virgin fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretched fingers methodically undid Phil's belt and pants. As expected, the freedom let a purple stalk push down the waistband of his boxers. Allison's grin faded at the sight of the swollen, throbbing head inches in front of her. Not for its impressive size. Not for her loyalty to Ike. But for the iron look to the rod. For the intense rhythm of the pulses down the length. And for the huffing and puffing above her. They were the familiar precursor to an event that, on this occasion, was incredibly unwelcome. More so since Allison realized it too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick rope of jizz launched from Phil's dick. It hit Allison right between the eyes. She recoiled. Her hands shot up. But she couldn't see. The second shot passed through her fingers. It splattered across her forehead. Her bangs became tinted white. The weaker spurts coated her thighs. Finally, Phil went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily said, \"Virgin. For. Life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor bastard,\" George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly sums up luck for the both of ya,\" said Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil blushed progressively deeper with each comment. Instinctively shielding his dick only brought more laughter from his friends. Each taunt and chuckle was breathing life back into his loins. By the time Allison had wiped her face and started wiping her hands on her thighs, little Phil was halfway to an encore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That counts, right?\" the drummer asked. \"He came, so it's over, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head. \"Not a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The deal was a blowjob,\" Isaac said. \"Ya never even touched him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he's hard again, she thought as she yanked his boxers down around his ankles. \"Phil, be a gentleman next time and warn a lady before you finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smiled up at him and licked her lips. Both hands reached out to milk the last of Phil's spunk onto the ground between her knees. Anything to keep it away from the rest of her hair. The first time someone gunked up her hair, it took her days to brush out. The misery of that incident made her swear no man would ever cream her precious hair again, and she'd been successful up until Phil's premature surprise tonight. He should count his lucky stars she still likes him enough not to chomp down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil gasped and winced as he rubbed his knees together. The contrast of the cool fingers gently lifting beneath his head and the warm velvet at his base made him jump. Relaxation instantly washed over him as Allison's tongue slid along the underside of his dick. And tension instantly returned as his friends hooted and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" Isaac called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now yer gettin it, big guy!\" George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let Ally do what she loves!\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil wanted so much to enjoy Allison's lips sliding across his prick. Instead, he only felt his face flushing further. It didn't help that Emily's comment ground the pink-haired girl to a halt. The cold air seemed down right frigid to his soaked penis without Allison's mouth. Had they stopped heckling him, the icy breeze would have shriveled him down to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison, meanwhile, was ready to murder that bottle blonde. All the attention previously on Phil was immediately directed between her legs. Right to her swollen lips and erect clit. Her love of having a dick in her mouth was supposed to be a secret! Empty jeering or a deliberate shot, Emily just let the secret out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock over, Allison flipped the bird to Emily and went back to business. Her tongue snaked around Phil's head and pulled him into her eager mouth. The brunet hunched over with a moan as a hum from the musician's throat resonated through his dick. The jerk brought his gaze to his waist. The rhythmic movement of pink hair was mesmerizing. The warm confines of Allison's mouth and throat chased away any nip of the wind, even once he was exposed again. It even helped drown out the comments from his friends. The quick draw from Phil earlier left Allison not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Ally!\" Emily continued. \"Just look at ya! Bare-ass naked, on yer knees, dick in yer mouth, and cum on yer face! Ya wouldn't be here if ya didn't think it suits ya perfectly! In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's hand shot up again. This time, they pulled Phil closer as she tried to bury her face in his crotch. The protesting squeals actually worked. Phil brought his hands to the pink mane as he thrust his hips forward. While she'd prefer not to have a cock in her mouth right now, the combined effects were surely shielding her from Emily's phone! Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Isaac said as he took the phone. \"That's the line, Em! Don't even <i>try</i> crossin again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison sighed into Phil's dick. I owe Ike big later, she thinks. She chuckled. She was pretty sure she knew what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing her muscles, Allison's head slid down until only Phil's bell-end was still in her mouth. Seizing the moment, she reached forward and wrapped her hand around the shaft and began to pump. The left one, meanwhile, cradled his sack and began to trace circles. All while her tongue caressed and rolled around his engorged head. It was too much for Phil to choke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" he moaned as he tapped her head. \"A-Ally! I'm g-gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison postured up with an audible pop. Phil's hands slid down to around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison grinned as her eyes met his. \"Just let it go, Minute Man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil groaned at the nickname, due in no small part to it pushing him to his second climax of the night. His hands clutched Allison like a vise. The entire payload splattered across her chest, painting the light tan a solid white that hid both pink nubs. The musician's grin only grew as her clit swelled. She didn't stop stroking until her admirer was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison rose back to her feet, the forfeit <i>definitely</i> paid this time. The first view of her coated chest was already making Phil's loins stir again. Deciding to spare himself more comments than he already earned, the brunet quickly reached for his pants and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya did it!\" George said with a pat on the back. \"And with a helluva load, no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look at that!\" Isaac said. \"Screw pearl necklace! Them itty bitty titties, that's a pearl <i>bra</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grinned. \"And like a cumslut, she rubs it in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloored again, Allison took a moment to collect her thoughts. As she continued cleaning up, she fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, Emily, ya only got away with this shit when my mouth was <i>very</i> full. Now that it's empty, I'd like ta remind ya that girls whose idea of dancin is ta make their boobs flop around and skirts flip up aren't in a position ta call others 'sluts.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Well...' what? Not so witty without somethin up yer cooch? Or are yer fingers glistenin for a different reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face flushed. Be it in anger or embarrassment was hard to tell, even for her. Either way, he fists curled into balls with each sputter and stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge jumped between them. \"Hate to break up this lovefest, but Ally still owes us somethin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Allison said, clamping her hands over her nude form. \"I'm goin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Allison's heels clicked on the sidewalk, Isaac started the chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NA-KED LAP! NA-KED LAP! NA-KED LAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for people to poke their heads out and join in. The bare musician held her arms tighter as she started her run bathed in cheers and catcalls. As soon as she was two houses down, however, the only sound was her footsteps and panting. Allison still dared not move her arms or slow her pace. The commotion could have easily attracted more people around the block. Or someone could be coming home late. It usually didn't happen, but better safe than sorry. Especially since Aimee's neighborhood didn't have any broken streetlights. Allison was already a fully visible and tantalizing spectacle without showing off her best bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky at last, Allison thought as Aimee's house reappeared. I'm back, and without a single extra pervert eyeballin me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed through her clapping friends, arms still secure. It was the straight shot, after all, even though it did mean letting Emily and Isaac smack her butt. Practically diving behind the bush, Allison quickly reached for...leaves and dirt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot again, she thought as she pressed herself against the bush. Carefully raising her head above the shrub, Allison grumbled, \"Where! Are! My <i>clothes</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from her chuckling beau and cackling rival, Allison pleaded with George and Phil. The former seemed frustrated, as he did last time. But good old Phil, blushing profusely, still managed to be helpful. Though he could only stammer, he was able to...</span></div></div>",

She of all people knew the extent of the fallout. The laughter was wholly unnecessary, too. For all of these complaints, though, Allison was overjoyed to see her clothes safe. A grin almost spread across her face as her busty friend came running over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to see you sweat,\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison snatched back her clothes. \"Not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison remained behind the bush as she redressed. No doubt there was someone besides her friends looking to get another eyeful. From her position, she could overhear Jen and her drinking buddies exchanging pleasantries. It was also clear she had met Isaac and Phil already; no doubt the former goaded her into that little prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, we're all friends now,\" Allison said as she emerged fully clothed. \"So what brings ya back here, Jen? Joinin me to help get the boys naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jen gave the three men the elevator eyes. Allison couldn't help but smirk as the bassist's eyes lingered at each of their crotches. The trio in question didn't shy away from the intention either. Most satisfying to Allison, however, was the Emily's face instantly turning into a scowl at the sight of new competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jen said. \"I hear you can't get them to drop their drawers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grinned. \"Well ya shoulda-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason you should help!\" Allison called. \"C'mon! One game of Beer Pong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" Isaac said. \"If she's gonna 'help,' it sounds like you want a game of doubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's eyes lit up. \"Chance of two bare asses? Hell yeah! Our <i>classic</i> doubles set-up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge said, \"Think Ally's on to somethin, Phil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group smiled as Phil's face flushed. Despite the longstanding crushes on his drinking friends, he still ate up the sight of Jen's behind. Sure, her breasts were, by far, the superior asset, but neither Allison nor Emily would ever intentionally flaunt their panties or butts. Even peeping up their skirts was a Herculean task. Yet here was a girl whose ass was hanging out of her lowriders. How could anyone expect him to turn away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Phil 'll be heartbroken if I don't join now,\" Jen said. \"I can go for one game of doubles and see where it takes us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac said, \"All right! Just one catch: since yer the new girl, ya take a handicap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take Phil. You take Lady Godiva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if Ally and I shoot first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four players began resetting 20 cups of beer in the classic fashion. Allison, still riding the high of no more crotch-kissing penalties, was even humming one of the band's songs. Isaac and Jen reviewed the game, ensuring the latter knew the basics. The pair even had the good fortune of skipping the debate of fingering or blowing. As for Phil, he was just trying to do anything that would keep his eyes on Jen's backside before the table would tear him away. All seemed to be going well, until they each took their positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Allison yelled. \"Why the hell am <i>I</i> a handicap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen said, \"Cause ya keep doin laps in yer birthday suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the few time ya don't, ya wind up makin only one or two cups,\" Isaac added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge concluded, \"Seein if Jen can carry ya's a good way to see if she can carry herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shot twin salutes and stink eyes across the backyard. \"Well then, oh grand savior of mine, <i>please</i> carry me! Set the pace for this <i>friendly</i> game and blaze our trail to victory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen shook her head and shrugged. This is gonna be fun, she thought.

Dancing eyes betrayed the placid facade, and the corners of his mouth were twirled upwards into a barely discernible smirk. From the neck down, however, he remained steadfast and serious even as his pants and boxers were yanked down to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" she says, \"if ya keep up this apathetic bull shit, we're gonna be here all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's the problem with that?\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison raised one finger towards Emily. Her gaze, however, remained entwined with Isaac's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya wanna enjoy it,\" she continued, \"ya gotta feel <i>every last touch</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Allison slowly and carefully ran the back of her fingers against the limp stalk before her. The small strokes did little to shatter Isaac's resolve or prop up his member, evoking only labored breaths from the prankster. It took the addition of a left hand on his thigh to make him jump, and a few small circles from its thumb to make him sigh. As one, his shoulders and knees slumped down, and the flesh against Allison's digits grew taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attaboy,\" Allison said as she stiffened her fingers. \"Now, to make it last, just trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking her gaze at last, Allison turned her attention to the pecker resting on her hand. A small peck brought the head to life, even before her tongue lapped at its underside. Tracing a trail of similar salutes down Isaac's length brought his member to attention. The occasional graze of her nails against his balls and thighs kept him at half-mast as Allison smooched her way to the base of Isaac's saturated prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than fill her mouth with the salty sweet treat, Allison descended further and continued to smack her lips against Isaac's sack. His swelling rod fell off her fingers and into her waiting palm. Pumping her hand drew a light moan from her partner. He audibly gasped when the darting tongue wrapped around his balls. Effortlessly, Isaac's entire scrotum entered the warm confines of Allison's humming mouth. Still that tongue continued to trace infinity around his gonads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac silently thanked Allison for that hand on his thigh. As much as he appreciated the attention to his groin, those nails on his thigh were killing his high enough to prolong the head. It certainly helped that the palm and fingers were still rubbing him through it all. Definitely the best blowjob ever, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Isaac's hands were propped against Allison's head. She opened wide with a grin. The message was clear: he was about to reach his limit. Allison slid both of her hands across his thighs and circled to his tight ass as she straightened her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Smiely?\" she asked grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac could only nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison opened wide, and welcomed her boyfriend's pulsing prick into her mouth with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, yeah!\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison had to chuckle. She had intended to do most of the work herself. However, she instead found herself holding in place as Isaac thrust his hips. That said, objecting was the last thing on her mind. The drummer was quite content to let him do the work while she groped his butt. Was quite content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few taps of her throat later, Allison felt a charge flowing through her. It appeared to start all over. Her lips, hands, and throat all appeared to twitch simultaneously. The surge raced down her spine, stiffening her legs. Her nipples and clit had gone fully erect during a blowjob before, but this feeling resting there was different. Before she even knew it, her hands were sliding down and off of Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-ly shit!\" George called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily added, \"What a <i>slut</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac and Phil felt their jaws slacken at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison blushed and moaned. The reactions did not stop her. She needed it this time.Two fingers slid into her dripping snatch. Meanwhile, her left hand tugged at her teat while cupping the small orb. Even her hips began to buck against her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Allison or Isaac were trying to hold out at that point. The pair groaned and emptied their loads together. Isaac's wilting shaft retreated from the warmth, but Allison jerked forward to catch it. Despite her mouth being full, she managed to stick her tongue out and lick up more of the salty treat from the emptied stalk. Having licked it clean, Allison then wiped her face, pushing the few stray droplets back into her grinning mouth. Then she gulped it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison wiped her hands on her butt as she rose. Two dry hands clutched Isaac's shirt as she looked him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya <i>ever</i> want me to do that again,\" she said, \"ya better kiss me <i>right now</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac happily met his girl halfway and locked lips. The taste of his own splooge did little to make him want to stop. All he thought to do was raise his hands and...embrace her? It struck him as soon as he did it. He raised his hands, not to grope her bare boobs, not to knead her exposed ass, and not to rub her displayed pussy, but to caress her back and sides. Yet this still made his loins twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison too noticed how unusual her actions appeared. She never swallowed, never kissed immediately afterwards, and her hands never strayed from his rear. Now, however, even as Isaac's dick was coming back to life, all she wanted was a kiss, and the gentle movements of his hands were sending electricity through to her muff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair broke off at least, gasping for air. Locking eyes allowed each to show the other a glint. Allison's blush returned. It appeared appropriate, given that she could find no doubt within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cumslut!\" Emily called. \"You still owe us somethin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison pulled herself from Isaac's warm embrace and reentered the chilly night. It took her three steps to realize that she should cover her nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NA-KED LAP! NA-KED LAP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Emily who had started the chant. Not Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison mumbled, \"What is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder, and noticed that George was talking to Isaac. Based on the gesticulating, he was probably asking Isaac to put his pants on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did feel it, she thought. Is this what waitin makes it feel like? Now to get through this fuckin lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be nothing else. That electricity had to be their bodies telling them the truth. Tonight was their night. Their night to share their love. With words, and with bare skin.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the party grew larger, Total Breakdown split up to cover as much of the party as they could. Jen was floating around near the front door, hoping to greet the new comers and ensure the paid the entry fee. It sounded restrictive when Crystal first said it, but was remedied as being the center of the action. Sure, the drinking games were near the backdoor and in the basement, areas with more space for play, but Jen was left in control of the socials and the music. All she had to worry about was finding that perfect balance between party goer and party hostess. Besides, one text message and she could swap with someone. So what if the system wasn't completely foolproof?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the job got more complicated when she laid eyes on that distinctive red and blue Mohawk atop a Sex Pistols T-shirt, freezing Jen in place with her mouth agape. It seemed unfathomable, but Luke, the bassist for Aborted Crisis, had crashed the party. By itself, this was no big deal. While boisterous and nasty on stage, in real life Luke was very withdrawn and polite. The hairstyle was his bandmate's decision, and he actually went out of his way to ensure there were no hard feelings between him and Jen, even treating her to a quick - and silent - lunch, before she joined Total Breakdown. This was the last place Jen ever expected to see him, and that was the big problem. The logic was simple: If Luke was at a party and wasn't the musical performance, then he was dragged here by his bandmates. The rest of the band was here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen almost threw in with Aborted Crisis before Luke joined. She was invited by Josh, the drummer of the band and, at the time, her boyfriend, and she jumped at the chance. The practice sessions kept cutting in on their time together, and Jen was usually helping Josh alone anyway. Jen had always wanted to join a serious band, and they'd proven in the past that they could work together without serious conflicts ruining things. Plus, they knew each others' bedheads flawlessly, so pre-concert styling would be easy. Even now, calling him an ex was too hard, and the two could still talk like they were a couple, once they overcame the initial awkwardness. But Aborted Crisis proved to be the iceberg that tore them apart, and subsequently turned Total Breakdown into its rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all because of the guitarist. Rhythm was covered by Toby, and Jen loathed talking to him. He wasn't very good, nor was he well informed on music. He pretty much just played whatever he was told in hopes it would bring him fame, money, and women. The last one he wanted desperately. In spite of being the oldest member of the band, he acted like his balls had just fallen and he was hopped up on meth. All he wanted were the groupies and the right to sign a girl's tits. Five minutes of conversation with him, and Jen was ready to puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Toby was tolerable. He was a pig, no question, but Jen had learned to deal with guys like that years ago. The big problem was Zack, lead guitarist and lead vocalist of Aborted Crisis. Listening to him sing and strum a guitar made everyone weak kneed, and the two pink fins in his hair only drove the girls wild. For all her hated of him, even Jen had to admit she had a <i><b>strictly</b></i> physical attraction to him even now. The problems started when he began to peel back his layers and show the world his true self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at Jen's tryout, the first thing he said was, \"'Nother groupie here for a party?\" And to punctuate this statement, he helped himself to a grab of Jen's boobs. Normally, Jen would have smacked him through the ceiling, but this time was different. Then, making things worse, Josh stepped up, not to protest the groping, but to identify her as an auditioning bassist. Zack's exact words: \"This slut can play?\" Jen stormed off outraged, and it was a later conversation with Josh that led to their break up. The worst of it, however, was a secret she swore to take to the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason she didn't put Zack in his place during any of this was her own embarrassment. Zack's hands were magic! It took every ounce of willpower, and probably a little of the disgust, to hide the fact that him fondling her breasts made her orgasm. She was thankful it was light, but her own disgust at enjoying it made her hate the misogynist and herself even more. In spite of this, it only fueled Jen's attraction. It was a twisted feeling, but Jen couldn't deny that she wanted to feel more, and it would be fine as long as she could place some duct tape over his mouth. And it's not like Jen had ever done more than fantasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was personal. Outwardly, Jen was the most vocal hater of Aborted Crisis. There were times she convinced Crystal to take time away from the concert to highlight Zack's treatment of women and encourage fans to boycott his performances. He didn't take it lying down, though, and neither did the rest of the band. It seemed juvenile, but the two bands were determined to crush each other until either Total Breakdown shut up, or Aborted Crisis gave Zack the boot. But that would be decided another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Jen had to make a choice. With their history, it didn't seem likely the two bands could be under one roof, and the roof did belong to Aimee. Josh and Luke could be little problem if Jen asked nicely, but only if they were here alone. Instead, they're here with Zack; she couldn't prove it, but she knew it was the only way Luke would join the party. Jen would have to convince Zack to leave. Only then would the rest of Aborted Crisis leave as well. But was there a method to get that bastard out without ruining the party? And what if he started getting handsy again? Between the alcohol and some arousal, Jen might not be able to get rid of him. And in the corset and tight jeans all but guaranteed Zack would try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there was Josh. He may have turned a blind eye in the past, but maybe he had more of a backbone now. Maybe he could convince Zack to hit another party, or even call it a night. It was a gamble, but he was the only member of Aborted Crisis likely to openly admit Zack was scum. And is it really any worse than betting that she can keep her own sick fantasies in check?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, maybe confrontation was the wrong approach. Do any of them even know that Total Breakdown is hosting this party? If Jen takes any approach and fails, that might be the <i>trigger</i> to the problems instead of the solution. Maybe they could handle this civilly if neither side made contact and denied being aware of each others' presence.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the idea of confronting each member of Aborted Crisis entered her head, she thought better of it. Best case, the efforts will result in a shouting match that kills the party. Worst case, she's strung from the ceiling naked for everyone's viewing pleasure. The two bands were both having fun so far, even if the night was young. Why rock the boat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Jen was no fool. If she and her bandmates gave him the chance, Zack wouldn't hesitate to humiliate them, especially at their own party. Her guard was up, for now at least, but her friends were completely defenseless. There was a voice nagging her to warn them, stressing sooner was better. Yet the familiar bubbling in her heart was telling her to banish the fear and just enjoy the party. The old war waged again, and history showed that her passion usually won this war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack's an ass,\" she mumbled, trying not to let the story repeat. \"Zack's an ass. Zack's an ass. Zack's an ass. Zack's an a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar snapped the raven-haired musician from her chanting.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even Jen had to smile, albeit wryly, at the sight out the window. There was a part of her that accepted it was just a massive unlucky streak, but there had to be more to it. There had to be another reason Allison kept finding herself here. Regardless, the conundrum could wait. It was party time. Jen stuck her head out and joined the chants:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NA-KED LAP! NA-KED LAP! NA-KED LAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Allison's heart-shaped behind was out of sight, reason returned to Jen. Her bandmate was dressed in only a pair of heels and a hair tie. Last time this happened, the rest of the drummer's clothes wandered off. And this time, a different pink-haired bastard was hanging around somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly's priority one, Jen thought. First, I gotta find her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into Allison's head was easy for Jen. A spot between the party and the lap's route would be too risky, they'd be hidden from casual glances, and close to a landmark. Without hesitating Jen crossed the crowded party house and entered the backyard. Kegs, Pong table, four weirdos she recognized from Allison's social media presence, and several bushes in a row. The bassist nearly doubled over as she scanned the row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wonders why her clothes vanished, Jen mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights had been turned on to let Allison and company see what they were doing. A consequence of that was it made it effortless to see one bush decorated with black lace. Jen walked over to that particular bush and, sure enough, found the rest of the pink-haired girl's clothes. Already seeing how this could go wrong, Jen began to gather her friend's gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" a voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen turned around and craned her head up to meet a pair of blue eyes. The scorn in them only aided the intimidation of his body language. Only under that gaze did it occur to her how this would look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Phil,\" a shorter Asian boy said. \"That's Jen. She and Ally play together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry. I don't really listen to Punk. That's more Ike's thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen shrugged. \"To each their own. And at least I'm not the only one who wants her clothes safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Isaac said. \"You are <i>definitely</i> alone there. Phil just wants a reward for guardin them more. But do me a favor: hide over by the patio door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen chuckled as she followed Isaac's instructions. It was clear now why Allison liked this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the distinctive clicking of high heels on pavement grew louder. It was soon replaced by the rustling grass and a blur of pink and bronze bolting behind the shrubs. Seconds later, the dyed mane emerged over the foliage, everything below Allison's neck still hidden away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where! Are! My clothes!\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoining Isaac in chuckling was a big-breasted blonde. A muscular guy with dark skin seemed to be lamenting the turn of events. Yet Phil, like a boyscout, pointed over to Jen. The bassists restrained giggles turned into a full-blown laugh attack. At least Allison's face softened upon seeing her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to see you sweat!\" Jen called as she ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison snatched her clothes back. \"Not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison redressed, Jen exchanged pleasantries with her bandmate's friends, including George and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, we're all friends now,\" Allison said as she emerged fully clothed. \"So what brings ya back here, Jen? Joinin me to help get the boys naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a different time, under different circumstances, Jen would have eagerly agreed. All three of Allison's male companions were total eye candy to the raven-haired beauty. And it would have been child's play working with Phil. Despite the impressive rack poorly contained by Emily's halter top, his eyes were bulging out at the bulges in Jen's corset. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a good idea,\" she said. \"Not if we gotta shed our clothes, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only 'gotta' if we lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better we not gamble. Zack's lurking around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck invited that asshole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck invited half of these people? The point is he's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Allison turned to her drinking buddies. \"Sorry guys. Beer Pong's out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance!\" George said. \"But now what do we do? Only Ally got a buzz goin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still play a game. It's just gotta be somethin that lets us girls keep our clothes on,\" Jen said. \"Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge shrugged. \"I don't think it'll matter if Phil ain't ever gonna look you in the eye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Case and point. So-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we need a game of dirty Straight Face,\" Emily said. \"That'll get him lookin elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how strictly dressed we talkin?\" Isaac chimes in. \"You only said clothes on, not on <i>properly</i>. If we can scrounge up a tablecloth, how about Smile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, back to my original suggestion, we mingle over a game of Century Club. Not a lot of focus needed there and we all get shit-faced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vote Jen decides,\" Allison says. \"What do you feel like?\"</span></div></div>",
