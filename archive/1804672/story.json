Eliza sat down as she gleefully rubbed her fat filled belly in satisfaction. Eliza loved eating, she didn't care in the slightest about being fat, which showed on her body. Eliza was once a thin and trim beauty but having a job and kids produced layers of fat on her.  At first the sight of her trim body becoming smothered in fat was upsetting but the very notion of depriving herself of delicious food was painfully unappealing, so accepting reality, Eliza came to embrace her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp mmm what a lovely breakfast though a little small, I'll have to have a little snack. Oops but first I'll have to do the dishes.\" Eliza said.

The shirt was a little tight from her six month pregnant looking big pot belly, but everything else was fine. She put on some sunglasses to try to hide her face from any of her friends that may be at the mall.

Like the rest of his family though, he is obese, much bigger than any average kids in his school grade, and he\u2019s very proud of it as a result.  He had the look of a pear-shaped body, which meant his butt and thighs are much bigger than the rest of his body, though his belly is noticeably and hanged over his sweatpants he would normally wear, along with his t-shirt which both are much tight because of his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s a very fun loving boy as far as his lifestyle is concerned.  He would normally play video games, sitting there do nothing, and also he would occasionally go into the family-sized pool, just for the sake of it.  He loves his family as much as they love him too, and they all have the same goals which they could try and get as much bigger and fatter as they can, even Richard can already imagine of himself on what he\u2019ll look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he would eat as many foods as he can non-stop, and this was his aim to make it possible.  He\u2019s already obese and certainly wants to be not only the biggest kid in the family, but the entire school too!  He may be obsessed with it, but as long as he loves being big, he would enjoy his lifestyle as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was having a usual day when we can see him...</span></div></div>",
