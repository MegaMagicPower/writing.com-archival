Strange that as there seems no place for the water to have come from. You stoop down to look at it closer and notice it's surface is not clear but instead a murky brown colour...congealed blood, perhaps days or maybe even hours old? You dotn want to find either what caused this wound or who survived it, assuming they did of course. As you continue quickly along the path you hear a stream burbling in the distance and walk towards it. The air is deadly calm here and your fur prickles up from the aura of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn the corner you see a small maiden sitting by the stream, slowly brushing her hair as her skin sparkles ever so brightly in the moonlight. Her pointed ears and the bow nearby tell you she is an elf or, at any rate, a halfling and most definately not a person to try and take on in a fight unless you are either foolhardy, lucky or have a deathwish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you that bow would be a very useful acquisition in this forest if anything your inmates said about this place can be trusted.

Do you even have a brain inside there or is it just a hollow space? Shall we find out?\" She says before raising her fist. You see it rush towards you and ,faster than you can block, she ends up smacking you around the head with the hilt of the dagger, knocking you out before she steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake many hours later judging by the lighter sky to find yourself upside down, feet tied above you as you sway from side to side in the gently chill breeze of the early morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the thief awakes does he?\" Comes a much gentler voice than from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does indeed.

Check the ground beneath you. Here let me help actually\" She says with a grin as she pushes you with her bow. As you swing you can see a small pit below you containing what looks like a pixie, except she seems to be eying you up with a bit more curiosity than you'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my friend Anabelle. Anabelle likes to eat things. Luckily I've a pact with her clan that anyone I say is safe is not to be eaten by her.

I'm right here and you are trying to escape right before me. Sheesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh shut up already!\" You snap at her as you fail to untie yourself. The craftsmanship behind the knots far to strong for you to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a mouth on the boy. Shame Anabelle has a much bigger one. I feel like I'm doing the world a favour by removing your genes from the pool. Enjoy your trip through Anabelle dear, I know she will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cackle from the Elf she pulls out her bow, quivers an arrow and shoots through the rope holding you. The rope untwines, each strand spiraling around each other until you see it break. You look downwards to see the open maw of Anabelle beneath you. The last view your eyes will see before you plummet right into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later you wake up though, you sort of wish you hadn't. Your body is surounded by the digestive enzymes of the Pixie which start to slowly eat away at your flesh. All you can do now is wriggle about in her tummy in hopes of finding a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately though, it seems that Anabelle has had a healthy diet and undigested matter was to be found. It wouldn't be long before the acids eat completely through your skin, the best you can do is simply try and keep your head above the acidic pool. Though as you soon find out, you can't do this when the level of liquid inside rises around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakened and defeated, you lay as a mere shell of the once proud fur you were; the enzymes having reduced you to a nicely nutritionaly balanced soup. Skunk's have such a flavour to them afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there is a shift in the liquid, a downward pull that sucks your remains under. If there was a chance of getting out, it was gone now. Once more Lady Luck smiles at you and gives you a firm kick between the legs since now, you're on your way through the small intestines, the enzymes there finishing the job from the stomach as you float along the twisting and winding path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont spend long in there though as after an hour or so you pass out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip through her intestines does your figure much help. You are now much slimmer than before though of course you wouldn't know that being as you are now a steaming lump of fecal matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

Her body, though thin, is curvacious at the hips, and feminine enough to avoid a mix-up of gender. Her tail is her dominant feature. Roughly the same length as her you can see it could cause some serious damage if needs be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Though she lacks the endowments of a normal mammal, mainly that of breasts you can quite clearly see that nature gave her something else instead. Her arms. There are six of them at present, when she first entered you could swear she only had the normal two.<br>\r\n         Though there are six of them, you assume that they can be morphed back into her body, as most proberly her legs. Thinking about this you realise this would allow her to assume the form of a feral Rattlesnake, a nearly nearly 15 feet long one at that.<br>\r\n         Her atire is rather odd. Odd given the given surroundings but not elsewhere. She was dressed in a pair of Black Leather pants, a tight midriff-baring halter-top of the same material, and a pair of kinky and sexy four-inch heels. Who's to say she couldn't be fashion conscious out here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         You notice her stop. Her tongue flicks out in the air as she tastes it, her head looking around before fixing on the tree ahead of her. The tree you were currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I smell something big.\" She says, savouring the taste as she eyes the trunk where you had climbed up moments before.<br>\r\n         \"Never smelt it before around here. I wonder what it is. Maybe a meal or a companion...or maybe both?\" She giggles to herself as she steps slowly towards the tree you are in.</span></div></div>",

Her lips find yours as you roll her over onto her back, her magic having taken full effect on you now as your hips seem to meld with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blissful embrace,<br>\r\nthe love making passionate.<br>\r\nYou don't pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you cuddle after that little foray into sin, falling asleep in each others embrace. Come morning you find her combing her hair. You get up and walk on over to her and give her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles, slightly taken aback by the affection from the skunk and turns around to give you a quick belly scritch. You promptly show her the trinket you found and she claps with glee before taking it from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I free to go then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You clkeared your throat as you stood your ground for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whistle back in the darkness. Silence. You whistle again and hear footsteps coming towards you. You step back to the middle of the road as their pace quickens and just as you are about to turn and run you see a duo of prison guards. The take one look at you and train their weapons on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww fuck!\" You say as you see them. Cursing your luck as you lift your hands. A pointed gun is a nice incentive to stop you from running afterall. They're gentle with you as they put the handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations buddy. This is the furthest anyone's got. Unlucky though. At least you got to enjoy freedom for a bit....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Razor wire fences, watch towers and high stone walls were your constant companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just escaped from the prison you made a mad dash to the forest before the guards could reach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that\" One of the guards chasing you says as he sees you disapear into the undergrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you man. I dont want to die either. Good luck in there. He's going to need it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laugh on as they turn around. You watch them walk of and the spotlights search back along the forests edge. You can't go back, only forward... into the Forest of Deceit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPremise is simple. Try and make it through the forest. How you do this is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry and keep it akin to how the story is and please at least try and write so people can read it. Feel free to add a gay or a herm angle if you want, I don't mind. No fur bashing please.
