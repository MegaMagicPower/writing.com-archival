At night, he became a vengeful warrior, known to the public as a vigilante - Batman.<br>\r\nYet even with all that venom in him, part of him found a simultaneous satisfaction. It felt...almost like a job well done. But Bruce was very good at convincing himself otherwise.<br>\r\nFor most people, a successful evening would consist of completing their responsibilities, a fine meal, and maybe a few extra hours to kick back and crack open that new novel. Bruce - or rather, Batman - found his form of content from his nearly nightly excursions. On this particular evening, he had already incapacitated two drug dealers, prevented the raping of a seventeen-year-old girl, and stumbled upon another strange object from an emerging crime scene, in what had been a long string of puzzling evidence.<br>\r\nStill, there were nights when he could accomplish nothing more as his alternate persona - though Bruce was having trouble imagining it at the moment. On such occasions, he emerged as \"The Billionaire Without A Cause\", traveling around Gotham's most luxurious hot-spots. <br>\r\nAnd then there were nights like tonight, when nothing seemed to go even remotely right. And to his dismay, <br>\r\nthe night had only just begun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't quite place his finger on that feeling and decided it was nothing. When he arrived at the Bat Cave, Bruce changed into a business suit, complete with shoes and socks and was checking the meteorite sample, when it started to glow. As batman approached it, he realised he was shrinking! In his years as batman, Bruce Wayne had been shrunk numerous times; by his fellow JLU-er , The Atom, by supervillians and once, by a prototype shrinking machine he had constructed. But this felt different. For one thing, he wasn't shrinking rapidly, as with other times he had shrunk; No, he was shrinking down at a rather slow rate. Sitting himself down in a chair that was still normal sized for him, Bruce continued to check the results of the meteorite sample. However, half an hour later, Bruce realised that his feet were dangling off the edge of his chair and that he was barely 4 and a half feet tall (as his computer had helpfully provided him)! In a space of 1/2 an hour, Bruce Wayne had shrunk from 6' to 4'6\". Getting off his chair, Bruce decided that....</span></div></div>",

He leapt to his feet; the leather chair he had\u00a0previously\u00a0been sitting in \u00a0flew back a few feet. Bruce held up his hands, inspecting his arms and hands as if an explanation was tattooed to his skin.<br>\r\n       In all his years of traveling the world... In all his training with the league of shadows... Never had he encountered such a rapid disintegration of height.\u00a0Bruce's brow furrowed so deeply it was painful. His eyes darted about as his mind whirred at a thousand miles an hour.\u00a0His gaze rested a moment upon the exit, then proceeded to speed-walk towards it with a purposeful stride. Judging by the way his clothes were bunching up at the joints and hanging off him, he wouldn't have much longer before he'd be unable to drive home. *<b>No one</b>* could see him like this.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u2022--\u2022----\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 39th floor penthouse at Gotham Towers had never been a \"home\" to him, but today it was close enough. Bruce breathed a sigh of relief as he sank into the the plush pillows on his bed. Never had he been happier to be safely secluded in this place.\u00a0<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to call out for Alfred, then closed it again, remembering that it was Tuesday, and his butler would be out purchasing groceries today. \u00a0<br>\r\nBruce was pretty sure he was getting a migraine. This physical ailment was such an inconvenient complication. He'd have to to cancel his date with Paris Hilton (a plus, come to think of it, he realized).  The scientist/detective in him also reminded the young billionaire that he should be keeping detailed records on the nature of his condition. Bruce eyed the glossy cell phone on the bedside table considered calling Rachel. He didn't exactly want her \u00a0to see him like this, but he wanted her there at he same time. He knew he could count on his best friend.\u00a0<br>\r\nHe wondered how she would take the news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Bruce. Great timing, court just dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel.

Children were chasing each other off the afternoon school-busses. Laughter trickled through the air.<br>\r\nRachel Dawes was sitting contentedly at her desk, filing through a hefty stack of paperwork. An assistant DA's job was was far from simple, but she enjoyed her work nonetheless.<br>\r\nRachel reached for a manila envelope and flipped it over. It was very light, but not empty. No return address. In fact, it was completely unmarked except her name scrawled across the front. Frowning, she slit it open and cautiously peered inside. Rachel pulled out a scrap a paper: \"this should help with the case against \u00a0Maroni.\"<br>\r\nAn anonymous tip. Looking deeper in the envelope, rachel pulled out a tiny clear plastic baggie filled with a powdery substance.<br>\r\nShe tried to open it, but the plastic was slick, and she didnt have a great grip. At last it burst open, unfortunately exploding its contents all over Rachel's face and desk. She sneezed, then shook her head and dusted off her desk and skirt. Rachel resealed what was left and set aside. She would send it for testing.<br>\r\nShe intended to drop it off on her way to lunch; she was meeting Bruce at a local cafe today. Harvey wouldn't be thrilled to know this, but then again, Rachel had no intention of filling him in. She grabbed her keys and handbag and rose to leave.<br>\r\nBut as she stood, a crippling wave of nausea and dizziness overcame her. Rachel's knees buckled as she collapsed.<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes later, her eyes flickered open. Rachel groaned as she attempted to pull herself to her feet. Every inch of her body protested at this sudden movement- Why was she so sore? Rachel's mind was cloudy, and she found it difficult to process where exactly she was. This terrain was unfamiliar to her. Then she spotted a pen lying next to her that was roughly as tall as she was. She screamed and nearly fell off the edge of her own desk. She quickly backed towards the center, nearly tripping over strewn papers as she did so.<br>\r\nShe was hyperventilating now. But her breath caught in her throat when a *large* shadow enveloped her figure.<br>\r\nRachel gasped and whirled about--<br>\r\nStaring down at her was ______ ?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have no idea what happened.\" You exclaim in a choked voice.<br>\r\nBruce stares at your terrified, confused expression, then stands back up and glances around before turning his attention back on you. His height to you was dizzying, but his voice was gentle. <br>\r\n\"Listen Rachel, we're going to figure this out. But I need to get you somewhere safe.\" <br>\r\n\"Ok.\" You nod, and he lays his palm flat on the desk. After a moment's hesitation, you step onto his hand. It's such a strange sensation. You imagine it must be rather odd for Bruce, too. As slowly and carefully as he can, he raises his hand up to eye level. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to put you in my pocket until we're away from prying eyes. Is that allright with you?\" Bruce says quietly. <br>\r\nYour eyes dart to his pockets. You aren't sure which pocket he's talking about, but none sound extremely appealing. On the other hand, it's probably the best option you have at the moment. You look back to his eyes and nod. With the same caution, Bruce tipped his hand into the breast pocket of his shirt. After checking to make sure you were still allright, he re-buttoned his blazer and began to non-challantly retrace his steps through the DA's office back out to his car. It's dark in the pocket and you sway with every step, occasionally bumping into his chest. You finally hear the car door shut. You shift a little as you feel Bruce moving to retrieve you. You close your eyes as his huge hand fills the pocket and withdraws your tiny form. You open your eyes to bright sunlight again. Bruce puts you down in the cup-holder and starts the engine. <br>\r\nThe stunned silence between you seems natural, but you can't help but wonder... <br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" You call up to him. </span></div></div>",

For a long time- perhaps hours, perhaps days, she wasn't certain- Talia was certain she was dead. She had thought she might encounter a bright light, as was popular rumor. But she was met with darkness every which way she turned. Darkness that was reminiscent of the pit at night, she thought with a grimace. <br>\r\nSlowly, her senses came back to her. Indistinct voices echoed in her ears, and irregular light permeated her eyelids. Perhaps she wasnt dead yet after all.<br>\r\nShe tried to move, but her limbs felt like lead. Recognizing her body's need, she rested in semi-consciousness for a while longer. The voice because less frequent, and she found herself wishing it would come back, even though she didnt know who it was. She refused to be scared. She had been prepared to face death, and wouldn't be daunted by... Whatever was currently happening to her. <br>\r\nSomething sharp suddenly pierced her arm, followed by a cooling sensation. Had someone injected her? Poison was her initial guess, but she discarded that notion when feeling flooded back into her limbs a moment later. The noises became crisper, her senses attuned themselves to their environment. Speaking of which, where was she? She opened her eyes. They focused for a moment, then became wide with shock. Everything was enormous... She must have been the size of a doll! <br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\nHer breath caught in her throat when the voice spoke, finally recognizable this time, and extremely near. <br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" She demanded, her strong voice quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who is with her?)</span></div></div>",
