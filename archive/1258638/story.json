They\u2019ll be chasing that lead for a very long time! In the meantime we\u2019ll have you all to ourselves,\u201d replied Tomalak proudly, \u201cIn the meantime I believe it is time to end the charade.\u201d<br>\r\n\tWith that the metal sphere dissapeared revealing an advanced Romulan laboratory. Off to one side Data clearly saw Tomalak grinning from ear to pointed ear.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI presume that that was some sort holographic projection?\u201d inquired Data.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou presume correctly, now if you\u2019ll just hold still for a second my assistant here would like to take a sample of your circuitry.\u201d<br>\r\n\tData was about to reply when he noticed two huge metal cuffs forming around his hands and restricting their movement completely. His ankles were attached to similar cuffs.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh yes, the restraints,\u201d sighed Tomalak as another Romulan walked up to Data to remove one of his access panels, \u201cIt took a fair bit of work but we managed to simulate perfectly five ton iron cuffs with only a fraction of the size. I hope you do not mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\tThe other Romulan then tore away a small piece of circuitry. To compensate Data simply rerouted signals around the breach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow for our next test I\u2019d like you to perform a demonstration of your strength. This will be done by your holding an ever increasing amount of weight until you can no longer. At that point we will release pressure,\u201d stated Tomalak, still grinning wildly.</span></div></div>",

Before long, Captain Benjamin Sisko's face was looking at her, carrying a solemn expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we got back just in time,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't agree more Captain.\" Kira started to get him up to speed,\"Three Dominion ships came through the wormhole and started attacking us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" she heard Jadzia's voice in the background, \"They're retreating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked to Eddington for confirmation, and he simply nodded his agreement. Just like that it was over. She put aside her confusion, for the moment, simply happy that the room had stopped shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easy,\" Sisko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged and the communication ended. \"Damage Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all superficial...\" He paused, and the tone of his voice told her something wasn't sitting right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Major.
