Falco\u2019s voice chirped on the communicator. \u201cHey buddy, we need to rendezvous about and a mile and a half north of where you jumped. I\u2019m sending the coordinates for the location to your navigation unit. Once there, Pepper and Peppy will brief us on the mission. See ya\u2019 later.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBye Fox!\u201d Slippy chimed in.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.bye Slippy.\u201d Fox finished awkwardly. He deployed his parachute as his Arwing (now on autopilot above) headed back towards Great Fox. This was just another odd job that the Star Fox team had to pull off to keep the lights on and the ships fueled in between big pay jobs. However money had been becoming tighter so the jobs became odder and odder as time passed. He was relieved to have semi-real mission after a long dry spell. The ground quickly rose to meet fox as he braced himself for landing. The ground was soft and muddy causing the fox to sink a bit on impact. He quickly unhooked his parachute and jumped out of the wet mud. \u201cDammit, my boots.\u201d Fox moaned shaking his feet attempting unsuccessfully to remove the gunk from his boots. Giving up he radioed Falco. \u201cCan you send me the coordinates?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep, here they are, meet you in 20. Keep your hand on your blaster. We have no idea what lives on this planet.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha, shoot first ask questions later?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs always. I\u2019m landing soon so I\u2019ll be out of contact for a bit, if anything happens try and get Slip.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWill do.\u201d Fox finished. He walked out of the clearing and into the thick of the jungle with his hand resting firmly on his blaster. The air was humid and heavy. Fox was relieved that he had chosen relatively light clothes. He wore a sleeveless shit under his usual vest and a pair of light pants, to keep the wildlife off of his legs. The jungle was relatively quiet, besides the general noise of the ambiance and the squelching of his shoes of the soft earth. However this was interrupted by a growl coming from Fox\u2019s stomach. However he dismissed it and continued walking on. <br>\r\nMoney had been relatively tight and the rules always went fuel before food on the ship. Hence it had been a day since he had had a real meal. Needless to say Fox needed little exercise to keep an athletic figure. He had very little fat on his body and due to the lessened food intake needed little  exercise to keep in shape. He clocked in at about 5\u20199\u2019\u2019 145lbs. He continued through the jungle until he was interrupted again by a growl. He was very hungry, starving in fact. He then stopped in a small clearing and saw some fruits hanging on a tree. His stomach roared again almost begging him to eat them. It was then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fox and his team had been called in to stop a rampaging ark (a special shelter ship for mass transporting civilizations that lost their worlds). Fox and his team managed to stop the AI that was running rampant, but not before it sealed Fox inside and alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Fox. The codes to open the doors are complicated. And if we try blowing them open after the damage the battle caused, we could end up killing you by mistake,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...could you at least reset the gravity?\" asked Fox, floating around. \"Everything is working but this,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the time. You'll just have to make do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed. He guess he could think of this as a vacation somewhat. The ark was made to house millions for extended periods of time, so there was plenty of supplies onboard. His stomach then crumbled and he went floating to find food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Fox know that without gravity to exert pressure on him, there was no need for his body to exert itself. There was nothing he couldn't lift easily and his body didn't burn much, if any, calories just floating around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, eating...that was a different story. He still would intake the same amount of calories as before...but without gravity, he essentially was not taking any exercise in the slightest...</span></div></div>",

Slippy's already passed out from an all-nighter three times already.\" Falco said, accompanied by a soft moaning sound from somewhere in the background. \"Well, can you please at least fix the gravity in here? Do you know how long I've gone without any of my usual training routines?\" Fox was poking the large gut pushing up his shirt. 14 days of food and no exercise has really taken a toll on his body. His limbs have blimped out, his face had soft round cheeks, but most of all, his belly was so large, Fox had a hard time pushing his shirt down halfway, let alone cover the whole thing! \"...Seriously guys, you don't wanna know just how much I've...changed.\" \"Sorry, but I think the wiring was damaged, and it'll take even longer to fix that. Don't worry, we'll find out once we get the doors open. Just hang on until then. Falco out.\" Fox began trying to do crunches again, but without gravity, it was nothing more than bending your back. \"*sigh* I don't even know why I keep doing this...\" His stomach began rumbling again, and so he began floating to a crate full of food rations nearby.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Boys, we've got a new mission. Code 3. Debrief in my office in five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peppy's voice broke out over the Great Fox's loudspeaker, Fox and Krystal both swore under their breath. It had only been two days since Fox and Falco got back from a tougher-than-necessary mission to the Fifth Galaxy Division, where a small band of rebels who had taken it upon themselves to deify Andross had decided to raise some hell. While the two fighters made short work if their targets, it had taken three days longer than necessary. The dogfight was easy, but once the rebels realized they were severely outmatched, they took hostages and holed up in the first apartment they could find, paying dozens of residents to fight off any intruders. Of course, McCloud and Lombardi were able to take care of business, but securing the hostages was a tough deal. Fox was still aching and a bit overtired, and had been relaxing with Krystal when the call came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Peppy's calling you back out already,\" Krystal pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm not happy about this one, either. But Code 3s are simple escort missions. I can probably set my autopilot and sleep the whole way there. If I'm not back in two days, I'll drop you a line. Otherwise, we'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox gave Krystal a hug and a quick peck on the mouth before he grabbed his jacket and went to the debrief. Just as he expected, it was an easy mission. A young, rich lynx wanted an escort party from her college on Stardenia back home to Sunomio for spring break. She was a daddy's girl, and daddy had offered Team Fox three months' usual pay for this one mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all formality from there. Fox, Falco, Slippy and ROB headed out and got to Stardenia in a few hours. Once there, the four met the girl and drew straws to see who'd get to sleep and who had to keep watch at what time as they prepped their autopilots. Fox won some well-deserved sleep, and didn't notice a minor but glaring typo as he typed \"Sumomio\" into his onboard computer. As the ships lifted into space, he drifted into dreamland, and the rest of the team didn't notice as his ship slowly but surely fell out of rotation and started veering out wide left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox awoke hours later, finally recovered from his previous journey, just as he entered Sumomio's atmosphere. As the ship drifted closer to the ground, Fox realized his team was nowhere to be found. As it taxied around an entry point to the planet, he realized this wasn't Sunomio. But he didn't truly realize the severity of the situation until he climbed out of his ship and right into the waiting arms of two very large lions in rubber jumpsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two felines started to carry the vulpine into an imposing-looking immigration room, he determined that something was very, very wrong. Glancing left and right at his captors, he was taken aback. The rubber jumpsuits, one red and one blue, strained to retain what must have been 650 pounds of hefty big cat each. In doing so, he didn't notice a looming round slide dropping at a diagonal angle into the floor. Which made it a real shock when they dropped him right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCloud yelled as he quickly rode the decline, again when he was hit by a cold clear spray that dissolved his clothing, and a third time when his decline was suddenly halted as he fell directly into an orange and black jumpsuit, much like the ones his captor lions were wearing. Just as quickly as the slide started, though, it suddenly halted, and Fox found himself in a ten-foot by ten-foot room with a massive TV screen in front of him. It jumped awake, and as its image came into view, Fox found himself face-to-face with a massive tabby cat. Easily pushing a full ton, the cat wore a golden jumpsuit much like Fox and the lions did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, and welcome to Sumomia!\", the cat began. \"We're glad that you've decided to visit our wonderful planet. My name is King Anthony the Eighth. 150 years ago, my great-great grandparents, starved and delirious, managed to escape the infamous Ryat War, landing on this planet as its first residents. Planting the last of their seeds and praying for a fertile climate, they were the first of many to discover just how special this planet's atmosphere is. Those first plants came to fruition in only three days, and what's more, the harvests were more bountiful than ever seen before - with the caveat that their nutritional values and the natural air combined to overload the average body's metabolism. After one week, my starving ancestors had gained ten pounds - in a month, they'd gone from evacuated to overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time since, Sumomia has become a celebration of everything fat. We're global champions of sumo wrestling and one of the largest exporters of food to struggling planets in the universe. We're proud of our global weight in the market and flaunt it accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're here because our body scanners upon entry found you aren't nearly close to our planetary standard weight. We require all residents to have body weight percentages of at least 40 percent, though the more the merrier. I, personally, hold the record, at 1,942 pounds and a percentage of 97.8. You will not be allowed to leave your current room until you meet this mandate. You have two options, as such: voluntary gain or involuntary.\" As he said the second, Anthony's face contorted just the slightest bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope you make the right decision to respect our heritage. Once again, welcome to Sumomia, and we hope you have the time of your life here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anthony's face left the screen, two options came up on the screen, which Fox walked up to. The two buttons simply said :) and :(. A timer began counting down from 30 seconds.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fox considered his options, quickly realizing that he didn't have many to choose from. As the timer ticked away, he knew that no matter what happened, he was going to have to get fat. If it's the nature of the planet, he wasn't getting away without gaining a few pounds, and he didn't want to think about what might happen if he went against the grain. Better to take control of the situation while he still could, mitigating the damage and making sure he wasn't taken prisoner. With time still on the clock, McCloud pressed the :) button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second's pause, a second video of Anthony came up on the screen. He seemed happy. \"Splendid! We hope you enjoy your time on our wonderful planet!\" As the cat continued talking, the room slowly but surely filled up with a faint but noticeable green gas. \"That gas is relatively harmless, a simple cocktail we've prepared on this planet to make your new gain as easy to stomach as possible. In a few moments, our automatic kitchen will begin preparing some high-quality dishes for you, and the gas is intended specifically to speed your digestion and make your weight gain as fast and easy as possible. In a second, the screen will offer a variety of foods for you to choose from, all the highest quality, and you can select whatever you want. We'll let you know when your body fat percentage reaches an acceptable level, though you can continue eating for as long as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat cat's face disappeared, replaced by a basic touch screen module filled with dozens of different types of food. Separated by meal and ethnicity, Fox found that almost every type of food he could imagine was at his fingertips. Up in the corner of the screen, a small line said \"15%,\" clearly the fox's current body fat percentage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox searched through the selections and finally decided to start by pressing a button for a chocolate milkshake. Mere seconds later, an unseen door in the wall slid open and out came a tray holding the biggest milkshake Fox had ever seen. The size of a bucket and packed to the brim with ice cream, milk and chocolate sauce, the fox thought he had died and went to heaven and took a sip. It was, indeed, one of the best things he'd ever tasted. One sip became two, became four, became a gulp and then a chug - Fox noticed that since the gas had sprayed him, his appetite had grown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Fox was highly regretful, as he had just finished the gigantic milkshake. Panting and holding his belly, which was noticeably distended by two inches and accentuated by the jumpsuit, he groaned and took a deep breath. Suddenly, his gut shrank a bit. Breathing in again, Fox saw his stomach process the milkshake instantly, his gut emptying and spreading its contents throughout his body. Checking the screen, Fox's \"15%\" had become a \"16%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking things couldn't get much worse, Fox resigned himself to a feast he'd likely never have a chance to enjoy again. Ordering a steak, then a triple cheeseburger with chili fries, then a massive ice cream sundae, he dined continually, pausing after each dish to allow his stomach to settle. Over time, he watched himself grow fat. First the gain was barely noticeable - his arms were a bit pudgier than before, or his chest saw a slight bit of padding. After a few hours, though, his gut had extended inches off his body. Another three bowls of pasta later, his thighs were touching, and checking his reflection in the screen, he was working on a big double chin. At this point, he was becoming obese, and his percentage showed - he had crested 30 percent body fat.</span></div></div>",

When he did the screen lit up again showing the same fat tabby cat. \"Well I see you made your choice, thats ok...honestly I think it's more fun this way\" he said with a toothy grin. Suddenly Fox felt a sharp prick on his shoulder and he looked over to see a dart in his arm. Before he knew it Fox couldn't feel his arm, then that feeling spread to the rest of his body causing him to fall over unable to move. From behind Fox could hear a door open and heard lumbering footsteps behind him, and in front of him he saw a chair rise from the ground. Fox was picked up and placed in the chair and was able to see that it was the same two lions who threw him in here. As the lion in the blue jumpsuit placed straps around his head, legs, arms, the lion in red pressed a button under the screen causing a tube to descend from the ceiling. Then the lion in red forced open Fox's mouth and shoved the tube in down his throat causing him to gag a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Anthony was still watching through the screen and once he saw Fox secured he said \"now that your comfortable lets get you to up to standard\". Fox could hear a humming noise coming from the ceiling as a thick, creamy substance flowed slowly down the tube and down Fox's throat. \"Thats a special little shake that we like to make here to help people pack on the pounds, and your getting a super concentrated batch to help you gain quickly\". Fox could feel his stomach expanding as more of the shake went down his throat. His stomach began to slowly expand forming a small bulge that was quickly gaining size as it pushed against the jumpsuit he was now in. Soon the rest of his body started to fatten up as his arms started to grow flabby, and his thighs swelled to the point where they were pushing against each other, he could even feel his butt getting bigger as it widened into a fat bubble butt. Not much longer and Fox was sporting a solid double chin, and all he could do is look in shock as his once toned body ballooned into a fat sack of lard. As Fox grew bigger, what grew the most was his belly leading the way as it kept rising higher and higher, sagging onto his growing lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox didn't know what the jumpsuit was made from only that whatever it was was super elastic as it grew and stretched with his body. And while this was all happening the two lions and the king just watched with enjoyment, all of them stroking their bellies. After a bit the flow stopped and the tube went back into the ceiling and the restraints undone, leaving Fox just laying there, in shock at what had happened to him. Fox's attention was regained when King Anthony spoke \"Well I must say that was fun to watch, not many who come to this planet gain involuntarily so it is a really treat. And you should now meet the required...oh...looks like I got a bit carried away looks like your body weight percent is at...</span></div></div>",

He had saved the Lylat more ways than one, taken on challenges that would've made lesser people quake in their boots and flee. Now he was on the hardest assignment of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather and loving husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a good five years since the Star Fox team had disbanded. Fox remembered it like it was only five days. Krystal had announced to him that she was pregnant. Pregnant with his child. The shocking news suddenly catapulted him into a flurry of life changing decisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long hour of discussion. Fox and Krystal both decided that, for the sake of the child, they would stay together. Fox knew that he was probably more responsible for courting the young vixen to bed, and if he left the child without a real father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell such an idea bothered him. Growing up an orphan was, more or less life scarring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat also tied into the next decision. Getting Fox out of action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father died on the job. Something that both Fox and Krystal did not want for the child. So it was settled between them that they should leave the Star Fox team for good. A decision that caused a lot of friction between his friends and fellow teammates, but it was not argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had turned his back on the action packed life of a bounty hunter forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the allure of piloting and seeing all the various worlds of the Lylat had led to his new career. As a commercial pilot. It was not exactly the safest job but he got it the fastest. The company \"Lylat Jets\" was extremely shocked that ace pilot Fox McCloud had suddenly appeared, wanting to simply fly their spaceships. He was hired there on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife as a pilot had become sedentary to say the least. He would be sitting down for hours at a time, taking passengers to and fro. As a pilot he could only leave the plane for so long on certain days and normally found himself eating the fast food and downing a soda on the spaceship. Fox's metabolism, used to months of toning and training, neutralized the food and soda as it had for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the first month or so things had begun to change in his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's normally flat body had begun to soften. It was subtle at first. Five pounds in the next two months. But things slowly spiraled further down. At the end of the year he needed to go up a size in uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years later going through this job without much change in routine led to a rather large change in Fox himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body had gone from toned to tubby and the time when he was toned was just a long lost memory. Instead of chiseled abs he now had small pot belly, usually filled with brand soda and airline food. His angular face had bulged out, giving him a \"moon face.\" His legs and rump had not escaped the damage, filling out rather rapidly with their lack of use. His arms too were showing signs of gain, his fingers chubby and almost sausage like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is the Fox we see now, laying in his bed, staring at the ceiling half awake. His wife lay there...</span></div></div>",

Mommy! A monster in my closet!\" Came a high young voice as the door flung open with a young blue fox kit rushing into the bedroom as Fox rolled his eyes with a knowing smile Krystal leaping into action to comfort their young son... Perhaps his life wasn't so lacking in action after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright Marcus, Daddy will get you a glass of warm milk and then back to bed alright?\" Krystal cooed as she stroked the fur on the young boy's head and smiled at her husband who smiled back and ruffled his son's hair as he tromped to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox tapped his foot waiting for the milk to heat as his stomach let a low rumble and he chuckled silently to himself poking his head into the fridge looking for something tantalizing to satisfy his midnight hankerings. Finding a large slice of Marcus's week old birthday cake fox licked his lips as greedily pulled out the decadent chocolate treat while using his somewhat plush rear-end to push the door closed. Fox devoured the cake in record time, leaving only crumbs on his well fed cheeks gulping the last of the milk straight from the carton, mentally taking a note to put that on the grocery list as the pot finally whistled and the captain stifled a belch  as he poured it into a mug and headed back sending his son to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox awoke to the sun in his eyes hearing Krystal in the other room helping Marcus get ready for his day at school. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes Fox yawned loudly as he got up and headed to the bathroom to get himself ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot groaned as once again as he vainly tried to make button meet hole on the black slacks of his captain's uniform. \"Ahhh c'mon don't tell me I got bigger again!\" he ranted angrily as he felt the heat rise to his chubby cheeks trying hard to suck his gut in, one to many midnight snacks he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a problem honey?\" Krystal asked as she walked in the room her voluptuous figure dressed modestly for the day, Fox sighed in frustration and embarrassment the last thing he wanted was for his beautiful wife to notice she was growing a chubby hubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh I think I've gone up again,\" Fox admitted as he loosened the choking grip his tie had on his fleshy throat \"I have to say I never expected I'd be one of those guys that goes to seed after he got hitched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiled as she embraced him from behind her slender hands running up and down his gut in a soothing rub as he felt himself relax a little. \"Well... So what if your getting a little cuddly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuddly? C'mon Krystal I think I hit cuddly after Marcus was born, I think its safe to say I'm getting fat.\" Fox said giving his belly a hearty thump as Krystal giggled and moved to the closet seeing if she could fish out a bigger pair of trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your not 25 anymore Fox,\" His wife said tossing him another pair of slacks \"Your a dad, now it doesn't hurt anyone if you have a bit more presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presence?\" Fox said managing to button his pants, it was a tight squeeze with some noticeable chaff action going around his waist but it would do. \"You make it sound like a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with a woman finding a bit of charm in her husbands figure?\" Krystal asked playfully as she helped her husband do up his ill fitting belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charm? Now I know I'm getting the pity party.\" Fox laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now that's not the kind of talk I want to be hearing out of you!\" Krystal said as she pulled her husband over to the rooms large vanity mirror. \"Now look and tell me what you see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rolled his eyes and looked lazily into his reflection, his face had swollen with plump cheeks blending into a wideset neck that oozed lazily over the tight shirt collar it was stuffed into, flaccid arms bulged heavily through his short sleeved shirt, a captain's badge was pinned over his left breast which he could see was starting too grow moobish, the buttons of his shirt puckered slightly pulling the fabric of his shirt taught over his gut as it hung over all angles of his tight belt, his thighs notably straining a tight pair of black trousers and a heavy derriere threatened to tear the his seat with any great movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A terribly mismatched couple?\" Fox said defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong! The answer I was looking for is a man of experience!\" Krystal said as she shoved his captain's cap hard on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I mean your the big man in charge!\" She said as she flirty traced circles on his chest with her index finger. \"Don't tell me you don't feel at least a little rugged now that your heavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox glanced back in the mirror, noticing the gentleman like features of his well fed face, the power in his thicker shoulders in his arms, the way his well fed stomach gave him a regal yet approachable air. His uniform really pulled the look together and he saw what his wife did. The pilot deviously narrowed his eyes as he pulled the blue bombshell roughly into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't mind I went from hunky to chunky...\" Fox said  huskily as he leaned down to kiss his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww! Mushy stuff!\" Marcus said as he covered his eyes at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Markie your mom and dad are having a moment.\" Fox smiled with cheerful annoyance and kissed his wife anyway picking his son up afterwards, throwing him atop his shoulders as the kit giggled picked his dad's cap off his head and put it on his own head. \"Are you gonna be home for dinner dad?\"</span></div></div>",

Fox stared on Krystal the whole way out, he was starting to wonder if her sudden acceptance of his size was all that great. One thing was sure though, it was time for work. Fox yawned and checked his PDA, today was going to be busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFridays always were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid into his car, self consciously adjusting the seat backward to give his belly room. He knew it wasn't really THAT big yet, it wasn't touching the wheel or anything even when it wasn't adjusted. But it seemed to accentuate his girth just by seeming that much closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was fortunate to have a relaxing drive to work every day, the shuttleport was just outside the city limits of Corneria City. Landing it not too far from the rural districts. Fox himself had become rather accustomed to the quiet of the country. There wasn't any loud neighbors, no robberies, and work was just around the corner. It reminded him somewhat of his bounty hunting days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vast quiet of space, save for the low hum of his arwing. Sometimes he'd fly out by himself as a way to get away from his teammates. He loved them like family, Slippy and Falco, but they really had a bad habit of arguing. Trying to keep one's cool as team leader was rough sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past five years he had not really seen much of Falco or Slippy, he had to actually think back to when he saw them last. It had to be on a chance visit when he was on his way to Fortuna with some adventurous tourists. They bumped into eachother at the shuttle port, Falco and Slippy had kept the team going as best they could. Recruiting two new kids (\"man I am getting old\") to help fill the spot of Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy Hare was one, she was Peppy's daughter, he remembered way back when he'd babysit her. She had to be almost 20 now. Then there was some other kid he didn't recognize, Dash Bowman. Fox was just starting to lose his figure around that time. It was back in the days of Medium shirts and 30 inch waist pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fox's PDA buzzed, he glanced down at it, he was getting a voice message. He checked the caller, \"Jamie Salsberg.\" He rolled his eyes and answered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. McCloud?\" An unsure voice asked on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its me, what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're having a little difficulty at the shuttleport, somebody's here and they say they know you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sat still, thinking for a moment. He thought he heard a scream on the other end of the phone somewhere in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's voice started getting panicky. \"Oh that! 'sjust Melissa, you know how she is with spiders and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to see me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says they're an old bounty hunter friend, says they want to catch up on old times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's nice and all, any specifics?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want it to be a surprise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was stopped his car for a moment, the shuttleport was coming into view. It looked dead silent. Which was beyond weird for a Friday morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie who is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\" Fox sighed and put his PDA back in his pocket and drove just a little closer to the airport. There really was no body at the entrance, cars were left vacant where they stood. Something was seriously wrong. With a gulp Fox pulled his car up near the edge of main entrance of the gate. Security was absent from their position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttleport was in real danger, real life danger, and the only person for miles was a portly out of shape former bounty hunter. His first response was to phone the police, he knew it would take a long time for them to get there, and whomever had taken on the entire Port without anyone alerting the police was some force of nature. Fox typed in a code on his glove compartment, with a small whoosh it opened, revealing his old blaster and some other important documents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought I'd have to use this again.\" He muttered. He only kept it around for nostalgic purposes, and the possibility it might see some action one day. He hoped he wouldn't have to use it, but of course things never quite worked that way for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp he exited his car and kept his blaster holstered at his side. Slowly, and as stealthy as possible, he made his way up to the front of the airport. He knew walking right up to the front door would be a bad idea. There were security cams, and no cover. However there was a possibility. A staff-only area that included a lounge as well as a way to the security checkpoints. Metal detectors and other means to keep unsightly people onto the shuttles were there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course they had always been lax on security, perhaps that proved to be their undoing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and keeping his head low, Fox quickly made his way to the staff-only door. He pulled out his keycard and slid it into a slot on the door's automated lock.  It made a small beep, and the red light on the lock changed to green. He pushed the door open and walked, making sure to shut it quietly behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was sweaty, he hadn't run that far for that long for a long time. His heart was pounding and his belly was rising rapidly up and down. \"Jeez I hope I don't die of a heartattack before I get there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept low the whole time, listening for any signs of life at the doors along the hall. It was chillingly quiet. All he could hear was his taxed breathing and pounding heart. He opened one door and had to stifle a yelp. On the ground was a pile of dead security guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell did this? He almost didn't want to find out, but at the same time they wanted him personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp he made his way further down the hall. It took a moment to convince himself to open the door to the security check point, with a deep breath he pushed it open slowly and peeked out. Sitting at one of the metal detectors was Leon Powalski, smoking a cigarette, his blaster resting on the conveyor belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox needed to keep his element of surprise and there was no way he was getting out there quietly with his girth. Then again he might not have too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon jumped a little when he heard a loud click from across the room, his eyes shifted around and suddenly found an open door. It was the one that led to the staff only area. Where all the bodies of the supposedly dead security guards were. He could smell a trap, but he was conditioned to feel no pain. He half way enjoyed it as a matter of fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the lone security guard could do, without a weapon, was probably minimal. Though he loved to hunt, and he loved when his prey played rough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nimble legs he shuffled to the open door and peered inside. He heard a loud grunt and a tearing noise coming from the lounge. Smiling he raised his blaster to shoot and ran into the room. However as soon as he opened the door, a coffee pot was smashed over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would've knocked a normal person out only dazed Leon, he stumbled around a little pointing his gun wildly. Suddenly he felt a heavy weight push him to the ground and hold him there while he squirmed. A thick arm reached its way around his neck and held itself there. In a moments time Leon succumbed to a sleeper hold and passed out there on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox stood up and dusted his now ruined pants off. He turned his head around to get a good look at his back-side. His rump had burst the seam of his pants finally. With a blush and curse, he continued onwards. It was just a rip. As a matter of fact it made room for his \"presence\" as Krystal called it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust further along the security checkpoint was the flight desk. And who else was there but Wolf O'Donnel and Panther Caroso. With a sigh he held his back to a wall and weighed his options. He could get close enough to Panther and bash him over the head with a blunt object, and Wolf was right next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he had to be fast enough to disarm Wolf. He knew that Panther would go down easy, he always did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't make any sense...Just three guys did this?\" He muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox picked up a fire extinguisher and made his way closer to Panther and Wolf. The two were distracted, Panther had his gun pointed at Jamie, who was tied to his chair. Wolf was casually resting against the desk, with his gun holstered. Fox held his breath, he was just a few yards away. With a grunt he stood up and charged as fast as his fat body could go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanther didn't know what hit him, the fire extinguisher knocked him out cold. Fox turned towards Wolf, who was reaching for his blaster...</span></div></div>",

Fox almost laughed, had he really changed that much? Wolf threw a right hook and Fox instinctively dodged back and returned with a hard jab to the stomach. Wolf clutched his torso as Fox delivered an upper cut to his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp Wolf stumbled backwards. \"Alright fatboy enough games.\" Wolf growled and bared his teeth. He held up his razor sharp claws and smiled. Fox wiped the sweat from his face and held up his fists. It had been so long since he had done anything like this. He couldn't believe in the shape he was in he was holding his own as good as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf swiped at Fox with his claw, grazing his shirt and leaving three fine tears along the midsection of his shirt. Fox yelped as he felt a little blood trickle down his belly. Panting Fox knew that wasn't going to be able to keep up with Wolf's speed. He was going to have to go all out while he still could. With that in mind he stepped back a bit and let Wolf advance, giving Wolf the feeling that he had the upper hand. That Fox was submitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as Wolf tried to swipe with his claws again Fox used as much energy as he could to dodge and grabbed the fire extinguisher that had knocked out Panther with. He heaved the thing over his head with all his might and smashed it into Wolf's skull, the crushing blow made him bite his tongue, blood trickled onto the floor. Fox bashed Wolf in the gut and knocked him on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" Wolf panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Fox McCloud, and don't you forget it.\" Fox grunted and threateningly held the fire extinguisher above Wolf's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf squinted for a moment and then chuckled, \"took you long enough,\" then he passed out there on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox panted  heavily and dropped the fire extinguisher on the ground. Slowly he stumbled back and sat in a chair. Sweat pouring down his forehead as he tore open his captains shirt to assess the damage. It was nothing serious actually, the cuts did not go deep, and it seemed only the tips of the claws hit him. It was like his extra blubber had protected his vitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe term \"kevlard\" popped up in his mind, he groaned at the pun and turned towards Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Mr. McCloud, you still got it!\" Jamie cheered. \"Can you untie me? These ropes are chaffing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...hold on.\" Fox nodded as he took another second to catch his breath. He wiped the sweat from his brow again and shuffled over to Jamie, he grabbed a knife from Panther's unconscious body and cut the rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! I promise I won't make fat jokes about you behind your back again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as they're good I don't care.\" Fox smiled and punched Jamie playfully on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little beat though Sir, can I get you anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get me something to drink, I'm parched.\" Fox said fanning his face with his captains hat. Jamie nodded and ran to a vending machine nearby and turned back to Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was a goner and that Kevin didn't make it to the phones in time to call you! I'm surprised he called you of all people but I'm glad he did.\"  Jamie said as he tossed a bottle of soda <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin didn't call me...\" Fox tilted his head confused. \"and where is everyone else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all locked up and tied up in some other room. They kept me out here because they knew I knew you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd they know that?\" Fox said as he opened the bottle of soda and chugged it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...well...I...well they were asking around and I blurted out that you were captain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To malicious characters that just might look like Star Wolf?\" Fox folded his arms and raised an eyebrow at Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know I'm sorry, look you showed up just in time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the back of the room Fox heard rustling around, he grabbed a blaster and whipped around aiming at the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Captain cool it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's eyes widened a little. It was Falco, so that's who Kevin called. No surprise, he was what most would call a fanboy of the old Star Fox team. Star Falco was the most he was going to get. It wasn't like their number was private either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If had known you were coming I would've left at least Leon for you to take down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco looked surprised and then at Wolf and Panther on the ground. He then looked back up at Fox and holstered his blaster. Falco let out a small laugh of disbelief and stared at the Captain. \"Either they've lost their touch or you're full of surprises Captain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Falco I've still got it.\" Fox folded his arms, his self esteem diminishing with every old friend or foe entering the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez Fox is that you?\" Falco looked rather embarrassed. \"Man I'm sorry, just didn't recognize you, you look well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I got fat, seems like you're taking care of yourself though.\" Fox stood up and walked up to Falco. \"I'd like to stay and chat but we have three unconscious criminals that just took down the entirety of a shuttle port, I'm assuming these aren't the only people here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that, there's a small army of mercs at the back of the port, they're looking to hijack a shuttle or two it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where the rest of the hostages are!\" Jamie jumped up and ran to Fox and Falco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just Star Falco here to do some clean up, but you'd better get home Fox.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Falco this is my port and I'm a captain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Fox you have to leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look just because I'm a little out of shape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, as much as I'd like to have you to stay, you've got Krys and your son back home. Besides you earned a break.\" Falco gestured to the two unconscious bodies on the floor. \"And I can't have you taking all the fun.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe chubby vulpine looked down and nodded. \"Alright Falco, you get my port back though you hear? This jobs done me good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too good I think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" Fox rolled his eyes and walked back to the entrance of the port. Jamie followed close behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now Captain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home, lock your doors, pray they don't find you.\" Fox shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No seriously.\" said Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was joking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gulped, Fox laughed out loud and kept walking. \"You remind me of a certain co-worker I used to have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's eyes were glued to the screen, Fox had left for work about three hours earlier, and a shocking news broadcast had said \"Lylat Jets\" shuttleport had been attacked by an unknown terrorist threat. Cameras and a news chopper were positioned outside of the shuttle port while police officers had set up a barricade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar Falco had been called to the scene from the inside, which raised Krystals spirits, but her husband was in danger. She wrapped her arms around her legs and turned off the television. What a way to start the day. Shakily she walked to the kitchen and started to brew some tea, she always went to tea when her nerves were on edge. It was a mom trick she had learned from some neighbors down the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just taken her first sip when she heard foot steps behind her. She bolted around and spilled her tea a little. Standing right in front of her was her husband, his shirt was torn open, his furry belly hanging openly, three bloody scratches spread along the front. Dirt was smudged on his pants, and they sagged just a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox!\" She shouted and ran up to him, throwing her arms around him in tight embrace. He hugged her into him and stared into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for safe working environment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought...I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krys it's alright, I just got a little scratched up. My clothes took more damage than I did, speaking of which I need new pants.\" He blushed and gestured to the rip in the seam, the red fabric of his boxer shorts looked like a balloon. She went into a giggle fit and hugged him tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get you whatever you want, I'm just glad you're ok.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey can you throw me some lunch together? I'm starved.\" He winked at her and stretched, pushing his belly forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you seducing me, Mr. McCloud?\" Krystal smiled softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go get cleaned up, and save it for later, I said dinner was special tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a tease.\" Fox said and smiled as he turned around and walked up stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick shower and some bandage work, he went downstairs and saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any damage to any of the aircrafts?\" Fox asked hoping he could divert Falco from talking about the shape he was in smiling to himself as the self consciousness began to ease into a small amount of pride, while he was not exactly thrilled to get back into action it was always a nice thought that he still could even if he was a good 50 pounds past his prime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falco was just saying the terrorist's where suppressed with minimal damage to the port.\" Krystal interjected as she handed Fox a drink, \"Hostages secured and aircrafts all accounted for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed with relief as he took a swig of the cool beer his wife handed him, his port would be back in working order in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how has Star Falco been running? Has the Great Fox been giving you any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We call her the Eagle's Roost now and you know how fickle the old gal can be, I swear most of our pay goes to maintenance for the damn thing.\" Falco said as he took his seat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear that.\" Fox said feeling both a jab of annoyance at his father's ship being renamed as well as the twinge of resentment in his former wingmans tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily I think I'm getting a sweet meal ticket from this gig though I hope you don't mind not getting a cut, you look like you eat well enough anyway.\" Falco snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha,\" Fox groaned sarcastically as he felt he insecurely gave his prominent stomach a rub, \"Glad to see your as abrasive as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serious! Fox I hardly recognized ya! Who woulda thunk baby faced Fox McCloud would look so grown up! Or rather grown out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby faced?\" Fox asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal suppressed a small giggle \"Just a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rolled his eyes and crossed his arms with a huff, he thought he looked sharp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was the taste of the old life Fox did it get the old blood boiling again?

Not even a little bit?\" Falco looked surprised. \"No thoughts of the good ol' days at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those days weren't that good.\" Fox mused as he stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on there has to be some fighting spirit in there, otherwise you wouldn't have taken down Star Wolf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did that because I was protecting what's mine Falco.\" Fox sat up straight and stared at his old wingmate. \"That's the only reason I've ever done anything like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco looked a little distressed, Krystal could sense some unsaid feelings from him. Fox sipped his drink and shivered as the cold liquid traveled down his throat. On the outside he did seem perfectly reserved and confident about what was just said. Inside he felt a little remorse. He left his team on a bad note, something he never really got to make up.  This really felt like Falco asking if Fox was really sure about moving on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have changed Fox.\" Falco said with a humorless chuckle. \"All grown up right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just about me anymore, I have Marcus and Krystal to take care of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when you said you never wanted a life like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a long time ago Falco, you need to understand, I'd rather be fat and work the longest shifts in the world  than see my family in danger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco's mood didn't seem to improve, in fact he looked very annoyed. That friction between the two teammates had only grown stronger as the years have went by. Being a father really had changed Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quiet for a moment, Falco, folded his arms and looked at Fox. \"Well if that is what you want, then so be it, thanks for your hospitality but I'd better get going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falco wait\" Krystal interjected. He stopped for a moment and looked at her. \"Since today has been a big day and all, how about you and the team come by later today and join us for dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco looked a little amused by the offer. \"Do I have the big man's permission?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed. \"Sure, bring the whole gang, I'm sure they'd like a decent meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its settled, it'll be like a family reunion, it's a little impromptu but I was preparing for a special night anyways.\" Krystal said as she walked over and kissed her husband on the cheek. \"You should come by around 7, we should have everything set up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco nodded. \"I'll see you then, later McClouds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox waited for Falco to leave the room and get as far away from earshot as possible. \"Krystal what was that about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I hate seeing you two like this, it's been years since we've seen any of them and it's all because you and Falco can't seem to keep anything civil between you two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? If he can't accept I want this life right here and now then he's no friend of mine.\" Fox glared a little and watched Falco's car drive off from his window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't want to accept it because he's scared, he won't admit it, but I'm sure he liked it better when you called the shots and he could do his own thing.\" Krystal sat down in Fox's lap and stroked his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed. \"Alright then,\" he slumped in his seat a little and closed his eyes, \"oh and Krys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes hon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize we're feeding 4 other people tonight right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my special dinner for tonight is covering this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiled a little and straddled Fox's lap. He looked up at her a little surprised and rubbed her back. \"You said you wanted a big dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to fatten me up?\" Fox looked a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, you make sound like I intend to eat you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, just wondering, what a bombshell babe like yourself would want with a butterball husband.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you.\" She replied and wrapped her arms around his neck. \"You look like a man of experience.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this man of experience is getting too flabby for his liking Krystal, I have no clue how I managed to survive today.\" Fox looked up into her eyes. \"I need to get in some sort of shape, just in case.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and stroked his cheek. \"I just want you safe at home, truth be told I don't want you actively running around out there getting into fights, and I think you'd be less inclined to do that with this extra heft.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems you can take the Fox out of the fight but can't take the fight out of the Fox.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox if you do start working out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Krystal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you'll try and stay a little big.\" Krystal looked down a little. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say that you're new physique has been 'growing on me' so to speak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox laughed a little. \"Well alright if it makes you happy I'll come up with something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple smiled at each other and locked into a deep embrace and kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox lazily opened his eyes, his bedside alarm clock read 3:00. The shower was running and he could hear Krystal humming in the bathroom. With a yawn he sat up and scratched his midsection, he draped his legs over the side of the bed and searched around for his discarded red boxers. He couldn't believe what he was thinking, he wanted to actually keep pudgy physique. It went against everything he knew. He instantly thought about the stages of grief, had he reached the acceptance stage? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the boxers up his thick legs and squeezed them on. He gazed at a mirror hanging off of the closet in his bedroom, and felt vulnerable. He never really saw himself in the mirror like this, he felt worse about himself than he did before, then he noticed them. The closet was cracked open, and poking out of a corner was a dumbbell. He had a few weights left over from his mercenary years, though they had really fallen into the wayside since Fox had become a little distracted with work and parenting. Perhaps he didn't have to lose any weight at all, rather build his body to support it, then everybody would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're awake! I'm going to go pick Marcus up ok?\" Krystal rushed over to Fox and gave him a hurried kiss. Before he could even answer she was out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the place to himself, he grabbed his PDA and searched an online for a hardcore weight training supplies. He winced a little when he saw the prices, perhaps he should think about getting too far into it later. Right now he was kind of hungry, and in need of a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce downstairs and happily digging into a roast beef sandwich, he realized how well he had it. He had a steady job, with good income, he had three meals a day, with plenty of snacks on the side. While he wasn't exactly rolling in the dough, he was living better than he used to. Now just how was he going to make some extra cash on the side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no bank left Marcus, bank left!\" Fox shouted at the television as Marcus mashed the buttons on his controller. Unfortunately for Marcus' virtual ship, a homing missile locked on and blasted it to pieces. The gameover screen appeared and Marcus determined to win, hit 'try again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal watched the two amused, she had dinner laid out on the table buffet style, and tables set up on the patio out back. It was about 6:50 PM, and their guests would soon be arriving. She walked over to her husband from behind and hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behave tonight you hear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\" Fox rolled his eyes and hugged her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good husband.\" She smiled a little and sat on the sofa. Before they knew it the door bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\" Fox said. With a grunt he stood up and walked to the door. He was dressed casually, a t-shirt and some shorts Krystal bought the other day that were wide in the thighs and the seat. It was an unusually laid back look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and looked outside. \"Wow you really came.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco chuckled at the remark. \"All I had to say was free food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come inside, dinner's been cooling off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox watched as his two former team members entered his home, nothing really had changed about them. Then Lucy and Dash came in, Lucy looked much more like her mother than her father, and Dash, well Fox had a strange suspicion as to whom he looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place you have here Fox.\" Slippy chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much but its home.\" Fox shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone got acquainted with eachother, in Fox's case he got reacquainted with most of his house guests. Krystal had outdone herself that night, the food was great. Fox almost didn't realize he was going back for thirds, pretty soon it was fifths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if I had her cooking for me,\" Falco remarked, \"I'd be as big as you too Fox.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening winded down, Fox realized that he was still helping himself to the food. It seemed his body had accepted his wife's proposal faster than he did. Which reminded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falco, about earlier...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, I know you're all Mr. Responsible and such now, but believe me it suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was wondering if I could somehow work something for you guys on the side? I need some extra cash I've realized, for something special.\" Fox gestured towards Krystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but you want it out of the action and close to home.\" Falco folded his arms. \"Well...</span></div></div>",

So your asking me to use my position in the airline to start a smuggling ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe azure pheasant, waved his hand  in dismissal \"No no nothing like that, we're just looking for a pilot to bring us a few crates of munitions and supplies here and there so we don't have to bring the Eagle's Roost to port as often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot rubbed the underside of his padded muzzle as he contemplated the proposal. \"You sure I'd be out of the action? I mean I'm transporting supplies to an armed vessel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco rolled his eyes at his former leader \"Its not like we're gonna call if we're in the middle of a warzone you know?\" he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine looked to his wife as she contemplated it as well \"While I'm not to thrilled with the idea of you transporting military cargo I can't see it being much more dangerous then your day job either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded as he thought about it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian noticed Fox would have to think about his offer, \"Well you know our number big guy, we'll be around til tomorrow so you can let us know when you decide.\" He said as he rubbed Marcus's head as he took his leave from the McCloud home.<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox kept his green eyes focused on the mirror as he observed his flabbier bloated body, he wasn't sure why he had this insecure fixation on his looks today; sure his body wasn't in the best of shape but he knew he was far from anyone's definition of ugly, he certainly enjoyed the extra helpings he could eat now that he was bigger, he had a gorgeous wife and a loving son and he definitely wasn't looking to go back to the life of a mercenary that lived pay check to pay check... His thoughts drifted back to his encounter with Star Wolf and the exhaustion he felt from a short distance sprint, it couldn't hurt to be in a bit better shape either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the vulpine's musings where cut short when he felt his stomach twist as if to remind him it was about time for some before bed snackage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed to himself a bit absentmindedly rubbing his tummy while he headed to the kitchen \"Well Krystal should be happy to hear no matter what you aren't going anywhere.\" he said finally content with the idea of staying large and in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox savored the spoonful of ice cream as his wife walked in, just finishing putting Marcus to bed. Smiling he walked up and gave her a kiss that she eagerly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's been awfully turbulent huh?\" She said resting her face in his chest. \"Lucky the airline will be closed tomorrow cuz of all the commotion, I forgot to get you a new pair of big boy pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot laughed as he ate another spoonful, \"Well buy em a bit roomier this time, in case I need room to grow.\" He joked as he bumped Krystal with his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shared in the laughter and gave him a peck on the cheek, \"Will do sir! Can't have the big boss man going around with his underwear showing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah that privilege is reserved for Mrs McCloud.\" He flirted as he put the now empty bowl into the sink. \"But how would she go for having a little beef with her pork?\" Fox joked as he flexed his flaccid arm to make his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A double order? Oh that would go over quite nicely I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think I should then? Take up Falco's offer I mean, excersize equipment isn't exactly cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal paused a moment as the air thickened \"...I don't know Fox, I just... I just don't want you heading back to the old life you know? Full of danger, after the worry I went through today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot embraced his wife with tender understanding \"I know, but you don't have to worry about me heading back that life. I have everything I want right here. Besides a big guy like me can't quite live pay check to pay check on instant noodles anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Fox, I trust you. So whatever you choose I will support it.\" She said snuggling close to his meaty body.</span></div></div>",

Far off into the distance he could see his father's old ship. She looked as she always did, a little rough around the edges, not very flashy in design. Yet she was a trooper and had outlasted any flashy new Cornerian flagship. Mainly due to her adaptability and the blood, sweat, and tears the team mechanics had put into her survival over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was his fourth time heading out to drop off cargo. A pit still formed in his stomach when he saw that the \"Star Fox\" insignia that had always been there had been replaced. It felt like it was no longer his father's ship, and in an odd way he had let down his dad. Of course the guilt subsided when he thought about his family now, and any father would want a peaceful life like this for his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain McCloud?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox jumped a little and turned to his co-pilot. \"Sorry Jamie what is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to be ok? You had a thousand yard stare going on there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, just watch the Comm channel to see if Falco is calling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jamie nodded and stared at the various meters that kept track of the ship's condition. The telecommunicator was blank, the caller alert light remained unblinking.With a sigh, he lay his hands on the back of his head and stared at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, if you don't mind me asking, why do you get so quiet on these cargo assignments?\" Jamie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking is all, I have a lot of good memories in that ship over there.\" Said Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked at it thoughtfully. \"I bet this might sound sappy but when I was a little kid I wanted to be on the Star Fox team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox laughed heartily and looked at his young companion. \"Seriously? Why never mention this before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem to enjoy talking about your past.\" Jamie shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it'll make me feel old.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to me, with all do respect sir, you are old.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rolled his eyes and kept the course steady. \"It's not all it's cracked up to be trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me captain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a merc I mean, it's not exactly the best job in the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is, see the universe, pick up hot girls, win congressional medals of honor every other weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one you have to desensitize yourself to death, I've killed hapless thousands of people Jamie.\" Fox frowned a little. \"Fathers, brothers, sons, all just fighting for a cause they thought was right, they all just become faceless goons that jump out at you like in a video game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was silent for a moment and looked at the captain. \"I'm sorry sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox shrugged. \"I have no regrets, and I'd do anything to make sure that what is most important to me stays safe. That's what Star Fox was always about to me at the end of the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young co-pilot looked down, ever since he started working with his childhood hero, Jamie thought he was just a washed up shadow of the vulpine he used to be. It was depressing to him at first, but in the time he had known him, it had dawned on him that he had just changed priorities. He still was a hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the caller alert light began beeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep her steady boys!\" Dash Bowman called out as he supervised the cargo shuttle's docking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fox and Jamie scrambled at the controls, Cargo ships were wider and dealt with heavier loads than most commercial shuttles, thus they were a little more unwieldy, especially in tighter spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said steady!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Bowman, they're fine.\" Said Falco as he entered the Hangar. \"Just a little farther in and I think we're good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly the ship settled as the engines shut down. Fox slumped in his seat and hi-fived Jamie, they were starting to get used to docking the blasted ship. Fox grabbed a small clipboard of paperwork and exited the cargo shuttle where Falco was waiting. He walked up to the pheasant gave him a firm hand shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't think I could've found someone to do this job better than you. Always on time and no accidents.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet.\" Jamie added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rolled his eyes. \"Hey at the rate you're paying I should probably do a good scrub of the ship too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked a little annoyed and sighed. Falco chuckled a little, \"I could use some cleaning staff out here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for a little extra cash, I've almost enough to get the next part of my home gym.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but I wouldn't make the captain do that, that's grunt work.\" Falco punched Fox's arm and gestured at Jamie, who did not look amused. \"And I can tell you've been using what little you have of that home gym.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Fox felt a little pride beam in himself. \"Makes me wonder if my dad would end up like this if he was, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe your mom, I dunno how McCloud genetics work.\" Falco shrugged. \"But thanks again, this has been really great of you to do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you.\" Fox smiled a little. \"Been nice seeing you guys again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft now you're getting soft on me too.\" Falco rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I loathe your company, if that makes you feel any better.\" Fox chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it, now get outta here, I'm sure you have lunch or something you need to get to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care Falco.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two former wingmates waved at eachother as Fox and Jamie boarded the cargoship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't like him.\" Said Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh he grows on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Krystal was probably one of the finest cooks Fox had ever met. To be honest he really hadn't met any cooks. Though she could make anything decadent and taste heavenly. She had a way with learning new things, she always became adept within weeks of experimentation. It really didn't take long to get her to fly an arwing like a natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She taught herself English, and she taught herself Saurian. Now she had taught herself how to cook like a pro. Fox stared at the plate of roasted porkchops and licked his lips, she always made lunch in style too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fox felt her eyes on him as he ate, he had definitely let his appetite grab the reins the past two weeks. There never seemed to be a break in his eating. He was always getting a snack here or there, coming back for a fifth plate of dinner. Mixed with dumbbell workouts in the partially complete home gym, Fox had become a rather large guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His arms had begun to bulge with chub and muscle. His chest, while plush, had definition to it. Krystal had to admit she liked the \"flavor\" the workouts added to her hubby. With a stifled belch Fox set aside his plate and looked over at his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admiring your handiwork?\" Fox said as he wiped his face with a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My handiwork? This is all your doing.\" She replied and poked his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vulpine blushed a little and scratched his blubbery stomach. It was weird to him, the feeling of being bigger. Two weeks ago he barely breached 36 inch pants. Now as the second week came to a close the 42 inch waist of his pants was starting to get snug. His belts becoming useless once again. He didn't know it was possible to get so much bigger so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His chest had genuine moobs at this point, even with their definition from weight training they still bulged and pressed against his shirts. Though you didn't take much notice of them, his gut was rather distracting. It easily was starting to become the biggest part of his gain. It had the appearance of an overstuffed beanbag, sagging and bulging against every fabric that was pressed against it. His thighs were starting to be come tree trunk thick, Fox was noticing that one thigh alone was soon going to be able to seat Krystal and Marcus side by side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The best way he could describe how he felt was by comparing it to flying the cargo shuttle. It felt good to be the big thing that other ships made way for, and while unwieldy at times, he always managed to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like?\" Fox posed a little for his wife. She blushed madly and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm madly in love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes could you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead it can't be that bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiled sheepishly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew it sounded silly!\" Krystal laughed as she punched her husband's thick arm playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!

I know I'm easy on the eyes but what gets it for ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! Don't make me say something like that! That's way to embarrassing!\u201d She laughed hiding her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled and nuzzled her face with his own, \u201cC'mon! Your embarrassed, I'm wearing a vest that was tight at least 90 pounds ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since its just you and me I guess I can tell you, Krystal laughed slyly  as fox lowered her face to face with him still carrying her in his embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've always had such a good looking face, but to be honest it was a bit...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit what?\u201d Fox laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirly!? C'mon Krystal, girly? Me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and gave his flabby cheek a pinch, his face was was fuller and more masculine melding with his layers of flesh upon his vanishing neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wasn't opposed to a romance with the dashing prettyboy, but after we left Starfox and you started bulking up I couldn't help but get attached to the handsome face of a well-fed gent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you did keep me well fed didn't you?\u201d Fox laughed as he layed back on the bed with Krystal sitting on his lap looking down on him while resting her arms on his porcine stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can't take all the credit, I mean the airline food helped too!\u201d She laughed drumming on his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sneaky little she-devil! It was on purpose all along!\u201d Fox howled laughing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no that was all you. I just helped you along a little is all.\u201d Krystal giggled giving the heavy flab a light pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was me who kicked it into overdrive huh?\u201d  He laughed as he relaxed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou combined two worlds honey, the soft inviting gentleman and the big strong soldier.\u201d  Krystal mused as she layed her head down on his plush chest, the soft supple breast muscle serving as an ample cushion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaww your making me blush Krystal and I got a lot of face now so that's a lot of my blood!\u201d Fox joked. \u201cSo if you would help your big ol' hubby rush his blood a little further south he would be pretty grateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that can be arranged...\u201d Krystal said as she deftly rolled atop her husband.<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox yawned as he lazily tromped into the kitchen the next morning, his heavy footfalls making a thumping noise with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG'morning Dad!\u201d Marcus smiled eating his cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grinned as he poured himself a cup of coffee and grabbed  a donut from a box of a dozen, - just something to tide himself over until he woke up enough to make a real meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Marcus,\u201d The heavyset vulpine said ruffling his young son's hair, after reaching for a second donut. \"What are we up too today?\" he smiled knowing Marcus's excited reply already.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It left him wondering how so much energy could be bundled up in such a small kit. Perhaps it was the cereal. Fox looked at his coffee then at the cereal thinking maybe he was waking up the wrong way. Then again it couldn't hurt to try both, it would help wash down the donuts for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks for reminding me, I almost forgot.\" Fox winked as he sat down at the table and kept at his box of donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked up at his dad and giggled. \"Good thing I remembered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.\" Said Fox as he munched away another doughnut. \"So any idea what we're going to do at the picnic?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's going to be lots of food, and you get to see my friend's dads, oh and games, like the wagon race!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wagon race?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm going to jump in a wagon and you pull me.

Fox had to appreciate the honesty of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point son, I'll pull you then.\" Fox smiled and looked down as his hands reached into an empty box of donuts. He blushed a little and moved the box aside. His stomach growled a little, still not quite full. He grabbed the box of sugary cereal and poured himself a bowl full. Fox glanced down at his wrist watch, the band snug against his thickening forearm.    His extra bit of breakfast fortunately wasn't going to stop him from getting out of the house in a timely manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly vulpine chugged the milk from his bowl and patted his stomach as he stood up from the table. Fox felt shocked that his stomach was still begging for more. It took serious restraint as he grabbed some food from the fridge they were asked to provide. He licked his lips, tempted to taste a little bit of potato salad. He seriously hoped there was a lot of food at the picnic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus followed close behind him holding his share of food as they piled into the car. Fox looked down his chest and saw his belly not even an inch away from brushing against the steering wheel. With a bit of a grunt he adjusted the seat back a little farther. He tilted his head a little and pushed the seat back as far as it would go. Last time he did this he was concerned about how big he was getting, now oddly enough he was gauging how big he had gotten since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact he was gauging for future gains. How big was big enough? The question filled his mind as he readjusted his seat to a comfortable distance and began pulling out of his driveway. Marcus bouncing with excitement in the back. Fox followed the routine directions to the school, his mind wandering back and forth between  the \"big\" questions. How big did Krystal want him to be? How big did he really want to be? How big would he let himself get? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions he'd have to answer a different time. Slowly he pulled up into the school parking lot, benches were set up with all sorts of dishes on them while various kids were bolting left and right. Their dads sitting at the side shooting the breeze. Fox parked his car and grabbed the food as Marcus bolted out to join his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath he carried the food.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm not really all too excited about buying exercise equipment for the sake of simple cargo work,\" Fox sighed.  \"And as much as I think Falco still wants to believe it, I'm not the swift young Arwing pilot I was years ago. I just want to be here with you, Krystal... helping take care of Marcus too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiled and hugged Fox.  \"So what are you going to do now?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose I'll take a week off.  After that incident at the airport, I think my superiors may agree with me.  But after that, I guess I'll just continue being a commercial pilot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal sighed.  Fox was right.  He was older, and getting involved with bounty hunting again wasn't something he could easily do.  And considering his overweight status, it wasn't something he could feasibly accomplish in a relatively short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't complain, though.  Krystal hugged Fox, one hand gingerly touching the seasoned pilot's protruding belly.  \"I'm absolutely fine with whatever you want, Fox,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal kissed.  Krystal preferred his decision anyway.  Fox would do much better being on the actual planet than having to go out and risk himself out in space.   And staying here flying commercial jets would contribute a lot to Fox's new physique, something Krystal had been positive about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, Fox only wanted to take care of his son and loving wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed.  Fox had finally gone back to flying jets after his week off.  He had gotten it with no objections; according to the higher-ups, they would have given it to him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a week of no action, Fox's weight went through another increase.  Fox had to once again go through a uniform change, his chubby belly getting too big to fit into what had only been snug a week ago.  Fox didn't complain.  Krystal's cooking was marvelous to say the least, and Fox knew that he'd never be drawn away from it no matter how large he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fox was now at the size where his belly smothered the wheel in front of him if he didn't recline.  He no longer did it for comfort, he did it for necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all of his weight was in his belly.  Fox's chair was getting a bit uncomfortable as well, thanks to his growing behind.  Fox was worried that the airline would have to install new seats to accommodate his new girth, until he was informed that the seats were interchangeable.  Fox now was able to sit comfortably for the first time in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis popularity rose as well, as more demand came for flights piloted by the ex-bounty hunter.  Fox received a promotion, and began flying private jets as well as commercial ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a week...\" sighed the fat pilot as he returned home.  He removed his uniform shirt and went to his bedroom, where Krystal was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home,\" she smiled.  Fox smiled back and climbed into bed.  Fox's face was a bit softer, the added weight in his face making his muzzle seem to protrude less.  His slow walk was now officially a waddle, and he was taking up a small bit more of the bed than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox slid off his pants, stripping down to his underwear, and hugged Krystal.  Krystal couldn't help but stroke Fox's larger belly, which had gotten softer and jigglier.  Krystal wrapped her arms around her husband, even though they didn't reach as far as before.  Krystal's arms met at her paws, and she could reach any farther than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, they were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Fox got a call from Falco.  He was checking again to see if Fox's decision about the cargo job was final, and Fox assured him it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just come for one job?  Everyone here at Star Falco wants to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox winced.  Star Falco was okay, but nowhere near as exciting as Star Fox had been.  \"Sorry, Falco,\" Fox sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco paused, and then said, \"I guess I'm sorry for bothering you, but at least can I come back for dinner at your place?  Your wife's cooking is superb... I've been eating quite a lot of different foods all around recently, but I must admit that there is nothing, and I mean nothing, like the food Krystal makes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox turned to Krystal, his belly swaying a bit from the quick turn.  \"Falco wants to com over again for dinner.  He apparently can't get enough of somebody's cooking,\" he winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll just keep coming back though, won't he?\" asked Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you teach him how to cook it,\" Fox suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal thought for a moment.  \"Alright, he can come,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Fox said, and he held the phone back up to his ear.  \"She says you can come, and she'll teach you how to cook food like her's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" said Falco.  \"I'll be there tomorrow night.  See you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.  Later.\"  Fox hung up and put the phone back in its cradle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Falco finally arrived.  He had arrived early to learn how to cook, and Krystal was eager to teach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about Falco had changed.  What was it?</span></div></div>",

Fox had doubted that Krystal would be able to teach Falco how to cook, but she had assured him that it would work out.  Still, he had his doubts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed as he nibbled on his donuts.  Originally they had just been a morning food, but lately, Fox had begun to devour them day-round, now averaging a few dozen a day.  Fox didn't pay attention to how much he was eating, but it sure seemed to be having an effect on his waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, don't eat so many donuts before dinner...\" Krystal sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox swallowed the rest of his donut.  \"Sorry, I guess I couldn't help myself...\" he said, slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the doorbell rang.  \"That should be Falco,\" Fox said, and he went to get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside stood Falco, wearing cargo pants and his knockoff Star Falco tee.  He was somewhat different from what he had looked like last time he was over; he now sported a small belly that poked out from his once lithe abdomen.  Although it still fit inside his shirt, it was certainly noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey, Falco,\" said Fox, who couldn't help but stare at Falco's new flab.  Falco didn't notice; he was too engrossed in the corn dog he was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Foxsh,\" said Falco.  \"May I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Fox said, snapping out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco finished his corn dog and stepped inside.  He headed over to the kitchen, and began talking to Krystal about the kinds of food he had been eating lately.  Fox slumped down on the couch and began to nod off when suddenly Marcus came up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Marcus?\"  mumbled Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the same guy who came to eat here with those other pilots that one day?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... His name is Falco.  Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... He's starting to look a bit like you.\"  Marcus pointed to Fox's large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled.  \"I suppose you're right.  It's because he's getting a ton of really good food to eat, just like your father is.\"  Fox patted his large belly, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was something else too...\" Marcus furrowed his brow, apparently trying to remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have to do with dinner?\" asked Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was it!\" Marcus smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your dad'll be right there,\" Fox said, and he leaned forward, his stomach pressing a bit into his legs as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the kitchen, Fox saw a lot of food prepared on the table.  Falco and Krystal were setting it, and most of the food seemed to be located where Falco was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you make so much?\" asked Fox, dumbfounded.  There was enough food on the table to feed three families, easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to make a lot to show him how to do all of it,\" Krystal said.  Falco finished setting the table and immediately sat down and began to devour his first heaping plate of spaghetti.  Fox watched as Falco ravenously wolfed down the food he had prepared for himself.  He ate so quickly, he looked to Fox like he was in a food eating competition or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal didn't say anything, and they both sat down, Marcus taking the seat next to Falco.  Fox was hungry too, and began with portions as large as Falco's, even though he didn't eat anywhere near Falco's rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Falco was pretty stuffed.  His belly had swollen up to the point of causing his shirt to ride halfway up his stomach.  Fox's belly was also larger, but his shirt was already ridden up before he had started eating; Krystal had been making him stick to wearing his same clothes instead of having to buy new sizes to accommodate his changes in growth.  As a result, most of his belly was usually naked, except when Fox was wearing his pilot uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious!\" exclaimed Falco as he put his hands on his belly.  \"Thanks for teaching me how to make this, Krystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp, it's getting late, so I guess I'll head home,\" said Falco, and he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around, Falco,\" said Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Falco replied.  And with that, he left out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal were tired, so they sent Marcus to bed and then went to bed themselves.  Krystal fell asleep before Fox did, hugging his stuffed belly and using it as a pillow.  Although it caught Fox off guard for a moment, he just shook his head and smiled.  He had to admit, he was liking his increased weight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning was a Sunday.  Krystal had left to take Marcus out with his friends from school, so Fox was alone.  Fox woke up some time later, to suddenly notice something Krystal had left on the nightstand...</span></div></div>",

With the current Star Fox team making a triumphant dash towards the ship's docking area to get into their arwings, you'd be forgiven for thinking all was business as usual for the space mercenaries as Falco Lombardi and Slippy Toad blast off into space... Only for Katt Monroe and Slippy's girlfriend Amanda to follow after them, both 'temporary' members of Star Fox while the team's real leader, and his girlfriend, deal with a rather <i>heavy</i> issue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BRRRRRUUUUUAAAAAAP!* Oh man, that was goooooood~\" Moaned Fox McCloud, patting an enormous furry gut that hung precariously low to the ground. Swiping a nearby juicy burger from the hoard of food surrounding his bed, the once mighty leader of Star Fox is now reduced to a quarter of a ton blob. He\u2019s  confined to the isolation of the medical bay, feeding himself silly as Krystal tries her best to figure out a solution to the mystery virus that got him in this state. \"Here blubberbutt, why don't you stuff your face with another one of my cakes~?\"coos  the blue vixen as she feeds the slothful fox a large piece of mud cake, blushing as he rips it to shred with his complete lack of eating etiquette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she\u2019s <i>sort of</i> trying to find a solution. Being even more obsessed with Fox in this state than usual is certainly isn't helping Krystal try and focus on getting to the bottom of whatever this virus Fox has recently contracted from an uncharted planet. It also didn't help there's little sense of urgency whatsoever- while not meaning to exaggerate Fox's serious yet probably not lethal predicament to her fellow pilots, by the time Fox had started piling on the pounds Krystal had made sure that  by no means whatsoever was anyone to even *think* about approaching the medical bay and disturbing the two until Fox was \u2018cured\u2019 from his mystery ailment, which to this day the rest of the team was still in the dark about. So Krystal is the only member of Star Fox to know that Fox is(and likely want to keep it that way) is an enormous fat ass, his appetite growing alongside how quickly his stomach stores any food he ate into fat. Yet it isn't like Fox likes talking much anymore, preferring Krystal to think for him usually while he sat back and had himself fed and attended to in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking a furry moob while Fox finished off his fifth entire cake for the day, Krystal suddenly notices a vial over on a working bench start to fizz and bubble up, one which she'd filled earlier with some of Fox's blood when she was less apathetic about Fox staying morbidly obese. Getting up and eyeing it, Krystal starts to think to herself, placing it into a high-tech purifying machine also. Ignoring for once her flabby boyfriend's pleas for some more kinky feeding time from his mate, Krystal procures two different liquids from the machine; one which was the blood from Fox she\u2019d first extracted via needle, the other a strange, slightly murky substance. Grinning, she places it into a sealed canister and waves it in front of Fox's fat case. \"Hey Foxie, I managed to isolate that virus of yours that made you quite the chubster! Just have to run a few more tests and I'll have a cure... Though...\" Thinking to herself, Krystal thinks about the amount of fun she could have with a substance that would turn anyone into another furry fatty like Fox... Or make Fox an even BIGGER lardball, since there was no telling how strong this stuff could get if she kept injecting him with it! \"Oooooh, that'd be <i>heaaaven</i>~\" Krystal sighs as she imagined a mountain sized Fox, though she soon snaps back to reality. \"Though Fox can't stay like this, even if he is a stud- who's going to protect the Lylat System? But then, I reeeeeeally want Fox to stay like this...\" \u201cKrrrrrystaaaaaal-*Mmmpth!*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving an entire pizza in Fox\u2019s moaning mouth almost by reflex, Krystal considers several different options, before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

He figured there was no way to break them off, so he moved on and did a quick check of the room, no clothes, no tools or anything to help him escape. The only thing he could do was head towards the door and hope that an exit was nearby. As much as he said it, he knew the chances of it being real were slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Door opened in front of him, and he stepped into the dark room, not knowing what to expect, and once he was inside the door slammed shut. Sealing him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonofabitch...\" Falco muttered under his breath. Then one by one the lights turned on. To Falco's amusement. The entire room was made of edible material. \"You have got to be kidding me...\" He complained. Looking at the back of the room, he saw the exit covered by at least two feet of sweets and candies, as well as sweet obstacles blocking his path to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\" Falco scoffed. \"You want me to eat my way over there.

I don't even like candy.</i><br>\r\nWith that he started eating. The first obstacle was pretty simple, just a net made out of various flavors of cotton candy. He got through that easily enough, a few tufts of cotton candy still stuck to his beak. He also noticed that the chocolate seemed to stop pumping once he started to eat. What started as a death trap became an ankle deep annoyance.<br>\r\nThe next obstacle was a bit more complicated. Just one long, blanket like, sheet of taffy suspended at perfect height for his mouth. No matter how much he ducked down, even when he tried crawling on his belly (all that managed to do was get his front half completely covered in chocolate). So he simply walked through while eating the taffy. It harder to eat than the cotton candy, but at least it didn't taste bad. <i>Now I feel like I should've tried candy before this, it's not that bad.</i> Falco thought to himself while chewing, or at least the closest you can get to it with a beak, the taffy. Eventually he was through.<br>\r\nThe penultimate obstacle was just a large pile of assorted sweets stacked in front of a door. \"What, did your budget run out or something?\" He asked. When no response came he just started eating, at firs taking one at a time but eventually started going for two or three. To get through it faster is what he told himself. He didn't realize he ate enough to get to the door so he actually ended up eating a few dozen extra pieces.<br>\r\nThe door itself was just a simple wooden door. The first problem came with trying to open it as his hands were still bound together. He tried to use his beak but found the knob came off the door. He dropped it on the ground before realizing that, of course, the door was edible. He started eating the door at first only going for the bottom half so he could just crawl through, but when he got to the last fifth of the door it went from chocolate to wood, meaning he was going to have to eat more than he planned. He cursed at his captor and then continued to eat the rest of the door, he never stopped to check if he had eaten enough to get through, almost as if he was compelled to eat the chocolate. Eventually he finished the door, blushing at his own act of gluttony he stepped through.<br>\r\nSurprisingly it wasn't an exit. The new room was a simple metallic gray with a black door, two mirrors and two rectangular LED screens attached to the wall above the mirrors. Falco didn't have time to be confused before a red number appeared on the LED above the left mirror. 138. \"One thirty eight...that's my weight.\" Falco said to no one in particular. The mirror below suddenly had an image on it, an image of Falco, still naked and looking the same as when he first woke up. Eventually curiosity got the best of him and he stepped in front of the right mirror, his reflection stepping into frame with him. He heard a beep and looked up to see a green number had appeared on this LED screen. It read 151. \"One hundred and fifty one...wait. Did I gain thirteen pounds from that?!\" He shouted suddenly looking at his two reflections more closely. While it wasn't immediately noticeable the right reflection had much less muscle definition then the left one.<br>\r\n\"Oh Falco, good to see you're listening to your dietician!\" The voice of Kat rang out inside of the room.<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and let me go, I did your dumb trial, I've reached a bigger potential as you put it!\" Falco responded angrily.<br>\r\nKat laughed in response. \"Oh honey, you haven't even started.\" She stated with a dreamy sigh. \"Now I have one question for you; Tits or Ass?\" She said completely seriously.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Was all Falco could reply.<br>\r\n\"Do you prefer a woman's top half or her bottom half?\" She stated more eloquently. <br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\"</span></div></div>",

Inside the room was a small wooden table and a few bigger tables with pastries stack on them, a robot, an insane amount of pastries and other baked goods, and an odd chair. He walked up to the chair and noticed while it still had four legs, two arms, and a back...it was incredibly wide, so wide two of him could fit comfortably on it.  The robot stirred to life. \"Please sit and I shall serve.\" It said.<br>\r\nFalco didn't see why not and sat down. Large metal clamps closed around his still chocolate covered ankles. \"Of course...\" Falco muttered to himself. Suddenly the robot wheeled over to Falco and cut the braces on his arms. \"Well at least I have these.\" He said, flexing his arms and clenching his fists.<br>\r\n\"You will eat what you are given.\" The robot said to him.

Falco could see where this was going. So he ate the eclairs. And then the cupcakes after that. And then the overly buttered biscuits after that. And then another cake after that, and they were still coming. A few things Falco didn't seem to notice were; one, he wasn't getting any fuller. Two, his lack of sweet tooth didn't seem to impair his consumption. And three, he didn't notice where all of those fat ridden sweets were ending up.<br>\r\nWhile Falco gorged he grew, but not in a normal way. While his face seemed fuller, his arms heavier and his gut rounder it was his lower half that was getting most of the attention. It started with his thighs, the once thin limbs soon bulked up causing Falco to absent mindedly spread them apart to get more comfortable. Following his thighs his ass seemed to grow wider. His once flat behind quickly becoming bubble like. His hips were also caught up in this, causing him to have quite the feminine figure.<br>\r\nFalco paid no mind to any of this, only to the food that was laid out in front of him. He sat there and ate for hours. Not realizing when his chin grew a double, or when he grew a small pair of moobs, or when his gut spilled over his lap, or when his thighs grew so wide they not only touched the arms but also squeezed against each other, or when his butt not only started to grow over the edges of the seat but also started to lift him higher, nor when his newly acquired hips started pressing against the arms of the chair with such force small cracks appeared in them. Eventually something was going to have to give.</span></div></div>",

They stopped and parked their ship near a resort and hotel known for being really accommodating. They whole team got three rooms. One was for Fox and Krystal, for obvious reasons, Slippy and Amanda, and lastly, the two single guys of the group, Falco and Peppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the avian aviator, it sucked being the only single guy besides the aged hare, even the needy toad got a girl with him. He sighs as he starts the first day of his lonely relaxation. He started by the pool in green swim trunks, showing off his toned and feathered frame to any takers. He was hoping to find girls coming to him, but ended up seeing some eye candy walking out of the pool. She looks like a voluptuous robin with nice curves to fit the black one piece swimsuit she had. Her red feathers caught eyes of the majority of the single guys around, including Falco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He tried to not look goofy as he struts over to the bird while she starts to relax under the twin suns that the resort orbits. \"Heya, miss. May I say, you look very nice and I just wanted to make sure-\" he was interrupted before he could finish with an abrupt, \"no\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No? I... I barely said anything.\" He starts to get nervous as she retorts. \"I'm not into guys like you, thinking a nice body is all you need. I like bigger men anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Bigger?\" His nervousness turns into confusion. \"Yup... Get some meat on those chicken bones and I might give you my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Falco was desperate. This was the most decent girl he has seen so far. He thought as he walked inside the resort, passing a restaurant on the way to his room. This got him thinking as he gets back to his room with Peppy snoozing on the bed beside Falco. He changed clothes, but looked at himself in the mirror before putting a shirt on. He saw his physique and pictured himself tubbier, then chubbier, then enough the bend the cockpit of his arwing outward. He did however have the robin leaning against him in this image. He smiles before heading out fully clothed.</span></div></div>",

However, he insisted that they go all the same, so at 5:00 sharp, they had shown up at the door and taken their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now 9:00 in the evening, and despite what Krystal said about her small appetite, she had not stopped eating since she had arrived. She had so far taken 40th helpings of everything she could heap onto her plate, probably had MILLIONS of calories, had already added a good 100 lbs of chub onto her figure (though she hadn't noticed yet) and it didn't look like she was going to slow down anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled and said \"No problem Krystal.

I've been eating awhile now, but you were barely able to finish your second serving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no, I'm fine Krystal, honest! As long as you're happy, I'm happy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't me wrong Fox, I AM happy. I'm enjoying myself immensely eating all these wonderful morsels, and would happy to be continue on doing this.

If you don't feel hungry anymore, maybe we should just go....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox started sweating profusely at these words.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fox feared getting caught but not as much as he feared Rejection, but If we would've taken the stimulant himself, he worried that if he wwere to get to fat for an Arwing then how would he be able to make ends meet if he and Krystal were to start a family?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox Loves Krystal and that's what he wanted to do with her more thing else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox began to remember what his dad Taught Him before he died, \"Remember, the only way to deal with your fears is to face them. Now this may sound extremely corny but, no matter what you get yourself into... Love Conquers ALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox then decided that it was now time to be a man now more then ever... he looked up and saw that Krystal had gone back to eating her fill, she was currently finishing up what looked like a ordinary piece of steak, but something wasn't quite right... the plate was awefully large for and ordinary steak let alone a very small one with no bones. Krystal then popped it into her mouth and ate it up with great speed, she then turned her head over to the nearest waiter, put her hand to her mouth as if she were drinking from a big glass... and yet she was holding nothing; \"Waiter! I'm still hungry over here... I'd Like another one.\" Fox then began to wonder, \"Another what how long was I spaced out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter then ran for the kitchen very fast for no apparent reason... Fox made his move while her many plates were all empty, \"Krystal...\" Krystal then began to look at Fox but before she could say anything Fox made his move, \"You know how much I Love you right?\" This made them both blush, Krystal then reached her hand out to Fox and he closed his eyes and gave it a kiss. A classic gentleman guesture. This made Krystal giggle, \"Krystal, I have something to tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then looked a little worried and asked, \"Is this about our wedding?\" Fox's went down and he made a hesitant answer, \"Well sort of...\" Fox struggled to continue. \"I would do almost anything to make you happy...\" Fox then genltly grabbed both her hands with his and lifted them up \"I just want to know if you are willing to do the same for me...\" Krystal made her awnser in no time,\"Of course I am Fox!\" she whispered back to him. Fox nervously gulped as he made his finishing move, \"In that case, Krystal I...  it would mean a lot to me if you get very fat for me.\" Krystal's facial expression did not change, Fox then began to explain his motives, \"It's just that before I met you I was looking for the fattest woman I could find because I was just so very lonely... IKrystal put the index finger of one of her hands on his mouth and whispered to him, \u201cSave it\u2026 I love you so much Fox\u2026\u201d She began to shed a tear and she talked; \u201cI don\u2019t care about my figure or what anyone else may think\u2026 if it makes you happy Fox I will pack on a lot of weight for you\u2026\u201d Fox was blushing so much that the lower half his face was bright red and he could hardly believe his ears. \u201cI knew something was up when I began to feel so much hungrier than I ever was in my entire life\u2026 after you gave me that drink. You have no idea how happy I am that you told me the truth. It makes me want you even more\u2026\u201d Krystal then closed her eyes and gave Fox a big Kiss mouth to mouth and she was done they began to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came over and it was now abundantly clear to Fox as to what Krystal Had been eating before waiter put down Krystal\u2019s order he had 3 other waiters remove the empty dishes that Krystal had quite literally ate clean\u2026 Fox\u2019s Jaw dropped and so did his ears when he saw what it was, a gargantuan cheeseburger complete with no vegetables and every meat topping known to chefs and the burger itself was the size of a medium pizza and as thick as a birthday cake. \u201cNever seen anyone eat it all before let alone ask for seconds\u2026\u201d the waiter stammered in equal disbelief as Fox was, \u201cI\u2019ll take it to go\u2026\u201d Krystal mentioned. \u201cGood thinking miss any more and you are bound to explode,\u201d This only made Krystal giggle as she unfastened her belt and her belly surged out a full foot enough to begin to push the table into Fox only enough to make to snap him back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on their way home Krystal was originally 145 pounds and was now on the verge of 250\u2026 She and Fox were Snuggling on the back seat of the space Limo, Krystal then whispered into Fox\u2019s ear in a romantic mood, \u201cJust don\u2019t go crazy on fattening me up I do want to be able to fit down the aisle after all. After that I\u2019ll become the fattest woman in the universe just for you.\u201d This made Fox\u2019s nose bleed and faint from arousal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH FORWARD TO THE DAY OF THE WEDDING\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I always thought of it as a planet sized swimming pool when I was a pup.\" He turned to Krystal who was rubbing her giant Buda belly as if she were expecting. Her chipmunk cheeks and triple chin made her look even cuter than ever to Fox. \"I've heard the seafood there can be both fattening and healthy at the same time if you want it to.\" Krystal told him she then leaned back in the sofa, closed her eyes and opened her mouth, Fox then just smiled and fed her a foot long hotdog. \"That makes the 5th one before we even get there.\" He teased her as he patted her belly making it jiggle like it was the surface of a pond. (Or an ocean Aquas doesn't have any oceans it's just 1 big one with no more than 300 islands and only 20 of those are large enough to support small cities the largest island Dreylex, {about the same size as earth's Cuba} was also the planet's capital city. Population 4.4 million + a random number of Visitors, 2 of which are now Fox and Krystal)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal had fallen asleep, (it's a 16 hour flight based on a slowly decaying orbit meant to maximize the tourism effect)  Fox was using her giant basketball breasts as a pillow, while her belly wasn't big enough yet to use as a mattress fox certainly tried. He was having wonderful dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's newfound girth made her as big as one of Aquan Whales. Her Belly could alone would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool to the brim. She wearing a red bikini and breaching out of the water the way that a whale would. (Breaching: that's when whales jump out of the water with most of their bodies in the air.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was wearing a green swimsuit and was simply enjoying the ride as he was safe inside her cleavage with only his head and arms sticking out just to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox then felt water on his face and woke up to find that it was Krystal who was holding up his head and licking his face. (What? They are fox's not all that different from dogs ok?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" She teased him. There was then a voice over the ship's intercom system it had the typical male plane captain voice, \"Welcome to Dreylex.\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fox, Krystal, and the other tourists walk off the spaceship, everyone went on their separate ways, Fox and Krystal were greeted in the parking lot (think of this place operating the same exact way as an airport.) by a frog wearing a suit and sunglasses and holding a sign that read \"Welcome to the newlyweds Mr. &amp; Mrs McCloud.\" even thought it was raining pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Fox thought that it was Slippy until he realized the frog was too tall and thin to be him and it also had bluer skin tone. The frog was the driver to a hover transport (Taxi), Fox and Krystal got in the back seat and despite the fact that Krystal now weighted at least 610 pounds the transport was able to take off as if she weighed what she was before her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox asked, \"I wasn't planning on rain. How long will this last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Frog didn't even bother to take off his sunglasses,,, strange. \"This Is Dreylex, the longest we can go without rain is 3 days. Some storms like this can even last as long as 3 weeks. Only on Aquas would this be considered normal.\" he dispensed this information with a surprising lack of emotion in a deep monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then asked Fox, \"Where is our hotel again?\" Fox then realized to his horror that he has been so busy feeding and loving his wife that he forgot to book a hotel and only did so for the flight. For about 90 seconds he was unable to answer. Krystal was about to ask fox again with a great deal of concern, when the blue frog interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need a place to stay I can recommend 2 destinations that don't need prior arrangement... don't worry they're not filthy dumps, Aquas has no slums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his reassuring words, his voice still had the same emotionless tone. This made Fox slightly more suspicious, \"I can take you to the beach side resort down town, of course I don't know if you will be able to enjoy the place in this weather. Or I can take you the marina and plot a course to our closest underwater city Torfan, it'll let you escape the our adverse weather, but with a population of about 600,000 not including tourists some people find the place a bit too crowded, that and they don't get to see the sun as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox felt he didn't have much choice in the matter so he chose the...</span></div></div>",

After Fox told the driver of his decision, Krystal asked Fox, \"Honey, do you think there would be enough room for me down there?\" she asked as she was rubbing her exposed belly in circular motion with the hand that she didn't have on Fox's upper back. Remembering the dream he had on the flight to Aquas Fox told Krystal, \"Well there is bound to be plenty of room in the ocean after all my wife is a whale now.\" He stated this in joking tone as he gently patted her giant belly that was enough the make it jiggle, \"Oh! Stop you!\" Krystal then giggled as she grabbed her belly with both hands and made it jiggle up and down. This made Fox blush he then closed his eyes and gave it a kiss Krystal then whispered into his ear, \"Besides you haven't even seen how big it can get yet! I'm practically a lightweight!\" Fox looked up at her with a gentle smile, \"You call a 610pound woman a lightweight?\" he asked Krystal then put both her hands on the cheeks of his face. \"Let's see if you can get me up to 800pounds before the honey moon is over.\" She whispered seductively and then the 2 of them closed their eyes and enjoyed a kiss as big Krystal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the blue frog driver pulled out a cell phone and spoke into it \"They're going to Torfan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would've taken them about 3 minutes to get to the marina, but because Krystal insisted on stopping for now fewer than 5 fast food drive-through trips it took 65. She wanted to eat as much as she could before they went to the bottom of the ocean fearing that the food down there would be a bit worse in quality then the food on the surface, She got the largest thing on the menus and super sized all of them. A Quadruple Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and Lemonade, An extra large deep dish pizza with bacon, pepperoni, hamburger and extra cheese with breadsticks and a glass of whole milk, A 30 Piece Bucket of Boneless fried chicken with mashed potatoes &amp; gravy and a glass of whole milk. Fish and chips with Fish that was big enough to come off a shark with as many chips (French fries) to coat them and tea. And finally a Foot long hotdog with hash browns and apple juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this made Krystal Gain another 10 pounds, her weight was now 620 Pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got off the hover car and boarded the submarine. They were able to arrive to Torfan without incident it had the appearance of a beehive yet it was made of a metal that would not corrode in seawater nor would any coral or barnacles build up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atrium of the station was beautiful it had the appearance of one found on a luxury liner, Fox then decided what to do next, He spend so much time rubbing Krystal's belly during her binge that he forgot to get food for himself but it was nearing the end of the day and he was kind of tired. What now?</span></div></div>",

She wondered how long it would be before the plasma screen ruptured and numbers flood the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox watched over her shoulder, twiddling his fingers and thumbs. He coughed into the crook of his elbow to avert his gaze. The soft fur on the nape of his neck stood on edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, we need to take a step back here, love,\" Krystal massaged her temples, \"when you tell a woman you want to ask her a 'special question,' she thinks of something other than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox whined at the back of his throat in that way canines do, his ears flattened. \"I was getting to that part.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you? You've only sat here throwing outrageous numbers at me for,\" Krystal glanced at the corner of the monitor and read the time to herself, \"hours now, God above.\" She threw her arms over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox pulled up a seat and dropped into it. It creaked beneath his weight. The vulpine mumbled a sigh and his lips flapped. He stared at her with moist eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten million pounds,\" Krystal shook her head, her ears swiveled with the motion, \"do you even know what that number means?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean, I was thinking in fantastical ball park figures, y'know, like planet sized, maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal blinked twice at the vulpine. Her fingers twitched. \"First off, do you know much planets weigh? And second, how is that even going to mechanically work?\" Krystal stifled laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played out the wedding ceremony in her head. 'Here is the bride, we're standing on her side.' Everyone seated on the blubbery mass of her torso, the chairs lopsided on the cellulite surface. Their faces adorned with Plasticine pleasantries that pulled out of shape every teeth peeling second. No one can speak over her beleaguered breathing, no doubt assisted by a large oxygen tank apparatus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, Fox McCloud, take the latest addition to the Lylat System to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for heavy and heavier, til death do you part.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shook the image from her mind and bit back more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox glared at her but melted in the overpowering presence of her amused stare. Finally he mustered the courage to speak. \"Well, if you're so smart, how much does a planet weigh then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ten million pounds, I guarantee you,\" Krystal twisted in her chair and faced the computer monitor. She clicked a new tab, gleefully abandoning the string of numbers and searched the internet for an answer. \"Ah, a cargo ship weighs five-thousand tons give or take. So would you settle for a wife with the surface area of a small island instead,\" Krystal cooed at Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop making fun of me now.\" Fox folded his arms. \"This is why I never told anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal chuckled, her voice clinked like ice in glass of cola. She grabbed Fox by the hips and nestled him closer to her. Her muzzle brushed against his. She felt his spine twitch at her touch. \"Well, I don't find the idea of being your own personal island one hundred percent appalling, if that makes you feel any better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's breathing quickened. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I do,\" she trailed her finger down his chest, her fingers curled the tuft of fur poking over the collar of his shirt, \"just promise me one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.\" Fox gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more hitting me over the head with meaningless numbers, please,\" Krystal hooked her thumb and pointed at the computer monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hon,\" Fox slouched, \"they're fun to think about. Can you imagine what you'd look like if your scale read off that many zeros?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tapped his cheek, \"it's much more fun to actually <i>do</i> something I think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Fox sighed. \"I mean, doing things takes forever though, and it's not easy.\" He stroked the soft curve of her stomach. The beginnings of a belly brought on by the lax life of Cornerian living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's something we can do to alleviate the wait.\" Krystal bit her bottom lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights flickered on, the gentle hum of the Great Fox tickled her ears. Four reclining seats outfitted with arrays of machinery awaited Fox and Krystal. The blue vixen ran her fingers along the plush upholstery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox parked himself at his own seat. \"I dunno, this stuff only has combat protocols programmed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've obviously never tried debug mode..\" Krystal eased into a seat. \"Now get set up, this is going to take a minute.\" The cushions sighed. She tapped a button on the arm console and a chromium visor covered her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was dark for a short second while the display calibrated. Pirouetting patterns of lights flashed her eyes, registering the movement of her irises. A digital white expanse flickered into existence. She felt dizzy. Her head and body attempted to adjust the conflicting motion and non-motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"User Krystal, welcome,\" red text floated,  \"initiate VR training?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for the arm console and punched in a series of commands. Like Slippy showed her. The VR training prompt disappeared and the white expanse disappeared. A wireframe landscape flashed in its place. Thin green lines that stretched for miles. The red text returned. \"initiate debug mode?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal indicated 'yes' on the console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lay your arms in the designated areas and remain still.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her breath. Machines whirred to life outside the VR visor. She clenched her toes. A sharp pain shot up her arm and vanished in that exact instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal blinked until her focus returned. She stepped forward. The test wireframe surface tingled at her feet. \"Good, good,\" she held her hand out an interface appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'User FoxMccloud, pending.' Kyrstal tapped his name. A gust of virtual wind rushed her fur.. The wireframe lines quivered like guitar strings. A blinding flash erupted in the distance. Fox staggered forward from the light. He fought to catch his balance and took a knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little different than I'm used to.\" Fox panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not even at the good part yet.\" Krystal winked. A pastel blue skyline warmed into existence. Sunlight stained the horizon pink. A gust of salty seaward wind tousled her fur. Her feet sunk and sand eased between her toes. Waves rolled, foam hissed and the simulated water crashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox stared at Krystal. \"Did...did you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat trick huh?\" Krystal took his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you, uh,\" Fox rubbed the back of his neck, \"show me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to show, it's all in your head.\" Krystal tapped his temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox licked his lips and nodded. \"Okay, okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small building rose from the sand. Its textures loaded in: weather worn wood repainted white. A neon sign in the shape of a dolphin flashed. Fox took Krystal by the hand and dragged her to a table for two. Grilled stacks of salmon slathered in succulent butter sauce awaited her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, eat.' Fox smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sliced the stack with a fork and popped it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavor exploded on her taste buds. Saliva dribbled down her cheek. She couldn't eat the stack fast enough.  Krystal hummed through her mouthful of hot food. A tall milkshake glass rose from the table. A plump cherry tapped a whipped cream mountain. The chocolate mixture of icecream and cookie chunks called her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal wrapped her lips around the straw and washed down the salmon. She met Fox's eyes. His were sultry, the lower lid puckered in concentration. He adjusted his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's cheeks felt hot. His intense stare told her all she needed to know. Her cheeks warmed further with each gulp of shake. A tingling sensation engulfed her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck bulged outward. Suddenly her virtual clothing pulled tight on her arms. Gelatin biceps swelled up, tearing the sleeves open. Her chest quivered and pounds flooded her pert breasts. Each second passed and they sagged lower and lower. Her chest burst the shirt. She inspected her fingers and watched them develop little potbellies of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled and a peculiar sensation spread from her bellybutton outward. She imagined dough rising in the oven. The round bulge of her gut blocked the waist of her pants. Her sausage fingers scooped her belly in a futile attempt to reach the button on her pants. The metal blockage pinched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, my pants...it hurts...\" Krystal gasped. Her hips spilled out of the waistband. The seams on the inner thigh stretched open. Her stomach surged further outward, the force blasted the button open.. Her gut spilled into her lap. The remains of her pants flaked away. An ominous creaking sound meant her relief was short lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips pressed against the chair's armrests. Wood cracked, virtual splinters flicked into the sand. Krystal tried to stand from the doomed seat, but the sudden exertion only sealed its fate. The wooden legs caved on themselves and her rotund mass squashed the chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox stepped around the table and gingerly stroked her gut. It gargled at his touch. His chest heaved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like all this?\" Krystal scooped her belly and shook it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a freak.\" Krystal smirked. \"But then, I think I like it too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debris faded. Fox and Krystal sat on the beachhead. Her ponderous rear end packed the sand tight. The tide splashed in and tickled her pudgy toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little imagination does wonders.\" Krystal's paunchy cheeks bunched up as she faced him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox pinched her love handle, a hunger flashed in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's source was unmistakable to those who were familiar with the McCloud household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox please! I can't eat another bite!\" Krystal held onto her belly which was now stuffed to the brim after her usual lunch. Which by the standards of everyone else would normally be considered a feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Honey. I still have some Muffins for dessert, and they're your favorite kind. Chocolate chip.\" Fox gave her the usual sad puppy dog eye treatment. No matter how much food she packed inside her belly, he always wants her to keep eating even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, as much as I love you, I... MPH!!!\" A muffin had been stuffed into her open maw while she spoke. But Krystal Just took it out with her hand. \"Fox! That's MPH!!\" But Fox merely stuffed another muffin into her mouth. She removed that one with her other hand. \"Fox! Seriously I'm FUMMMM!!!!\" He stuffed a 3rd muffin into her mouth one that Krystal couldn't remove with her hands being full. She had no choice but to eat it. Thankfully the 3 muffins she was carrying were the only ones. She ate the muffin in her mouth but merely put the other 2 onto a plate. She then gave Fox a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nervously chuckled and responded to that look with, \"Sorry Hon... you know I can't resist the temptation to feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal sighed and placed her hand on his chin. \"I know, but please, the least you could do is give me some time to digest all this before dinner.\" As much as Krystal disliked Fox's occasional incidents where he would force feed her like this; she wouldn't trade the life she now has with him for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" He then gives her a brief kiss. \"Just finish those muffins for me. Krystal slowly did so, when she finished them, she reclined back in her chair and slipped into another food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has now been about 11 months since they became husband and wife. In those 11 months, Krystal had gained a considerable amount of weight. To be frank, her weight gain had started long before the wedding. About 3 months after the Anglar fiasco, Fox began to fear loosing her so he confessed his feelings for her in private. Krystal could still remember the overwhelming joy on his face when she told him that she felt the same way. She had regarded fox as handsome &amp; brave, when she first met him on Sauria, and joined the Star Fox crew because she found the prospect of space travel exciting. Over the next 4 years during their various adventures Krystal found that she was paying closer attention to Fox than the rest of the team, and not just because he was the leader, for she did so even outside mission debriefings, and that she also felt happy whenever she and Fox went on duo missions together, it didn't take Krystal long to realize that she was falling in love with Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Aparoid invasion hit Sauria and Prince Tricky made his Honeymoon suggestion to Fox &amp; Krystal she laughed at Fox's reaction she knew he felt the same way. Which is why it didn't shock her when he finally told her; and of course when the time came they actually did take up Tricky's offer and had their Honeymoon on Sauria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conclusion of the Anglar war had resulted in an unusually long period of peace in the Lylat System, it was at this moment Fox took the opportunity to retire and start a family. For there were now plenty of pilots out there that could easily take his place. Fox even landed a job as a flight instructor at the Cornerian Academy. Such a high paying salary on top of the fortune that fox was able to earn over the years had allowed the 2 of them to live the good life... and allowed Fox to spend as much money as he could on food for Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had admitted his fondness for larger women to Krystal on their 5th date, when she began to mind how he would always encourage her to eat her fill and then some, often egging her on to get 2nd helping even though she was stuffed. How he always agreed to the offer for dessert, yet only wanted Krystal to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was of coarse alarmed at the revelation. But accepted his offer to fatten her up when she pondered everything she could loose if she rejected him for what would be a deal breaker to most women. Having finally found the perfect guy, she no longer needed to watch her weight or maintain her figure anyway. Ironic considering she would frequently do all the deeds attributed to staying slim such as dieting and exercise to maintain what she thought he would find beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight when she met Fox was around 180 pounds at 6 feet tall and 22 years old, her figure was normal. Now at age 27 after a slightly more sedentarty lifestyle on board the Great Fox, the numerous dinner dates before they were married, and 11 months since the wedding her weight had ballooned up to 300 pounds. The weight gain had of coarse been slowed down during her stay on the Great Fox and her efforts to stay slim combined with all the adventures they had in those 4 years, while accelerating significantly following Fox's retirement from mercenary work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir house is a custom made Mansion in a small neighborhood high up in the mountains over looking the Academy. Thankfully for the sake of peace and quiet, it was on the apposite side of where the Arwings would be flying. And the only ships that delivery drones, an ambulance if needed, and the ships that belong to residents as they come and go on their daily routine. The walls were sound proofed to minimize noise from the outside so that Fox &amp; Krystal could sleep comfortably, especially when Fox used Krystal's belly as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal deeply enjoyed the food play sessions they would have. She loved being fed by him, but it wasn't exactly comfortable for her when Fox went overboard like this. She loved the feeling of being full, and the idea of growing fatter. But hated the feeling of being so full that she was about to explode. Fox's enthusiasm was more difficult to handle than the food, as Krystal grew so did the sizes of her meals, her stomach muscles had a hard time adjusting their length to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Krystal lapsed out of her food coma, she found herself lying down on the couch, and Fox using her belly as a pillow again while gently wagging his tail. She decided that now would be the best time to tackle the issue of what happens when she's too full to eat further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently woke Fox up by licking his face and telling him that she wanted to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Times had changed in Lylat. Peace, it seemed, had returned to the system and happiness and prosperity seemed to rain from the heavens. However, luck was not so kind to the Star Wolf Team. The Cornerian army had recently put an enormous bounty on all citizens of Lylat who were deemed \u201ca threat.\u201d Mainly, any of Andross\u2019s accomplices or sympathizers were being rounded up. Wolf and his crew had managed to evade capture for some time now, but Wolf felt it be better if the team split up. Reckoning that if they would be harder to capture if they weren\u2019t all in the same place. The team agreed to stay in some form of contact and with that they split up into the different corners of the Lylat System. Wolf had no idea where any of his teammates were, and only a vague idea of where he was. He looked up from his dirty mug of lukewarm beer to view the interior dingy bar where he currently sat. The room smelled of beer and bad burgers. He looked back down at his mug and sighed. He was a bit of a mess of late. He had sold almost all of possessions. Seemingly, his bounty rose as quickly as his funds fell. He only traveled with what he could carry, mainly the clothes on his back, his eye-patch, some money, and his Wolfen. His grey fur was matted and dirtied in some places. He hadn\u2019t stayed in a clean place in several days. His white t-shirt sat lazily half tucked in, half not in his tan pants and a black leather jacket was slung crookedly over his broad shouldered frame. Wolf was relatively relieved that his body hadn\u2019t gone the way of his luck. He was still in relatively good shape. Before he and the rest of Star Wolf were forced to separate he stood at about 195lbs of almost pure muscle; standing 6ft tall. However, months had passed and his lifestyle had deteriorated to what would be considered \u2018less than desirable.\u2019 His weight had ballooned slightly to 205lbs, none of it muscle by the way, creating a miniscule paunch barely able to rest on his pants and not really visible to the public through his clothing. Needless to say, Wolf really hadn\u2019t noticed. Instead he was focusing on the little bit of luck he did manage to acquire. Today he had managed to rent a hovel of a motel room for the night, with a shower and running water. First luck he\u2019s had in some time.  He took another swig from his glass. \u201cThis beer is terrible,\u201d he muttered to himself downing his second brew of the night. He sat at the bar alone tonight, well so he thought. It was then he caught a vixen approach him from the corner of his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, you!\u201d She said softly, taking a seat next to Wolf. \u201cYou here by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\nWolf turned to face the woman and was taken aback. She was beautiful, and made only more gorgeous by the crumminess of her surroundings. Wolf was speechless. \u201cWhat, are you just going to stare?\u201d She said, egging him on. Wolf looked back at his glass. He had refrained from communicating who didn\u2019t employ his or was part of Star Wolf for the fear that they were after his bounty. He looked back at the vixen believing that she couldn\u2019t be after him, she was too beautiful. \u201cHello yourself.\u201d He replied is a very becoming fashion. <br>\r\nShe chucked a bit to herself \u201cmy, aren\u2019t we flattering. My name is Fey. Yours?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrevor Michelson\u201d Wolf responded quickly as his old name put him in danger of arrest. After this the two immediately broke off into conversation. A smile returned to Wolf\u2019s face for the first time in ages as they continued to talk into the night. However without Wolf noticing she had managed to get him to drink about 3 more beers during their lengthy conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how would you like to head up to my room? I\u2019ve got myself one of the nicest rooms in this place.\u201d Without a second thought to who this vixen was or what she wanted, she managed to seduce him up to her room. Upon arrival\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The room was reminiscent of a place that was quarantined as not a speck of dust was to be seen nor a decoration out of place.  However before Wolf had time to comment on the state of cleanliness he heard Fey speak behind him. \u201cGot him.\u201d He quickly turned around almost losing balance (he was pretty hammered after all). \u201cGive up Wolf, your too drunk to even remember your name.\u201d Wolf swayed on the spot while she pointed the strange weapon at him. \u201cNight,\u201d she stated calmly firing at him right between the eyes.

Anyway, seeing as you picked that choice, we\u2019re going to have to set up some guidelines for your Detainment Program. You will have to gain at a minimum, 10lbs per week, however if you feel like going over that\u2019s fine with us.\u201d She said with a slight chuckle. \u201cWell we have to hook you up to one of these devices, \u201cShe calmly states moving the anklet type device in front of Wolf\u2019s face. \u201cThis,\u201d she shook it for emphasis, \u201cWill remain on your body at all times. It monitors you weight, and don\u2019t even try taking it off. It detects if it\u2019s off your body and alerts us to come and scoop you up. If that happens\u2026I really don\u2019t know or care what they do to you.\u201d She than clamped the device on to Wolf\u2019s ankle and began looking at a PDA type device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026so you currently weigh about 205lbs and by the end of your punishment you should be pushing about 550. Oh and like I said before, don\u2019t even try taking it off now\u2026it\u2019s calibrated to your weight so unless you can find someone who weighs exactly the same as you, it\u2019s stuck. Even then, we\u2019ll be alerted and scoop you up regardless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf was still confused, \u201cI can barely afford gas for my jet! How do you expect me to feed myself that much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, silly me I almost forgot. Here,\u201d she tossed a card at Wolf landing directly in front of where he lay, \u201cThis is a card that is given to you by the Lylat Penitentiary Group and can only be used to purchase food. It won\u2019t work on anything else so don\u2019t get any ideas, besides, this card is cheaper than keeping scum like you in prison.\u201d Wolf didn\u2019t know how to respond, this was the most bizarre punishment he\u2019d ever received. Fey then moved closer to Wolf and pat him on his stomach, \u201cEnjoy skinny.\u201d She than began to laugh. Her gun was lifted at his head and she fired. Wolf went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, whuh\u2026\u201d Wolf woke up dazed and confused on the floor. The ropes that bound him lay discarded besides him. Quickly he rolled up his pants leg and saw the anklet. On it, it displayed a message, \u201cWeek one, Starting weight 205, Ending Weight 215.\u201d Wolf couldn\u2019t believe this was actually happening. He then began to wonder if he could even put on 10lbs per week without eating himself sick or hurting himself. He stood up and rubbed his head. He decided\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright,\u201d he mumbled to himself, \u201cLet's get started.\u201d He had to gain 10 pounds over the next 7 days or else he would be thrown into a cell which he would never leave again. He righted himself, rubbing his forehead (he was slightly hung-over from last night) and lifted his shirt and looked at his stomach. What was once flat and muscular now could barely be considered toned and a small layer of fat had settled near his waist. He rolled his eyes and headed out of the room where Fey had given wolf his ankle scale and trudged downstairs. However, upon exiting the room he noticed that he was no longer in the same grody bar/inn and was instead in a cozy, lavishly decorated hotel. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d He thought and he hurried back into the room. This wasn\u2019t where he was last night. Wolf\u2019s dirty and unkempt appearance stuck out like a sore thumb in this setting. This is when he noticed a pile of clothing on the dark wooden table in his room with a note on top. He quickly grabbed it and read. <br>\r\n\u201cDear Trevor Michelson (his new alibi he assumed), <br>\r\nWelcome to you new life, and your new home. This hotel is owned by the Lylat Penitentiary Group and this room will serve as your living quarters. However you\u2019re welcome to leave if you choose, but you\u2019re too poor to afford anything else so we recommend you stay put. Anyway, Fey already briefed you on your punishment and meal card so this letter will not explain it again. You will see a stack of clothing under the letter, these will take care of you as your girth increases, again you can buy your own but were offering this for free out of the kindness of our hearts (to this wolf almost burst out laughing). Furthermore and most important, besides your gain, is blend in. That means stay clean and do not disrupt the other customers in this hotel. If we detect any disturbances you will be scooped up and never heard from again. If you have any questions call us at the attached number. Good luck for your sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf then saw the room key resting next to the note and stuffed it into his pocket after he changed into the smallest size they was left on the table. Which, needless to say, was a size to large but not ridiculously so. He proceeded to walk out of the room and into the lobby where he was immediately met by the eager staff of the hotel. <br>\r\n\u201cMr. Michelson?\u201d A badger dressed in the typical hotel garb questioned, which wolf responded to with a nod, \u201cAh, good, let us escort you to your table.\u201d Wolf was taken a bit aback by the sudden gesture and was whisked off to a table in the middle of a bountiful breakfast buffet. He sat down. \u201cI will return shortly for anything you may need Mr. Michelson, please enjoy the buffet sir.\u201d To which the badger quickly disappeared. Wolf sat quiet and still as he was in deep thought. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over the following hour, he would proceed to fill himself with twice that amount, though it was quite unpleasant.

It puffed out a small amount, though none really noticeable for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed and in pain, Wolf clambered back to his hotel room, lying down on the bed, taking off his shirt and massaging his sore belly. \"I need to find a better way to get this food down, I can't stuff myself like this!\" he thought. He turned on the morning news. Nothing important happening. He flipped through the channels, finally stopping on a travel show detailing popular local restaurants.

However, unlike Wolf, he looked as if he had been here for a while. The other wolf looked about 40 to 50 pounds heavier than himself and was apparently in denial about his recent gain as his clothes were about a size too tight. At the moment the wolf was tucking into a huge breakfast of steak, bacon, sausages and pancakes (Wolf actually was nauseous watching the other wolf eat all that food). The wolf\u2019s clothes were too small and some of his furry stomach could be seen resting on top of the waistband of his shorts. But none of this mattered to Wolf because he had a plan. All he had to do was put on enough weight to equal that of the other wolf and just slip his ankle weight onto him and gaining 50 pounds was much less than the 350 he was supposed to. <br>\r\nWolf leaned back in his chair and began to chuckle to himself about the brilliance of his plan. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His face had gone soft, no longer \"seductive and attractive\" as Panther once described it himself; now it merely seemed \"cute and nonthreatening.\" His chin appeared to have grown a twin and what looks like a smaller triplet. His chest was huge, in all honesty he cod give Krystal a run for her money, they were overshadowed; however, by his gut. It pushed itself into the skin tight orange jump suit, to the point where it was molded around his several love handles. His now meaty arms stuck out at odd angles due to these, his sasuage like fingers now floating away from himself rather than resting in his hips. And what hips they were; while calling him pear shaped would be too much all that fat seemed to be equally spread out.

Those are Mandatory.\" Wolf looked at him with an irritated glance. \"I'm not kidding!\" Plague continued, pointing to a canister on every Robots back. \"If you don't take the pill willingly. They'll force it down ya, and that liquid they have there...\"  He Points to a random pudgy inmate. \"That guy had the same attitude as you did yesterday, and he was as thin as you too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf scanned the area. Those Robots didn't seem like they'd be any problem for him at all. He's faced worst, but was it really worth risking his looks?</span></div></div>",

He continued to eat and converse with Plague and Carrion. \"So how long have you two been in here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Three weeks.\" Carrion replied, at the same time Plague said two. The two seeme to scramble a bit before deciding on two and a half weeks.<br>\r\n\"So were you two skinny when you were firstlocked up in here?\" He asked. He was answered with two nods. \"H-hey...how bad are we now?\" Carrion asked. Wolf chuckled. \"Well...you two might've changed.\" He looked over at Plague; who's face was relatively normal, a small chest a gut that would be easier to describe as a beer belly than anything but an absolutely huge bottom half. Thunder thighs, huge hips, wide rear-end; the works. \"You've gone pear shaped.\" He turned his attention to Carrion, his face chubby, his chest a barrel, and his gut resting on his smothered thighs. \"And you're quite the opposite.\" They both seemed to get suddenly self conscious.<br>\r\n\"Hey...let's make a pact to tell each other how big we've gotten ok?\" Plague asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Wolf responded. \"Wait...why haven't you just asked each other?\"<br>\r\n\"We have but apparently we're too nice, we didn't think we were nearly that bad.\" Carrion replied.<br>\r\nWolf grunted in response. \"Makes sense...probably didn't really believe each other really.

He swore he heard someone sigh from relief but he brushed it off as nothing.<br>\r\nAfter a while of chatting another announcement came on. <b>All guests please return to your rooms...all guests please return to you rooms.</b> Wolf was going to complain about it being to early but Plague and Carrion told him it was to prepare for the next meal.

Carrion and himself had been sentenced to this prison just a few days ago; and it didn't take them long to figure out how it worked.<br>\r\nThe microchip and jumpsuits worked together to make the \"guest\" believe they weren't putting on any weight what so ever, even going so far to make them unable to feel themselves or someone else touching it. The pills, they guessed, were to make them hungrier and potentially lower their metabolism. Everyday when you woke up you were weighed and had a picture taken...you were not shown the results of either.<br>\r\n Now he and Carrion were already \"overweight\" (if you want to be generous) when they first arrived; and they didn't feel like getting any bigger just yet. They hatched a plan on their second day. The next newbie to walk into the buffet would be cornered by the two of them and separated for some good old conversation. One would talk the newbie's ear off while the other snuck some food onto their plate. Hopefully they were naive enough to not realize what was going in. After that it was a simply stuffing pillows under their clothes (it was difficult, but doable)to appear \"padded\" (thankfully the care bots were foolish enough to listen to their request of extras) and two sacks of flour they managed to steal from the kitchen to help fake their weight gain. Now all they had to do was try to find a way out of this over glorified mess hall without screwing their plans up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Wolf's PoV</div><br>\r\nUnbeknownst to himself, he had been eating for three this past week and had gained thirty pounds a a result.

As he slipped it on, he failed to notice that his suit was different. As he'd been packing on the pounds, his suits had been automatically exchanged for larger ones so that Wolf wouldn't feel the effects of the weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he buttoned up his uniform he looked at himself in the mirror, and while he saw a distinct belly on himself.. \"Not bad... I could work this off in a few days once I get out of here...\" He said to himself, not fully seeing how much weight he had put on. He closed up his shirt and headed to the buffet as usual, piling on even more food than he had the previous day, which was becoming a pattern for him. He sat at the table, his ass now starting to slightly spill over the sides of the chair, and having to slide back more than usual to accommodate his belly, but the slow transition has made most of the change seem minimal, as was the design of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf was eating his breakfast alone for some time, he scanned the area wondering where Plague and Carrion were, normally they would be here alongside him. Wolf groaned. It wasn't like he enjoyed company, or viewed them as friends. He just liked feeling like they were getting closer to a breakthrough and how to escape this messed up place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Breakfast ended, Lunch began, and without thinking Wolf went back to the buffet to restock on his food, and as he took his seat again, he heard two familiar voices around the corner. He looked up to wave them down when he instantly froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were Gigantic. Plague was a behemoth, given the change from yesterday, he was at least 300 pounds heavier, and waddling slowly towards the buffet. Carrion was no different in size, the only difference was he was now confined in a hoverpod, which was only used for the most obese guests here, who were too big to even move on their own. Wolf only stared in confusion as the two of them got their lunches and took their seats across from Wolf. Cairon having to move several chairs out of the way for his hoverpod, and Plague sitting on no less than three chairs to accommodate his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table stayed silent for a few minutes as Wolf tried to regain his sanity, and the others began eating, until eventually, Wolf couldn't help it any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what the F-Heck happened to you!\"</span></div></div>",

The robots then gave Wolf his food and a new pill that seemed slightly bigger, heck a lot bigger than the usual pills. Wolf almost gawked at it until he remembered he had an XXXL soda to guzzle the medicine down &amp; a lot of greasy foods like chicken wings, pizzas, tacos/burritos, &amp; hamburgers of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, bottoms up.\u201d Wolf said to no one in particular. As Wolf quite literally wolfed his food &amp; drink down, the doctors monitoring Wolf through his Series 71-G Microchip, noticed a few major changes that was beginning to astonish them &amp; could change everything within this prison. One, the gaining of adipose tissue was quickly accelerating as more tissue was stacked on his body from consumption. In other words, it means that the fatter he is, the easier it will be to keep that fat from being lost or replaced with muscle, meaning he will gain quicker &amp; reach immobility much sooner than expected. Two, the neural impulses being received by the Microchip was already showing phenomenal signs of improvement with odious, larcenous, violent, or selfish impulses meaning his rehabilitation was going along faster than they thought. Thus Wolf would probably leave on parole with good behavior within a few years, maybe a decade  instead of the twenty year maximum sentence he was given. &amp; three, most astonishing of all, was that the closer he reached immobility, the less he had to use the bathroom, thus waste removal would be easier with his superior eating capacity to its fullest every hour of everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor\u2019s were still trying to find the reason for the third phenomena occurring in Wolf O\u2019Donnell, &amp; knew that if he was released early (immobile or otherwise) they would never know how to maximize weight gain &amp; complacency in their \u201creformed\u201d inmates. So they formed a plan to ensure they could study his weight gain whether he leaves early or not. They first needed to isolate him to a hoverpod in the cozier cells (pardon guest rooms) with the other immobile inmates to monitor his health &amp; prevent suspicion. Secondly they needed to up his food supply &amp; engrain more tests on his psyche to further break down his malevolent maverick habits. &amp; three they needed to subliminally cover up his permissive nature from anyone monitoring Project L.A.R.D., while also getting his unknowing signature so that they may continue testing on him even if he leaves. But I digress, this story is about Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf was done eating his feast, it was a feast fit for a king of gargantuan proportions. Wolf was strangely cleaned up by the robots &amp; he was already slowly gaining most of the weight in calories from his meal. By now Wolf was almost immobile, barely able to walk or waddle, let alone run or plan some sort of elaborate escape plan. Heck, StarWolf was no longer a threat as he was reduced to a cringing, corpulent canine. Wolf was just minutes away from entering a fugue state &amp; he was about to go to sleep in his room, when the robots stopped him. \u201cUmmm, is there a problem robot.\u201d Wolf asked in an almost timid &amp; meak voice. If anyone else from his old crew that wasn\u2019t imprisoned right now or knew him personally either before or after entering Project L.A.R.D., they certainly wouldn\u2019t recognize or understand why he was doing this. Hell Wolf hardly understood why he was acting this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no problem Patient O\u2019Donnell, however, the doctor who make your medicine are asking for a routine checkup &amp; evaluation of your behavior for your chance to be paroled.\u201d The robot responded swiftly yet surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay. Let me just get uuuppp\u2026\u201d Wolf attempted to get up, but now he couldn\u2019t even do that on his own. \u201cSorry feeling *huff* a little tired *puff* &amp; winded *huff* from that meal *puff*, might need a little *wheeze* help getting there.\u201d Wolf panted &amp; wheezed, barely able to word out his request, but still they helped him up &amp; gave him arm crutches to help his lack of mobility. It took forever but they finally got to the doctor\u2019s office &amp; there was a surprise waiting there\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrion, Plague, &amp; Team StarWolf were being diagnosed as well. It seemed all of the major members of Taam StarWolf had come for a check-up with the doctor, the Prison Doctor at Project L.A.R.D. The doctor himself was an actual anthro instead of a robot, in this case an otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening to you guests. I am Dr. Mustelid, I am here to help you enjoy the benefits of this facility in the best health possible. Now then let's get started on your checkups with these waivers\", Dr. Mustelid showed us a stack of papers saying in plain writing, \"Patient Medical Waiver\" in red &amp; white lettering. \"These waivers will allow me to examine all of you without invading your personal privacy &amp; get the best help possible if anything has gone wrong. Don't worry about money, for you see, the prison is already paying for your medical benefits, now chop-chop\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf &amp; everyone else was ready to protest why they needed waivers to get their health examined, only for the microchip to inhibit that train-of-thought. After a moment of silence, they agreed. They were all asked to do simple stretches &amp; exercises, while the doctor poked &amp; prodded them with state-of-the-art lab equipment that stuck to their fur (in Leon's case scales) as they wobbled to-&amp;-fro like life-sized, living gelatin molds. Wolf was about to collapse but thankfully his willpower allowed him to stay awake long enough to notice that he had some blood drawn &amp; an x-ray being done on his body at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe examination went well, despite Wolf's impending lack of mobility caused by his recent astronomical weight gain. Thankfully Wolf didn't have to focus too much on his own health as he was strangely transfixed by everyone else's evaluation. Panther Carusso was already a bulking mass of flabulous fat cat flesh when Wolf last saw him &amp; now it seemed he was even bigger than before. Panther was about to burst the seams on his food-stained uniform, &amp; he was in crutches just like Wolf, but even slower as he was tested. Leon Powalski, the cunning &amp; crafty chameleon killer, was blushing, or at least tired due to the color changes his chameleon flesh was displaying. His scales went from a sickly pale green with grey spots, to a red blush with light pink stripes, &amp; finally to a content blue with yellow zigzags, &amp; he was jiggling &amp; expanding with every wheezing breath he took during the exercise test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlague, that verminous rat, was unkept as could be in this luxurious \"prison\", but he was grumbling with hunger, as he was given an injection in his bulbous stalky legs, for what the doctor claimed was \"a mild infection\" in the muscle. Carrion, the bulky buzzard was even worse off, coughing &amp; shivering as his moobs were examined by the stethoscope which was placed in a few rather, unusual places as if the doctor was groping him. Carrion was also wheezing too much as if he had just run a marathon, while wearing a lead straitjacket, &amp; carrying a sack of bricks on his back the whole way. In truth, Carrion could not do any of those things on account of his immobility. Finally after two agonizingly, exhausting, &amp; hunger-inducing hours, Dr. Mustelid gave his evaluation &amp; recommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everybody, good news &amp; bad news. The good news: your blood work &amp; respiratory functions are doing fine, despite your *hem hem* \"lack of mobility\", as are your gastrointestinal systems &amp; bone. The bad news is that with all of your bones being unable to adapt immediately to recent growth spurts, &amp; you are losing the ability to take care of yourselves, we are forced to upgrade all of your accommodations &amp; extend your stay for an indefinite amount of time for the duration of your sentence in the Immobility Wing. As payment however, you will each be subjected to humane tests on your body for scientific discovery of the Lylat System. Please allow us to escort you all to your new rooms in the Immobility Wing since you've already signed your waivers for your own health. That is all\". Wolf &amp; the others looked around in bemusement, which then became shock, &amp; finally pure terror. With their bodies reaching the cusp of mobility &amp; basic independent day-to-day functions, they would be Project L.A.R.D.'s prisoners forever, even if they did make parole. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Normally Wolf turned down these delivery boy jobs deeming them below him, but Lylat security was increasing and he needed to keep a low profile.<br>\r\nBut more importantly this employer promised good pay. Initially Wolf was suspicious of this (he even paid him extra upfront) as the job seemed too easy for that kind of pay but he wasn\u2019t turn down a job this generous. To be honest, Wolf really didn\u2019t know where he was as he never ventured to this side of the Lyat Sytem. While Wolf was waiting for the rest of his crew he looked around at the cityscape. Oddly, all the doors seemed wider and almost every store was a restaurant. Even the people seemed bigger, around the waist that is. Wolf reclined on the bench not giving it much thought, assuming that he was just in the restaurant district.. Regardless\u2026</span></div></div>",
