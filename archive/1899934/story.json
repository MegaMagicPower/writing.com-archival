Who's that Pokemon?\" He exclaimed as he took out his PokeDex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PokeDex stated that there was no information on this Pokemon as of yet. It towered over Ash with a tall, lanky body. The beast seemed to be ancient, yet so youthful at the same time. Its face was that similar to a cherub's but a body similar to a lion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glared at Ash. After a little bit of staring, the beast roared louldy. Ash covered his ears as he winced in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Pokemon vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Ash wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ash began to feel a bit off. He winced in pain as he felt every part of his body shrinking at an exponential rate. Ash then realized that he was either shrinking or.....getting younger!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on!?\" Now 8 year old Ash squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis regression stopped when he was.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can I go there?\" Ash asked Clemont and Bianca who laughed and said, \"I don't see why not, but sir why are you doing this and who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed and said, \"My name is Tomoki Itoi but you can call me Mr.Itoi, the 'kindergarten' teacher at the school he will be attending and the head of the Puercitia committee, once you're finished eating I'll lead you over to the inn to get you set up.\" And with that the man went back to his food and Ash, Bianca, and Clemont quickly began to eat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their food was finished, they went off with Mr.Itoi to the inn where he managed to get them a room, and soon enough they all went to sleep having had a tiring day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens the next day for them?</span></div></div>",

She looked around, noticing how there were no adults. A large, official looking building caught her attention. Zoey walked inside to see a maid woman in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! A visitor, would you be interested in taking my challange?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's the challange?\" Zoey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win in a pokemon sumo battle, then I wil give you my most valuable treasure.\" The maid offerred. Zoey agreed. \"Now then, you will be facing my Ivysuar!\" The maid declared and threw out the pokemon. Zoey nodded and reached for a pokeball when. \"Hold it missy!\" The maid said. Zoey looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Zoey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be the one going against my pokemon.\" The maid said. Zoey nodded. She stepped out onto the field. \"One more thing, you need your appropriate armor, I'll let Ivysaur handle that.\" The maid said and stepped out of the room. Zoey looked at Ivysuar who motioned for Zoey over to a table. Zoey did as told and stood there. Ivysaur pulled her clothes off. Ivysaur then picked up a warm white cloth, and wrapped it around Zoey. The maid came back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A diaper\" Zoey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a traditional sumo attire, now, BEGIN!\" She said. Ivysaur and Zoey pushed against eachother. After seconds of getting nowhere, Ivysuar slipped a vine into Zoeys towel diaper. Zoey giggled as she was tickled. Ivysaur moved onto her armpits and tickled. Zoey fell to the ground easily. Ivysaur lifted her up, ready to win. Zoey suddenly regained herself, and flipped off, and shoved Ivysaur out. \"Congratulations!\" The maid cheered. She retreated back to her room, and returned with Zoeys clothes and a strange pink crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Zoey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your prize, it's a special gem. By touching something with life on the side that's smooth, it regresses them, the side with the black pearl inside, progresses them.\" The maid said. Just then, Ivysaur plucked a sharp leaf and Zoey's diaper fell in half. \"Heh heh, sorry, Ivysaur hasn't lost in a while. She's just congratulating you.\" She explained. \"Say now child, now that you possess the artifact, what are you gonna do with it, revenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing too extreme.\" Zoey said slipping her clothes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, who could you use it on?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm, my friend Dawn I suppose.\" Zoey said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now who is this Dawn?\" The maid continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and I have been rivals since our first contest, she's a tough one.\" Zoey admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, why not use it on Dawn?\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'd evict a friend from that competition.\" Zoey shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, she's hard, why not use it to catch up to her, life's not always fair, wouldn't it feel good to tease her a bit?\" The maid suggested. A devilish smile crept across Zoey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do what you please, but if you do any regressing, be sure to grab some diapers on your way out.\" The maid pointed to a store. Zoey thanked her and left. She had this great scheme, but was it right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May was planning on spending the entire week with Ash's mom, while she trained for the Kanto Region. Delia was super ecstatic; it had been years since anyone stayed at her house for more than a day. Her son was constantly running about exploring the world. Meanwhile, poor Delia was lonely, wishing for human contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through all the rooms, making sure no spec of dust was visible. To possible outsiders, she seemed to be worrying about nothing; she cleaned the house everyday, so there really was nothing to clean. That thought never crossed her mind though. She took a drink of coffee before cleaning, and briskly cleaned every square inch. By the time finished, May was still not going to arrive for about 4 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done she walked down the hall to her special room; she opened it and smelled the fresh talcum powder inside. This was her dream child room. Before she had Ash, she hoped to have a baby girl and built this entire room for it. By the time she found out Ash would be a boy, she locked the room to intruders and set up a different room for Ash. Delia was keeping this room completely up to date though. Each day she would go into pretend she had a baby girl. She was about to do the same thing this morning, but something odd happened; she started regressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia didn't notice a thing at first. She just came in and looked over the crib, acting as if an imaginary baby was there. Meanwhile, ages started fading her. 36 35 34 33 32 31 30, By 30 she lowered one of the crib doors; she was going to continue acting, but she had no energy. So she sat on the crib, and then ages more rapidly left her. 28 26 23 19 14. As a teenager, she thought 'what the heck, I'm tired' and closed the baby gate to sleep in the crib. Her teenager self didn't mind napping in a crib for a bit, because she still had no idea of what was happening. At each age, she thought and acted like her age. After closing her eyes the last 13 years passed. 14 10 5 1. There Delia slept in the crib, like a baby. Her old clothes were being used like covers, except for her panties. Hours later, she made a poopy in it. Not much time passed though before the door bell rung; May was outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rang the door bell a few times, unintentionally waking up a baby Delia. May was going to wait for someone to answer, but then she heard the cries. She didn't have it in her to let a baby cry. So she opened the door and quickly closed it. She walked fast toward the noise and eventually saw the lit up room. She ran to the room and was soon blinded by the lights. She was blown away. It was a baby room with everything a baby girl could want. The walls were pink, the crib was pink, the changing table was pink, and stuffed animals were across the carpet. She was in a state of amazement for a second or two, looking at the room features. Then she heard the cries again and soon realized why she was there. She leaned over to the crib, with curiosity. \"Is everything alright?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere voice was soft and motherly, which distracted baby Delia. She looked up, cooing at this new figure. Her head tilted a little bit and soon she started smiling. Suddenly, she was no longer focusing on her poopy problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay reacted warmly again \"Do you need your mommy? I-I don't know where she is but..\" May had finally smelled the problem \"ew.. looks like somebody needs a diapy change huh? Don't worry, I can do it. I've changed diapers before\" She smiled gently and scooped up Delia, holding her nice and steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in May's arms, Delia just closed her eyes and sucked her thumb. May lowered onto the changing table, now realizing the clothes she was wearing. It didn't cross her mind yet, who this baby was. But, she knew how to act with babies; one must always stay calm to reassure the baby everything's alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay gently removed all her clothes, except for the panties. She held her legs and slowly removed the clothing. Delia was looking upset though, so May motherly said \"Wow, you certainly did a number on this, now didn't you.\" She tickled Delia's tummy and then went back to work. She got a baby wipe and cleaned her up. Then she lathered her bottom end with baby powder.\" Wouldn't want you getting a rash, now would I?\" Lastly she held Delia's chubby legs again to slide a diaper underneath. Lastly, She gently lowered Delia's legs and firmly strapped the diaper in. \"Hmm.. you probably need a shirt, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay picked up a now diapered Delia. Holding her in one arm, she looked through the drawers for baby shirts. In the first draw, she found an array of shirts and picked the first one; it was a pink baby shirt similar in color to Delia's pink blouse. May brought her back to the changing table and said \"Hold still.\" She slowly put the pink baby shirt on Delia. May was filled with enthusiasm after finishing up. \"Awwwwwwww, don't you look so cute! Now its time to find your mommy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying 'mommy,' Delia responded, saying \"Mama, mama!\" Delia even motioned to be held again by May. This was NOT what May expected. The whole thing took her off guard, making her look anxious. She controlled her anxiety, picking up and doing the best not to sweat up. She carried the baby throughout the house calling, \"DELIA! DELIA, ARE YOU HOME?\" Each time she called, Delia responded, looking up at May. May ignored that and rushed to Delia's room. No one was there, but she did spot a picture of baby Delia. She rushed to the picture, stunned at what she saw. \"So-so.. ya-your Delia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia giggled. May was then speechless. \"Do you remember anything else?\" Delia tilted her head and said again \"Mama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was shaking a lot and very anxious; her home greeter and friend's mom was now a baby. What more? She thought May was her 'mama.' If it wasn't bad enough, May and Ash were very close, so close they might marry some day. In other words, May's potential Mother-in-Law, now consider May her mommy. So, what was she supposed to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem struck May hard and she sat in a nearby chair to relax. Meanwhile Baby Delia was getting scared. \"Ma-mama?\" She hugged May tightly, hoping her mommy to send the same warmth back. May had here eyes closed, when she felt pressure on her waste. She looked down, seeing the cutest little baby imaginable hugging her waste. The adorableness of baby Delia, reminded her how much fun this was. Maybe she could handle this. Maybe this was meant to be.</span></div></div>",

Yes she does\" May nose rubbed Baby Delia and stood up, playing with Delia as she left. May took her to the kitchen and opened the cabinets eventually found some baby bottles. She checked the fridge and sure enough there was milk. May needed to free her hands though to pour the milk. She quickly explored the kitchen for a high chair; eventually she found one in the pantry. It was a bright pink high chair, like Delia's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay condescendingly talked to Delia as she positioned her in the seat. \"Don't you worry about it snuckums. Mommy will protect her baby and feed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia played with her legs, while May poured and heated the baby bottle. Once it was ready, May held Delia in her arms and sat in a normal chair. She slowly fed Delia milk, like a true mommy. \"Bottoms up.

May decided to take baby Delia with her to the door, even if it wasn't a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held Delia firmly in one arm, over her chest and cautiously walked to the door. Once she opened the door and saw who it was, she was speechless. \"Mom? Wha-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's Mom, Caroline, answered the question but was very confused about seeing a baby. \"I just was dropping off your sleeping bag, you forgot it back at the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was still awkward in conversation. \"Oh, yeah. Thanks for bringing that. I'll see you later though. Bye\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's Mom got serious, \"Wait right there. What's this baby all about? Is Ash's mom making you look after her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay sadly didn't have it in her to lie. After all, she did intend to make this a serious thing. \"Well.. not exactly. Come in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith caution, Caroline entered. May walked her to Delia's room and showed her the baby Delia picture. Caroline asked \"Why are you showing me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay took a deep breathe, \"Because I think this baby is Ash's mom. She looks just like the picture. Plus, when I came to the house, this baby was in a crib crying with adult clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline was stunned by the story, and looked back and forth at the picture and Delia. \"Wow... it seems, she is a baby now. I-I don't know what to say. What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay nervously said, \"Well.. I sorta already have an idea. She thinks I'm her mommy, and Ash is a close friend of mine. I can't leave her for someone else to adopt, so I've decided to adopt her. I'll be her mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's mom was flabbergasted \"That... that's ridiculous! You can't be her mother! We still don't know if she can be cured!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia suddenly started crying. May gave her a death stare and calmed the infant. \"Mom.. we have a baby in the room. Please be quieter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline calmed down, \"Alright... just you can't be her mother all of sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Look at this face and tell me she wasn't meant to be this way.\" May held up Delia to her mom. The two stared at each other for a bit, and then something broke the silence. Delia peed in her diaper. Delia started crying loudly \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's Mom was annoyed, \"Augh, right she's meant to be this way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay ignored her mom and focused on her baby. \"There there, mommy's here. You're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay carried Delia over to the changing table and did a full diaper change. While doing so, she sung \"La Di Da Li Laaaa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's mom just watched in amazement as her daughter performed flawlessly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

YOUR TOO YOUNG TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline marched over near May, \"Now listen up young lady..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay cut her statement off, with a pacifier. \"No, you listen up little girl. I am Delia's mommy, not just your daughter. \"Now, if your going to act like a baby whose desperate for her needs, than I'll treat you as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline was completely taken back; May had never talked down to her or like this. She was being treated like a little toddler. \"May.. I'm sorry its just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay kept up her tone \"Its just what? That's a verbal eraser. You need to be taught a lesson.\" May walked closer to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are you doing? I'm your mother.. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay gave a warm odd response. She started treating her mother very differently all of a sudden. \"No, you're not Caroline. I'm your mother. Augh, this is all my fault. I haven't been giving both of you equal love. Come here sweetums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay put a pacifier in her mom's mouth and then lifted her up on to the changing table. She then started tickling her mom,  which strangely caused her mom to regress. The tickling was rapidly regressing her mom, but her mom felt it. She felt herself regressing. 36 34 31 27 22 16. By sixteen she got in a question \"why.. why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because thats what mommy's do. They comfort they're loved ones. Maybe I need to change your diaper for you to see. May easily removed her mothers clothing. After removing the last of her mom's panties and letting Caroline's nakeness show, Caroline was only 10 years old. Then May powdered Caroline's butt, regressing her back to a 1 year old. May finished the changing with a nice tuggidy wuggidy diaper. Caroline was horrified, but soon that all changed. May tapped her nose and said \"BOOP!\" Strangely enough this regressed Caroline's mind completely. The next words out of her mouth were \"mmmmm Mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe she could show the baby girls off to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Ash was at the park with his Pikachu asleep by his feet. He noticed May walking towards him and it looked like she had two girl babies with her, one in a stroller and one in a carrier on her front. Ash wondered where they had come from. Did May suddenly take up babysitting? And as they got closer, one of these girls looked... strangely familiar to him. Nevertheless, he waved to his friend and called out, \"Hi, May!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ash! You won't believe what happened over at your house,\" said May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Does it have to do with those babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" said May. And then she proceeded to tell Ash everything, how she discovered Delia as a baby in her house, how she took a quick liking to Baby Delia, how Caroline just so happened to come by, and how SHE got turned into a baby. May took Baby Delia out of the carrier and handed her over to Ash. He wasn't sure if it really was her or not at first, but May had taken Delia's baby picture with her as proof, and as he looked at the picture, then at Baby Delia, he was shocked by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot for Ash to take in. His mother and the mother of his friend had somehow turned into babies. And what's more, May seemed surprisingly okay about all this. Something felt off about the entire thing. May was talking about how this was meant to be, how she was going to be their mommy, and the events of how Caroline was regressed didn't make sense to him: how was it possible that Caroline could turn into a baby just because May treated her like one? There wasn't an explanation for how Delia got regressed, since, from what May told him, she FOUND her like this, but Caroline's regression was just strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Ash said, \"...this isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked May with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right!\" Ash said, a little louder, \"You're acting all strange and our moms are now babies! We can't just leave them like this! We have to tell Professor Oak or someone to see if they could help get them back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, Ash,\" May quickly protested, \"don't do it! Not now. Think about it: wouldn't you like to play with your mom as a little tiny baby? Wouldn't it be neat to take care of her for a change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh listened as May tried to convince him, then he looked back down at Baby Delia. She looked up at Ash with the most precious look on her face and uttered \"Da-da?\" Ash couldn't believe it. His own mom now thought that he was her daddy. At that moment, he made up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ash do?</span></div></div>",

At the age of ten, he set out on his own to become a Pokemon Master, leaving his mom with an empty nest. Sure, he tried to visit her whenever he could, but most of the time, she was left mostly by her lonesome. And he had to admit that while he did want to be a Pokemon Master, there were times when he did miss his mom. He wasn't fond of her more embarrassing tendencies, but he did still want to be able to bond with her whenever he could. Now that she was reduced to the state of a mere toddler, how would bonding work now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that May mentioned it, he did think it'd be interesting to be looking after Delia like this. She did look quite cute as a baby, after all, and it would certainly be a different experience from looking after his Pokemon. He wasn't really looking forward to the... messier parts of childcare, but as long as they could find a way to turn her and Caroline back, then maybe this could actually be fun, and he might even be able to spend time and bond with her in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he wouldn't have to worry about her reminding him to change his underwear when she was too young to worry about keeping HERS clean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Baby Delia called him \"Da-da\", that was when Ash lost most of his resistance. He hugged her close to his chest, now feeling not only the warmth of love, but also the desire to protect and take care of her, just like how he protects and takes care of Pikachu. Delia, meanwhile, had grabbed onto Ash's shirt, feeling comforted as she placed her head against his chest, listened to his heartbeat, and softly breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did have his previous concerns still in mind, but he reluctantly put those aside as he stroked Delia's hair and back, comforting her even further. As he let go from the hug, he looked at May and sighed in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Ash, \"they can stay like this for now. But I still think we should find a way to return them to normal eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY!\" cheered May as she cuddled Baby Caroline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dada! Dada!\" Delia giggled happily as she hugged into his chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I getting myself into?</i> Ash thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do next?</span></div></div>",
