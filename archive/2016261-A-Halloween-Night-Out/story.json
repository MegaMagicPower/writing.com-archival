Somehow I had left my girlfriend talk me in to going out in drag for the night with her friends.  Still not sure how that happened.   We had just moved in together which was a big change for me after years of having my own flat. Not only that we had also moved back to her home town, so that she could start a new job.<br>\r\nI had gone with her not just because of our relationship but there was no work where we were living before. So because of this I had not made many friends here yet.  I mean we had only moved a month ago, I figured I still had time to make friends of my own.   So when she came up with the idea of spending Halloween night with some of her old friends I wasn\u2019t too sure about.   Could I survive a night with a group of giggling girls and still keep my sanity? Only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 31st got closer the girls started to talk about what they were going to wear on the night.  I hadn\u2019t given it much thought.  I was thinking of just wearing my jeans and a t-shirt.  It was on the 28th that I was told what we would be doing on the 31st and where we would go.  Apparently for the last five years one of the local bar\u2019s held a party night with a prize for the best costume and entertainment.  I must admit it sound fun when my girlfriend told me about it.  As she was doing this she dropped the bombshell that all of us would be wearing matching outfits.  She and the girls had decided this during one of their long phone calls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that I was not pleased was an understatement. I thought I would look like an idiot.  I mean Jane my girlfriend at 26 years old,  5ft 6in and a size 12 with long wavy blonde hair would look good in just about anything she wore. Me on the other hand I was 27 years old, 5ft 8in with short brown hair and a little bit of a belly would not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Mark you won\u2019t be the only man in drag on Friday night\u201d Jane said to me.  \u201cHowever you will be the only one who is surrounded by a group of gorgeous girls\u201d she went on to say with a smile on her face. \u201cSo what\u2019s my costume going to be?\u201d I asked with a frightened look on my face.  The only answer I got was \u201cWait and see Wait and see.\u201d  With that she walked out the room and out of the house to go to work.  Over the next couple of day I asked her a few more times as to what my costume might be and all I was told was to wait until Friday as it was to be a surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane got home around seven on Thursday night and over our meal started to tell me a little more about we were going to be doing during the next day.  \u201cWell tomorrow is my day off so that gives us the whole day to get everything ready\u201d Jane announced over desert. \u201cOh good \u201cI replied hoping that she would notice the sarcasm in my voice.  She didn\u2019t. \u201cAll you need to do is shower and shave, a close shave mind and me and the girls will take care of everything else\u201d She went on to tell me.  I decided to try my luck again and ask the question that had been on my mind all week. \u201cJane, honey can you tell what my costume is?\u201d There I had said it but would she tell me.  \u201cYou will find out tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your surprise now would I?\u201d She said in reply. Well at least I didn\u2019t have long to wait to find out what it was and how embarrassing this would become for me I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up the next morning to find Jane nowhere in sight.  Strange I thought I was normally the first up.  I went to answer the call of nature then went downstairs for breakfast expecting to see Jane in the kitchen but she was not there. Instead I found a note from. I opened it and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><span class=\"cpink\"><i>Morning Honey <br>\r\nYou looked so peaceful lying in bed this morning I didn\u2019t have the heart to wake you.  I had to leave early to get some last minute things for tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse my shampoo and conditioner when you have your shower and don\u2019t forget to have a really close shave All OVER and meet me and the girls at Susan\u2019s place at 2pm this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you are really not in the mood for tonight but do it for me and I will owe you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove <br>\r\nJane</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right I was not in the mood for this party but Jane said she would make it up to me. At least that was how I read her note. This one fact had put a smile on my face maybe today / tonight wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all and with that thought in my head I finished my breakfast and went to have my shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself following Jane\u2019s instructions to the letter.  The suggestion that it contained was more than enough to motivate me. Beside which I was starting to look forward to a night out even if it was with her friends.  I hadn\u2019t been out since we had moved other than to go shopping.  So what if I ended up looking like a fool I was sure I wouldn\u2019t be the only one wearing a silly outfit tonight. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As per my instructions I had a close shave. It was really strange feeling my smooth skin, there hadn\u2019t been this little hair on my body since I was a kid. After the shower I settled down for yet another morning sat down to watch daytime TV. The sooner I got a job the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knocked on Susan\u2019s door signalling the start of what I knew would be a Halloween I would never forget or live down no matter what happened once the door was opened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
