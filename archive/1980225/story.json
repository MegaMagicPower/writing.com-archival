This couldn't be true to him, he is actually touching some sort of a human skin right before his very eyes. Then he noticed a strap look object, and the blue hair as well. Jason couldn't believe it right before his very eyes, he is actually shrunk down to a very small height (about a half an inch or so) to the girl he dreamed up. \"Wow, I honestly cannot believe it right before my very own eyes.\" Jason said, stunned to notice the girl that he wanted to meet. He walked further back to take in the full reality of it. \"WOW... I couldn't believe it, I am actually meeting Dawn shrunk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice comes back in. \"Say, I told you I would make your dreams come true.

She is all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dude.\" Jason said, and then he tries to decide what to do now. \"Should I go inside her, or should I wake her up?\"</span></div></div>",

So I figure I will climb through the ear.\" he said, and then he grabs onto her skin, and starts climbing his way up, all the way into her ear. It took him some time as he needed to get his footing exactly right, but other than that, he did just fine. He then walked inside of the ear, thinking what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is two things I would like to do. Perhaps let Dawn have a dream talk with me, or perhaps go into her brain to control her.\" he thought of two things to do.

He sees a bodyish like object with all sorts of holes or open things that is sticky and all. It was none other than the very brain that he wanted to look for. Jason just looked at the brain in all of it's glory. Knowing that he can do some big things on Dawn with it. \"Oh man, you are so freaking right. Thankfully I brought my controller.\" he said, as he pulls out a gaming controller that is like a Steelseries Stratus controller. Then suddenly the brain starts moving around as the heads shakes. It goes one direction, and Jason chases it, and then suddenly when the heads switched, he was almost flattened by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This brain better behave.\" he said, and then he pulls some giant tape and tapes the brain down and then climbs onto it and attaches a device. \"Alright Dawn, it's time to wake up!!!!!!!\" Jason shouted just as he activates his controller and pushes a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he messes around inside.

So he figure just talking to Dawn inside the ear would be a good idea. He had to think up some things to ask her, like where does she live or whatever, but somehow he couldn't get an idea. \"Ideas on how to talk to an anime girl. I just don't have any. I don't know if she will figure out something is wrong in the ear, and then she will find me out for it.\" you said, and then he notices some rumbling, as if something was about to happen to him.

Then, the fun can begin.\" the voice replied again. Jason kept walking for a few minute, and through the bushes until he finds the sleeping Dawn in her swimsuit. Jason just scored and he smiled. He has finally found Dawn. \"Ever wanted to be small to her, well here, you can make her as big as you want. Just imagine what her height should be, and let her grow.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I always wanted to see either a 50ft Dawn, or a 200ft Dawn.

Since she was laying, and the trees around Jason are about 50ft tall, it seem to be the right estimate. Jason watched as his thinking did the magic, and as a result, her height has grown to 50ft tall. He can tell as some of her feet is now touching the water, and her head is rubbed against one of the trees at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem that could occur is that if she wakes up, she would freak out, but at the same time, perhaps its great to make an awesome intro for Jason to her.

After 3 hours of unconsciousness, you find yourself to be a thousandth of a millimeter (do the math to find out how small that is because I'm too lazy to do that). The next thing you know is that you're in some kind of bed. The covers are kicked off and you see someone's barefoot, and it smelled bad. You hear a loud fart come from this person and BOY did it wreak of shit! Just out of realization, this person is Bianca; her girlish snores in her sleep told you so. After that fart, you discover that this is Lulu's interpretation of Bianca from the YTP. How coincidental is any of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Bianca spread out in her bed, it wouldn't hurt to explore her body a bit, especially her butt to find out what kind of problems she has with her large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to stop at...</span></div></div>",

DNA Rewriter, this gonna good changes in the Bulma's reproductible material and change it from Human to sayian, when Trunks is concieve here, itsn't gonna be a half-breed but a full fledge one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Side effect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma will become sayian too... Yup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a DNA Rewriter of course, You don't have fancy nanobots for that job! ... no yet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out a needle with the DNA Rewriter Serum - Ready with the Saiyan DNA added in the mix and administre it right into the solft wall few moments after, The Organ tremble a little before segregating a blue-ish liquid all around, the walls swells and expand and then shrinks back, meaning that the changes are happening, the best thing of all, is that Bulma isn't feeling... at least You hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma was bathing, water falling in her naked body, a good relaxing bath it's what she need..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nuntil she felt warm right in her lower belly, right where her womb and intestines is locate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" She rub her belly a little. \"Probarbly gas\" She thought ignoring the fact that small part of her hair is black now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself more lightlweith, stronger, energetic and tremendous hunger, she is really <i>really</i> hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\naside from all of that, she feel fantastic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to wake Gohan and Krillin.\" She turn off the bath dryed herself and put some clothes, ignoring the tail that just grew in her behind and hid in her pants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relaxing in a dried part of the womb you found on, To be honest, You didn't slept since the experiment, Of course, you could use some sleep but Science demands investigation in what change occurred in Bulma's body while injecting the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings can be complicated in microscopic levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

I get it, I get it, you're in my head altering my code but please, let me have my new body you don't know how long I dreamed for it!\" she was right, for too long, she was harassed and teased by other woman human type digimons, even if is not directly, she was always jealous of Angewomon's curves or Sakuyamon's sex appeal, or even her big sister, Rosemon... she shake her head, she got a good reason to dislike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same instant, her body returned to her curvacous appearance. she sign in relief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your little fun proving your existence... it went better as expected, you explain to her your objective and the small camp, she gasped and say that altering digimon code is almost impossible except a digi-destined or Digimon Tamer, who are humans, are capable to do that feat, but even then they are limited by some outside soucer, to alter it directly it was nothing but a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat's until you come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it, you are inside of my head altering my code... why?\" she ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want to prove something.\" you shrug, you sit down at one of the brain's roots, after you explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but why me?\" she ask as she fly around, this time getting at the forest's outskirt. \"For all we know, there are more digimons with more power than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, You're a Ultimate Digimon, what if I make you have power of a mega digimon? that's the challenge\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you expect me to fight a mega? no in a long time, buddy.\" she chuckled \"I don't trust a tiny man in my head, what if you are a evil overlord that want to create an mindless digimon army?\" she shrudded, this could be also a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to do that, I just wanted to prove my abilities as a modder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you made it... and since you're in my head, I guess you can live with me... or in me. the only payment is that you make me stronger.\" She say, while flying more faster, she could see the buildings of the city she lives in... this day can be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might go exploring your body, Lilimon. there must be something I can modify in a specific area.\" You say as you get up ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I wanna present you some friends, but any thing you change, tell me first.\" she said as she enter to an small digimon city.</span></div></div>",

And why are you so big?\" You say, hearing her giggle after you say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your questions in order, i don't know, i brought you here, and I'm not big, you're just small.\" You slowly stand up and look around, realizing she's telling the truth upon seeing all the giant sized things in what you could only guess was her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the reason you're small in the first place, that was my doing.\" You quickly turned around to look back at her when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You did this to me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when i found you, you sort of fell out of the sky and into the ocean. It's really cold this time of year, and by the time i fished you out, i thought for sure you were going to die. But i managed to bring you back to my place and keep your body warm before that could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You did all that for a stranger like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't explain why I'm so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I found a scroll in your arms when i pulled you up. You had a firm grip on it, even unconscious. But after i pried from your iron grip, i saw the technique written on it for something called size bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size bending? You mean you used that on me to shrink me down? But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i figured you owed me for saving your life, and there's something I've really wanted to do for a long time, but could never do. Until now that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I'm going to shrink you down to around a centimeter in height, and then I'm going to toss you in my mouth and swallow you.\" At that moment, your whole body was paralyzed by fear. Was this girl really going to eat you like some kind of snack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, the technique also showed me something for granting immunity to digestive acids, so you won't be killed by that anyway. And it's not like you can say no.\" At that moment, she started doing hand signs, and before you could react, you had shrunken down to one centimeter tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow looking up at the even bigger girl, you could see her lowering her hand down to pick you up. You tried to run away, but failed as she grasped you by your clothes and lifted you up to her face and opened her mouth up. You started screaming as she flicked you onto her tongue and closed her mouth, sealing you in darkness.</span></div></div>",

He placed a hand on the anus and pushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His smile grew bigger as the once strong ring of flesh gave to his hand with little effort. He was able to slide his whole arm inside her with such easy, that it was almost disappointing. So, to make it more fun, he teased her a bit. Aaron began slowly pushing his arm in and out of Clover, hoping to stimulate her into a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Almost in no time, the heat in the area began to rise, and Aaron noticed a strong smell begin to waft down from the vagina above. Soon, a small trickle of fluid dripped down as Clover began panting. He was getting a reaction alright. Now to really start it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aaron thrust in faster now, his hand balled into a fist as he went in and out. Clover increased the panting as well, her whole body beginning to to shake. She gripped the bed sheets with both hands as sex filled dreams clouded her mind. The pressure built and built until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aaron felt Clover was about to reach her climax, the tremors in her body reaching fever pitch. He pulled his arm all the way out and dived head first into the anus, forcing his whole body into the blonde girl's sensitive hole and giving her the most intense orgasm of her life. The bed became damp between her legs and she settled back into an exhausted rest as the pleasure passed, falling into dull after shocks as something moved deeper into bowls...</span></div></div>",

The \u2018grass\u2019 he was sitting on was fur. The fur on the giant creature\u2019s muzzle. Above him was the creature\u2019s forehead on which was a giant purple unicorn horn. Just above that was the creature\u2019s mane, dark purple with a pink highlight running down the bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex realized two things. He was sitting on the muzzle of a giant pony. And that pony was Twilight Sparkle and she was looking right at him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Neither Twilight nor Alex could believe the strange new reality that was before them. They just stared at each other for several seconds as their brains tried to catch up with what their eyes were seeing. A tiny human and a giant pony, each was impossible to the other, and yet here they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Alex\u2019s eyes wandered from Twilight\u2019s to the area around him. From his position on Twilight\u2019s nose, Alex was able to see they were in a hallway of some kind. White marble covered the walls and floor while golden buttresses hung from the ceiling. The walls had various things from oil paintings of regal ponies to tapestries and banners of a golden sun. Alex recognized it at once as one of the hallways of Canterlot Castle, the home of Princess Celestia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  So, they weren\u2019t inside Twilight\u2019s castle. Alex looked back at Twilight and tried to take in as much of her as he could. Instantly he noticed the lack of big purple wings on her sides. She wasn\u2019t a princess yet. This meant he was somewhere in MLP\u2019s past. But when? And more importantly, how? How was he sitting on the nose of a fictional character? What did it mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cUm, excuse me?\u201d He was pulled from his surge of questions by Twilight\u2019s soft voice. \u201cAre you\u2026a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Alex nodded, their eyes locked on each other once again. He watched as a mad gleam of excitement grew in Twilight\u2019s eyes, her nose quivering a little as she broke out in a smile. Alex was suddenly lifted into the air a sparkling purple aura surrounded him, pulling him a little farther away from Twilight so she could get a better look. He began turning in different directions as Twilight examined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cLet\u2019s see. A small patch of hair on the head, bipedal, no hooves but hands and fingers. Full body clothes and an overall appearance similar to apes. Oh you are a wonderful find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThank you?\u201d Alex said a little unsure of what was going on. \u201cUm, where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  However, Twilight seemed to ignore him. \u201cOh my gosh. I have to take you to the Princess. She\u2019ll definitely want to see you. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Twilight began running off in what Alex figured was the throne room\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was returning home after a long day at the Weather Factory. They were dated to have another big summer storm in two weeks, and the manager was set to make sure everything was ready. So, most of the workers had been to given double shifts to prepare. Luckily, tomorrow was the start of Rainbow Dash's two days off, so things were looking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Dash flew along, her joy at being free again slowly built. The urge to do a few celebratory laps around Ponyville grew as well and Dash was not one to pass on the chance of some flying. The rainbow maned mare smiled smuggly as she began to increase speed, climbing into the air as she went. Nopony would mind her doing a few tricks as well, right?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As dusk began to set over Ponyville a small fly named Frank made his way home, a crack in Fluttershy's cottage floor. It had been one hell of a week for him. Normally, as a fly, his life was pretty crappy. Ponies usually took shots at him when they saw him or, for the more angry ones, they used the spray. These were annoying but easy to avoid. No, the newest threat was a recuring nightmare caused by one pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"AAAAAHHHHH YYYEEEAAAHHH!!!!!\" A sonic boom shook the area as a rainbow colored shockwave passed over head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no.\" Frank groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned just in time to see a giant blue pony with rainbow mane heading straight for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rainbow Dash...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Alright, you know where this is going.

It was his equilibrium giving out from the fact that he was currently several feet in the air and free falling as gravity took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Crap!\" He cried as he fell. Panic set in as the ground rose up to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pulling the wrist computer to his face, Sam began typing away in a blur of fingers. \"Come on, come on.\" He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The computer just buzzed and showed an error message across its screen. Sam grit his teeth and began slamming his fist on the screen. He glanced down, the ground only feet away now. He was going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"COME ON!\" With one final roar of desperation, Sam struck the computer again. This time it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A loud humming sound came from the computer and Sam felt himself stop in mid air, his face just inches from the ground. The anti-grav system had thankfully turned on just in time. He breathed a sigh of relief. Quickly righting himself, Sam placed his feet on the ground just as the computer gave one last buzzing sound before shutting down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn.\" He thought annoyed. \"I knew inter dimensional would be difficult. But I didn't think it would fry the computer that fast. Hopefully I landed in the right place so I can get Twilight's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam looked around at his surroundings. He was in the middle of a dirt road with fields of flowers on each side. The road itself lead to a rather dark looking forest at one end and turning, he saw his destination at the other. Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good,\" he thought.\" Now at least something went right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Though glancing at the flowers nearby, Sam realized his problems weren't over yet. The flowers were massive, nearly as big as skyscrapers in his own world. Everything else matched the size of the flowers too. he had been shrunken on his way through the portal and with the computer damaged, he had no way to restore his size or fly over to Ponyville. Walking would most certainly take several days at his size, and that was time he really didn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luck was on his side though. AS he was thinking about what to do, the sounds of hooves clapping on the gravel road drew his attention. It was coming from the forest. Sam turned and saw...</span></div></div>",

The sun was shinning, there was a pleasant breeze and the weather promised a cool afternoon. All was well with the world, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n AJ was leaning over to pick up a bucket when suddenly she felt something strike her anus and squeeze in before getting jammed half way inside her. She jumped at the strange feeling, wheeling around to see if somepony had snuck up on her. With no one seemingly around she tried to remove the strange object only to find it was too small for her to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was about to head up to the farm house to ask for help, when Rarity trotted up to her with a worried expression...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Sam's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam groaned in the humid darkness he now found himself in. He had been launched into the anus of another pony after Rarity accidently sneezed him off her nose. And of course, just as added misery, Sam found himself only half way inside the ring of muscles, stuck up to his waist with arms pinned to his sides and his legs hanging in the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know what?\" Sam grumbled to himself. \"All I wanted to do was explore another world. Travel around, see the sights, maybe exchange scientific knowledge with the locals. But no. My computer breaks down, I'm shrunk, and now I am struck in the ass of SOME RANDOM PONY! AND WHY DOES IT SMELL LIKE APPLES?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His angry yell echoed off the organic walls in his dark prison. Sam let out his pent up rage and tried to relax. He'd need to a plan to get out of this bizarre situation, and that would require a level head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, just as he was starting to form the blue prints of a plan, Sam felt something gently grab his legs. It began trying to pull him out of the pony butt, though it held firm. He did feel himself slide out a bit as the unknown force pulled. It greed his arms just enough to allow him to start pushing himself out along with the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few seconds and one final great pull, Sam popped out of the pony behind and enjoyed the sweet smell of fresh air...For a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Rarity's POV, a few seconds ago*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rarity opened her eyes after her sneeze, only to find Sam had been launched off. Panic set in as she charged ahead, hoping she could follow his trajectory. Her eyes quickly caught sight of Sam flying through the air. She moved faster to catch him, only to stop dead as he landed...In the butt of her friend, Apple Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Apple Jack whipped around at the feeling and Rarity moved fast to help. AJ looked up to see Rarity coming towards her with panic in her eyes. The Earth Pony seemed to try and hide her plot related issues from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Rarity.\" She said nervously as the unicorn stopped in front of her. \"How ya all doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not now, Apple Jack.\" Rarity grabbed her friend and spun her around to face AJ's backside. \"I need to removed Sam from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\" AJ shouted. \"You know what flew up my rump?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not a what, a who. Sam, a little human in a rather unfortunate predicament. I'll explain later, for now just hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright.\" AJ lowered her head to the ground and held up her behind to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rarity examined AJ's plot and found Sam's legs wiggling in a vain attempt to free himself. In her panicked mine, Rarity forgot to use magic and simply grabbed hold of the human's legs with her mouth. Trying very hard not to think about the fact she had her lips near another pony's rear, Rarity began pulling as gently as possible. She made slow progress until with one final pull, Sam was freed and Rarity fell backwards, losing her grip on the tiny human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Well, this IS an endo story.

He soared through the air only to head straight at Rarity's open mouth. He closed his eyes and braced himself as he landed on the soft and slimy flesh of the waiting tongue. Sam was just able to feel the humidity of pony breath and caught the smell of mint before he bounced off the tongue. His angle threw him to the back of Rarity's throat. As he hit the back of her throat, Rarity's reflexes took over, and the tiny human was swallowed into Rarity's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Rarity's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rarity landed on her back side after pulling Sam from Apple Jack's. She was relieved at first until something landed in her mouth. Panic set in as she realized what the 'something' was, only to turn to dread as she accidently swallowed. She had just swallowed the tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Apple Jack stood up and sighed in relief. She turned back to Rarity, a smile on her muzzle. \"Woo wee, Rarity. That sure feels much better. Thank ya kindly for removing that there obstruction from mah hind quarters. Hey, ya alright sugar cube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rarity just stared at Apple Jack. \"I swallowed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The smile died on AJ's lips. \"Ya did what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rarity suddenly jumped at the farm pony, grabbing her firmly. \"Sam! The tiny human. I swallowed him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She started to go into full panic mode as thoughts of a tiny digested human skeleton formed in her mind. She promised to help the little dear, not kill him. But how was he suppose to survive stomach acid? Not good, definitely not good. She had to do something, and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luckily it was Apple Jack to the rescue. \"Rarity, calm down. Look lets go to Twilight. She'll know what to do. On the way you can tell me what's going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n AJ grabbed Rarity and pulled her along to Twilight's castle...</span></div></div>",

His main mission in coming here in the first place was to research these odd magical pony creatures. So, might as well start with some pony anatomy. He walked farther in, switching on the flash light built into his wrist computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After about ten minutes of walking through the ear canal, Sam becoming slightly sick of seeing nothing but pink fleshy walls and small yellow patches of ear wax. At first he thought maybe Rarity wasn't as clean as she pretended to be, but he soon realized that these patches were ether too small or too deep for rarity to ever reach on her own. He quickly decided that he didn't care ether way, and just wanted to see something else besides earwax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, Sam found lights flashing from around the corner ahead. He moved right through it and was met with the most amazing sight of his life. He had come into a huge chamber, clearly the hollow center of the white unicorn's skull. Starting from the floor and rising high to the top of the chamber was a giant grey fleshy organ, the brain. All around the brain arches of multicolored electricity danced up and down the organ, sometimes even crossing in brilliant flashes in light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam's mouth hung open. It was a strangely beautiful sight. For a time he simply stood there and admired the natural activity of this miracle of the natural world. An organic computer, perfect in design and powerful beyond measure. He vaguely wondered if his own brain acted like tis or if this sight was the result of rarity's magical origins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After he recovered his breath a bit, Sam looked around at the area. Belong the brain, countless 'wires' grew out of the organ and moved down through a hole at the bottom, the entrance to spinal cord. He activated his wrist computer again. It was set to scan the brain and try to figure out how it worked. As it went about its job, Sam continued to watch the brain. Then, the damaged computer acted up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam felt his wrist heat up. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The computer started sparking and glowing as the AI spoke. \"Error. Unknown energy detected. System is compromised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" Sam shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"System over load imminent. Prepare for electrical discharge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam's eyes widened in horror. \"No! Abort discharge. We are inside an organic being. A discharge could be harmful. Abort discharge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But it was too late. The screen burst into a blue light as lightning shot out from the wrist computer and hit the brain dead center.

This pony was really orange, and has bright green eyes and a smooth long hair. This pony we are talking about is Apple Jack, and she is one strong willed son of a gun. Today she was planting tons of apples for the upcoming harvest, and she is surely quite a worker that's for sure. I mean she spent all day and a portion of the night just planting apples and watering them as well. Eventually she started to get very tired and needs to get rest. After she planted the last apple, she got pretty tired. She was weakly walking towards the door when she tripped on something and hit the ground. The tripping was annoying as it cause a thump on her leg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... man, what a day. These rocks give me the headache like a acorn splitting apart all over the place. Oh well, at least these apples are done in like a bull done on a rider.\" she said pretty stubborning just as she gets on her bed and proceeds to fall asleep. However, just as she starts to rest. The rock that she tripped on started to come closer and even climbed on the walls with some sort of spider legs. Inside the robot was you. You were asked by a friend to go into my Little Pony and interact with her brain somehow, like get a picture of you and her brain. Then somehow, climbing out of the cockpit was you with a hook gun. You look to see a great opening to the brain. What better way than to go through the ear of a pony. Well here goes. You aim right for the edge of the year and then fired your grappling gun. The grappling gun fires some hook and after a few moments it barely hits the edge of her ear. \"Bullseye.\" you said. Then you attach the gun to the spider rock bot and then you get onto the rope and then you start climbing your way all the way to the ear. You are a half an inch BTW. As you climb up, you notice her head started to move, and it causes the spider robot to fall off and then you swing all the way to her body and hit it, but suddenly, nothing happen. She is still asleep like a baby. Guess that work day really exhaust her. \"That was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decided to wall climb with the robot all the way to the ear. This was way easier than the other way, and after about 5 or so minutes, you were then at the top of her ear. \"Okay, it is time for me to enter the ear. Thankfully I brought my gear.\" Right then, you started to get your two feet apart and then draft jump or something or draft climb down to her ear drum. Now the question you now face is, where do you want to go exploring first?</span></div></div>",

Eventually you were through the eardrum, and now the rest of the way is a easy navigation job. You walked through the ear in a sort of path that was set for you, and eventually you reach the end of the tunnel. \"Finally, I made it through.\" you said with a bit of relief.\" you had to clear out the earwax you had to go through, and it was nasty for sure. \"But boy am I going to need a bath after this, and perhaps after what I am about to mess around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brain is like a ton of pinkish substances and with it all squishy and all that stuff. Now your job that you are trying to go is interact with it at least once. Right now you reach into your bag and pull out a camera without the flashing and took a few pictures of the brain. You took pictures of all the parts of it, like the spinal core that connects to it, the nervous system, and a couple others. Heck, you even do one selfie picture with you touching the brain that feels squishy and very soft. Also, you got brain juice on your hands, so you clean it off. Also, it kinda smells like a pony's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what would I want to do with her brain? She is still sleeping.\" you thought out just as you bring out some gear.

You see, Black Jack was a changeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not a member of Queen Chrysalis' hive, Black Jack hailed from a hive hidden in the Griffon Kingdom. He had been exiled from the hive after he refused to a mission. Leaving his home behind, Black Jack traveled to Equestria in the hope that he could find asylum, ether with the ponies or with Queen Chrysalis herself. Both hopes were quickly dashed when he learned of the failed invasion of Canterlot. The hive went deep into hiding and Equestria sentiments for Changelings were at an all time low. He had no other choice but to hide as well, grabbing small its of love from here and there as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Things took a turn for the worst that morning. He had no idea how bad it would get. And he regretted it even now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Flash back to about an hour ago.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Black Jack was enjoying a rare moment of peace. He was out in a forest clearly full of flowers, choosing to forgo his shape shifting disguise in favor of his usual form. He was alone and far removed from the local roadway after all. Who could see him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He bent down to smell a few flowers when it happened. The air sudden filled with magical energy. He could feel it all swirling around and flowing into a single point right behind him. His instincts took over and Black Jack dived to the left, just in time as a beam spell ripped through the ground he had just been standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned and saw a single grey furred unicorn glaring at him. Black Jack groaned. He was in no shape to fight and he didn't have magic to begin with to battle a unicorn on his own. His only hope was to try and talk the unicorn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi.\" He said calmly. \"Look. I'm not sure what I've done to anger you, but I'll happily move on if want. I don't wan to fight you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Too bad, bug.\" The Unicorn snapped. \"After what your kind did in Canterlot, you really think I'm just going to let you walk away? Not a chance. Get ready to fight or get ready to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The unicorn fired again, Black Jack again dodging the attack. The Changeling went into full survival mode. he took to the sky in an effort to run, only to slam into a magic barrier. The unicorn was much smarter than he thought. With no choice but to fight, Jack dive bombed his opponent, hoping a head on attack would catch the unicorn off guard...It didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he hit the unicorn, a rock slammed into his side. Black Jack was sent spinning into the ground. As he looked up he saw three more rocks held in the unicorn's magic zoom straight at him. The first two hit home, striking him in the head and one of his wings. Black Jack staggered out of the way as another volley of rocks rained down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, in his dazed state, Jack was unable to avoid the third blast of magic. It struck him hard in the chest. He went flying into a tree, smashing right through it before stopping against another one behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By now Black Jack was in really bad shape. Luck was on his side though. During the attack the barrier lowered just enough for him to get threw. Ignoring the searing pain all over his body, the Changeling charged through, trying desperately to escape the unicorn's wrath. Just before he made it, another spell struck him. He only realized what the spell did after he had gotten away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *End Flash Back*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Black Jack buzzed over to a nearby apple tree, quickly sitting on a branch to rest after the huge strain. The spell shrunk him,. He was somewhere around the size of an ant or smaller. His injuries were almost life threatening. If he didn't get some 'love' to feed on quick he was in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as he wondered what to do, an orange earth pony with an apple Cutie Mark waked up to his little tree, a smile on her face, and love in her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ok, you know where this is going. Have fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Where are we, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, middle-aged man with a buzzcut turned around to address his charges.  His name was Captain Lance Shoemaker, pilot of one of seven trans-dimensional pods <i>S.S. Oasis</i> that had taken a chunk of the population to this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We appear to be in a garden of some sort.. be sure to watch out for animals, if they can see us.  This is the designated meeting point for our new colony.  Captain Villareal and the others decided on it.\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two weeks since the <i>S.S Oasis</i> and the other six ships arrived in Equestria.  Earth had been torn apart by the worst epidemic in history, and quarantined with the city of Phoenix, Arizona were the last 2,218 humans alive.  Two technological revolutions for space and dimensional travel had been progressing to find some way to escape the planet and the disease, and it was clear that dimensional travel won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the disease wiped out the human race, the last 2,000 humans were transported to the only other dimension that they knew existed, the world of Equestria, with all the supplies they could think about for mustering up a new life.  They had been able to view it through their monitors, the peaceful (even magical!) world inhabited by strange, pony-esque creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Captain...\" a young man in his late teens or early twenties said, walking up to Shoemaker.  His name was Martin, one of the 15 people under Shoemaker's jurisdiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we finally found one?  A pony?\" he asked.  None of the group had ever seen a pony before, but it had been planned out that they were going to make the inside of a pony's body their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the unexpected side effects of the travel was that Equestria was apparently a lot BIGGER than their world.  Humans were barely the size of ants, if that.  From the scouting reports, their vessels had touched down outside a peaceful hamlet, though it was so big that it would be impossible to get there in a decent amount of time.  They had the supplies, but they couldn't survive out in the world with giant bugs, giant animals, and other dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to build a new civilization within the body of the first pony they saw.  It had taken two weeks for Group 6D, Martin's group, to get to the designated point.  They were ballooned the farthest away when they had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a... cottage?\" a woman in the group asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin strained his neck to see up and in the distance.  A tall mound that he could just barely see the top of loomed above them.  It was like a round house with grass growing on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the occupant of that house is a pony named \"Fluttershy\".  Based on our intel, she is the perfect host for us.  There should be other people there at the docking bay, ready to brief us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek into Fluttershy's cottage lasted nearly another day, but the group of fifteen was definitely relieved by the time they slipped underneath the crack to her door, which was like a giant overhead mountain above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>pound... pound... pound...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the group entered the fold, a massive yellow pillar entered Martin's view, followed by another one.  He craned his head as a wave of fear overcame him, in the heavens was a cladestine pink mane miles above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move, people!\" Shoemaker said.  \"We need to get to the bed by nightfall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's a pony?\" Martin asked.  He could see the vaguely equine shape, but the goddess-like face gave off a remarkably human-like expression.  This one in particular seemed gentle despite her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nightfall, the group had reached the bed, panting for breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Shoemaker!  Captain Shoemaker!\" a small, Latino man greeted them, flying down from a moving, metallic platform.  The man had apparently been up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Villareal!  It's good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you all could make it!  We have found our future home!  Your group was the last one we were searching for, and now we'll all together to begin our new life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have already installed much of our technology...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  Yeah!  Lemme tell you, it was hard as hell to be one of the first groups here!  We had to set up lifts and platforms to help the later groups.  Most everyone is already inside the body, it's just me and a few others on the welcoming committee!  Let's get you all up though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillareal pulled a remote from his vest, pressing a button as a metal lift extending from up on the bed.  Martin, Shoemaker, and the others were lifted from the wooden floor up onto the plush magenta sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Martin said to himself, reeling at the unlevel ground.  That was caused by the titanic weight of the massive Fluttershy, who was laying on her back, sleeping soundly with a soft smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been deposited right on the middle of the bed, where Villareal stepped off the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we've already set up several towns with Fluttershy.  It's been a filing nightmare, lemme tell you, but we've got the basic necessities, and we're trying to figure out some bureaucratic processes.  There are eight towns, each within its own Sector.  As Group 6D, you will be assigned to one of them as your living space and given a duty while we get this place up and running.  These are all a work in progress!  I'll run you through each one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 1: The Brain.  A quarter of our population lives here, in our \"capital\" and central control.  We run day-to-day affairs and used electrical impulses to communicate with the body.  Right now, we're on top of the grey matter, but we're exploring underneath to see what we can use to our advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 2: The Lungs: Controls our oxygen supply, with one half of the town in each lung.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 3: The Heart: Main base is in the heart itself, but this sector is our postal system, using the bloodstream to send mail throughout Fluttershy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 4: The Stomach: Part of our explored frontier.  We're still figuring out this one, though we believe we can get our food supply here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 5: The Nose: Related to Sector 2, and in control of oxygen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 6: The Mouth: Underneath Fluttershy's tongue, we have a small village going.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 7: The Ear: The Communications district.  We have one colony set up within the right ear, which is used to relay sound waves and information about the outside world to central control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sector 8: The Liver: We study poisons that may be dangerous to us here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all of them.  It's turning out to be an interesting place, and now that you're here, we'll be complete.  Now, let me just get your file here!\" Villareal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked at him in amazement.  They had already come so far in a couple short weeks, to turn a living body into a society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillareal looked them over, while opening a pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... according to your files, Sector 6D has been assigned to....</span></div></div>",

Shoemaker and Martin both looked at each other, and then at the rest of the crowd to gauge their reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few slight murmurs to one another, but overall they seemed to think it was an okay destination.  All that was left was to get into the sleeping titaness in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you in there!\" Villareal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking another platform, the fifteen people were at the edge of the pillow.  Fluttershy was asleep on her back with her head on the pillow, but only the back of her ears were touching the pillow.  The entrance to the ear canal would require climbing, something that fifteen people shouldn't do all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If these were human ears, we could probably get you in on foot, but...\" Villareal said.  He pulled out a whistle from the seemingly endless vest he had, and blew into it sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's right ear twitched only slightly, but that wasn't the intended result.  Three men in hazmat suits heard the whistle and emerged from the thicket of Fluttershy's nearly endless pink mane.  They shimmied their way up the back, each one stopping at various points.  When the last one reached the very tip of Fluttershy's ear, they all pulled out three mechanical claws and sunk them into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grabbed onto the handle and pulled with all their might, pulling the yellow flap of Fluttershy's ear back and stretching the cartilage.  Martin took a step forward as the entrance to the canal became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna need this!\" Villareal said, depositing a mining helmet on Martin's head.  \"Care to do the honors, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gulped and stepped up, even before Shoemaker himself.  He pulled himself over the ridge that was the tragus, feeling the fuzzy, yellow ground for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on the light, peering into the vast abyss of the ear.  It was like a cave.  With a deep breath, he took a step forward, watching the dim light around him go out as fleshy ceiling hung far far above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the others lined up in a single file line at the entrance to the oblivious pony's ear.  Martin looked back and noted it with amusement.  It was a comical scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was fuzzy, but not nearly as much as outside.  He heard voices from behind; the others were entering as well.  They ought to be careful with their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground dipped before him as it became a bowl shape.  He must've left the entrance and entered the canal proper.  He had to trudge through the forest of hairs, his comrades right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was near the back of the canal, right before the eardrum, but they couldn't see it yet.</span></div></div>",

The \"trees\" around them were taller than they were, and were covered in a chunky yellow wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaghh!\" a cry from a man alarmed Martin.  The young ear spelunker turned around to see another in their group covered in the same wax from head to toe.  He was screaming as he struggled in a pile of the substance, and the more he struggled, the more he stuck to the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had apparently wandered off to the side, feeling a little too adventurous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Duh.  Ear wax... That's what this stuff is...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, he wasn't really disgusted all that much by it.  There were far worse places in the body where they could've been living; the ear of this pony was probably a safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Shoemaker sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.  Just hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling the man out of the wax, Martin and the rest continued through the forest of hairs.  Fluttershy seemed a remarkably gentle and feminine individual, but there was a surprising amount of ear wax in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Shoemaker shouted.  Off in the distance, a couple miles (by their standards) away, the forest ended as the ground sloped forward once more into a hill.  There was a large pinkish disc that marked the end of the canal, and a much smaller, very visible settlement just before the disc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be the eardrum...  and look!  There are about a couple dozen houses and buildings just before it!  That must be our new home!\" Shoemaker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  They really got things up and running fast!  They already have houses built!\" Martin replied.  About forty minutes of walking later, and he was working his way up the slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" he said in relief.  The other humans had built the village upon a caldera of flesh just before the eardrum.  The first building he came across was made of metal, and he was a hand across it.  They had even used the earwax for stability in the foundation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft pounding resided in his head.  The place needed some form of architectural stability, as every little sound would vibrate the apparent eardrum flanking the village.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest building in the village was in the back, and it was kind of tower.  Martin noticed it's clear purpose was to be an elevator, because on the very top floor was a metal catwalk connecting the tower to the center of the eardrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat catwalk branched off perpendicularly to another identical catwalk, which was built into the drum itself and served as a hallway to either side, where there were two buildings built into each side of the drum.  Martin didn't know what purpose they served yet, but he could see a few people scurrying about up there, the lights in the building giving them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most striking thing was at the top center of the eardrum, where a large metal dish and antenna stuck out of the eardrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you've seen our pride and joy!\" a middle aged man with a vest said, greeting Martin and his group as they took in the village.

Though, if any of you are interested, I could give you a tour of the facility...\" he said, gesturing to the modified eardrum.  \"I imagine this is where a great number of you will be working...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin was intrigued, the buildings of Central Control were quite a bit more complex than the little townhouses down below.  The young man stepped forward, and with great surprise noticed that he was the only one to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Levi clapped him on the shoulder.  \"Come along son, I'll show you the ropes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the group followed another director into one of the townhouses, Martin trudged through the tiny yellow hairs, up a small fleshy ridge until he could actually touch the eardrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great curiousity, he stood alongside Levi, and noticed that the eardrum was constantly vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost yelped when the disk before him opened like a door, just enough to allow them to enter it like it was an elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" Levi smiled.</span></div></div>",

It was time to feed her animal friends, so naturally she was very chipper around this time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was also unaware that a group of tiny humans were building an advanced civilization within her own body.  She did however, know that she had been feeling very weird these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer motor skills seemed increased, her hearing was sharper, and she was had to take in loads more calories at dinner in order to feel satisfied.  It had been going on for a few weeks now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just a gradual change either, it had been so sudden that it was almost scary.  And while most of the changes seemed positive, there were a few that were kind of scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was all alone, she heard them.  Voices in her hand, hundreds of them all speaking in little more than a teeny, tiny, miniscule whisper.  She could only hear them at certain times, and if she strained really hard, but she knew they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had also been a tingling taking place in her stomach, and sometimes her brain throbbed mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then!

I will go to the doctor tomorrow!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's own voice bounced off her own eardrum, also being intercepted by the town's giant satellite dish while being heard by essentially everyone who lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin and Dr. Levi were in central control at the very center, where the latter was giving the former a tour.  Martin had proven to be a quick learner; he had memorized all of the station's functions in little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentral control was a large room just underneath the satellite, where a giant glass window overlooked the rest of the ear canal and the town below.  A few monitors and desks were stationed below the window, where the workers interpreted sound waves before sending them off to central control in the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, sound waves would reach Fluttershy's brain no problem by simply following the entire ear, but that information would be left un-interpreted for the humans in the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, Dr. Levi and Martin heard something that made them pale.  They looked at each other, understanding passing over their features.  Several workers got up from their place at the monitors to begin screaming at each other, looking for any semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Doctor?  She knows!  SHE KNOWS!\" Dr. Levi shouted, banging his fist down on a nearby table.  Martin followed him for direction, even as the controllers ran past them in order to inform anybody they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were so careful!  But we couldn't avoid detection!  Her hearing is stronger!  Although we are miniscule, she can probably hear us just barely.  We obviously had some kind of effect on her body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do, Doctor?\" Martin asked, grabbing the older man's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi regarded him thoughtfully.  Without any training, Martin already seemed capable of operating all of Sector 7.  And for just getting here, he was taking this entire situation well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!  You're coming with me!  To the brain!  We are the only ones with this crucial information, and we must inform the leaders.  I will call a meeting of the sector leaders immediately.  We must avoid being detected!  We would be considered nothing more than bugs to them!  No!  Worse!  Germs!  Parasites to be wiped out at the first hint of detection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gulped.  They were the last hope for humanity too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is when we take the initiative!\" he walked up to a monitor and began typing information into it.</span></div></div>",

Some of my lab assistants will be staying here.  They can help you get settled in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked slightly perturbed, as if he wanted to argue, but he nodded nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Dr. Levi took off, his white lab coat flapping in the wind behind him.  He entered a room in the back of the building, where five futuristic looking pods lay ready, pointing toward adjacent holes in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard the news already, doctor.  The information should have already been received by Brain Central Control, but as a Sector Leader, you need to be there!  We have already readied your escape pod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jamison!\" Dr. Levi said frantically, strapping himself into the pod and placing a helmet on his head.  The aide pressed a few buttons on the nearby dashboard, giving the good doctor a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatch opened ahead of the pod, and a spring-loaded launch pad moved up.  After a few quick inputs, the pod was fired to cruise at a speed of around sixty miles per hour (by their standards)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Levi flew out of the facility through the back of the eardrum, flying back through the rest of the middle ear, past the hammer, anvil and stirrup on a clear destination to Sector 1: the Brain</span></div></div>",

We just go into this whorse' brain and look for all her recipes from her memories.\" That... doesn't see bad- \"Then we erase those secrets from her brain! See? perfect fool-proof plan!\" Oh, no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? That's your wonderful idea!?\" White Star didn't look really convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you really thought that she is actually good at baking? you know, her Special Talent?\" As the second voice of reason, the stallion pointed on his own Cutie Mark \"The whole point of our Cutie Mark in our flanks? To show what we're actually good on at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Listen to him! For all we know she doesn't have any secret recipe because she and her husband are that good-\" The pegasus mare was promptly shut when Bake Mare stared bloody murder on her, she squeaked seeing that stare of pure anger, even the stallion recoiled seeing that gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to believe that! I refuse to believe that this whorse and her ballless husband are better than me on baking! I refuse to let my dream dies while hers thrives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still salty that she and Carrot won that Cake competition, do you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence Red Star!... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">but yes</font> look, we go to the brain, take what we need and get out of her, then we can go back to our bucking lives! Alright!?\" Both nodded. \"Good.. now that we're here...\"</span></div></div>",

These are only a few of the chaotic plans the lord of Chaos, Discord, used in his rein over the land of Equestria. Effective but far from his only tricks. At least, of the ones that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Truth is, Discord formed many plans in his long, long life. Countless bizarre schemes to bring a bit more 'fun' the lives of ponies. Some worked, he kept those, using them slowly over a long period of time to avoid being predictable. Others failed and were forgotten. But some just bored him, quickly abandoned in favor of something more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One such plan involved creating an intelligent race of super fleas. The idea was that a race of talking, magic using fleas could be used to drive poor unsuspecting ponies up the walls. Discord found a sizable colony and gave them pony level intelligence and some magic. He figured they'd build up their society and then revolt against the ponies they fed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Instead, the fleas formed a symbiotic relationship with their host pony at the time, a journalist named Bold Point, and stayed secret from the rest of Equestria, moving on to Bold Point's children after he died and continuing this cycle with each new generation. Needless to say, Discord was less then thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unable to get the fleas to really do anything chaotic and unable to remove the gifts he'd given them, Discord simply left them behind, forgetting them almost immediately. That was almost 2,000 years ago. If he bothered to look again, he'd find things a little different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Inside Celestia's throne room)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A lone flea by the name of Zeck jumped onto the handle of Princess Celestia's bedroom door. Looking around quickly to make sure the coast was clear, Zeck smiled to himself. All was quiet and he pushed through the key hole and into the waiting bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few quick jumps landed Zeck on Celestia's bed, where he found the unsuspecting Sun Princess sleeping soundly, completely unaware of what was about to happen to her. Zeck smiled wider and scurried across the bed to his target, Celectia's head.</span></div></div>",

And there was the rare flea who had nothing more on his mind than power.  A flea like Zeck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his life, Zeck had watched the ponies from his colony.  One of them could stomp out a thousand fleas with one step, but their society was structured, populous, and the most powerful nation in the world.  How Zeck yearned to be able to control it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying over Celestia's pillow, he stopped at the base of cheek and climbed up, resting upon Celestia's nose.  She was laying on her back, a peaceful smile on her face.  His magic would allow her to control Celestia's body completely, and there would be no pony who was the wiser.  He could control all of Equestria.  He just wanted to regard the body he was going to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all of his legs, he bounced up the cheek to the left, the princesses' ear the clear target.  It twitched lightly in her sleep, the golden crown symbolizing her status nestled on top of her magnificent mane.  Why she would wear that thing to bed was beyond Zeck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, he was at the alabaster alicorn's ear, the ridge to the entrance of the ear canal directly above him.  It spiralled inward with a fleshy color to the walls, covered in light white hairs.  It served to remind him that even the being considered a goddess still had a corporeal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced once more, clearing the ridge easily and entering the ear.

Cody is a 13 year old traveller with a sword with lots of spells and tricks he's learned his whole life. He wears a green shirt with black pants and matching shoes and a grey jacket with a hood over his head. He was currently traveling in the chilly part of equestria and heading towards what appeared to be a city made up of crystals. Which was perfect because he's on a personal mission: Go on a fantastic voyage in this \"princess\" of this crystal city. Mostly for research. Cody than summoned his magic sword and appeared in his hand which was a beautiful golden blade with diamond encrusted handles. Cody chanted a spell as the sword glowed and granted him wings to fly for a closer look. He than took off and the view of the city was breathtaking. He saw residents who looked like ponies. They didn't notice him because he was up so high. He than notice a very tall Eiffel tower like structure at the center of the town. \"I bet that's where the princess lives... and that the princess is pretty. Cody than casted another spell that caused him to shrink to bite size to sneak in. He also casted a speed spell to help him fly fast. For a young boy, he sure is skilled with a sword and magic. After a few seconds of fast flying he got to the tall building through one of the Windows and searched for her highness. In no time flat he found the princess who was pink with both wings and horn going to the dining room for a meal. \"Ohh good timing for me!\" He said as he flew after her. After landing on the dining table he saw the princess with another pony, only this one had just a horn. They both shared a kiss and nuzzle. Cody noticed this and whispered \" Hmm they must be a couple having a nice meal together. Sure hope they don't mind an extra\". A voice was than heard \" Prince shining, princess Cadence, dinner is served. His timing could not be more better. He looked out and saw bowls of salad and plates of spaghetti which sure looked pretty good even to Cody. \"Maybe a few bites couldn't hurt\" he said as he snuck into the spaghetti. It was rather nice and warm, which was good considering he was out in the cold. He then started slurping some pasta which was only enough since he was small. Cody already had enough to eat and now was feeling ready to continue. Suddenly he got tangled up in the pasta and was now floating up towards the crystal princesses mouth. \"Ok looks like I'm going in now\" Cody said rather eagerly.</span></div></div>",

When he was close enough, he had to untangle himself from the pasta and leap onto her tongue to avoid her shiny teeth. He does so by cutting the pasta with his sword and then hopping on the food just as it entered her mouth. He jumped off the food and onto her tongue as the rest of the food got chewed. But he quickly lost balance as she started chewing away making it hard to even stand up, let alone focus on magic just to make him float. Cody knew he had to get physical and that's when he saw Cadence's uvula swaying back and forth as she still chewed. \"It's a long shot, but I have to try\" he said. He then noticed the princess stopped chewing which means now he has a chance. Cadence tilted her head causing her food and Cody to fall down to her stomach but Cody has other plans. He rode the chewed up bits towards the throat where the dangling flesh is and with one big leap, he caught it as he watched the food slide down to Cadence's stomach. \"Phew, that was close...and sorta fun\" Cody said relieved. Cody made sure his grasp was hard and firm, 'I just hope she doesn't throw up though\". Just then, he saw light flashing in Cadence's mouth meaning she's eating again. This time she was eating her salad and Cody watched as she chewed her salad causing the uvula to sway again, but Cody was determined to keep hanging on. After a few seconds of chewing, Cadence swallowed her chewed up salad and send it down her throat as Cody continued to watch from her uvula. \"Boy, she sure can eat\" Cody said humorously. \"Now what to do?\" He said as playfully swung on Cadence\"s uvula.</span></div></div>",

Cody heard everything while still hanging over the throat: \"The princess is sick? I should probably put on a protection spell\" and used his magic sword to do so, \"there\" he said to himself while hearing the conversation some more. \"He keeps saying to take some medicine with plenty of fluids and get some rest, which I can't because of all this work I have to do.\" \"Well why not just give one more day and see how you feel in the morning?\" Shining suggested. \"I suppose so\" Cadence sighed, \"Thanks honey\" and gave him a peck on the cheek. After hearing the rest, Cody thinks for a few minutes and figures that maybe she's right, there is more to this \"fever\" of hers. Cody than thought to himself: \"Maybe I should travel in Cadence's body some more and look into this fever she has. If it's something much worse, I could try fighting this virus and heal her. Besides, it the least I could for invasion and could help with my own research! It's a win-win!

After further examination he remembers cadences \"fever\" and realized something: \"Wait, could this be some kind of virus that's making Cadence sick? Hey! Who or what are you? Cody called out. Immediately the virus said \"No one. Be gone!\" In a menacing tone and flew away in the upper passage of the throat. Cody was caught off guard by this, \"Whoa! That thing talks?! Hey wait!\" He exclaimed as he flew after it. In no time he was catching up with this monster but little did he know this virus has some tricks of it's own. Annoyed by this chase the virus uses it's tentacles to sap black magic at Cody. \"Leave me alone!\" It shouted as it casts lightning at Cody.

Well simply put, I am created from the hearts of someone who is full of anger, hatred and seeks vengeance on someone...and is very sick. Who that someone is, I don't know or care actually. All that matters is that I fulfill my purpose.\" \"And that is?\" Cody asked. \"Why to turn this beauty to the darkness! All I have to do is spread darkness in every inch of this vessel! Although it will be rather difficult with pestering me. That's why I'll make a deal with you: you leave right, and I'll go easy on this beauty.

However, Cody still wasn't backing down look actually quite confident. \"You underestimate my own power!\" He said as he concentrated his own powers in his sword and then shined bright. Cody then pointed his sword towards the virus and fired a beam of light directly at it causing to shout in pain. \"Aaggh! You actually hurt me?! Some non pony?!

You want to defeat me and save this princess? Prove it by finding the rest of me into the important organs!\" Cody was frustrated but had to do something, \"Fine, at least I'll take you out first!\" He shouted as he thrusted his shining sword through the virus causing it to fade away. Before it completely, disappeared it had a few last words: \"Not bad boy, but as long as the princess is infected, she will be in grave danger! Still want to risk your life for her? Go ahead! But I warn you now: it won't be easy. The other mes put up a fight like I did!\" It finished as it faded away.

Cody opened his wings back up and followed in pursuit, but was immediately being blown all around smacking into the walls of the lungs, \"oof\"! All the virus did was laugh at his failing, \"hahaha! Aww what's the matter, having trouble getting around fly boy?\" Cody scoffed in annoyance. He now knows this isn't going to be easy...unless he tried timing! He watched as the lungs got bigger and smaller due to Cadences inhaling and exhaling. Cody figured he could use this to his advantage. He than heard the virus taunting him, \"aww! Giving up already? I guess whether or not I move, you won't land a blow on me, hehehe.\" But Cody didn't listen, instead he was waiting for the right moment. As Cadence was about to inhale, he jumped up with wings open and using the air coming in he managed to speed up right at the virus with sword I hand and slash him. *Swish*! \"Arrgh!\" The virus shouted. \"But how did you..?!\" But before it could finish, Cadence exhaled and made u turn causing him to speed right back and slash it again finishing it off as it faded into oblivion. Cody was victorious. \"Well, looks like I'm Cadences breath of fresh air\" he jock as he conjured up a drum and cymbals making a rimshot, ba dum psh! \"Alright, on to the next one!\" Cody said as he exited the lungs and flew deeper to the next destination.

A few minutes later he comes across the bloodstream. Cody can use this to lead him to the heart. Cody then realized something: he has to swim in there and there's no air in here. Fortunately he has another trick up his sleeve...or mainly in his sword. He summons it and conjures up an air bubble around his head in order to breathe. His protection spell he casted earlier also protects him from getting soaked in the crimson substance. He was now ready to swim in the bloodstream. Cody kept swimming until he heard a sound like a drum. He knows what that is. Finally he reached the heart, a very important part of Cadence. Her heartbeats were rather soothing, like it could put anyone to sleep. Cody had to stay awake though to search for the next virus. He saw something unusual up ahead. It's gotta be it. Cody swims up to this monster sword in hand to strike it. Just then the virus spoke in an evil tone: \"Heheh, look who it is, the little pest getting in our way. And here thought you were just invading a princesses privacy.\" Cody answered \"That was my plan at first but after seeing you here I decided to make a little change; starting by kicking you germs out!\" as he readied his sword. The virus just laughed: \"HA! You sure you want to do that, especially considering where we are? Need I remind you where we are? One little mishap could cost this beauties life. Hehehe! I'll tell you what though: if you leave right now I won't do too much to this princess. Oh I'll still do something devious nevertheless\". But Cody wasn't gonna give up that easily. Sure it was right about one thing: if he wasn't careful, well he didn't WANT to think about it. Still he had to beat this monster so he had to think hard about this. Then he got an idea: \"Ok pal, you got me I'll leave. Just try to go easy on this pony at least. She IS a princess after all. Well see ya!\" He said as he casted a spell the apparently made him disappear. Could it have been that easy for this virus? Did it actually win? The virus then laughs out loud: \"Hahaha! that fool! Like I would just cause some minor damage here when I could do much worse! Whelp! Better get started\"it said as it prepares some deadly poison to infect Cadence even more. Just then it felt a sharp pain through it's whole form: \"Ugghhh! What the..\" He said as a sword appeared through it. \"What is this?!\" He demanded. Just then the rest of the sword appeared along with something else; it was Cody! He was still here the whole time! \"Gotcha! Invisibility spell!\" He taunted. \"Nooo! You little...\" the virus tried to finish but faded into oblivion. Another virus defeated. Cody dismissed his sword and sighed in relief. \"That was close! Now onto the last important part. You'll be okay, your highness.\" He said trying to leave the heart. Cody listened to the heart a little more first and was relaxed by it: \"Mmm something I need after this stressful day is over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued...</span></div></div>",

Leaving the heart, Cody kept diving down deeper and deeper until he reached the stomach...and the last of the evil virus. It was a bit tight on the way down but he had to manage until finally, he plopped down to the center of Cadence. The first thing he saw was of course the remains of salad and spaghetti from earlier. He also noticed some stomach acid, but thanks to his protection spell from earlier, it won't hurt him at all. \"Boy, the princess sure can eat.\" He said humorously. Cody then opened his wings and started to search high and low for the monster roaming around here. Cody then noticed some food moving a bit thengot suspicious and took a closer look. Getting close enough, Cody lifted up the pieces of food...only to be surprised by the virus! \"Boo!\" \"Agh\"! They both shouted. The virus was floating right above him laughing evilly: Hahaha! Made it this far I see. So my other boys couldn't stop you! Fine then \"hero\". You want to defeat me and save this lovely mare? You can try, but I won't be so easy!\" \"Yeah, that's what your other boys said but guess what? They're gone! And so are you!\"Cody exclaimed. He summoned his magic sword once again and said: \"Now c'mere so I can cut you up to nothing!\" The virus simply smirked: \"Hmph ok small fry but first let me shake...shake things up!\" Confused by that remark, Cody simply said \"huh?\". The virus chuckled \"hehehe! Well let's just say, I hope you enjoy your ride out!\" It said as it began slamming into the stomach walls. Cody was shocked to the core, seeing this, \"Whoa! What are you doing!?\" The virus laughed again, \"Oh, just making her highness REALLY sick!\" as it continued slamming. Suddenly, the stomach began to gurgle and shake violently. Outside, Cadence started feeling a pain in her stomach, like she ate too much and some is trying to get out. \"Uuuugggghh\" she moaned. Her face was turning green and she placed a hoof to her mouth. She was gonna throw up! Back inside, Cody noticed that both him and some of the food was rising out of Cadences stomach! The virus smiled evilly, waving \"Bye bye\" right before he was launched. Back outside, Cadence rushed over to the bathroom ready to barf, \"Ohh, I hope this at least helps me feel a little better!\" she said sickly. Back inside both Cody and the food were coming up fast. \"Oh man! What now? I REALLY don't wanna go out like this! And CERTAINLY not the other way around neither! He thought. He was coming up back to the throat as he had his eyes on Cadences uvula. It was his last chance. Timing himself, he waited until he was close enough and leaped and successfully grabbed the dangling flesh as the rest of the food was spewed out of Cadence. Of course Cody looked away because he would be sick too just by watching, so he looked away disgusted. \"Ugh, that's not right. Stupid virus.\" After a minute of barfing, Cadence finally stopped, much to hers and Cody's relief. Despite letting it all out, Cadence still felt a little irritation mostly in her throat. *Cough cough* So she then got some water and proceeded to gulp it down, unaware of someone else she's about to gulp down. Back inside, Cody was still hanging on to the uvula (even after that violent cough) and pondered: \"Well now that THAT'S over with, I gotta get back down and finish the job...and fast!\" Just then, he saw Cadences mouth open again seeing a tidal wave of water...which could actually help! \"Works for me!\" He chimed. He readied himself as the water was washing him, plucking him off the uvula in the process and rode the wave back down. He now has another chance to stop the evil virus from making the crystal princess even more sick than she already is. Back into the belly he goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued...</span></div></div>",

Xiawuchi and his family and friends were a rare species of Equestrian termite that made their homes within the musical instruments that ponies liked to play.  Xiawuchi was one such termite in a colony within a cello inside one of Canterlot's finest musical emporiums.  It was a peaceful life, they stayed away from ponies.  The cello was priceless, so they figured it would never be sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the ponies didn't know that Xiawuchi and the others had achieved sentience, that they were just as entitled to life and civil rights as those who were much bigger than they.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, one day the cello WAS purchased atop the music store's shelves.  An elegant grey Earth pony mare was in search for a new cello, and apparently she had a love of expensive, ancient baubles.  From that point on, Xiawuchi and his friends had their home moved, to a small house within the town of Ponyville, where the mare and her loud roommate lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that, Xiawuchi would have never said that he hated ponykind.  From that point on, he would grow to despise the big ones, but more importantly, he especially loathed the demoness known as Octavia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia... it would go down in the colony as a name to whisper to little larva when they misbehaved.  That is, if there was even a colony anymore, which there wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia HATED bugs, and she especially hated bugs that infested her cello, as she found out the day she brought the cello home.  Xiawuchi still remembered the titanic grey face looking in, followed by the ear-splitting scream of fear and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point on, one-third of the colony was squashed underneath her hooves.  His parents, and most of his brothers and sisters survived, but Octavia would have her house fumigated a mere days later, taking the rest of the colony with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiawuchi just barely managed to escape the house, huddling up within an enclave in Octavia and Vinyl's lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge...\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Xiawuchi?\" a peppy female voice said.  His friend Atalia the Ant waddled up to him drawing in the dirt, the cool blades of grass shading them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local ant colony had taken him in when he had nowhere else to go.  They, and another termite colony had helped him get back on his feet, all six of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge... I told you before, Atalia.  I'm just about to launch my attack on the grey demon...\" Xiawuchi said, his pincers morphing into a smile.  Atalia cocked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge... but those ponies are like a million times bigger than we are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I think I'm onto a breakthrough...\" he said, finishing the drawing in the dirt.  Upon closer inspection, it was more like a blueprint.  There were several diagrams of other insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the queen said that she'll support you in any way.  We don't want to get fumigated either, but we don't want to be lead into a death trap, either.  When does this plan of yours go underway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiawuchi grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight.  If her precious music means so much that she'll wipe us all out, we'll see what music sounds like after we're done with her...\" Xiawuchi said.</span></div></div>",

When the lone termite asked to have an audience with her about betting revenge on the pony-god Octavia, she had been expecting him to be mad with rage and asking for a full scale assault. She had been ready for this and was also ready to deny the request while also talking Xiawuchi down in favor of another plan. This was not what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry my friend. Can you repeat that?\" She asked nervously, hoping she had misheard the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Xiawuchi nodded. \"I formally request your permission to take two, maybe three small teams of your soldiers on a mission to infiltrate Octavia and Vinyl Scratch's home. We will invade the target's ears and, depending on how she reacts, force her to work for the restoration of my clan or to destroy her hearing for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The calm way in which the termite spoke tricked most of the assembled ants and other termites to think he was trying for the most peaceful method of attack. Queen Anna and the Termite Queen of the neighbor clan, Samara knew different. They both exchanged glances at the other. The was no peace in Xiawuchi's eyes. He chose this plan both to limit the possible casualties and to force Octavia into one of two forms of torture. Serving the bugs she so feared, or losing the most important thing to her as a musician, her hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Queen Samara spoke first. \"And what of the other team, the third one? I'm assuming the first two teams will be used to infiltrate both ears. What is the third team to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Xiawuchi bowed in respect to Samara. \"You are correct, my queen. The first two will be for Octavia's ears. The third team will invade Vinyl Scratch, her house mate. Should Octavia try to gain help from Vinyl during our attack, the third team will be in place to remove the unicorn as a threat. We can also use her another method to keep Octavia under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Samara and Anna looked to each other as Xiawuchi finished his plan. They both agreed, it was brilliant. With such small numbers they could avoid the casualties they had feared would result from a head on attack with Octavia and the plan actually bypassed direct fighting and put Octavia into a position where she would have to obey their demands or be rendered deaf for life. It was cruel, wicked, near evil and most of all...Their best chance to win without deaths on their side. Anna looked back to Xiawuchi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Xiawuchi. Are you prepared to lead this plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" He spoke without pause or uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Later that night, in Octavia and Vinyl's house)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Octavia and Vinyl were in bed, sleeping soundly under Luna's moon. Neither of them saw the line of ant and termite soldiers climbing up their sheets to begin Xiawuchi's plan... </span></div></div>",

The Queens Anna and Samara had chosen her to lead the Third Battalion of bugs, with Xiawuchi rounding out the First.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was honestly worried for her friend.  Xiawuchi was not a torture technician by nature, and he had come up with such a cold-blooded plan.  When they first found him, he was meek.  Traumatized, in a way.  Months of hatred and resentment had festered inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive.  This is the best course of action to take back our homes and lives.  Anyway, Atalia, what are you still doing here?  I'll be entering the left ear of Octavia with my squadron, but you are assigned to go to Vinyl Scratch.\" he said, noticing that Atalia's squad were waiting for her on the white unicorn's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going now.  They appear to be ready.  Just... don't lose yourself, Xiawuchi...\" she said, before wandering off, scurrying down Octavia's bed post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were at the middle of the sheets, ready to enter.  The grey Earth pony had a frown on her face as she slept, at least that was what he tell from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had one-thousand ants and five-hundred termites underneath his command, a standard squad size for each type of colony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's march!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForming into a single file line that when put together would only cover about a foot total, the column of insects marched with Xiawuchi at the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia did not stir, which was fortunate because she could crush all of them in one fell swoop.  Luckily, she was lying upon her back, her ears pressed into the pillow.  From their vantage point, they would have easy access.  Xiawuchi imagined that the Second Battalion was doing something similar on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, Xiawuchi found himself at the entrance to a grey, dark, and slightly moist cavern.  Octavia's ear twitched slightly, reminding him that the cave was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped onto the ridge and moved into the pony's ear, the single file line coming directly behind him.  It would take almost ten minutes for the last ant to enter, but Octavia didn't stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling hung high above them, grey hairs covering both it and the floor.  He moved past, ready to start the plan.</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't be noticed, as you were small enough to pass for near microscopic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud booming noise assaulted your senses, and your heart leapt into your throat as a red flat stepped into your field of vision.  Glancing upwards to the heavens, you spotted slender feminine legs that reached into your sky, taking strides longer than you could comprehend as they made their way along their errand.  Your miniscule form could just make out a frilly red skirt up in the sky, and you knew that the titaness was in fact Mirajane, the bartender and former S-rank mage of Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no quarrel with Mirajane, however, and let her pass.  Reaching into your pocket, you pulled out a flat disk and pressed a button on the top of it.  A silver metallic suit surrounded you, protecting you from the various dangers that would no doubt happen at this site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had another agenda, and as you started up the rocket boosters in your legs, you caught a glimpse of red hair as you flew up to the height of the bar tables that were the size of mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed course to the shock of red hair, landing on the bar table and retracting your suit.  The first thing you saw was a massive teenage girl by the name of Lucy Heartfilia, who was talking animatedly to the person opposite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you grinned deviously.  The enormous red-haired colossus opposite Lucy was Erza Scarlet, the most powerful female mage in Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had originally come here as a \"science vacation\" of sorts, planning to shrink down and explore the body of the various inhabitants of this world.  The fact that Erza and the other females of this guild were ungodly beautiful was just a bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, things backfired.  You appeared right smack dab in the middle of the guild, unshrunk.  The guild members were sent into a frenzy, and who else would take you down than the stern and impulsive Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you arrested under suspicious grounds.  It had been a setback, but now you were technically a wanted criminal in the Fairy Tail world after you escaped (with shrinking of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you could get back to your original task, and who better to go with than Erza Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little revenge, too.\" you snickered evilly, thinking of what you could do.  Kicking organs, zapping neurons in the brain, taking control of her body.  You may be small, and Erza may be strong, but if you had her brain, even she was helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... where to enter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza was talking with Lucy, a small smile on her face.  She wasn't dressed in  her usual armor, rather simply just her plain white blouse.  A slice of cake was sitting on the table before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you...</span></div></div>",

The titantic fork then scooped up the bite of cake you were lodged in, raising up to the face of the hungry Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sense of vertigo as you were lifted up to the enormous face of Erza Scarlet.  Her grey eyes didn't notice you in the least, not realizing that she was going to allow what amounted to a parasite into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive, fleshy red lips were directly across from him, and you looked on in awe as they parted. opening wide enough to gobble up one million people your size in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous cave drew closer, and you were drawn into its moist interior as the fork slid in and out of Erza's mouth before it closed completely.  You tapped a button on your wrist, creating a small light to see ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be Erza's tongue...\" you say to yourself, as you jab your boot into the wet squishy pink floor that you were standing on.  White spires that could crush you into pulp rose like mountains in the distance, on all sides.  You were truly miniscule.  Cave couldn't even describe it.  This world was like a whole other world to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ooh, nice pearly whites, Miss Scarlet!\" you grin deviously.  As you lounged about on Erza's tongue, your eyes wandered to the back of the mouth, where a massive dangling appendage hung over a black hole going downward.</span></div></div>",

The walls in the distance and the floors were a deep red.

In fact, Erza's body was your oyster now, and there was only one thing to do.  Take your revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suspicious, my ass.  I didn't even do anything, and you still had me arrested!  Well, now that I'm out, let's see how you handle a little home cooking!\" you chuckled deviously, reaching into your pocket and pulling out a laser beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed it at the floor directly in front of you, and didn't hesitate to pull the trigger.  A yellow beam of light emerged from the tip of the laser, burning a spot in the stomach wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world began to rumble as Erza's stomach undulated and gurgled from the abuse it was taking.  Like a slide, you rode the wave of undulation to the very far wall, pointing your laser in random directions and frying the stomach from all corners.  You laughed as you had the time of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Erza fought back a yelp as she felt a sharp burning pain in her stomach.  Lucy looked at her with confusion, taking another bit of her own meal, while Erza rubbed her belly through the white fabric of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erza-san, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, just give me a-AUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same pain happened again as the girl jerked forward.  Every few seconds, a jolt of pain would erupt from inside her, causing her intense spasms as she moved about with an exaggerated expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the stomach, you had reached the very edge of the stomach, and your grin reached its evilest.  Pulling back, you fired the beam at the wall, but held the trigger this time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds later, and you burned a hole in the stomach wall with your weapon, big enough for you to slide your way through.

A few pumping internal organs were set up before you, with the ripped stomach behind you in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  Liver. Zap!\" you said, firing your beam to fry the girl's large red-brown organ before you.  \"Gall bladder...\" you zapped the organ right next to it, putting a hole in that organ as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the giant girl outside scream in pain even from your spot in the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these small time organs are so boring.

That wasn't to say he was anything like Jaune.  Unlike Jaune, who was clumsy, awkward yet overall friendly, Lionel was neurotic, eccentric, paranoid, and mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, bag-eyed with jet black hair, some people wondered why he was still at Beacon.  He didn't have a team.  Not anymore, at least.  He was so strange that they proclaimed they couldn't stand him after two weeks of living together, and for some reason, Lionel was allowed to live on his own after the fact and still attend Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also didn't train, or participate in combat.  At all.  Coupled with the fact of his apparent disdain for the Faunus, cold attitude, and his ability to avoid classes without any ramifications, it was safe to say that nearly everyone at Beacon disliked the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the doors to the cafeteria, Lionel could honestly say he couldn't care less about any of that.  His tired red eyes scanned the room until he saw them.  Team RWBY and Team JNPR sitting at their usual table, chatting the day away.  When he looked at Blake though, everything seemed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw <i>them</i>... the floating black and white wisps surrounding the cat faunus, and the sound of static buzzing around his mind.  Scowling, he sauntered into the cafeteria, passing a few tables and glowering at anyone who would dare look in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake Belladonna was essentially his mortal enemy the moment she stepped foot into Beacon, and the feeling was mutual.  It made sense, a former member of the White Fang and his family's relationship to the Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got close to the table, all eyes locked on him, most of them filled with disdain.  As he didn't get along with Blake, naturally he was the enemy of both teams.  He didn't care about them though at this moment.  The thing he had feared, Blake had the disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grimm... inside her, that only he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scowl on his face, Lionel sat down and pounded the table to get Blake's attention, as her nose was currently lost within a thick book.  A few plates and cups shattered as the entire cafeteria suddenly became aware of the tension when Blake looked at Lionel with barely restrained hatred.  Since his grandfather had always been the one to propose the Faunus be confined to Menagerie, and Lionel had always been one to support that idea... at least until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What's the big idea?\" someone shouted.  It seemed to be Weiss.  The other seven members of the team got to their feet, glaring daggers at Lionel for his nerve.  Yang and Pyrrha even seemed to be on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you <i>want</i>?\" Blake spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...\" Lionel hissed,  \"don't you stupid Faunus <i>ever</i> understand?  It's always the same with you people.  Menagerie, the White Fang, it doesn't matter.  You want equal rights, but you don't <i>listen</i>.  You never listen, and now it's too late.  You have it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palpable anger arround the table turned to confused murmuring.  While Blake still glared at Lionel, she didn't actually have any idea of what he was talking about.  He wasn't like normal Faunus haters.  His reasonings always seemed a bit nonsensical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Lionel left the table without another word, before a fight could break out.</span></div></div>",

At the background, there stands a large white mansion that also looked quite grand.

The person appeared to be a young girl with long black hair tied up by a purple headband, the only thing she's wearing is a light purple two-piece swimsuit, she might have come here for the pool. You watched as she walks outside and towards one of those type of chairs that are used for sunbathing and begin to lie down on top of it. After all that's done, you finally begin to jump across the blades, but suddenly a strong gust of wind blows across you causing you to jump more further than you weren't expecting.</span></div></div>",

So far, they're got nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this project is so BORING!\" cries Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Timmy!\" Chloe tells him. \"The human body is an <i>amazing</i> thing! There's the stomach, which breaks down the for we eat, there's the lungs, which help us breath, and there's the brain, which is in control of everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe is obsessed with the human body, which is why Timmy chose her to be his partner.

Possibly with fairy magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you being sarcastic or dimwitted?\" Wanda asks him. \"Because I honestly can't tell anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I!\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! said Timmy. \"I wish I had my shrink suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo and Wanda lift their wands up and grant Timmy's wish. His shrink suit poofs out of midair. Chloe gazes at it in awe. Timmy goes in it and prepares to shrink to microscopic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Timmy!\" Chloe stopped. \"We're working on this project together! Can't I come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Chloe,\" answered Timmy, \"but this suit only fits one person at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I can watch you travel the human body in that suit,\" said Chloe. Cosmo and Wanda poof a camera onto the chest plate of Timmy's shrink suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this camera for?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for live streaming!\" answered Wanda. \"That way, Chloe can watch you travel the human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY! Everything's solved!\" exclaimed Cosmo. \"Oh wait - who are you going inside, Timmy? Why not pick me? I have raisins in my ears after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but no thanks,\" answered Timmy. \"I think I'll go inside Chloe. Last time, I went inside Vicky in this suit, and I ended up getting an F.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" replied Cosmo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy shrinks to microscopic size and heads towards Chloe's head.

Just make sure to unlock the door so that no one come in. The room's soundproof otherwise.\" \"Great! I have a strap-on in my storage trunk in front of my bed, btw.

Thoughts ran through your mind as possiblities come to you. You rub your fingers across the fleshy walls as you pass them, an odd feeling tingles at the back of your mind. Its the Force reacting to something in the walls. You stop and put your hand on the wall, allowing your connection to the Force to pass your sences through the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just under the skin you feel it. The engery of Ahsoka's nerves, sending signals to her brain. Wanting to try something, you use the Force again to reach for the nerves with your mind. You smile as they react, sparking and sending stronger signals through the nerve systems. You have several ideas on how to use this, maybe to contact Ahsoka for help later, maybe to connet directly into her brain and see what you can make her do. But for now, you decide to activate the nerves and have them send huge bursts of pure pleasure into Ahsoka's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grab hold of the flesh with both hands and simaltaniously use your fingers to massage the flesh and use the Force to start screwing with the nerves. The effect is almost instant as the signals race faster through the nerves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Ahsoka and Padme are going at it like rabbits, Ahsoka on top drilling the senitor with the dildo. Suddenly, she arches her back and her eyes go wide as the most intence feeling of pleasure she'd ever felt, shot up her body from her ass. Ahsoka opens her mouth in a silent scream of pure bliss and starts grinding even harder and faster into Padme. Both felt the pleasure building unto the two women let out loud moans of pleasure as they orgasimed at the same time...</span></div></div>",

Their naked bodies collapsed onto the bed and they fell into a blissful sleep while holding each other. They sigh and drift away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you're still inside Ahsoka's ass. You remove your hands from the wall of Ahsoka's rectum and take a step back in the pulsating tunnel, \"Well, that was interesting.\" You take a look around you. The walls of Ahsoka's rectum are somewhat red and color, as opposed to the pink of a human's, and everything is shiny and slick. You walk deeper inside the sleeping Ahsoka as you continue your exploration of this sexy alien. Moving deeper the walls eventually go from smooth to ridged. you are now inside Ahsoka's colon. You marvel at how clean it is inside here. You may have a long walk ahead of you if Ahsoka is anything like a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two lovers awake. Groggily, Ahsoka and Padme stand from the bunk and put there clothes back on. Ahsoka dons her padawan outfit and Padme replaces her senator robes. \"So we tell no one as usual\", Padme asks. <br>\r\n\"Of course, it would be terrible for my master to find out I had sex as a padawan\", Ahsoka agrees. <br>\r\n\"And I would be in a huge scandal if the public find out, me being a senator\", Padme agreed. \"Well, I'm off, I hope to see you again soon\", Padme grinned coyly.<br>\r\n\"Same to you\", Ahsoka said. Padme left and Ahsoka stood from the bunk. She couldn't help but feel a slight tickle deep inside her. \"I must've eaten something that didn't agree with me\", she thought. She exited her chambers and walked through the corridors of the ship like she would any day, oblivious to the tiny passenger she was carrying with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ahsoka you have reached a dead end, a sphincter. \"Well, that was quick. I shouldn't be reaching one of these this fast\", you say to yourself. Your world sways slightly as Ahsoka walks through the ship. The natural sway in her hips doesn't help you much either. Then it suddenly dawns on you, you have the force. You used it earlier to stimulate her nerves and give her an orgasm. Why not use it now to map out the inside of her body and then you'll know exactly where your going. You place your hand on the wall of Ahsoka's colon and concentrate. You find her nerves that go all throughout her body and tap into them. In a few minutes of meditating you have a complete mental map of Ahsoka's inner workings and know exactly how to travel to any part of her body without having to exit her. This is a dream come true. \"I can go anywhere and stay beneath Ahsoka's skin the whole time. I never have to see the light of day again, I can just stay inside Ahsoka Tano for as long as I want. I can live as a parasite inside her and explore wherever I want and she'll never have to know. This is so awesome\", you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka grabs a cup of water in the mess hall, \"Man, that tickle just doesn't want to stop. If it didn't feel kind of good I'd be annoyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have Ahsoka's entire body to go explore, where do want to go next? </span></div></div>",

It would be even more difficult to get into her womb from where you are right now anyway. You walk through the twists and turns of Ahsoka's colon until you finally reach the entrance to her intestines. This is going to be difficult as you are now going against the natural current of her digestive system, but what could you expect when you crawl up a sexy alien woman's asshole. You approach a tightly shut sphincter at the top of Ahsoka's colon and brace yourself. Using your hands in combination with the force you pull the sphincter open. Fluids rush out and almost wash you away, but you stand strong and pull the sphincter open enough for you to slip through into Ahsoka's intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Ahsoka Tano suddenly feels a slight rumble in her gut. She brings her hand up to her belly and rubs her abs gently. \"Ooh, I wonder what's going on in there\", she says to herself. She boards the landing ship for a mission on a neutral planet, a simple escort, and forgets about the feelings she's been having this morning. She is still unaware of your little exploration of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swim inside of Ahsoka's dark intestines, making your way through the endless twists and turns. Finally you reach your mark and swim towards the wall of her tunnel. You slip through and find herself inside one of her blood vessels. The liquid is so oxygenated you can actually breathe with some difficulty. Now you simply float idly and wait for the current to carry where you want to go. You're not exactly sure where this one is taking you inside Ahsoka, but you know it is taking you to a spot where you can get out of her bloodstream without hurting her and move freely in her body. After a few minutes of floating the vein gets small enough that you can go no further. You have been deposited right at the surface of one of Ahsoka's muscles. You break the wall of the vein and climb out, using the force you also seal the vein back together and allow it to heal. You don't want to hurt your host. You look forward and a large expanse of Ahsoka's muscle all around you. You use the force and examine Ahsoka's nerves to find out that you are now inside her right thigh. \"Damn it, now I have a long climb to make\", you moan. It isn't all bad though, you always did think she had some sexy legs on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka's ship has landed and the senator is ready to be transported. Ahsoka gets word on her communicator that she has clearance to move out after the clones have exited the lander. She sits and watches until the last clone has exited, then she stands. As soon as she takes a few steps she has a feeling in her right leg that makes her stop, \"Oh Ahahaha\", she giggles at the tickle in her thigh. She rubs her leg and wonders what that odd tickle was now that it's stopped. She exits the lander and joins the convoy to escort the senator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have made it out of Ahsoka's thigh despite the violent bouncing. Now you sit surrounded by her hip bones and reproductive organs along with the rectum that you just recently entered through. If you look closely you can actually see through the muscle the jiggle of Ahsoka's ass as she walks. Quite a well developed togruta you are now wandering through. You move your way through the tightly knit muscles all around you and grasp the wide tube that is the exterior of Ahsoka's vagina so that you can shimmy your way up to the top of her ovaries and into her abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahsoka walks she wipes the sweat from her brow. It isn't even that hot out, but Ahsoka is sweating nonetheless because of how unbelievable horny she is for some reason. She's got to keep herself composed while she is on a mission. She can relax once she has gotten back to the ship. Who knows, maybe Luminara or Padme will be there to help Ahsoka relax. If she's really lucky Ahsoka might even run into Aayla Secura at some point. Ahsoka thinks back to how she knows from experience that Aayla is an animal in the sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne loop after another of the intestines you pass by as you use them as both a ladder and a landmark. Once you get to the top of this it's Ahsoka's stomach and you'll be at the center of her body. You finally make it to the top of her intestines just beneath her stomach. You sit and take a breather while you watch the big organs process Ahsoka's meal around you. You turn your head and watch Ahsoka's washboard abs move side to side as she walks. With that swing in her hips it's a miracle you've made it this far. Your breather is over and walk over to the back of Ahsoka's body, literally. You approach the tall, ladder that is her spine and jump to grasp her flexing vertebrae. Compared to before it is an easy climb up to her shoulder blades. You step off the spine and round her ribcage. You are now walking beneath her left arm. As you pass around her torso you watch her chest cavity work. You can see her lungs, heart, esophagus, airway, and everything all in motion. It really is amazing that you are getting to explore this young padawan girl's body. What started out as a dirty little intrusion has turned into an amazing exploration. Although, it's going to get dirty again soon as you round her ribcage and walk behind her breasts. You can see her mammary glands right in front of you and wonder which one you should climb inside. Ahsoka didn't have very large breasts, being as athletic as she is, but they are certainly well formed and perky. If you're lucky, they might even have some milk in them, togruta breast milk. Which of Ahsoka's breasts should you climb in, left or right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole trip back Ahsoka's back has been itching terribly. Then her side began to itch as well. First her thigh tickled, then she got unbelievably horny, she felt a weird tingle in her abdomen all day, and then her back, side and chest began to itch. It hasn't been a normal itch though. Every little tingle and tickle has had an odd effect of turning her on. She's been horny as a rabbit all day long. Today has been a weird day, fun, but weird. Ahsoka sits back and wonders what part of her is going to start giving her a fun time next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand on Ahsoka's rib and make your decision on which of Ahsoka's jiggly boobs you want to climb into. </span></div></div>",

Sitting on her rib you walk over to the mammary gland that is well within your reach. You wonder how exactly would one enter the breast from behind. If you were outside of her body you would try to climb through her nipple, but seeing as how your not this may be difficult. You decide to use the force is probably your best bet on getting through the mammary gland without hurting Ahsoka Tano. You place your hands on the inner wall of Ahsoka's chest cavity and try to find a seam in her mammary gland. Eventually, you find a natural groove and decide to use that as your entrance. Using the force you make a hole open up just large enough for you to climb into. Hoisting yourself up into the hole, you will it to close behind you and seal up as if you never touched it. You are now completely surrounded by the flesh of Ahsoka Tano's left breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka walks through the ship oblivious to the tiny passenger having the time of his life inside her. She walks through the ship toward her quarters with her hips swaying side to side as they always do. She registers many looks from the clones on board as she passes them by. They all like her body, and she kind of likes that. As she approaches the sleeping quarters of the ship the halls begin to empty out. Eventually, there are only a few other people on this end of the ship other than Ahsoka. Suddenly she feels an intense wave of pleasure bring her to a knee in the middle of the hallway. She gasps for air as orgasmic sensations sweep over her from her left breast. She grasps her tit and massages it in pleasure. She has never felt like this before. She stands and regains her composure before someone sees her. Quickly, she heads for her quarters so that she can be in private. She walks with difficulty as nearly every step she feels as though she is almost to orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl through the layers of fat looking for milk ducts to enter that will make your exploration easier. After a few minutes of searching through the fatty tissue you locate one and enter the small tunnel. Looking back you outstretch your hands and close the flesh behind you. You are now completely sealed inside the milk ducts of Ahsoka Tano's left breast. You look forward and are somewhat surprised to see the path get brighter. You crawl forward and see a small chamber in front of you. Entering it, you slide into a fleshy, dark room. It is soft and about the size of an average bedroom. The chamber also contains a small amount of liquid at the bottom of it. It is possibly milk. Obviously, togruta anatomy is a bit different from human anatomy, only slightly though. You sit in this chamber inside Ahsoka's breast listening to her heartbeat and her breathing, both of which are incredibly erratic right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka barges into her room and locks the door behind her. She immediately disrobes and retrieves her vibrator from beneath her bed, massaging her breast the whole time. She lays out on her bed naked and gasping for air, massaging her chest and penetrating herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your world lurches around as if the breast suddenly sprang into motion. Ahsoka just took off her bra, and now her breasts hang free. Even more worrying, the chamber you are in begins to undulate and pulsate all around. Outside, Ahsoka must be rubbing and squeezing her breast around you. She must be able to feel you inside her breast. You have to get out of here and go deeper inside her where it's safe. You try to move through the undulating chamber and climb back through the tunnel you came, but the breast is moving so much from Ahsoka's massage it is making it near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka is near climax. She massages her tits and moves the vibrator in and out of her again and again. Suddenly, she feels another surge of pleasure come from her breast all of a sudden. The feeling in her tits combined with her toy causes her entire body to tense in climax and suddenly relax. She removes her wet dildo from her vagina and takes a few deep breaths as she relaxes. Strangely, she still feels something coming from her breast. It's as if there is something inside her mammary gland that she can feel moving inside her and tickling her. Does Ahsoka feel you inside of her before you are able to get to safety deep within her body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahsoka sits for a moment and allows her hear beat to calm down. As she steadies herself she feels a significant tingle in her left breast. It's not painful, more erotic if anything. This little tingle has been all over her body today and caused her to have quite an interesting mission. Perhaps it's normal, her breasts could simply be growing, that thought makes her happy. It could be a simple nerve impulse. Even if it isn't, it hasn't brought her any harm today. If it is an organism it could be safe to leave it be. She is curious, however, as to what this is. Ahsoka decides to find out for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her breast you struggle to crawl through the milk ducts as fast as you can. If you can get inside her chest cavity again you'll be safe. The moment you reach the point inside her that you entered the milk duct you freeze. You are unable to open a pathway through the fatty tissue with the force. In fact, you can't move at all. You feel yourself sliding backwards the way you came. You know what this is, Ahsoka has grabbed you with the force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand hovers over her left breast and Ahsoka concentrates hard on the tingle she feels. She was right, there is something inside of her, something alive. The thought should in all rights terrify her, but due to the events of today she is more intrigued than anything. Finally, she has a grip on whatever the thing is and begins to pull it through her breast and towards her nipple. She cracks a smile at the tickling she feels as she pulls the little creature through her boob. All in all, this is actually very enjoyable for the young padawan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT SHIT SHIT\", you repeat as you are pulled through the milk ducts. You thrash and fight trying to grab hold of something and stop your exit of Ahsoka's body. You are no longer attempting to block her with your mind, that level of control and calm is long gone. At this point, any handhold or leverage would be all you could hope for but the soft and pliable flesh inside her breast offers nothing but comfort, no means of defense. The invisible force deposits you back in the larger chamber and pulls you toward the opening in the wall of her breast, Ahsoka's nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka concentrates with her eyes closed. She feels the pressure on the other side of her nipple as she pulls the source of her sensations out. She watches as her nipple wiggles and shakes with the struggles of the little organism. She almost has it out now. She holds her free hand underneath her breast to catch whatever may come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRAAAAP\", you scream as you slide through the tight nipple of Ahsoka Tano. You should've known this was going to happen eventually, being discovered by your hostess. You only wish it could've happened later, after you got to see more of the sexy togruta's body. Finally, the pressure is released from your body and light floods your eyes, blinding you. You land on a soft surface and struggle to gain your vision back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka's eyes widen as she watches the tiny organism exit her nipple. She expected a little worm or some other parasite, but what she removed from her body was a tiny...human. Her jaw drops and she deposits the struggling intruder on her open hand. She doesn't know what to make of this. Best to let him explain, she thinks. Eventually, the tiny human regains vision and looks up to her face. Ahsoka stares down at him bewildered and he stares up unsure of what to say. He is the first to break the silence, \"Well, this is awkward.\"<br>\r\n\"You want to explain why I just pulled you out of my nipple?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure if you take anything out of context it would look really bad\", you reason. <br>\r\n\"I didn't pull you out of context, I pulled you out of my tits\", she counters a little angry. \"So start talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you think of you better do it quick, that togruta giantess is pissed. Now you could just explain to her everything, how you snuck in her room, crawled up her ass, and explored the interior of her body. On second thought, that might not be such a good idea even with her being a nice girl and a Jedi in training. You could lie and try to help your case, but being a Jedi in training she might be able to tell. Decisions, decisions. </span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the tunnel shifted from a flat surface to a straight vertical drop as you feel Ahsoka move. You hold tight to the fleshy wall so you don't fall, but it was all for not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You hear rumbling from above, farther in the bowels. You look up just in time to get hit full in the face by a powerful and smelly wind. It knocks you from your spot and you get carried back out of Ahsoka's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sudden light and fresh air shock you a bit as you are shot out of the alien girl's anus. As you tumble, you manage to regain your sences and look around panicy as you free fall. Directly below, you see another anus, this one pink in color, surrounded by white flesh, a human female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wasting no time you aim yourself for this new ass and reach out with the Force. You pull open the ring of muscles and fly straight into the new girl's ass. The combination of gravity, Ahsoka's fart, and your own Force push allowed you travel deep inside the woman, before you landed, a little more rough than you would have liked, at the beginning of a curve that lead deeper into your host's bowels. What now?...</span></div></div>",

You were forced deeper into Padme's bowls, right up to her colon. Then, you were pulled back the way you came as the object pulled back. And then it thrust back in again, Back and forth, back and forth. The motion continued as you tried in vain to stop it, too caught up in motion sickness to do anything. What was happening right now?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ahsoka gripped Padme by the waist and thrust like the was no tomorrow. The senator moaned and cried out in pure bliss as she felt the strap on banging against her insides, the tiny feeling from earlier long forgotten. Ahsoka herself was too lost in the action to care anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh god!\" The young Jedi cried out. \"I didn't know it was so fun to be the 'male'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah ah ah ah!\" Padme barely heard her lover speak. \"For one so young, you're really good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You haven't seen anything yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ahsoka holds her hand over Padme's head. At once, the senator feels an odd tingling sensation run down her spine. Suddenly, she can feel everything double in pleasure. The pounding becomes like sparks of pure bliss in her body. Her orgasm was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Back inside, you feel the thrusting get faster. You are pounded furiously against the back wall of Padme's rectum, and the sounds of your host screaming in joy reach you. You realize, it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then hear Ahsoka let out a scream of orgasm as you're pinned against the fleshy wall and the two girls cum at the same time. You even see a small amount of Ahsoka's juices leak into Padme's ass. She pulls out and both girls fall over on the bed, causing you to bounce around in the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as you think things were calming down, you hear a dull rumble from deeper inside your host. You turn just in time for a blast of air to hit you and carry you right out of the ass through the opening anus. You drop on the bed and gag as your lungs fight for new air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After getting your breath back, you look up and find both girls looking down at you.

She's wearing jeans and a T-shirt that exposes her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she tries to tan, her brothers, Phineas and Ferb, are brainstorming something to do today. Suddenly, an odd scent enters her nose. She gets up from the grass and sniffs her pits. All she smelled there was her Ducky Momo deodorant. After that, the smell came back, and she sniffed like crazy. This caught her brothers' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, sis?\" Phineas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Candace answered. \"There's this weird smell, asked I don't know where it's coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas and Ferb smell the air to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Candace,\" replied Phineas, \"but we can't smell a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd,\" said Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Phineas's face lit up. \"Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today!\" he exclaimed. \"We're gonna build a shrinking helicopter to go in Candace's nose to find out what she's smelling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes pass, and the brothers have built themselves a shrinking helicopter. They hop in it and shrink to the size of a flea. Candace walks to the tiny contraption and bends down to it in able to see it in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go in my nose, I just want to inform you to not mess around in my body!\" she told her brothers. \"If you do, you're busted for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not making any promises,\" Ferb responded.

Still, you continued onwards, and the light coming from Ginormica's butt hole faded away to a tiny, faint pinprick. Eventually you came to a sheer wall with wide ridges -- a place where Ginormica's large intestine curled in and upwards. You landed on a ridge and put on your suit, exiting the sub so you could see for yourself the sheer enormity of the giantess's body. Each ridge, by your estimation, had to be at least fifty feet apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard a rumbling sound from high above you, and the ridge seemed to slant downwards. Your sub started to slide out into the abyss. As you ran to get back in, there was another rumble. You flicked your high beams upwards, and saw a mammoth dark shape the size of a mountain slowly descending. It was a massive turd, and it was about to engulf your submarine! You ran as fast as you could to the hatch, but can you make it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Yes -- just in time to be compacted in the turd, with only your periscope free. You will be stuck there at least until Ginormica's next bowel movement, to which you will have a front-row seat. Just hope she notices before she pulls the handle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

I can't hear my headphones!\" Lucas just ignored Tiffany as she turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, little pest!\" Tiffany scoffed as she left the room. As she was leaving, Lucas got a nice view of his older sister's big, tight, jean clad ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff may be annoying but she is hot. What I wouldn't do to see her naked.\" But then Lucas realized what he had under his bed. He reached under his bed and found a tiny little glass mixture of yellow liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember! Zoc gave this to me if I ever wanted to return to ant size!\" Lucas knew that his sister liked to take her showers late at night, so if he timed, it right he might be able to shrink himself and get a sneak peek at Tiffany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas waited in the bathroom, took off all of his clothes and threw them in the waist basket. Now that Lucas was in his birthday suit, he poured the yellow mixture in his ear, which caused him to shrink down to ant size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I forgot what it was like to be this small.\" Suddenly he heard the giant footsteps he was waiting for. Lucas ran over behind the toilet and watched as his sexy skyscraper sized sister walked into the bathroom, shut the door and started singing some ridiculous pop song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Woooooo!\" Tiffany then set her earphones on the sink and proceeded to strip. First she pulled off her pink tank top and tossed it over her head, then she pulled down her tight jeans, leaving her in only a pink bra and white pair of panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice underwear sis!\" Lucas yelled up knowing she couldn't hear him. Tiffany then hastily removed her bra and panties revealing her giant naked form to her tiny ant sized little brother. Tiffany then proceeded to dance around in her birthday suit, shaking her shapely ass and jumping up and down, which caused the ground to erupt for Lucas and also caused his boner to grow enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany turned on the shower and Lucas ran over to follow her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas realized he needed to be in the shower with Tiff but as he ran forward, he tripped high into the air and landed on the edge of the bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess the potion Zoc gave me also let me jump real high!\" Lucas watched as his totally nude sister rubbed her soap filled loofa all over her jiggly bare boobs and her tight sexy ass. Lucas then saw her turn around and realized that he had a clear shot at Tiffany's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tiffany, you're butt belongs to me now!\" Lucas jumped toward the billboard sized booty and landed straight into her ass hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" Lucas said as he plopped into Tiffany's anus. Lucas realized where was and realized that it was where he was supposed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm in Tiff's butthole! This is totally awesome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas couldn't believe that he got to watch his big sister strip naked and shower, and now he's nestled inside of her ass! This day couldn't get any better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext? </span></div></div>",

Repairs to their world were coming along nicely, and the months afterwards gave people time to mourn for those who lost their lives during the brutal reign.  She recalled having had to send Link back seven years to regain the time he had lost, but it was with a heavy heart that she did such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanon's Castle had been torn down completely, and the newly restored Hyrule Castle was where the Princess of Hyrule found herself living once it had been completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched a ladybug fly away from the daisy at her feet, wondering how things had gotten to be so lonely.  Everyone else in the entire kingdom was busy, and she had always been shut in the castle before Ganondorf's reign, with very few friends.  Looks like she was back to that now.  Not to mention, she had come of age and was next in line to rule.  Her coronation was in three months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would just have to keep up the austere, dignified disposition as royalty and the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes panned down to the daisy at her feet, where she saw another bug doing a task of some kind upon the petal, maybe a quarter of an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pupils dilated and her mouth dropped open at what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Zelda took off the opera gloves from both hands, revealing her dainty, slender hands.  She reached forward to the flower, barely pinching the creature up with her well-manicured nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deposited the being on the soft palm of her hand, and she noticed it was marveling at the ridges of her hand and her fingers in the background.  They must have been enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it... no him up to her face, and realized what she was looking at was a tiny man.  It was very clear, he had the same exact features as a human being, save for the rounded ears that told her he clearly wasn't a Hylian.  He definitely wasn't a Minish either, because he exactly resembled the round-eared humans that came from lands other than Hyrule.  He looked several years older than her, but was still very clearly young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded her with a clear look of intelligence, and had clearly not been bothered by her picking him up.  In fact, the display seemed to make him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sensitive ears pricked up as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, your highness...\"  the man said, before bowing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young princess was typically a very wise ruler, but she had never expected something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" she asked, not wanting to seem rude.  She was lucky there was no one else around to see her in this moment of (what the kingdom would consider) weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Patrick, your Majesty.  Think of my as a dimensional traveler of sorts, but I am also a biologist.  I have come to Hyrule in order to complete some of my latest works.  One of them is about... well, never mind.  Your courtyard just happened to be my landing spot when I arrived.   Of course, you exploits are known even to me, so I felt I just had to meet you in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimensions?  Biology?  Zelda's mind wrapped around the concept; they had sent Ganondorf to another dimensions, so the concept wasn't so far-fetched.  It also wasn't the first time someone snuck into the castle to meet, but this man was certainly... the most unique individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why are you so tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that would be a side effect, I'm afraid.  I am a size-shifter by nature, by after dimensional traveling, it appears that my current size is most natural in this realm.  But enough about me, let's talk about you, your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked perplexed, but she tried to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your face so large to me, it's fairly easy for me to read facial expressions.  I can tell from this angle that something is bothering you, but you are putting on a brave face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, sir!  I understand you are a guest in this kingdom, but it would not do you any good to accuse royalty of such a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarore, her lie was awful.  He probably saw right through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnnd, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had disappeared from the palm of her hand in a lightning flash while she was thinking, but the man would reappear soon enough as she felt a tickle at the very base of her neck just above her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickle moved upward, clearing her chin and latching itself onto her right cheek.  It moved upward and to the center, and what she felt were tiny hands and feet climbing her soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my goddesses!  He's on my face!  He's on my face!</i>\" her mind screamed, her heart beating faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt him climb up onto her nose, and she crossed her eyes to look at him.  There the man sat, on the tip of the royal nose, looking into Zelda's massive blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you listen here, young lady!\" he began lecturing.  Zelda almost fell down.  Here she was, five-hundred times his size AND royalty, and he was going to stand on her nose and lecturing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you went through was a horrible experience that no one should ever have to go through.  You're bottling it up, and that isn't good for anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes began to waver.  She had been thinking about that ever since Ganondorf's reign ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay to vent!  To show emotion!  You should, or you'll just waste away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears pricked at the corner of her eyes, looking to Patrick like twin rivers as they began to cascade down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all my fault!  All of it!  I'm the one that sent Link on that ridiculous mission!  I opened up the way for Ganondorf!  Me!  I'm the reason Hyrule was conquered, and my father died, and I ruined Link's life and people died!  I carry the Triforce of Wisdom and I was too stupid to realize that this would been coming.  Now they want me to rule but don't deserve it!  I can't do this alone!  I-I can't.  I-I'm scared to...\" she blubbered, tears streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was.  All of her insecurities of the past seven plus years, that she wanted to get out but was never able to.  And she told it all to the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on her nose rubbed its tip gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. Shh...\" he cooed.  \"You made some mistakes, but you were ten years old at the time.  You couldn't have known that was what happened, all that matters is that your heart is in the right place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sniffled, getting a grip on her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's normal to be afraid, especially in your case.  You're eighteen years old I believe, and now you're a few months shy of ruling an entire nation.  But the people love you!  They wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stared ahead, drying the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick yelped in surprise as her hand reached out and grabbed him none too gently and whisked him away.  Head spinning from the bumpy ride, he found himself pressed tightly into smooth white and pink fabric, something soft and bouncy beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's hands cradled him as she hugged him to her bosom tightly, still sniffling after she poured out all her fears to him.</span></div></div>",

I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do now?\" Zelda asked, suddenly feeling far more at ease with her guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was planning on getting back to my work.

I suppose I have an obligation to keep you happy.  Tell you what, you help me with my assignment, and I'm yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled, and Patrick yelped once again as she enclosed her fist around him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been three days since Zelda and Patrick met out in the courtyard of the revived Hyrule Castle, and Patrick had noticed that Zelda's mood was getting significantly better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked out well, coming to this video game world.  He expected to be small, but he didn't expect that he would land smack dab in the middle where the Hyrulian Princess was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had planned to get some info on local bugs before he moved onto his real goal: to draw an accurate map of a human's inside and out.  Before, he had thought he would enter some random Hylian, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to talk it over with Zelda first.  His size shifting powers allowed him to get smaller for an indefinite period of time, but he could also take on a human size for roughly an hour before he reverted back into his default size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had told Zelda of his powers the first night here; she seemed especially happy afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Zelda's voice.  It seemed to be coming outside the room, which was Zelda's master bedroom.  This was where he had spend most of his time the last few days, while Zelda performed royal duty.  It was night now, so she should be getting back any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get on the floor?  I want to show you something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Patrick stepped off the nightstand which contained his makeshift bad, and onto the floor.  He heard the rumbling of the door in the distance, and a massive shadow fell over him as the pitter-patter of feet sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came face to face with said feet, very pale and painted with a lovely red polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Zelda's calm voice said from far above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick strained his neck, past legs that went on for miles, before his breath hitched in his throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Goddess...</i>\" a little drool began leaking from the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiling Zelda looked down upon the tiny Patrick in lingerie.  Her tight pink nightgown hugged her body perfectly, showing off her curves and flowing down to meet a small pair of panties of the same color.  He swore the sound he heard was her breasts straining against the fabric, as they were ready to spill forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to have sex with you...\" he blurted out, before he covered his mouth with his hands and paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that to another woman would probably get him slapped.  Saying it to royalty could get him beheaded.  Hell, she could just dispose of him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe she sucks dick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Zelda's smile grew wider, from calm to mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Patrick could react, the long slender toes of her right foot shot out.  Patrick fell on his butt as her big and second toes enclosed around him, squeezing and torso and ensnaring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger girl sat her bed.  The roles had been reversed.  Whereas he had taken the authority the other day to confront her about her past, she was now dominating him with the demeanor of a ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breaking into my courtness, talking back to me, and now proclaiming that we wish to bed me.  Normally, such acts would not go unpunished...\" the girl said to the man between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed harder, knocking the air out of Patrick as his eyes bugged out.  She seemed to know the line between teasing and actually hurting, and would not cross it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip loosened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you what you want, but it's not going to be immediate.  I'm going to make you want it so badly, to the point where you can't stand it anymore.  I'm curious, what is you big mission that you talked about?  I'm curious, and telling me may help me be a little more lenient on you...\" she pouted, releasing her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick climbed up upon the big toe, staring at the princess as he spilled exactly what his mission was.  Her eyes lit up with understanding as you sat back down, preparing what to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... I was going to use another person once I got here, but the situation didn't go how I expected.  So... um... you I possibly use your body as the one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda...</span></div></div>",

As you instinctively move your hands about the alien location your hands and skin end up coming into contact with a rather strange solid object. For some reason it was somewhat rectangular at most yet cylindrical in other times. While it was rather stiff, the strange objects did carry a great brittleness to them, as hinted by the light sounds of cracking. \"huh?\" you mutter having no idea just how you ended up...wherever you were. While you were buried underneath the strange pile of giant stick like objects, you soon take notice over jest how easy it was to move many about. Curious, and not wanting to remain amidst the dark any longer, you soon begin to scurry your way past the large sticks before suddenly being greeted by a blinding light.<br>\r\nAfter a second or two of having your eyes come into focus, you soon find yourself gazing up at what looked like a wooden rooftop. The only exception from an average building interior was the fact that the whole ceiling seemed to be miles up in the air, with wood supports that seemed to rival that of a normal buildings size. \"w-what the!?\" you stammer absolutely dumbfounded by the odd sight before lowering your eyes to gaze about your strange surroundings. All about you was wooden pillars and even gates aligned in rows besides the walls. Just by the many farm tools and giant metal canisters aligning the farthest wall, it was easy to tell that this place looked just like some sort of storing area for animals. However, while this place did look like it would be ideal for keeping animals, there wasn't a sign of life located within the gates at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, you begin to clamber your way out from within the odd pile of sticks, which you soon realize was a ginormous stack of hay, to gaze about the massive interior. Just how you ended up here was a mystery on it's own, however the bigger question of the moment was just who's building did this belong to? As you pondered the possibilities, the sudden loud sounds of a creak immediately catches your attention. With wide eyes, you quickly scramble your way close to the massive hay pile before slowly peering out at the direction of the Creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! what a day.\" The sound of a young female voice says followed by what sounded like a small groan. With dumbfounded eyes, you watch as the mysterious stranger makes her way into the building. Adorned on her head were long locks of dark orange hair that flowed down her back in a rather lazy fashion. The front of her bangs were oddly parted, each section ending up with curled ends with large blue eyes located right beneath them. The strange giantess was garbed in a simple blouse with a yellow handkerchief as well as a rather long violet skirt stopping slightly above her ankles to reveal her worn leather boots. With each step this strange giant girl made, your whole surroundings, as well as you, were shaken about with each loud Boom. After moments of unbalanced tremors, you quickly gaze up to notice that the giantess was standing right before the hay pile. Without warning, she lazily turns her back towards the mound of straw before lazily lying back with arms out stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact from her landing did cause the hay to shake violently besides you, though luckily you manage to keep a steady footing. As your eyes continue to gaze upwards you notice her massive hands lazily limped under a pile of supporting hay. \"Ahhh....It feels great to take a breather after such a long day of work.\" you hear her voice emanate high above. After minutes of utter silence pass by, a rhythmic breathing was eventually heard from above the pile. Just by noticing her limp hand and the repeating calm breaths escaping the giantess, it was easy to assume that she must've fallen asleep. With a small sigh of relief, yet an ever-growing curiosity, you begin to gently clamber your way upwards the giant hay mound. After minutes of trial and error, mainly due to the brittle nature of the hay, you finally make it to the top where the girls massive abdomen lied before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust from the vantage point you were in, you could tell that this giant girl rivaled that of any skyscraper known in existence. The only question right now though was just what to do...</span></div></div>",

One voice was beckoning you to explore this massive beings body. At your current tiny size this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Why bother trying to pass it up? On the other hand, the other voice was urging you to act more rational. There was no telling how dangerous it would be trying to scale this huge girl's body, let alone the consequences that should follow if she woke up. As you stand still, deciding which side to choose in this awkward predicament, it seemed that the evil side was just too good to pass up. Besides, you could always try and be careful when scaling up her body. With the decision made, a small smirk emerges on your face as you carefully walk up and grip the white fabric of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The ascent upwards was quite easy to say the least. Thanks to the soft fabric and steady position of the ginormous farm girl, clambering upwards proved to be quite the ease. You were just thankful that there was barely any sign of movement from the sleeping giantess as you were now past the midway point of her abdomen. After a few more minutes passed by, your muscles soon began to feel the burning twinges of the seemingly simple exercise. \"Almost...there.\" you huff as you finally manage to pull your form up and onto the slant like surface of the abdomen edge. Taking a brief moment of respite, you immediately catch your breath while kneeling down upon the soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final inhale, you gaze up at your current location upon the huge farm girl's body. To avoid falling off and risking the climb once more, you quickly crawl your way towards the center of her abdomen where her supposed navel rested. Once there however, you could feel the floor beneath you rise up and downwards from each breath that the giantess made. While it was somewhat calming, your focus soon shifted towards your next decision. just where will you go to explore upon this massive sized female?</span></div></div>",

She was lying down in the grass near the massive lake, pretty much motionless. Was she dead?

Upon making your way to the bottom of the princess's chin, you slowly trek your way towards her lower salmon hued lip. To your surprise, your movements hardly managed to make the princess shudder, let alone budge a muscle. Then again, at your current size, you doubted she even realized you were on her body. After a rather arduous climb up the smooth surface of Ruto's lip, you soon manage to stand before the closed crevice that sealed her mighty maw. The only question now though was just how were you going to slip your way inside her with her mouth closed shut? Whether it was assistance from the goddesses or some delayed reaction from Ruto, the huge maw slowly begins to part unleashing a torrent of hot gust from within the pink abyss. Immediately, you lowered your body into a bracing position to avoid being thrown off by the giant exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the current begins to die down, you quickly stood up before inching closer to the parted lips. \"Here goes nothing.\" you mutter aloud to yourself before taking a deep breath and leaping straight into the depths of the Zora's mouth. Seconds of free falling later, your lower body plummets against an extremely slimy surface with a *SPLAT* to follow. the entire texture of the tongue was odd to say the least, feeling bouncy yet squishy enough to sink your body down the muscle. All about you, humidity and warmth radiated as the entire inside looked like some shadowed pink cavern. Further below, wafts of the hot breath from earlier blew out periodically, brushing against your upper body with each escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was amazing to be within the inside of the zora princess's royal maw, there was no denying the troublesome placement of your position. With Ruto lying down on her back, trying to keep a steady grip upon her tongue was a near impossibility. The saliva coated surface was nearly impossible to keep hold as traction was completely devoid all about. The only main reason you managed to stay steady was because of your location close to the tip of her tongue. Regardless though, you weren't going to let something like this dissuade you from venturing deeper within the princess's body. In fact, you could easily dive your way down into the awaiting gullet down below if you so desired. But then again, why not take in the sights of her mouth a little longer? It certainly wouldn't hurt or anything.</span></div></div>",

Never in your life you'd think to meet a videogame character...let alone enter inside them! Regardless of this, you had to swallow the facts down. You were inside of Princess peach's belly while she was outside snoozing about. As your eyes quickly shift about the interior of the pink slimy chamber, the loud echoing eruptions of gurgles mixed with heart beats resonate all around you. Fearful of the predicament at hand, and more than unwilling to become peach's next snack, you quickly scan about for some means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing up above, the entrance of the princess's throat was roughly around three stories up, a near impossible feat to a normal human being like you. \"Sheesh, how would Mario do this?\" you grumble before another loud groan shakes the digestive chamber. As you manage to keep a steady footing on the odd squishy floors, your eyes immediately follow the source of the sound...which just so happened to emerge from deeper within Peach's body. \"N-No way...\" you mutter gazing further down the stomach interior straight at the pink sphincter adorned at the bottom end of the wall. \"You're kidding me.\" You shake your head in disbelief, unsure and unwilling to accept the possible escape route. Upon doing so however, another loud gurgle fills the chamber only heightening up the bubble production by two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm doing this...\" you murmur as your eyes continue to gaze deeper down at the lower opening. \"But...if it will help me escape...then so be it.\" you sigh, seeing as how contemplating would only waste more of your precious time. With matters settled, you carefully huddle against the squishy surface of the belly's walls as you slowly sidle your way towards the opposite end. Luckily for you, the stomach acid rested further below the bottom area of the stomach, barely rising up towards the direction of the walls. While the acids were a rather safe distance down, you wished the walls wouldn't move so sporadically about. At times you'd think the stomach actually wanted you to end up digested just by how feverish the walls pulsated before you. Despite the tribulations faced with the slime coated walls, you eventually managed to make it within mere feet towards the bottom stomach opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" you sigh in relief. \"Now all i'll have to do is-\" your sentence was soon cut short however, as one good gurgle manages to shake the stomach once more. Taken completely by surprise, you latch on to the nearby walls before turning to gaze at the acid behind you. Within a matter of seconds the acid begins to-</span></div></div>",

Well, mostly for Seiko since she liked to play with Naomi's boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would've been an ordinary night for the two, but everything changed when Seiko pulled out a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seiko, what is that book?\" Naomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this book is filled with spells. Ayumi gave it to me at lunch today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spell book?\" Naomi became filled with fear from hearing that. \"Y'know, we shouldn't be messing with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Seiko replied, \"I'm not using it to summon a demon or anything! Besides, it's a gift, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning to do with it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this spell that can make a person invincible, but they'll become the size of a gnat. It's kind of like a 'Would You Press the Button?' scenario where you have the choice to do something, but there's a tradeoff involved with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that spell's description made Naomi filled with more worries. Seiko must be planning it to use it on her for whatever antics she's up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna use it on me, aren't you?\" Naomi asked with a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiko gave her a sinister smirk as she reads from the book, \"Subscribe-icus to Anime-icus America-icus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing those words, Naomi's worries changed into thoughts of exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that seriously the spell chant?\" Naomi asked, \"That is the stupidest chant I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Naomi blacked out and laid unconscious for 5 seconds. The moment she got up, she realized how big her clothes got. With her clothes being too big for her, this gives her the realization that she shrunk. The spell actually worked! Her worries returned right as Seiko lifted up her clothes off the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are!\" Seiko said. As Naomi observed, Seiko was flat-out naked! Naomi's worries came back. \"Now we can have some fun!\" Seiko continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're gonna do to me?\" Naomi worriedly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Naomi, I've had fun playing with your body, so I thought it might be nice of you played with my body,\" Seiko answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but why change my size?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can explore my body, DUH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiko picks up Naomi to think of where her tiny friend could explore.</span></div></div>",

Orbot notices Big in one of the submarines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he yelled. \"Get out of Eggman's shrinking submarine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking submarine?\" Big questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Cubot answered. \"It's a submarine that can shrink! It can even fly, and it has a built-in pizza oven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot smacks Cubot in the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what it does, huh?\" said Big. \"Maybe I can find Froggy with this!\" He turns on the shrinking submarine, and it shrinks to the size of a flu virus. Big takes the wheel and flies off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sub was a voice-activated GPS. Big thought it would help him find Froggy, so he tells it, \"Help me find Froggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sub goes on autopilot and heads to where Froggy is. The sub ended up going to Amy Rose's house. In it, Amy is sleeping on the couch with her usual dress on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this where Froggy is?\" said Big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GPS detected Froggy to be inside Amy. Luckily, at Big's size, he can enter her easily. Any idea on where to go?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> This interactive will combine 3 things: Giantesses, anime, and Endo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Endo is a sub fetish, usually of giantess, in which a human is shrunk to near microscopic size and travels around inside a normal sized human's body. Think Fantastic Voyage. So, in all my perverted thoughts, I J.M.Darkly have built this into a giantess anime story. This is more experimental than anything else so rules are as follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1) Use good grammar. If I can't read it or it doesn't make sense I will delete.<br>\r\n 2) You can use underage characters, but do not put them in sexual situations.<br>\r\n 3) Only female giantesses.<br>\r\n 4) Go nuts. I want to see what you guys can do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 4/8/2015: I have changed the name of this interactive so that we can include more stuff. Now, you no longer are limited to only anime. You use videogames, comics, live action stuff, anything you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The link to the video game and others section: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1980225-Endo-Chronicles/map/155332222222222222222222\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1980225-Endo-Chronicles/map/1553322...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, I am including one more rule. Recently, myself and another write have started a story line that has bugs invading the bodies of giantesses to mess with them. It has come to my attention that some readers may find this disturbing. As such should any new chapter include such content, I ask that the chapter title end with this symbol: *. This is to warn readers what they are getting into and to turn back if they don't wish to read about bugs doing endo. Thank you. </td>",
