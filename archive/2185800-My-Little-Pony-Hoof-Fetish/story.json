You weren't exactly sure what happened or where exactly you were now, but you certainly know that you didn't fall asleep there. Confused at your predicament, you searched around the place until you saw some small buildings up ahead from your location. Unfortunately for you, as you approached closer to civilisation, you figured out that you were transported to the world of My Little Pony once you laid your eyes on the casually walking ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you weaved your way into their society and have been living in a small house near Ponyville. Life inside Equestria was peaceful and quiet for the first few weeks since you got here. You were still human, but it didn't stop most of the ponies from being friendly towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, today was going to be very interesting (and perhaps troubling), and it was all going to start with one particular pony. Now choose an option and seal your fate!</span></div></div>",

But, despite the amount of ponies you befriended, you had a major foot fetish that slowly morphed into a hoof fetish. It was a drawback to have, but for the most part, you managed to control that part inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning started with you waking up from your nice little bed. You yawned for a bit before getting up on your feet and walking to the kitchen. You smiled; there couldn't be anything better in the world to start off your day with a healthy and delicious portion of homemade breakfast. You made yourself a piece of toast and poured yourself a cup of apple juice made from the apples in Sweet Apple Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of your story was not going to be relaxing at all. You were just about to chow down on your perfect breakfast when the doorbell chimed throughout the house. Frowning slightly, you put your toast down and walked up to the front door, wondering who was disturbing you this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you heard a unmistakable female voice call out your name, \"Are you awake yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even opening the door, you could instantly tell that your visitor was Rainbow Dash. You smile. You can't deny that the blue pegasus was one of your first and best friends in Equestria. Even though you were a little sensitive for her taste in terms of romance, the two of you remained good friends, goofing off and having fun with each other once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let Rainbow Dash in, letting her lie down and relax on your couch in the living room while you continued eating your breakfast. It didn't take long though for Rainbow Dash to get bored in your living room and walk in your kitchen to make your day get a little... entertaining for her.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately. she wasn't giving up without some fight. Rainbow Dash called you by your name, dragging out the syllables (or lack of), making you slightly tilt your head up. Thankfully you were just about done with your meal that you could focus your attention on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Dash?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cruel smirk started to form on her face. Wordlessly, she adjusted her position, hovering upwards just a few inches above the floor, until her face was at level with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my hooves clean,\" Rainbow demanded, lying down in mid air and extending her hind hooves to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, you just stared at the sweat-covered hooves, getting a small whiff of them. Surprisingly, they didn't carry much of a strong odor other than the damp smell of rain with a hint of feminine sweat mixed into it. Before you could look at any other details of her hooves, you were interrupted by the sound of Dash's cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your composure and blinked in disbelief, \"wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me. I know you want to worship them badly so why don't you just lick them already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... how do you react to this command? Your first option is to just shut up and comply with her command. After all, judging by the excitement in your pants, your mind is screaming at you to take this opportunity. Another option is to refuse. Your face is not some doormat in both senses, that ponies can use to wipe their dirty and sweaty hooves. How she found out about your hoof fetish was another question entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what is it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Driven by the sound of her raspy yet somehow voice, you felt the need to please the blue horse and comply to this one simple demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes once again focused on the two hind hooves that were inches away from your face. You took another sniff and instantly shivered from the euphoria of it but despite the aroma that was messing with your senses, you still hadn't started cleaning them with your tongue. They just looked so sweaty and you were getting so turned on that you grabbed her leg and buried your face in the frog of the hoof. Eventually, you started sticking your tongue out and licked the sweat of the hind hooves. At first, you took small but gentle licks while you kept sniffing the hoof, but as your senses were filled with the smell and taste of Rainbow's fresh sweat, you started taking bolder movements, and starting coating your entire tongue in her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rainbow Dash couldn't help but laugh a little at your efforts to clean her hind hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're doing this!\" she mocked, \"If you loved my hooves that much, how about I just make you my little hoof slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

With your face still buried in her hind hooves, you meekly yelp out your confession, while Rainbow's sweat continues to invade your mouth as you speak. You pour out your feelings over how much you're enjoying worshipping her, and how much you'd love to belong to her forever - doing whatever she pleases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpectedly, Rainbow Dash hears your little speech and temporarily retracts her hooves from you, giving you a quizzical glance at your panting face, \"Dude, you seriously want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were desperate to do anything just to get those hooves back on your face so without thinking about the consequences, you nod and beg to be her hoof slave. Watching carefully, you saw the emotion on Rainbow Dash's face from confusion, laughter before finishing with a wide and mischievous smirk. Without warning, she flew towards you to lend her hind hooves back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew you loved my sweaty hooves,\" Rainbow Dash teased with a wink as she rubbed the smelliest parts on your mouth, \"You must've wanted to lick my hooves clean every time I finish practising with the Wonderbolts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only moan in pleasure as Rainbow continued to overwhelm your senses with her sweaty hind hooves. Lapping it up like a love sick puppy, you took long deep licks into the centre of her frog, getting the moist dried up sweat taste into your mouth. You shuddered from the pure intensity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right slave,\" Rainbow Dash cooed, a seductive tone present in her voice, \"Keep licking! Maybe I should invite my other friends for you to clean their hooves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't care less what the cyan pony did to you now. You were too much in a state of euphoria to even think about what Rainbow just said. All the saltiness of her sweat made your taste buds tingle and you couldn't help but to lap up ever area of the frog. But it's really lonely just worshipping one pony alone. Maybe one of Rainbow's friends should join your company!</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long to finish your breakfast but every time you took a quick glance at her, you notice by her facial expressions that she was definitely planning something for you, but you couldn't work out the reason. This observation made you curious a little but you decided to keep quiet about it, brushing it to just paranoid thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rainbow Dash always acts like that... right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else happened that was out of the ordinary and a quick shower later, the both of you eventually left the cozy interior of your house towards the outside to get some sun. You know fully well that it's Rainbow Dash's only day off from her job and you needed to catch some hang time with her... and what batter way to do that than in the Ponyville park. Well, not really but Las Pegasus was both too expensive and far away. Despite this, Rainbow Dash was content with the choice of location and didn't seem to mind when you told her yesterday about the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unbeknowgst to you, Rainbow had a plan of her own and has invited one of her other friends to execute it. She was going to give you the best (or worst) day of your life and you were completely unaware of it yet. Unfortunately for Rainbow, her choices were limited. Twilight Sparkle and Rarity wouldn't approve of her methods in the first place so this left only three of her closest friends to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are three options Rainbow Dash could've taken.

It was strange and confusing at first but over the following weeks, you've made many friends and adjusted to their way of life that you felt that you belonged here anyway. But despite how well life was currently treating you, you still needed to find a way to make some quick cash in the form of bits. That's where all the trouble started: with a babysitting gig that you blindly accepted. It sounded so easy but in reality it turned out to be far harder and embarrassing than you ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour story started with you standing at the front of a nice looking house in the presence of a beautiful sunset. Your body was shaky but you were still excited for this opportunity. Taking a deep breath, you knocked on the door. A couple of muffled voices echoed from inside the house for a few seconds, before the door finally opened, where a light tangelo pony stood to greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening,\" the light pink earth pony welcome, \"You must be the babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Mane Allgood,\" you replied back, feeling a little shy, \"Yes, I'm here to babysit Scootaloo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare giggled a little, sensing a little bit of your nervousness, \"How are you feeling about tonight?\" she asked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling alright I guess,\" you said with a smile, \"Don't worry about me. You're in good hands with me by your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the only one with hands around Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, \"Yeah, yeah. Is there anything to watch for while I'm watching Scootaloo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare answered honestly, \"Yes. You need to be sure to pay attention to everything that's going on. Sometimes Scootaloo will sneak out of the house to hang out with her friends, and then you have to deal with that. If you must, you can let Scootaloo invite them over. I'll be back in a few hours, so look after Scootaloo okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, understanding her instructions. She walked out of the house and gave you the keys before she headed off. Once she was gone, you turned your attention to the task of getting yourself prepared to look after the young filly. The first thing you did was...</span></div></div>",

Chuckling to yourself over that thought, you walked up the stairs to the second floor. As your footsteps headed towards her bedroom, you briefly glanced the upstairs hallway, noting how modern everything looked, from the sleek light brown walls to the comfortable carpet that brushed against your feet. It was homely, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived at her bedroom (conveniently located at the far end of the house), you noticed that the door was closed but there wasn't any lock visible. You knew you could've pushed the door open but you wanted to be nice first. You gently tapped on the door and stood by for a response. A few seconds later, you heard a raspy tomboyish voice answer through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and let yourself in, where you saw a small orange filly pegasi on the table, writing on what appears to be her homework. You could take a good and accurate guess on her personality based on the way she decided to decorate her bedroom interior. Her tomboyish nature definitely shined through the posters of the Wonderbolts and Rainbow Dash plastered all over the walls but there were also some more girly memorabilia obscured away. On Scootaloo's table, you also saw a picture of her alongside with a yellow earth pony and a white unicorn, both of them looking to be the same age as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're the new babysitter?\" Scootaloo asked, placing her pencil down and spinning around to see you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"Yes Scootaloo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Scoots.\" she said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Scoots. So, how was your day at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo's purple eyes lit up, as if she was waiting for an opportunity to tell you everything about her, \"It was pretty awesome! Me and the other Cutie Mark Crusaders had a lot of fun with all our other classmates...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dragged on and on about how great her school day was and what she did with that time, you couldn't help yourself staring at her hind hooves. From your view, there was a lot of sweat and dirt on there, and even if you weren't close to her, there was a slight earthy smell that tingled your nostrils a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've been staring at my hooves a lot,\" the orange filly pointed out, \"What gives?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe this could be the one that could break the mold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A few rules if you want to add a chapter:<br>\r\n</b>1. This really should be obvious, but make sure you have good spelling and grammar. Not asking you to be absolutely perfect but there is a limit.<br>\r\n2. Unless it's a choice chapter, keep it at least a few paragraphs long. I'm pretty lenient on this rule so it's okay if you're writing a bit short but if it's blatantly obvious that your chapter submission is literally just a sentence, I will delete this and message you about it.<br>\r\n3. Speaking of choice chapters, don't add 5 chapters to this with all of them questions about which pony you want to go with. If you're going to do that, at least add to the main story or be clever about it and weave the story into your choice chapter.<br>\r\n4. Shrinking... while I may allow it later, please refrain from micro/macro stuff. There's other interactives for that.<br>\r\n5. The focus of this story is the protagonist (aka you) to be inducing in some hoof play with the ponies. Preferably hind hooves but the front ones are fine as well. Just know that while other sexual things will be allowed, keep it in the hoof fetish territory.<br>\r\n6. It's 18+, not GC or higher. Use your judgement on what this entails.<br>\r\n7. In terms of filly characters like Apple Bloom and whatnot, don't write anything sexual. Keep it at a PG level for those kinds of characters.<br>\r\n7. If I feel the need to add more rules, then they'll go here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese rules might seem a little scary but don't worry, I won't bite much. Besides, since this interactive is brand new, I'm offering some GP like some of the other ones. Up to 6,000GP (for the non-choice chapters). It will be lowered fairly quickly if this gets popular.</td>",
