You notice a small elderly woman with white hair, wearing some long Floral patterned dress, she was trying to reach for something on a high shelf, you decide to be kind and help her out, you go to reach for the box of cereal she was straining for when out of nowhere she smacks your arm out of the way, confused you look down and see her cursing you out, stepping back you ask what\u2019s wrong? Before she yells: ITS MY CEREAL. In shock you step away, baffled by the situation you struggle to find the words to respond and so decide it\u2019s better to leave her be, as you turn around you being to mutter under your breath: what a crazy bit- but you\u2019re cut off by her loudly chanting in some weird language you don\u2019t recognise, freaked out by the woman you begin walking away at pace, as you leave you definitely hear your name mumbled by the woman once or twice, hoping she\u2019s just a lunatic you pay for your sweets, get into your car and go home, on the way home you\u2019re staring plainly off into the middle distance as the sun starts to set and the sky begins to turn a lovely shade of pink, you look up at the sky and marvel at it for a moment, but as you do you notice a small green flashing light in the distance, curious you lean forward to try and get a better look when you accidentally swerve and nearly clip another car, brought back to reality by a loud piercing beep from the other cars horn, pulling back into your lane you forget about the light and continue home. You walk through your door and nearly drop from exhaustion, the drive back was especially draining for some reason, you hear your step sisters playing video games in the front room and your step-mother in the kitchen blending another one of her energy super smoothies, you\u2019ve got a big day ahead of you tomorrow, Halloween in your family has always been a bit of tradition, nothing ever goes well though, and honestly that\u2019s part of the fun, after standing in the doorway for maybe a bit too long, you decide to:</span></div></div>",

Millions of questions flooded your mind but only one mattered the most right now, how were you gonna survive this! Right as you thought your life was about to end, you brace for impact, the left side of your body impacts with something, then it gives and you fall slightly more, then you bounce slightly, bewildered you look around and survey your surroundings, you are in fact surrounded surrounded by giant sweets, chocolate bars the size of buildings and bags of Haribo bigger than you! You look down and see the worlds biggest flump, that was actually just a regular flump to anyone else, you say a little prayer of thanks to the giant marshmallowy god, your happiness is short lived though as you soon hear banging, coming seemingly from everywhere, you look around but all you can see is the blue walls of the plastic bowl you\u2019re now trapped in, looking up however you see a huge pair of breasts hanging over you ominously, you recognise them immediately as your step mothers boobs, you can\u2019t see her face over them, only the tip of her hair, you see it turn left and right as if looking around, then you hear in a booming voice: his friends must\u2019ve come to pick him up. With this the bowl begins to shift and move, you lose your footing and fall deeper into the confectionary, you can still hear her voice echoing all around you: he could\u2019ve at least let us know, or put this bowl out for the kids, I need to talk to that boy when I see him. With that you hear the creak of the front door opening, and suddenly, even at the bottom of all the chocolate and sweets, you feel the temperature drop significantly, she must be putting the bowl outside! Suddenly, the motion stops and everything is still again, you\u2019re lucky it isn\u2019t raining, otherwise this would be a lot harder to survive, you hear the front door slam again, then the only sound is that of the nocturnal creatures, you feel somewhat safe surrounded on all sides by familiar faces, there\u2019s a snickers on your left, you fell onto a bag of haribo, and the rest of the space is being covered by a packet of chocolate buttons, you sit for a minute and think about how this could have happened to you. Eventually you narrow it down to the fact that it was either the green flashing light, that crazy woman at the store or something else completely unknown. The crazy woman seems the most logical, if logic is even something that exists anymore, she must\u2019ve put some kind of curse on you, but that\u2019s impossible, that\u2019s all fantasy and make believe, you think to yourself sat only a few centimetres tall in a bowl full of sweets on Halloween night... You hear a group of children approaching the house, you hear them read the sign your mother always leaves out aloud: please take one and have a happy Halloween, they all say, you hear 4 female voices. Suddenly!:</span></div></div>",

The worst part is that you all had a pretty good idea of who was behind the robbery, but couldn\u2019t prove anything. And heading the four voices giggling above you as the bowl bounced and swayed, you feared you were right. Which is bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fate Was sealed when you overheard one of the voices say: no Cindy, you\u2019re not hogging them all to yourself like last time. Dammit. Dammit dammit dammit. You repeat to yourself, of all the entitled little brats to take the bowl your family kindly left out, it would have to be the group of spoiled rich brats that like in the wealthy part of town, They came in to your shop all the time and would always talk to yourself and other customers like they owned them, they acted so much better than everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n last you saw them they were 16, but that was 2 years ago now, they went away on back to back holidays for 2 whole years with their parent money, surely they\u2019re too old for trick or treating by now, the entitled spoiled little shits they are you were thinking to yourself, the girls were being obnoxiously loud as usual, they were chatting about all their travels and the different boys they fucked and all the strange expensive food they\u2019d had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night dragged and dragged and dragged as you were routinely thrown between the girls, each being too lazy to carry the bowl for too long occasionally you would be pushed further down by more sweets being added to your prison, and sometimes the weight would become lighter as they took off a chocolate bar to eat or a packet of sweets to share, but mostly you sat and listened to the girls gossip and bicker all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the night, you\u2019d memorised what had happened to each of the girls during their two year holidays: Cindy had gone away to Thailand to \u2018find herself\u2019 and fuck everything that moved. Alexis had gone to Egypt to take in the culture, and all of Egypt\u2019s food. Jeniffer went to Japan for their \u2018deep honourable culture\u2019 but mostly because she heard they did foot massages and the power trip was amazing to her. And Stephanie went to South Africa to \u2018get the most amazing tan\u2019 but really it was to be the richest and most powerful person in a 50 mile radius. you couldn't care less and honestly wanted them to put you out of your misery at this point.

You start to get hard, panicking and trying to cover it with one of the shopping bags before she turned around, you realise you can\u2019t lift the bag, now you can\u2019t reach it! A quick glance around the room confirms it, everything\u2019s getting bigger?! Wait no, nothings getting bigger, well something is, you\u2019re getting smaller! Panicking again you start to look around frantically for somewhere to go, something to do, you don\u2019t know what, just anything!</span></div></div>",

And now you\u2019re at the base of your mothers casual shoe, you crane your neck back to look up at the scale of the Goddess that was once slightly shorter than you. Staring up into the sky you see her head spin to look at where you once were, she looks confused as she sees bags of shopping left on the side, concluding her step son must have left them there to go up to bed, she begins to make her way over to them to see what the bags contain, down below however, a simple movement across the kitchen is like the earth itself is splitting apart as this huge wall of black begins to lift from the ground and into the sky.

You\u2019d managed to make it to the carpet in the hall, but you could still smell that horrid stench burning the inside of your nostrils, you notice the area around you darken asif a huge cloud we\u2019re blocking out the sun, then you remember your situation, looking up you see the planet sized underside of your mothers foot, she must be going to check on your step sisters, you remember that she only wears her slides when she\u2019s in the kitchen, and as a result, her now bare foot was headed straight for your tiny frail body, to any ant sized ears, your life was ended with a wailing scream, an earth shattering bang, and then silence, to human ears, it was simply the sound of a single step of a caring mother</span></div></div>",
