The experiment payed 50$ for just taking part in it so you felt that it was probably worth it. Heading in to the school early one morning, you go to the science lab where you find a cubicle set up. Entering the cubicle you find a small television showing only static and a stool. After closing the door to the cubicle and sitting down on the stool, the lights go out in the room. Looking at the television you wonder what is going on. You then hear some shuffling around outside the cubicle and suddenly the television comes to life with bright flashes of solid colours. You start to feel uneasy but can't wrench your eyes from the screen in front of you. The flashes are getting faster and brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few minutes you begin to feel bored. The colours then stop flashing and the TV turns off. The lights then turn back on. Still feeling bored you don't do anything at first but finally look at your watch, discovering that it had already been half an hour. Instead of panicking you calmly stand up and exit the cubicle. Seeing some money on one of the desks that wasn't there before you pocket it, strangely uninterested in how much there was. That was when it happened...

Looking up ahead you see Janice Phelps coming the other way, normally you didn't mind her as she left you alone but today was different. The instant she looked at you, you felt filled with pitiful disgust. You were therefore careful when you passed her and felt strangely self satisfied again once she had passed. Still walking to your locker you suddenly feel the need to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I want to concentrate,\" you murmur to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel rushed and hurry to your locker. Still rushed you find it hard to focus on entering your combination but quickly get it open, grab your books and start to run off to class. Just as you reach the door to your classroom you feel worried about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I forget something? No... Then what am I worried about?\" you ponder quietly. Entering the classroom you take your seat and suddenly feel a jolt of sexual thrill. The thrill lasted no longer than a simple kiss but was very confusing to you. The strangest thing was that while you thought you should be confused by it you were suddenly awash with lofty happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs class started you felt self conscious of your clothes and posture. Brushing yourself off a bit you straighten yourself in your seat and fail to gain the concentration needed to focus on what the teacher is talking about. As your concentration continues to be rather lacking you start to wonder why your emotions seem to be so off this morning. You think that you should be curious as to why you'd been feeling so strangely but can't seem to build the mood to be curious. Suddenly your concentration snaps on like a light switch and you are paying perfect attention to the subject at hand. Unfortunately it only lasts a moment and you are back in the realm of non-concentration and boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel an urgency as though you need to go use the restroom but notice that non of the usual physical needs were there, just the emotion of it. Your concentration fades back in and you take the opportunity to focus on class again. After a few minutes more you feel nicely relaxed and content as though after emptying an overly full bladder. It isn't long before you feel self-conscious again. That is followed shortly thereafter by a strange apprehension of something and then back to total loss of concentration. When the bell rings your concentration snaps back on and you hurriedly head to your next class (English), strangely panicking because Janice's next class is...</span></div></div>",

As you approach, hurried, from one direction she approaches just as fast from the other. She then spots you and you suddenly feel embarrassed and extremely self conscious, slowing to a slow walk. You then feel puzzled, the first emotion since the experiment that lined up with what you thought you should be feeling. Unfortunately it did not last as Janice turned the corner into her classroom. You were still a little ways away from your classroom so you watched her as your mood shifted to mild apprehension and then strong lust. Dropping your jaw you feel the lust build as Janice enters her classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter your own class and take your usual seat, wondering if your strange emotions were the result of your apparent crush on Janice. You had never thought of her in that way before but then again you had never paid her much attention either. This was thanks to your usually clumsy nature around girls. The sexually charged jolt returned once more before dying down into pleasant contentment. Relaxing a bit thanks to your newest mood you look down and see that the last jolt had brought about a tiny wet patch in your pants. There was another jolt but this time it was followed with a feeling of annoyance which helped to kill the sexually arousing mood you'd had since Janice first entered her classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs class began you felt like you were trying to concentrate but failing miserably. Concluding this was just an extension of your apparent crush on Janice you decided to ignore it. After a while you suddenly feel rather clever. Then after a period of apprehension you feel nervous. Peering out the door of the room you see Janice hiding just down the hall. Her boyfriend, Bob Whilby, then comes out of the room and your mood shifts again to joy. As they walk off you feel a building sensation of anticipation before...</span></div></div>",
