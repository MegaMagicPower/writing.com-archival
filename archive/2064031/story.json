Slowly within weeks the naga carefully managed to enslave the village huntsman and women. Then the town knights. And in just a few days after that the rest of the small-folk all became hypnotic slaves resulting in the entire village was her new dominion. She took over and ruled it, taking their spoils and letting them idolize and praise her. The two hunters Kyle and Susan became her loyal body guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last few months she seemed content with ruling a single village. Under the radar of any hunters that might try and rescue the villagers from her spell. But her greed and desire crept in the back of her mind.

An easy task. The naga grew excited of the idea that soon an entire army of monster hunters would be under her command. She grew a wicked smile on her lips watching her soldiers walk off to collect her more toys to play with. The excitement was briefly cut-off when the need to eat started to rumble over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hunger my darlings.\", she stated to her spellbound followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we prepare someone for you to digest?\", Kyle offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no. I would never digest my precious playthings, unless I needed to. No first time in a while I need to eat. I feel in such a good mood, I believe I will go hunt for my food myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress. What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what to do when I'm away, always keep <b>APPEARANCES</b>.\", Kyle and Susan went around town repeating their mistress' last word. A trigger command that would make the villagers act normal in the event she was not monitoring them in case anyone showed up to the village without her being present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while had passed, while the hypnotic naga had gone off to hunt. She was a couple miles into the forest where she can be alone to let off some steam. She loved the feeling of waiting for the right time to unleash her hypnotic power on unforeseen prey. Then one minute, a deer caught an eye over the naga. The deer didn't see the hybrid, its gaze was directed on the far left, it must have heard something else. The naga waited a moment she curled up her coils over her human arm and wound up around and twisted it. Instead of a burn from the rubbing it would normally cause for others, her human skin was softer than any normal human. Letting her squeeze out the oils in between her scales in her constricted layers of scales. She rubbed it on her neck and over her face, and the blew the remaining toward the deer, like blowing a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment nothing. But seconds later the deer stared straight at the naga and went closer. \"Good. Come to me so I can look-\", vvvvvvwhip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga turned to her left to see she tripped some kind of trap. For a fraction of a second, she saw a pouch hung by a match. After that a force of raw noise and force sent her back. The naga squeezed her eyes tight, they hurt. She felt sharp stinging. She couldn't force her eyelids to open for even a moment. When the noise stopped ringing and the stinging wasn't so terrible, she swore she opened her eyes. But still she didn't see anything. Nothing. The hypnotic naga struggled with the very real fear, her hypnotic eyes were now blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die monster!\", the naga heard next.</span></div></div>",

If she could pry the truth out, without forcing him, then this could turn things to her favor. Her face was still covered by both of her hands, the trap had blinded her eyes and she could tell no matter how hard she tried they wouldn't work. Nagas have an above normal level of healing in critical areas of the body. Her eyesight would return, probably in time when her servants returned with the hunters she ordered them to bring back. But for now her attention needed to be centered on this lone one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a naga yes, but the hypnotist you speak of is not myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another naga around this area? I doubt it, however explain yourself. So I can judge if what you say is true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cautious, he wasn't brazen to attack when I claimed to not be the hypnotist naga. Normally my kind wouldn't be near the populated areas. And I wasn't far enough to claim I was simply hunting. However, if my reason can bring us back to the village...\", she thought. \"You see I am hunting the same prey as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of metal cutting the air, the hunter wasn't convinced. This next choice of words had to sound better or else a confrontation was certain. \"Let me finish. She is a rogue, and as I speak has been enslaving people to build a small army against my clan of naga.\", revealing her plans to him seemed the best way to make the unlikely circumstance plausible.

The naga hypnotist lowered her hands from her face, revealing her still present and unrivaled beauty to the hunter. hen he saw the naga's face he was awestruck, as never before had he ever seen something so dazzling. The naga's entrancing beauty as formidable even with her hypnotic eyes removed. More often she used them without relying on her other attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter leaned close to her face and took out a cloth, putting some sort of potion on it. He rubbed it very delicately over her eyes. Desiring to break the ice, the naga asked for the hunter's name. \"So tell me foolish hunter, who do I call the one who blinded me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asher. Just Asher. And you are?\", he replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth the naga had not spoken her name aloud in a very long time. Her slaves in the village never even knew it. They always called her by Mistress. It was what she heard from every interaction that wasn't governed by fear or resistance. She figured an alias would be safe, just in case. He was close to shoving a sword in her heart, naturally a sizable defense would be within her instinct. \"Katheryn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Katheryn I am gravely guilty about attacking the wrong naga.\", she heard him softly sniff the air. \"Of course. My pheromones from before. Interesting? I never used it on humans. My eyes did all the swaying for me. Of course he won't bow to kiss my tail. But this could be used to get his attention later down the line if I need to. But for now...\", she placed the arm she coated with her scent up to Asher's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga could feel his body warm up. Just from touch and smell, she had his attention other than the end of his weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hmm. The damage looks pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nagas regenerate faster than humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I researched your race. But I mean is that the powder I used, its bacterial and is causing discharge. If I don't find anything to fix it, you may go blind permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to loose then! He was willing to help! She had to let him get to the village now! Without her eyes, she could not enslave the hunters that would be on her doorstep and they would kill her! \"Asher. There is a village nearby, they should have a medical inn that should house what you need to fix my eyes. Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll be back soon. Do you have any idea where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The village  has a tall rock formation that hangs on the far end of it. I was going to see if the hypnotist enslaved them, before stepping into your trap while I hunted for food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Stay there!\", he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr. Hurry soon.

I spent years making myself into the most desirable Naga in the world. My eyes had always been the quickest way to anyone's mind and soul. But I have other methods. My natural pheromones for example. They're not strong but they can be helpful in setting the mood. My natural beauty is rivaled by none, even among other monster I've been called lovely beyond comparison. My seduction I use everyday. And lastly worthy of note are my lips. One kiss will have him choking on Naga venom in mere moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a repertoire mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pride myself on them.

Even worse we need a scapegoat for him to hunt, or else he will realize I'm his target.\", the Naga slithered in place contemplating any plans she could to reverse this turn of events in her favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, if you would allow us, we will hunt a Naga and bring back to you so you can persuade it to fill in the role.\", Kyle suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naga hypnotism is difficult to use on others of our species. But you have the right idea on hunting one. Susan, Kyle. Track down any Naga nearby and report your findings to me. And until I have my sight back, stay out of view from the city and especially from our fellow monster hunter.\", the Naga ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, our lovely mistress.\", the two slaves answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get here soon Asher.

He called out to her alerting her of his presence. \"Katheryn, I have the medicine. Lie down and open your eyes.\", he told her in a very hasty manner. Not that she gave any reluctance. She did as he asked and let him do his work. Asher took the medicine and poured some on a clean rag, then placed it on top of Katheryn's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tffffffft! Hrrrrrgggghhhhh! It's burning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means its working. Bacteria you accumulated would have permanently scarred you. It'll pass by in a just a few minutes.

She wanted to tauntingly reply with a snark comment about how superior she was, and praising her hypnotic methods. But the restraint she needed in order to survive tempered her tongue. \"How long will it last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best guess about 2 maybe 3 days tops before your fully healed and can see again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me for this when were finished tracking that Naga rogue.\", she lied through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can pick up the trail first thing tomorrow.

Spying on him would be critical in order to plant the naga Katheryn would use to take her place until her sight came back. She pretended to fall asleep, lying sideways while Asher tended to start making a fire for the evening. Unbeknownst to him, the sneaky naga secreted off more of her pheromones making the camp site ripe with growing attraction for the serpentine seducer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ignorant to the fact, believing his growing fondness stemmed naturally when it never occurred it was coerced by her.

While she said nothing, all manner of schemes and silent taunting occurred in his head. All she did was stare at her prey, slithering around him, wishing she could kill him. She had direct means of control, and it ate away at her ego like a rash that would not back down. But the naga was still one to make the best out her circumstances. \"You think my pheromones got your attention before? You haven't seen nothing yet. So fall in deep sleep my little Asher, dream. Dream of me. Dream me as the object of affection. Don't just love me, become obsessed.

The drops were small, like drops from a leaf, nothing to wake him luckily for her. She had this smile, the kind you see when someone is enjoying every second of what is passing. The naga wished so badly to wrap him in her coils. Take his head, toward hers, blast his eyes full of hypnotic color until their optic nerves were so stimulated it fried their optic nerves and left them in complete catatonia. Not a quick death, a long dragged out experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my slaves can't get here any sooner. At least then, I could have them help me dispose of your body. Sleep well my 'darling' tomorrow you will fetch your hypnotic naga. Then I will reward you the greatest gift I will ever bestow on any mortal human. The feeling of my power overwhelming those senses. Every nerve and fiber, all clamoring for me. And as the body dies, it will still beg for me even after death, that is what love means to me. And all you will soon ever know. Keep resting, and think of me in every dream, vision, fragment wandering in your mind.\", she chuckled and clucked while he fell asleep still. And Asher's nightly thoughts now, were all pointed at her. The flawless body, the exquisite features, the obsessive desire to be near her and loved was hovering in Asher's mind. Question was, could Asher see past it and through the naga's deception in time?</span></div></div>",

Asher looked at her, intently, perhaps he was studying her to pick up a clue on hos Nagas were asleep or awake by their body movement. One might assume so given his actions.

She is so beautiful.\", all of these thoughts ricocheted off his brain like a superball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga had her tail move behind him, and gently nudged the hunter near her half human body. Asher's face grew red and his heart was not steady in the slightest. \"Asher, I feel we have something you and I. Are you interested in me?\", she asked knowing the answer already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katheryn, you may just be the girl of my dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Asher you charmer.\", she said stroking her index finger under his chin. She was tempted, the moment seemed appropriate to adhere to a venomous kiss. But perhaps a regular one would work better in the long term. As she needed to remind herself, patience was essential. But the waiting was ripping her apart. She couldn't keep it up any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she heard something....</span></div></div>",

In front of her stood a girl with long black hair reaching her ass and obsidian eyes and lips to match. She had large breasts and was only wearing a corset to cover herself. She also had a large set of wings on her back and a tail with a small heart on the end. Susan drew her sword and covered her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Succubus! Stay away from me if you want to live.

Let them engulf your mind, show you how desire for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan stared back letting the succubi's words infect her mind. She felt this new sensation, of sexual obsession for the succubus. Never before had she felt that for someone of the same sex, but now in this moment, it felt wonderful. She smiled seeing the succubus in a lens of total and flawless perfection. Her body grew hot for the succubus, all she wanted was to mate with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel it don't you? The passion, the obsession. But I can't just give myself to you. You must earn my pleasure for me to give it. Come now, pleasure your new lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan walked to the succubus slowly inching her way up to her face, her hands latched to the succubi's shoulders pulling herself up. Susan opened her mouth a bit and locked lips with the succubus. The instant she did, Susan felt like the most erotic moment of her life was captured in her mind and held  on for every second she joined lips with the monster. The succubus returned her kiss and pulled Susan's face in closer, both her hands holding her chin, and the demon aggressively returned the passion a thousand times over. Susan felt like it was the best kiss she would ever receive in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted for a few more seconds until Susan was pulled away by the succubus. For a moment Susan felt her mouth dance with unspeakable pleasure, as if tasting the greatest wine on earth. \"Very nice, I must say I'm impressed. But tell me? Do you know how long someone can withstand the pleasure a succubus grants to a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Susan felt her throat burn, on fire, the back of her mouth closing behind her. She gagged letting out her screams, but all that exited were just her tongue and audible chokes. \"Oh my. I hope that you can withstand it? It would be fatal if you weren't able to.\", the succubus giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan concentrated on her breathing and tried calming her body. She needed to not let the pleasure fry her body. She laid on the ground, positioning herself to where she could gain as much air as she could. She placed water over her neck to cool down her stimulated part of her body. She breathed slowly, or had a strong effort to try, praying she wouldn't die like this.</span></div></div>",
