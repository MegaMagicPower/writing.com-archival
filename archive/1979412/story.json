He was leaning back on a barstool drinking a cold beer, his old but sturdy boots propped on the counter. He tilted his head back and downed the alcohol with exceptional speed. He picked up his fourth bottle. -SNIKT- One of Logan's adamantium claws popped out and slashed the top of the bottle off with ease. Logan then put his lips to the bottle and quickly finished that one off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Life at the X-Mansion had been different for him. He was used to sneaking and hiding, killing and hurting; not normal things like playing games and chatting. Heck, he wasn't used to friends either. That could account for his poor social skills, perhaps. He had no problem talking with people, meaning he wasn't shy. Far from it, the opposite was true. Logan had a tendency to state exactly how he felt and why, and if someone didn't agree he'd tell them where they could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome at the mansion, like Bobby Drake, found Logan's way of life to be ideal. Others, like Scott Summers, saw Logan as a lost cause and a nuisance to him and all of existence. Logan didn't care either way. If people liked him, they liked him, if they didn't, they didn't. He wasn't in the business of changing minds; that is, unless killing them counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fate however had managed to get Logan to this place, the Xavier Mansion/School. Logan had been looking for answers and he was hoping old man Xavier might help him out, since he was a telepath after all. Xavier had helped some, but for the most part he emphasized that Logan would have to recover the lost memories of his past on his own - aggravating Logan considerably. And yet, this hadn't caused Logan to leave. He stayed. Most attributed this to Jean and his obvious attraction for her. But when she died, at his hands no less, he still remained. Xavier was gone now too, so him being telepathically controlled to stay there was ruled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He stayed for a few reasons. The first being that he didn't really have anywhere else to go. The second was because he'd made some friends there, though he wouldn't admit that, at least not in words or anything. Logan was also helping Ororo and the students at the mansion, carrying on where Xavier, Jean, and Scott had left off, and he enjoyed it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This particular day, the mansion was fairly empty. A few students in their rooms or outside, one or two maybe in the den or something. Occasionally one would enter the kitchen for something to eat or drink. Logan paid them no heed, and for the most part allowed them to do whatever they wanted. Ororo was gone to pick up some needed essentials, and Hank was off in New York or Washington, one of the two. Bobby, Marie, Pete, and Kitty were probably hanging out somewhere.</span></div></div>",

He had short black hair, a couple rogue lumped strands hanging down just a bit more than the rest. He had bright blue eyes and a five o\u2019clock shadow. He wore a solid black tee and camo pants, with boots. He wasn\u2019t your typical student; well over the average age, he was closer to the ages of most of the faculty in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we did. It\u2019s nice to meet you\u201d he stated, offering a hand to shake. Around his neck were some army tags; he\u2019d been discharged after it was discovered he was a mutant; a secret he\u2019d managed to hide somehow. While Jareth didn\u2019t have the physical abnormalities of such mutants as Beast or Nightcrawler, his abilities made it quite difficult not to know he was a mutant when activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby turned then and headed to the elevator, leading the way. \u201cYou have a most unusual ability Jareth, and that is not something easily said in a school filled with very unusual and unique students and faculty, but it remains true\u201d Bobby said as they got on the elevator and headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse\u201d he said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do hope you\u2019ll change your mind about that, our job here is to show that your mutant abilities are not curses, but blessings in disguise\u201d Bobby said, the elevator opened and they headed down the halls, passing some more students as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather gruff individual was heading their way with a beer bottle in his hand, \u201cHi Bob \u201d Logan sniffed the air then, and cocked an eyebrow, \u201cWho\u2019s the new guy, smells funny\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLogan, this is Jareth, Jareth, this is Logan. It\u2019s good you two are meeting now, as the two of you will be roommates\u201d Bobby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both responded, \u201cRoommates?\u201d neither sounding too happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Jareth, Ororo said that you may never admit it, but until you know how to properly use your mutant abilities you will need protection from potential danger, and she think that Logan is the perfect roommate for you\u201d Bobby said, heading away already. Jareth went after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want privacy, I told you what happens when my powers activate\u201d Jareth said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you must to be carefull if that happen, Logan it's not the most friendly guy... But he is a good person, both of you must to know each other\u201d and with that Bobby pulled free and headed back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJareth turned to Logan again then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on bub, I ain\u2019t too fond of the idea either, but we\u2019d best get over it, Ororo ain\u2019t easily swayed from a decision, even by these\u201d he said, unsheathing his claws for a moment. They caught Jareth by surprise to where he paused, but then followed a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one bed, Logan\u2019s, there was clothing on the floor; all dirty, some shredded to pieces from apparent rages, there were claw marks on the dresser, the walls, the door, and even the bedposts. Other than a large Canadian flag, and a lot of empty beer bottles, the room was pretty bare bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what brings you here bub? They don\u2019t let just anyone in, what can you do?\u201d Logan asked, taking another drink as he sat on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it\u201d Jareth stated, sitting his luggage (an old duffle-bag) down and off to the side, he unzipped one side of it, but got nothing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find out sooner or later, there\u2019s really nothing I haven\u2019t heard or seen before\u201d Logan stated, taking another drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI secrete really powerful pheromones\u201d Jareth stated with a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s what that smell is, I smelled it the moment you entered the mansion in fact. Super senses\u201d he explained and then went on, \u201cOroro wouldn\u2019t have put you in here with me though just because of that, what else do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, \u201cI shrink, to various sizes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, sounds like some friends of mine on the Avengers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t control when it happens, for all I know it could happen in a few seconds, or it might never happen again \u2013 and that would be fine with me\u201d Jareth stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t be fine with me\u201d Logan said, which caused Jareth to look at him quizzically. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bed, an action figure doesn\u2019t take up much room\u201d Logan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we just get another bed in here?\u201d Jareth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there aren\u2019t any more\u201d Logan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll sleep on the floor then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was pretty late, and since he was in a terrible mood, he moved as many beer bottles and strong-scented musky clothes out of the way as he could and prepared to lie down, \u201cTake the bed,\u201d Logan stated, \u201cI\u2019m heading out for more beer\u201d he didn\u2019t say another word, just left. Jareth figured he might as well and kicked off his shoes and lay in the bed. There was an overwhelming scent of Logan; musk, meat, and beer. It took him a while, but he eventually fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jareth was fast asleep when he was woken up by the sound of the doorknob jiggling, followed by the door opened. Bright light from the hallway poured in which caused him to squint his eyes as they adjusted from complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now, Logan always keeps his good stuff under the mattress\u201d said a younger male voice; this was definitely not Logan, it sounded more innocent, young, mischievous and... quite familiar. At last Jareth\u2019s eyes adjusted as he saw Bobby standing over the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he finally asked, annoyed by the intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response though, Bobby bent down and lifted the mattress, and that was when Jareth realized he had done it again, he had shrunk, as he rolled across the endless mattress. He came to a stop and got his bearings, standing up. Of course, as always when he shrank, his clothing did not shrink with him so he was completely naked, his t-shirt, which he\u2019d shrunk right out of, fell on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby pulled some magazines out from under the mattress and smiled, \u201cJackpot\u201d he stated, he stood up and went to leave, but had a better idea, and he closed the door and sat on Logan\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJareth had just freed himself out from underneath the heavy fabric of his own shirt when he saw a mountain of checkered boxers descending right upon him. \u201cNOO-mpmh!\u201d he said, being silenced as the wall of Bobby\u2019s ass pinned him down against the bed. He was fortunate, sort of, he had landed in the crack, the smell of unwashed boxer attacked Jareth\u2019s nose. He muffled out some cries of despair, but not a one was heard by the now giant Bobby who got comfortable on Logan\u2019s bed and pulled his boxers down just a bit in the front, he then proceeded to look through the porno magazines Logan had stored, and jack off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Bobby\u2019s ass would flex, squeezing Jareth between the two cheeks and the bed; at times it felt as though the cheeks even lifted him up off the bed; in fact, they were, there was a little bit of space. Jareth began to crawl with everything in him out of this trap. The way ahead was blocked though, more boxers. He had to try to break free though. He crawled forward trying to get free. He wiggled and writhed, and finally got his head free out into the open air, the rest of him still trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby had just finished cumming, with a sigh of ecstasy he pulled his shorts back up and sat back. It was then he felt something crawling around underneath his balls. He looked down, and didn\u2019t know at first what it was he was seeing, then he fell back against the wall in surprise, \u201c\u2026what the hell\u2026\u201d he whispered to himself, and looked again. Sure enough, there's Jareth\u2019s head just barely sticking out from underneath his balls! A second later an arm, and then a second arm joined the head, and were attempting to apparently pull the body they were attached to out from under the boxers and balls. Bobby\u2019s initial reaction was to move and help the little guy, but feeling him move down there, and seeing this \u2018full grown\u2019 man being squished under his (in comparison) titanic balls, was beginning to turn the eighteen year old on again. So instead, he leaned forward some, covering the man\u2019s face completely with his balls. He felt tiny little kicks, and he could see the hands which were still barely visible flailing about, and then trying to pull with all their might. That\u2019s all it took, Bobby was rock hard again. He began stroking himself again, leaning forward still to cover the little man except his arms. It was delicious, he\u2019d move every minute or so to make sure the little man could breathe, but was right back at it again in seconds. Despite having just cum moments before, it took him no time at all before Bobby shot another load. It was stronger than the first even. He laid back, blissful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJareth gasped for air, when Bobby got close to climax he\u2019d forgotten to let Jareth breath. The shrunk man was fairly worn out by the ordeal of just trying to stay alive from the threat of the balls smothering the very air from him. However, he had to move, using what energy he could muster, he pulled himself, getting his torso free, and then finally his legs. As soon as they were free he stood up and turned to Bobby. He saw a teenage boy, he felt humiliated and emasculated, he tried to regain some of that. \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby felt the little man crawling from under him and then looked at him, still relaxing against the wall. He didn\u2019t know what Jareth was saying, and frankly he didn\u2019t care. A hand swooped in and scooped Jareth up, he was completely hidden in the loosely formed fist; it was a loosely formed fist but very closed in to Jareth as he pushed against the hand futilely. He opened the hand back up, and Jareth found himself staring face to very big face with Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are a tiny dude, and you really helped me out man, bro\u2019s before ho\u2019s\u201d he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you little fuck, you try anything like that and I\u2019ll-\u201c he was cut off when bobby parsed his lips and blew a strong jet of hot air at him. It was hurricane force winds to Jareth, falling over backwards into the palm. The fingers curled in around him, pinning his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ll what little man? Get me off again? Yeah, I know you will, that was damn sweet and I ain\u2019t giving you up!\u201d A finger loomed in at Jareth, who kicked violently at it, but that was pointless. It touched Jareth\u2019s muscular chest and quickly made its way down until it landed on his crotch. \u201cDamn, your whole package isn\u2019t even the size of my fingernail!\u201d Bobby taunted. In truth, Jareth actually had a very large package, but at this size it wasn\u2019t that impressive; \u201cNot bad for a bug though\u201d Bobby apparently realized the proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was by far very straight, he was obsessed with girls even. However, this little naked man in his palm was again starting to turn him on! His finger inspected Jareth\u2019s crotch, and then he had an idea. He tilted Jareth\u2019s flaccid cock up and began gently and methodically rubbing it up and down, stroking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJareth\u2019s eyes widened when he realized what bobby was doing, his kicking and shouting resumed ten-fold. \u201cWhat the hell, get off me kid! I ain\u2019t gay! Stop it!\u201d he shouted, but his shouts only served to increase Bobby\u2019s efforts. He smiled as those efforts visually began to pay off, Jareth\u2019s cock reacted happily to the stimulation it was receiving. Jareth\u2019s kicked with all his might, doing his best to get free, he attempted to turn his head enough to bite the skin of the hand he was in, but was unable to do so. Then, he neared climax, his kicking grew weaker and weaker as it was building, his breathing increased slightly. Bobby was smiling the whole time, loving the look of the little man\u2019s face as he used all his might against Bobby, but was powerless against him. That\u2019s when Bobby stopped, he did not allow Jareth to cum, he had stopped just short. Jareth had closed his eyes, he felt it about to explode, but instead it stopped. The little man looked up at Bobby with confusion. A malevolent gaze fell on Jareth from Bobby, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you BEG for it\u201d he said with a cruel smile. A sense of dread overcame him as he became flaccid, Bobby started up again, repeating the process. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t do this you asshole! I\u2019ll kill you, I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll fucking kill you\u201d Jareth yelled as he was getting hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby then stopped, again when Jareth was just about to cum. \u201cDamn it!\u201d Jareth yelled as pleasure turned to agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to cum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, let me go!\u201d Jareth yelled, trying again to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad\u201d Bobby however decided to continue this elsewhere and stood up, and dropped the squirming man into his right pocket on his boxers. He replaced Logan\u2019s magazines under the bed, and left; he smiled as he closed the door and walked down the hall, feeling the squirming little man bounce against his leg.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A buzzing sound was heard, someone at the door. Logan put the empty bottle on the counter and walked to the front door and opened it. A woman was standing there with what looked like a box of matches. Logan cocked an eyebrow, waiting for her to say something first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, I'm Mrs. Gilman\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan nodded, \"What's the problem ma'am, your car break down or something?\" he asked, still trying to figure out the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, I was told that I could..\" her voice wavered a bit and she became a bit more quiet, \"..bring my son here\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is your son a mutant?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The woman seemed nervous. \"Y-yes, yes he is\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then this is the place\" Logan stated, his eyes shifted a bit, looking for the boy in the car parked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She relaxed. \"Alright, I wasn't sure at first. You see, I'm getting too old to care for him any longer, and he needs help due to his.. unique.. traits\" she said, obviously trying not to say anything that might be considered offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I understand ma'am, we'll take good care of him. Could you give me some basic information on the kid?\" Logan asked, crossing his arms and leaning on the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, well actually, I've already been in contact with one of your people I believe. Um.. I forget her name though\" the old woman said, trying to recall it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ororo?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The old woman smiled, \"Yes, that's the one! She said I could bring Keith here whenever he and I were both comfortable with it\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan nodded, still waiting for some specifics or to see the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Also, Keith isn't a child, I'd wager he's around your age in fact\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan cocked an eyebrow again, \"He needs us to care for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, well, you see\" she said, pulling out the matchbox and opening it up. Inside there were no matches, but miniature padded walls, and between those walls, in the box, was a little man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan's eyes widened, he'd seen quite a few odd mutations, but this was one of those that really shocked him. \"I think I understand now\" he said, looking at the little man in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, you will see that he is taken care of properly?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan nodded, \"Yeah, sure, of course ma'am\" Logan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The old woman smiled warmly and closed the box back up and gently handed it to Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan looked a bit nervous, something he rarely ever seemed to be, as he gently took the box. She then headed back to her car and was soon off, leaving him standing there with the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He moved back into the house, he was heading back towards the kitchen, but saw that since he'd left the students had pretty much invaded it. Apparently the sight of Logan drinking beer in the kitchen had kept a good portion of them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He went to the steps instead and toward his room. The whole time he was trying to keep the box rather steady in his hand. He couldn't help but look down at the box now and then, remembering the tiny man he'd seen in there. He was trying to grasp the concept that a person could fit inside that box in his hand. He realized then how huge his hand seemed to the box. He was trying to visualize what his hands would look like to someone so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He soon arrived at his own room and opened and shut the door behind him. He moved over to his bed and sat the matchbox on his bedside table. He then...</span></div></div>",

Despite being gentle, the little man moved back and forth a bit uncontrollably. Logan's intense eyes gazed down on this tiny figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He had short, spiked, brown hair, his eyes were difficult to make out, they looked green or brown, but he wasn't sure. There was a handlebar mustache and goatee too. He had a large build, well, for his size that is, which wasn't really saying much for the guy. He kept himself fit too, Logan noticed the muscular outlines under his clothes. He was wearing dark blue jeans, some plain white socks, and a long-sleeved gray shirt, no shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"HI THERE!\" the little man shouted. Logan pulled his head back a little, for a split second he wondered why he was shouting. It quickly dawned on him that those without ears as sensitive as Logan's would have considerable trouble hearing a voice so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy kid,\" Logan said in a voice just above a whisper, \"I can hear you just fine without you shouting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man seemed a bit surprised by that, \"Really?\" he said in a normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's a relief, I love my mother and all, but it's difficult for her to hear me, especially with her old age now\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I bet\" Logan answered, \"So, you always been so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, I started out even smaller, imagine a baby, but one for people of my size\" he stated with a smile, it was meant to be humorous, despite it being true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man stood up, \"I'm Keith by the way\" he said, lifting a hand to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan almost laughed right out when he realized what Keith was doing, it just seemed so funny. But, he obliged him and brought his index finger up to him slowly and moved it up and down ever so slightly, then removed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, this is the Xavier Institute?\" he said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah,\" Logan paused, \"well, this is just my room, wasn't sure where else to put you for now\" Logan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not Xavier?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, old Chuck died recently I'm afraid. Name's Logan\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice to meet you, so... are you a teacher then or...?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No. I'm a trainer, teach kids how to defend themselves\" Logan stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, alright, so...\" Keith trailed off, not sure what else to say.</span></div></div>",

If I know that I might be able to get someone to help you out kid\" Logan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, first of all I'm not a kid, I'm twenty-seven years old\" he paused, letting that sink in, \"As for my life at home. My mother bought me a house, my size of course, and had electricity, water, heating, cooling, and all that put into it for me\" Keith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you were living in a doll house?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith's face contorted slightly, \"If that's what you want to call it I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Easy little guy, just saying that's what it was is all\" Logan stated, smirking over the little man's slight anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"To someone your size I suppose it would look like that, but it was just as much a house as any your size\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, except I can't accidentally step on a real house\" Logan said. His breath this whole time continued to wash over Keith. The smell of meat and beer was near overpowering, but Keith withstood it. He also didn't reply this time to Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So where is this pint sized mansion of yours?\" Logan asked, getting no response before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? She didn't give you it?\" Keith asked, apparently surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If she did, I wouldn't be asking, now would I?\" Logan answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn\" Keith said, walking in a small circular motion. \"I guess I'll just stay in here then until she remembers... if she remembers\" Keith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My room?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, if the rest of this place is filled with children and teenagers, then I think it would be best to stay with someone that can protect me\" Keith reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He had a point, but Logan wasn't sure, for one the guy hadn't even asked. \"Alright pipsqueak, guess I can put up with you until O finds another place for ya\" Logan explained and stood up, walking over to the closet and pulled out a button up red plaid shirt but didn't button it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Where are you going?\" Keith asked, having been left on the nightstand.</span></div></div>",

Keith however recovered from the brief shock of the dominating presence of Logan and replied; \"N-no.. I, I want to go with you\" Keith explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan cocked an eyebrow but then brought his thumb and forefinger to the box and scooped Keith out. Keith was amazed at the roughness and strength of his fingers as he sailed through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan brought him over to his chest pocket and dropped him in. Keith tumbled a bit but resituated himself and then stood. It was then he noticed that he couldn't reach the top of the pocket, even if he jumped he wouldn't be able to. He gazed up to see Logan looking down at him, apparently checking on him for a second, he then let the pocket go and headed out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith decided he'd sit and relax. The fabric was warm, but the warmth from Logan's body was what made it truly warm, and his heartbeat could be clearly heard through the fabric of Logan's two shirts. ~This will take some getting used to~ Keith thought to himself as he bounced around here and there with each step Logan took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan entered the garage and got his tools around and then got on his back and began working. The flannel shirt had slid off his chest and to each side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith remained where he was for a moment, but curiosity came over him, as did the sense of boredom of staying in the pocket. He crawled on out and looked around. Straight ahead was Logan's left armpit, extending upward was his strong arm moving. Keith's eyes continued up and saw a wrench in his hand that he was twisting around, his other hand steadying things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith crawled toward the armpit, seeing it as the easiest way to get to Logan's chest, which seemed to be much sturdier than the fabric. When he arrived there, he was beginning toward the chest when Logan's arm came down, trapping Keith in the pit.</span></div></div>",

He lifted and peered down to see Keith gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell are you doing?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith coughed a bit from Logan's strong sweat, \"I- I was trying, to get up there\" he said, pointing to Logan's chest. \"Pocket was boring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan brought his right hand down and scooped Keith up effortlessly and placed him in the middle of his chest, then went back to working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith made himself comfortable, looking around the garage and getting a good look at Logan's body now too. He saw how strong Logan was, and how big he was too. He looked down toward Logan's feet but couldn't help but notice the bulge in his pants that was definitely bigger than Keith's whole body. He managed to get his eyes off of that though and saw that Logan seemed to stretch on for forever before you arrived at his feet. He turned back to look at his face then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan's black hair and sideburns were the first thing he noticed, along with a five o'clock shadow in general. He noticed the cavernous nostrils and mouth, the strong chin, the intense eyes and eyebrows. Logan was handsome, that much was certain. Keith was trying to get used to his face, it seemed like forever though since he'd been around another guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every so often Logan would grunt as he worked on his bike, he didn't seem to mind Keith's presence, or maybe he'd forgotten about him even being there, he did seem pretty focused on the bike after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You ever ride?\" Logan asked out of the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith didn't say anything at first, then realized that Logan was talking to him, \"Oh. No, but it was something I've always wanted to do. It's a bit hard though when you can't reach the seat or handles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan grunted in reply, he didn't pause for a moment in repairing the bike. \"You do any normal stuff at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Normal stuff? What do you mean?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Have you ever played any sports?\" Logan said after a brief pause, he set the wrench down and wiped his hands on a rag, then went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, at least not with others. I used rubber balls as basketballs, pieces of paper as hockey pucks, a toothpick being the stick.. so, sorta\" Keith said, sighing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wish it were different?\" Logan asked, still not looking at him, still working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, I mean, I am who I am. I'd like to know what it felt like to be regular sized, or even tall, but.. things could be much worse for me too\" Keith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good\" Logan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith cocked an eyebrow. \"Good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're pretty mature bug man, you don't wish you were someone else or any of that shit\" Logan stated, wiping his hands again and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith smiled, but wasn't prepared for Logan to sit up and began rolling down his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan realized a bit too late, he couldn't really grab him as he was still wiping his hands off, and laying back down now wouldn't help either, so he just watched as Keith rolled down his abs and landed atop his jean clad crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith moved around, trying to get his bearings. He'd landed on the rough jeans, and they were incredibly warm, warmer even than Logan's chest, and that had been quite warm itself. There was a strong scent here too, a powerful musky, manly aroma. His hands and feet pressed into the jeans and could feel something there, it was then that Keith realized exactly where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan chuckled, \"Easy down there bug man\" he said. There was some movement underneath Keith, that caused him to jump a bit. Logan reached down and scooped Keith back up and placed him in the shirt pocket again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How about I take you for a ride?\" Logan suggested...</span></div></div>",

Logan looked in again to make sure Keith was fine, he was, so Logan set out, starting the bike up once it was out of the garage, and they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The speed of the bike managed to press Keith firmly and securely into Logan's chest, he couldn't move a centimeter, no matter how hard he tried, so he just enjoyed the warmth and the rush of speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't too much later when they came to a stop. Logan checked on Keith once more real quick, filled the bike with gas, and walked into the store to pay. As he did he saw some cigars and bought a couple and placed them in the pocket with Keith, then headed back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith, who was able to move around again now, was a bit confused at the intruders, then realized they were cigars. \"You smoke?\" Keith asked from the confines of the pocket. \"Mhmm, you got a problem with that bub?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The students had cleared out by this point and Logan went ahead and grabbed some leftover burgers and reheated them. He quickly prepared them and then sat down at the table. He pulled Keith back out then and sat him on the table between the two burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They were like buildings to him, \"Whoa, you must have some appetite big guy\" Keith said, turning back to Logan and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This even caused Logan to smirk, \"Well, it helps when you're not the size of an action figure too\" he said and picked up one of the burgers and began chowing down. Keith watched, just amazed by how much food Logan was able to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You going to eat any?\" Logan asked after he finished his first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith turned back to the burger and tore off a piece that would be about the size of a dinner plate to him, but barely noticeable to Logan. \"That's it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's it? This is huge! I'm eating more than you even\" Keith answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That a fact?\" Logan asked, then took another bite. He brought his burger down to Keith and compared it and swallowed his bite, \"This thing right here is larger than your whole body, easily bug man, I think you might be wrong\" Logan said, he knew what Keith meant, but enjoyed giving him a bit of a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith picked up on that and smiled and sat down and enjoyed his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan watched Keith, and Keith watched Logan, both considerably impressed by the other; Logan by how little it took to feed Keith, and Keith by how much it took to feed Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The meal went by rather quietly before Logan finished and scooped Keith up again, allowing him to finish the rest in his pocket. Logan then moved over to the fridge and got a beer, paused, then grabbed a second beer, and headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arriving back in his room he set the beer down, and scooped Keith out of the shirt pocket along with the cigars. He sat Keith back on top of the matchbox, and the cigars nearby. He sat on the bed then and kicked off his boots, revealing his socked feet and the powerful stench that came with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoa!\" Keith said, waving his hand back and forth and holding his nose with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan glanced over and took his socks off as well and brought his right foot up to Keith, resting it on the table next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ugh! Man.. don't you ever clean those?!\" Keith said, coughing a bit and moving away.</span></div></div>",

The arms, chest, abs, back, and shoulders were all incredibly powerful in appearance. \"Damn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan looked over at him, apparently wondering what the curse was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're.. you're.. freakin' huge man!\" Keith said, not sure how else to really put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan paused then smirked, \"That's a change of pace\" he said as he unbuttoned his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" Keith asked, still watching the mountain sized show before him with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm considered the short guy 'round here, most everyone's taller than me in fact, and let me know it all the time\" Logan explained, realizing he wasn't the smallest guy around anymore, by a long shot in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, not from where I'm standing, you're basically a mountain\" Keith explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan smirked, being the big guy for once seemed to get an unexpected reaction from his bulge, it jumped slightly as he unzipped and removed his pants. He stood there now in his gray boxer briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith got a rather good view of Logan's legs and especially Logan's ass and crotch now; he was on the same level as them being on the table and all. \"God...\" he said, trying to process the sheer size it was compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan noticed and his bulge jumped again in response from the thought. Logan walked over to the nightstand and paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith was looking directly at the colossal crotch, which was hidden behind the thin fabric. Logan was comparing the mini man to his manhood as well, realizing that Keith was definitely smaller, and that thought really caused a jump, one that Logan couldn't easily excuse away, especially since it nearly rammed right into Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Time for a shower bug man\" he said and reached for Keith.</span></div></div>",

You clean yourself up\" Logan answered, he'd paused but now reached for Keith again, closing in on him, despite Keith's renewed attempts at backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You mean, you and I? Taking a shower? Together?\" he asked, finally finding his back against the wall and in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan's large and rough, yet careful, hand grasped him and lifted him up. \"Yeah, not a big deal little guy, haven't you ever been in a locker room?-\" Logan tried to stop himself from asking the question, but it was already out, he realized that Keith had most definitely not ever been in a locker room. \"Never mind that, I'll show you it's no big deal, come on\" he said and headed toward the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hot water was turned on and Logan sat Keith down on the counter for a moment as he took off his boxer briefs, peeling them away. Keith didn't look this time, he was afraid of what he might see dangling between Logan's muscular thighs, that behemoth of a monster he'd accidentally landed on earlier when Logan had been working on his bike. Instead, Keith went ahead and peeled his own clothes away right up until he got to the plain white boxers. He felt considerably self conscious, no one had ever seen him this way before. ~This is 'normal', I need to at least try this~ he said and peeled the boxers away, then turned back to Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There before him was something beyond imagination. It was twice Keith's entire height, and it was still quite flaccid despite the jumps it had made a few minutes before. The balls were each larger than any beach ball, easily. Keith's eyes finally went back up toward Logan's face when he realized that staring at Logan's dick might offend the colossus, and he definitely didn't want to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan seemed to take it in stride though, he noticed Keith's reaction. While Logan was definitely a ladies man, even he would have to admit the thrill from realizing that his package was larger than an entire grown man. That thought caused it to jump again, but Logan realized ahead of time and ducked so Keith wouldn't see that. \"Sorry, didn't mean to stick my cock in your face like that bug man\" he paused, his eyes taking in Keith's naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith was a nice build to him, light hair, very good tone, could easily be a football player, if he were regular sized and all that is. He even had a considerable package himself, again, for his size. Logan's heightened sense of smell could tell that Keith was nervous, no, he was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Easy bug man, ain't no need to be scared\" Logan stated and scooped Keith up gently then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was a weird sensation for both of them. It had been weird for Logan before, picking up a little man and all, but this was different; Keith was naked now. Logan was holding a naked little man in the palm of his hand. He became hard instantly and began questioning himself. He'd never given another guy a thought before, but, something about this whole situation with Keith was working on him in a strong way.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help himself though, the little guy was scared out of his wits practically and.. and Logan found it cute! Logan stood there in the shower with Keith still in hand, in shock.

He looked up, wrapping his arms around his forehead to help block the water even more. \"Logan?\" he asked, realizing that the big guy hadn't moved since they stepped into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan shook his head slightly, snapping out of it, and looked down at Keith. \"Yeah bug man?\" he asked, his regular tone back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You spaced out\" Keith said, he was resisting the urge to yell, he felt he should, but Logan seemed to be hearing him just fine over the roaring waterfall that was the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just thinkin', nothin' for you to worry about\" Logan said and then grabbed the body soap and collected it in the same hand that Keith was in. \"I'll let you get clean first before I start\" Logan said, waiting for Keith to start, he didn't realize it but he was staring the little guy down with an intense gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith noticed though, but tried to ignore it as he got some of the soap and began washing himself off. Logan just held the hand out, cupping it so that Keith didn't fall out. For Keith, Logan's palm felt like sanding paper under his little feet. This had a second effect though, the water from the shower began to fill up the spaces of Logan's hand and quickly rose to Keith's knees. However, it didn't go past there, so Keith was safe.</span></div></div>",

This was a bit surreal, yet cool, Keith didn't know why, but he found it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan went ahead and got some soap for himself and began lathering himself up and washing. His hands lingered on his crotch which was rock hard after Logan had watched Keith take his shower, he even grunted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan was rather quick about cleaning himself up too. Then it was time to wash his hair, he grabbed some shampoo and began lathering up his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith had been sitting rather comfortably on the top of Logan's head, until he saw Logan's hands and the shampoo coming to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"L-Logan! I'm up here still!\" Keith yelled, he'd kept at a normal tone before, but was afraid and couldn't help raising his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, so?\" Logan responded and continued, \"You need to wash your hair too, don't ya?\" Logan asked, continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah.. but, I might fall or get washed off\" Keith replied, calming a bit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Trust me bug man, I won't let that happen\" Logan said, never stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~Okay~ Keith thought nervous still as he grabbed some of the shampoo and began washing his hair as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Time to rinse\" Logan said and tipped his head under the faucet, and Keith as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Logan!\" Keith said, trying to hold on as he felt the ground tipping forward and the water began smacking into him and pushing him down. The shampoo made it impossible for him to grab hold of Logan's smooth black hair, so he tumbled down. He did a rather good job though at trying and only slid onto Logan's face, his nose in particular, he grasped as best he could. Logan was looking right at him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith's heart nearly stopped when he saw Logan's intense and deep eyes staring at him, it was as if he was staring right into his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Logan smirked, though Keith couldn't see it, he did feel the movement from it. Logan scrunches his nose a bit, causing Keith to lose his grip and fall down completely off Logan's face now. Down, down, down. And then...</span></div></div>",

However, it wasn't entirely over for the little guy, \"Look out\" Logan said with a smile now as his hair dropped down in Keith's direction and a torrent of soapy water rushed down. Just as the water was about to smack into Keith and most likely cause him to fall out of the hand; Logan's closed his hand and kept Keith safe and secure. Some water of course seeped in, but it seeped back out too from a slight gap that Logan had made between his thumb and hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Keith sat there, he managed to catch his breath and calm his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The water was turned off and the hand unfurled. \"All clean, wasn't so bad now was it?\" Logan said, stepping out of the shower and over to the counter where his towel was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith looked up at Logan. His large.. gigantically large, hairy muscular body glistened and shined, and the long black hair drooped down around his gorgeous face. Keith was about to respond to Logan too, when cold air slammed into his naked form, he instantly shivered and on instinct dropped down into a laying position on Logan's hand to try and absorb some heat from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, you okay there bub?\" Logan said, not realizing how Keith's small size was effected more drastically by the temperature change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"C-c-cold..\" Keith got out through chattering teeth, shivering and curled up.</span></div></div>",

He didn't bother with a shirt, underwear, or socks since he'd be going to bed soon anyway. He began looking around for something that Keith could wear to keep warm.

Without another word, or a rebuttal from Keith, the tiny man was dropped into Logan's sock. He then decided to tie the sock up. Keith had shown earlier that he had a habit of letting his boredom and curiosity lead him out of safe places, so Logan decided to make sure he stayed in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He sat the sock on his nightstand then and turned the light out. \"G'night bug man\" he said gruffly, and then climbed into bed and covered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keith wasn't exactly thrilled about being inside the sock. Logan obviously hadn't checked or thought of whether this sock was clean or not, cause it most certainly wasn't. The pungent smell of sweaty feet bombarded Keith nose from all sides. He tried to crawl out of the opening, but found it was closed off. So he tried tearing the sock, but the fabric was too strong. He sighed in defeat and decided to lay down. At least he was warm though, and safe; knowing Logan was near by, even if he had goofed off a bit in the shower, Keith felt safe around the titan. With Logan still in mind, Keith drifted off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Logan woke up the next morning and stretched a bit, he lay there momentarily, thinking some things over; specifically how he'd felt towards Keith yesterday. He soon arrived at three base emotions he currently had about the whole thing. The first emotion was one he'd had towards others at the mansion, specifically the younger students like Kitty, Jubilee, Rogue, and Bobby. It was protective, father or big brother-like in nature. The second emotion was a more primal adrenaline rush from being seen as huge, big, and powerful. Sure, Logan was strong and forceful in his own right, but this was different, he physically was larger, taller, than someone else now, something he couldn't say so easily before except around kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third emotion however, was the one that was causing him to investigate his emotions; confusion. Logan had been in countless wars, he'd been in plenty of locker rooms before too, so he'd seen his fair share of naked guys. Never before though had he given another guy a thought though. Logan sighed a bit, he had just admitted to himself that he was indeed attracted to Keith. He shook his head slightly, then looked over to the sock on his nightstand. He reached over and brought the sock over to his chest where it rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SKIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Logan's claws popped out and sliced the sock open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then was put back away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was Keith, who had still been asleep before Logan picked the sock up. Logan overturned the sock and Keith went tumbling onto Logan's bare hairy chest. The little buddy almost was covered by Logan's hair chest. Keith groaned a bit and rubbed his eyes sleepily. \"Morning\" Keith said, stretching some before trying to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' bug man, sleep well?\" he asked him, Logan was angled so that he could easily look at Keith, but so that Keith wouldn't go sliding down as he had before when Logan had been working on his bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, as best can be expected when you're shoved into a dirty sock\" he said, he seemed seriously offended at first, but then smiled, letting Logan know that it was okay, at least this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan tilted his head to the right slightly and raised and lowered his eyebrows quickly as if to say 'okay' or 'understood' in response. \"So, guess we should find your naked ass some clothes\" he stated. Keith was after all still naked. \"Gonna have to go to the toy store\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Keith spoke up, \"I'm not a toy\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so?\" Logan said, one of his hands came flying in from behind Keith and scooped him up before the little guy even realized what Logan had in mind. \"You fit in my hand, like a toy\" he said, closing his fingers around the little man and completely encasing him for a moment before retracting the fingers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fragile, like a toy\" he said, bringing the index finger of his left hand over and gently pushing on Keith's stomach until Keith began kicking his legs and pushing away at the finger, in attempts to make Logan stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fun too, like a toy\" he said with a smirk, dropping Keith back onto his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith sat on his hands and knees for a moment before standing up. \"Okay, maybe you're right, but I'm still a person, just like you or anyone else\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other people aren't toy-sized though\" Logan said, he was having a good deal of fun teasing Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith walked up to Logan's chin, and looked up, \"I'm still a person. Are you saying that if there were others like me, that they wouldn't be people either?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, they'd be toys, just like you\" Logan stated, he then parted his lips and blew downward at the little man, toppling him over. This caused Logan to chuckle slightly, which only shook Keith all the more since the 'ground he was standing on right now was Logan and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was determined though and regained his footing and walked back to the chin and climbed up on top of it even. \"How about I punch you in the nose, then see who's a toy!\" Keith said, determined to change Logan's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan smirked as a devious idea hit him, he allowed Keith to make his way onto his face, but as he made his way to his nose, Logan surprised him by opening his mouth, and Keith found his legs stretched over the chasm below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?! Close your mouth!\" Keith said, trying to keep from falling with his legs being stretched so far, his balance was rather poor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Logan widened the gap, and poor Keith went tumbling on inside, screaming as he dropped. Logan sat up though quickly to keep him from dropping to the back of the throat. Logan also instantly closed his mouth once Keith had fallen inside, sealing him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!\" Keith screamed in fear as he rested on the tongue. He went over and began pounding on the walls of this strange prison. \"Let me out!\" he cried out. Suddenly the tongue began moving around, tripping and tossing poor Keith, and coating him in saliva. The tongue maneuvered itself so that Keith ended up under it, and then it covered him up, Keith's arms and legs flailing on each side, wrestling against it to try and get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan meanwhile went rock hard at the sensation, the thought, and the taste. Realizing that there was a naked little man inside of his mouth, not even able to wrestle his tongue, was great by itself. That thought excited but also worried Logan. Keith was small and helpless, and however tasty he may be, Logan promised to keep him safe, and even wanted to, despite his pushiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan brought his right hand to his mouth and spit Keith back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith gasped and looked around, apparently scared out of his wits. He looked to Logan's face and a look of fear was all he showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Logan regretted doing what he'd done now, he could see it really bothered Keith. \"Sorry little guy, I was only joking\" Logan said, trying to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith however was just too badly shaken up by it to accept comfort from words, silent tears went down his face and he hugged himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan sighed and brought a finger up to Keith and gently rubbed his back, that seemed to calm him some, but he still didn't say anything. \"Come on, let's go get some breakfast\" he said. With that he removed the covers and got out of bed, getting himself ready for the day ahead...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Logan momentarily placed Keith back in the sock for warmth and sat it on the bed. The sweatpants came off and a pair of black boxer briefs went on. Some dark blue jeans, a white tank top, some plain white socks, and his brown boots followed. He then added a straw cowboy hat on top of his head. With that he was ready and walked back over and scooped Keith back up and without a word, placed him in the snug confines of the right pocket of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredibly warm, but also incredibly cramped inside the pocket; both were thanks to Logan's large muscular thighs. Keith didn't seem to mind though, in fact even after the incident of falling into Logan's mouth, Keith still felt a sense of security around Logan, and felt very safe being so close to him. It was odd really. Keith felt secure with Logan from everything else... except Logan. The larger guy's antics were based on fun, but Keith didn't think Logan would ever be able to understand how that experience had made him feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy sighed and sat in the pocket, move some lint around that had lightly collected at the bottom. Another thought crossed his mind, his current location was particularly close to another part of Logan's anatomy. He almost instantly questioned that thought and the feeling of arousal that came with it. -Why did I think of that, and why am I.. must be the heat- he excused it away, but his mind kept returning to what lay just a little ways away on the other side of the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step Logan took, shook his entire world. To Logan though, he didn't really notice anything, except the fact of how close Keith was now to his crotch. Sadly for Logan, that thought gained a reaction from said area. He tried ignoring it and tried to forget about Keith entirely for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in the kitchen, Logan saw that, as usual, most of the students were fast asleep still, or at least not in the kitchen. Kurt was awake though. \"Good morning Logan\" he said in his German accent. Logan waved half-heartedly to him and went ahead and got some eggs, bacon, and sausage out. He began cooking right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt walked over with a cup of coffee and sat down, \"Perhaps you should add a vegetable or fruit occasionally?\" Kurt said, making a light joke then sipped at his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan glanced up at him from the food. \"I think I'm doing just fine elf without health tips from our resident minister\" he replied, meant as a sort of joke, and sort of serious. It was quiet momentarily, except for the sound of food cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan gazed back at Kurt again then. \"Elf, you ever fallen for someone, you know just isn't right for ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked back up, cocking an eyebrow. \"Well, I..\" he cleared his throat and started over. \"As a matter of fact Logan, I have\" he paused, \"I'm training to be a priest, and priests are celibate. Yet, I will admit to you that on occasion my eyes and my heart have betrayed me\" Kurt said, and kept it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grunted a bit, \"You're human Kurt, attraction is a natural part of that, right?\" Logan said, still cooking, he didn't look up while he said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt was curious to what Logan was on about. \"Yes, I personally resist the urges though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Logan continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in my case, it's a matter of faith and duty to my order,\" he paused and decided to venture forward with a bold question, \"and yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looked up now, \"Isn't anything holding me back elf\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why bring up such a question Logan? You're not one to be interested in the affairs of the priesthood\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was quiet for a moment, \"It's nothing,\" Logan said and quickly added, \"and no, I don't want to talk about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, listen to your heart. Let your heart guide your steps and you shall never falter. Unless you are wanting to be a priest too, yeah?\" Kurt said, smiling, trying to take some of the seriousness out of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work as well as he'd hoped, Logan seemed very thoughtful at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, you may want to check on your eggs, I believe they are beginning to burn\" Kurt said, drinking more of his coffee before teleporting away with it to go do some light reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was ready and Logan put it on a plate and headed over to the table and pulled Keith out again and sat him down and sat a hand down over him, trying to conserve heat around him so he wouldn't start shaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then broke off a bit of egg, bacon, and sausage and handed them to Keith. Again, these pieces were each huge to Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry Keith\" Logan said during the meal, he didn't remove his hand, or look at Keith, just said it. \"I know I scared you, I didn't mean to\" he sighed. \"I guess I've been letting this whole thing get to my head and all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence, then; \"What's going to your head?\" Keith asked, he made no attempt to look at Logan or come out from under the hand's shelter either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan cleared his throat, \"Being the big guy for one. It's nice, I ain't gonna lie to you,\" there was a pause, \"but, I think I realize I've been coming off as more of a jerk, than a friend, and that's what I'd like to be,\" another pause, \"'Round here, I'm usually the guy that sticks up for the others, 'cause I know how it feels to not be able to fight back, to be caged, to have no control. I've been there\" Logan said, there was some deep emotion buried behind Logan's gruff exterior, and Keith was realizing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure that Ororo knows about you and gets you to your own room and all today\" Logan said, as he said it though, he felt a tinge of sorrow though. Keith was fun. He was also someone that Logan could have fun with and talk to without having to hold such a gruffness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something wrap around his thumb, doing its best anyway. He raised the other fingers and saw Keith was hugging him! \"Logan, you did scare me, and I- I really hope you never do that, or anything like it, again. But, I've had fun with you. I mean, I feel like I.. I fit in with you, and well, that means a lot to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to stay with you, if that's alright. I mean, a full room would be completely impractical for me anyway\" Keith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan smiled lightly back at Keith, \"Finish your eggs bug man, I'm taking you to get some more clothes when you're done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith smiled and did as he was told, Logan covered him back up with his hand again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they were both done and Logan scooped Keith up. \"You're sure, right? If you change your mind-\" Logan began. \"I'm sure Logan. I'm also sure about really wanting to walk around in something other than my birthday suit\" he joked. Logan smiled and then put him back in the pocket and went to the garage. He climbed on his bike and they were soon off...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't painful, for the moment at least, but it was definitely uncomfortable. He could feel logan's finger rubbing him the trought the jean. \"You can go under my hat toyboy, if my pocket it too tight. Just kick my leg if you want it\" Logan said, while he rub Keith's bulge under the jean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith tried to kick the muscle thigh, but the jean was so tight that Keith could not move any part of his body, even his head was pressed against Logan's leg. Logan knew that Keith could not move him self, and while he kept rubbing him and with a smile in his face, said \"Well, if you want to stay there\" and then, he turned up the motorcycle. On the upside of things, Keith wasn't a bit cold now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motorcycle flew down the road,, the town wasn't too far away and he was sure that there had to be some toy stores there; where else did the younger students at the mansion get their seemingly never-ending supply of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived, Logan parked his bike. He frowned instantly, the place looked stupid, that was his opinion right off the bat. \"Bet they have some jackass clown running the place even\" he said, before walking on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO! WELCOME TO LOONEY LARRY'S TOY EMPORIUM!\" came an obnoxiously loud voice the instant Logan stepped inside. Logan rolled his eyes, why did he have to be right; walking up to him was none other than a clown, apparently the store owner or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW CAN I HELP YOU?\" the clown asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help me by taking a long walk off a short pier bub\" Logan said and tried to bypass the clown, but was stopped as the clown jumped in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AW, DON'T BE A GRUMPY GUS NOW\" the clown said, faking a pouting face, he then squeezed a flower that was on his outfit, which of course sprayed Logan in the face with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience could only go so far, and Logan never seemed to have any. The clown found himself lifted off the ground by his collar. \"Listen clown,\" he began, but stopped, something cut his eye; there were kids in the store. Logan growled a bit, but he set the clown back down. \"I don't need any help\" he said, seemingly calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown took the hint, and hobbled off elsewhere, probably the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan headed on down the aisles, looking for some clothes for Keith. -Trains, board games, yo-yo's, sports equipment..- Logan told himself as he wandered through the store, but not finding what he was looking for. At last there was only one aisle left; the Barbie/Pink aisle. -Of course- he said and inwardly groaned as he began walking down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was this aisle that he found what he was looking for. In pretty pink boxes were clothes for some dolls of various sizes. He remembered that Keith was about half the height of one of his pinky finger, so he looked at that and began comparing his pinky to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he found clothes that looked like they'd be the right size. He grabbed up the box that contained three outfits, then decided it might be good to grab a second one as well. He then, gratefully, left that aisle and headed for the checkout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that clown again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though the clown kept quiet and quickly got Logan through the checkout and gave him his receipt. Logan smirked, taking his bags. \"What? No, 'come again soon'?\" he asked, having heard the clown say it to the other customers since he'd been there. Logan then headed on out to his bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Logan's claws popped open and sliced open the tops of the two boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got the clothes on out and began stuffing them in his left pocket. He tossed the boxes into a nearby dumpster; there was no way he was walking into the mansion with big pink boxes, he'd never live it down if he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to head back when he decided to check on Keith, reaching into his right pocket and pulling the little guy out. \"Not a fan of toy stores I take it?\" Keith asked, having heard the whole clown conversation from the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not\" Logan stated plainly. Then, He...</span></div></div>",

He then took Keith and the clothes out and placed them both on the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith inspected the clothes. He began trying them on, and smiled; they fit. Knowing that he quickly got an outfit together. He decided to wear a pair of jeans, some plain white socks, and a white long sleeved shirt with a blue t-shirt over that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan meanwhile kicked off his boots and sat on the bed, stretching his legs out and leaning against the headboard. He grabbed one of his cigars, which was also on the nightstand and a lighter which was inside a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think they fit well enough and.. AH!\" Keith stopped ins hock at seeing one of Logan's claws for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan cut the cigar with one quick swipe, then turned to Keith, hearing him scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- what's wrong with your hand?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-He hasn't seen these yet- Logan realized. He lit the cigar, then;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other five claws popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they?\" Keith asked, gaining better control of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're claws, adamantium; artificial\" Logan stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artificial, you mean, you put them inside of you?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I was experimented on like a lab rat, bug man. One of my powers is that I can heal, so some eggheads in the military thought they'd experiment on me; turn me into a killing machine\" Logan paused, removing the cigar for a moment, \"They got what they asked for\" he paused, \"in fact, they say I'm the best at what I do. And, what I do, ain't pretty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you kill for a living?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan placed the cigar back in his mouth, \"No. Left that hell hole, was found by the Professor, he helped me sort through all of that shit, for the most part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sounds like a great guy\" Keith said, calming a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was kid, he was one of the best\" Logan said, pausing in thought for a moment, before looking at Keith again. \"Nice outfit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Keith said with a smile, \"and thanks for buying it and all too Logan\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan nodded, \"So, what now bug man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Keith asked, waving his arm about in a slightly wild fashion; Logan must not have realized it but he was blowing smoke all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most folks come here looking for help; learnin' to use their powers out there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is being small, so I don't really know how I could possibly use that 'out there'\" Keith stated, \"but, I have found help here at least\" he smiled, but was still waving his arm around to clear the smoke, coughing a bit in his sentence too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan smirked, and realized the smoke was bothering Keith, he... </span></div></div>",

Keith smiled, hearing the concern in Logan's voice made him feel warm inside. However the feeling was interrupted as he was elevated up and the fingers unfurled completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's eyes went wide and his mouth opened in awe. \"A mutant?\" he asked Logan, already forgetting the 'keep it quiet' rule. Logan nodded, \"Came here the other day, been watching out for him since\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat it a good deed my friend, you and I are much alike. We are warriors, but our hearts are golden\" Pete said, slapping Logan on the back real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat even made Logan move forward a little from the strength of Pete's arm, \"Sure Pete, whatever you say\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I hold him?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask him?\" Logan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete leaned down and whispered, \"Would it be alright for me to hold you?\" Pete asked, an eagerness in his eye, Keith noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but be careful, okay?\" Keith said, a bit nervous. Logan dumped Keith into Pete's hand, and Keith was shocked. Pete's hands were even larger than Logan's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, he is so cute and tiny\" Pete said, moving Keith around in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan smirked, knowing that Keith would have some choice words about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed Keith frowned as he was tossed about and talked about as though he were a baby or a puppy, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I took care of you for a while?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's eyes widened now, he hadn't expected that, but he waited for Keith's reply.</span></div></div>",

Inside, he was glad to hear that Keith still wanted to stay with him, even when offered to go with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete brought a finger from his other hand up and began poking and prodding at Keith playfully. Keith in turn tried pushing the finger back but found he couldn't even budge it. Pete noticed this too and gave Keith a little extra push for trying. This forced the air right out of the little guy and he lay still momentarily, trying to regain his breath. Pete's finger began to make its way over Keith's body then, petting him like one would a lizard or some other small animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Pete, hand 'em on back, got some others to meet still\" Logan said, holding his hand out. A look of slight sorrow and hesitation crossed Pete's face, but he reluctantly dumped Keith back into Logan's waiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice to have met you little comrade\" Pete said, leaning down, his face taking up all of Keith's vision. \"Uh.. n-nice to meet you too\" Keith answered, but was grateful when Logan's fingers covered him back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of them left Pete behind and headed downstairs. The den was empty except two guys, Bobby and Remy, who were playing a game of pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, if it ain't mister big bad hisself\" Remy said with his Cajun accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby didn't say anything, just looked over at Logan. The boy admired him, maybe more, but was so intimidated by him that he found he could never hang out with him or even say much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lettin' the kid beat ya Cajun?\" Logan asked as he walked over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think mon ami. I been winning three games straight, n'est-ce pas Bobby?\" Remy said, twirling the pool stick around, he accidentally hit Logan's hand, and poor Keith went flying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're swingin' that-.. oh no..\" Logan said, pausing and looking at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't tell me the great healer is wounded\" Remy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan ignored Remy and began searching the floor, crouching down, he was careful not to move his feet. The carpet's odd coloring made it difficult to see where Keith had gone to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy shrugged Logan off, \"Go ahead Bobby\" he said. Bobby nodded and began walking around the table, past Logan and Remy to try to get a good shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, poor Keith had been sent flying down tot he ground. Amazingly the carpet and his incredibly small size kept him from breaking any bones, it was amazing. However, he was a considerable distance away from Logan now and surrounded by titanic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of white sneakers with blue designs on them, began heading his way. \"NO! HELP!\" he screamed and began to run. The shoes thundered behind him, gaining incredible ground on him with each step. The third step was coming and the shadow loomed over him. Keith kept running but turned his head backward and up to see the gigantic treads closing in on him. \"LOGAN!\" he cried out, knowing he wasn't going to make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Logan's hand shot forward, right under Bobby's foot. This caused Bobby to tumble over, not expecting that. Logan pulled his hand back close to him, now holding his prize, Keith was safe. \"You alright?\" Logan asked, opening the hand up and peering inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ton Earth?\" Remy asked, leaning in and seeing what was in Logan's hand. \"You carryin' 'round dolls now?\" Remy smirked, logic trying to make sense of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ain't no doll Cajun, the kid here nearly crushed this little guy\" Logan said, raising back up from the crouching position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was badly shaken and was laying curled up in Logan's hand, trying to calm himself from the thoughts of being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby meanwhile got back up, \"Did I, do something wrong?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you almost crushed my friend, Frosty\" Logan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy on the kid Logan, didn' even know 'bout him after all\" Remy said, defending Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was silent for a moment, he indeed did not have any idea about the little man, until now as he looked down and saw him there. \"I-I'm sorry, it was an accident, I had no idea Logan, really\" he said, the last thing he wanted was for Logan to be mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grunted and wrapped his fingers back around Keith. He didn't say anything to Bobby or Remy, he just turned and walked away, heading back toward his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy placed a hand on Bobby's shoulder, \"Don't let him bug you, that one there is always fussin' 'bout somethin'\" the Cajun said, trying to make Bobby feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess\" Bobby said and put his stick away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not playin' no more?\" Remy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby shook his head and was heading for his room as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. well, guess that's four games\" Remy said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan got back to his room and sat on the bed and then opened his hand. Keith was no longer curled up, he still seemed shaken, but looked back to Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meeting the others was a bad idea, it's too dangerous for you\" Logan said, paternal instincts taking over. Keith smiled, but disagreed with Logan, he had wanted to meet the others, and wouldn't mind meeting more either. \"You shouldn't have been so hard on him\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's eyes widened for a second, \"What? Seriously? He almost crushed you Keith!\" Logan said, getting louder than he normally would around Keith. Keith int urn placed his hands over his ears then removed them when Logan finished. \"No one knows that more than me Logan, but, he didn't know about me, so it's not his fault\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying it's mine?\" Logan said, getting defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's no one's fault, it was just an accident\" Keith said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grunted, a moment later he rolled his eyes and sat Keith on the nightstand and then stood up. Keith was about to ask where Logan was going, but he didn't get the chance as he left the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keith sighed to himself and then noticed the pile of clothes again that Logan had bought him earlier. He began going through them better and sorting them. He smirked at the outfits. Most of them were impractical, things he would never really wear; and yet, he considered it, thinking some of them could be sort of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a police officer outfit, a camouflage outfit, a navy outfit, a firefighter outfit, a business suit, some more regular clothes like jeans or khakis and a t-shirt and a hoodie. Then the outfits began to get really interesting. There was a pirate, a cowboy, an Indian, a Robin Hood (tights and all) outfit, and even an Indiana Jones type outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled to himself and decided to try one or two of them on while Logan was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan meanwhile had tracked down Bobby and knocked on his door. No response. \"Come on kid, it's me\". Still no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Logan's claws slashed through the lock of the door and opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SNIKT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was sitting on his bed, leaning against the wall and looked at Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan could tell that Bobby had been crying, so he bypassed the question as to why he didn't answer the door. He sighed and walked in and sat on the bed as well, though not side by side with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh.. I came to say that, it wasn't your fault, downstairs, and, I shouldn't have yelled at you, like I did\" he said. Apologizing wasn't really something that Logan did very often, even when he should, so it was a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, we good then kid?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked at him then, \"I am sorry Logan, I didn't know\" Bobby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was a rather emotional kid. He usually seemed fun and carefree though, that is except when he was around Logan. Around Logan he seemed exceedingly self-conscious and timid. Logan had noticed this before, but had never said anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Bobby\" Logan said, seeing the tears begin to form again. It was too late though. \"Ah kid\" Logan said, maneuvering around and wrapping and arm around him and hugging him. \"You shouldn't take what this old grouch says to heart, y'know?\" Logan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby went a bit silent as he was wrapped in Logan's embrace. He remained quiet, for a bit, enjoying where he was. Logan was warm and felt as great as Bobby had imagined he would. Indeed, Bobby was gay, and had been attracted to the old Canadian since the day he met him. However, Bobby knew for an absolute fact that Logan was straight and that there was no future for them. So, Bobby at least was able to enjoy this moment with him, even if Logan was oblivious to it. ... or was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's sense of smell managed to pick up on the pheromones Bobby was releasing into the air. Logan's eyes widened, his initial reaction was to pull away. But he stopped himself a split second before he went through with that. He remembered that he'd just hurt Bobby's feelings, and now he knew why he'd been able to do so with such ease; Bobby placed him above others because he was attracted to him. So, if he were to pull away and confront Bobby about it, it would crush the kid's heart. Logan inwardly sighed and held Bobby for a little while longer before releasing. \"You alright now kid?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now uh-\" Logan scratched the back of his neck, trying to think of something to say, but was drawing a blank. \"I'd better get back and check on Keith\" he said, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Bobby said, \"Thanks Logan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan gave a half-way smile back at him, and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Poor kid, I know how it feels to love someone that doesn't love you back- Logan thought to himself as he returned to his room. He walked toward the night stand and about burst out laughing as his thoughts for Bobby were broken. \"What the hell are you wearing?\" he asked, bending down to get a better look at Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dressed up in the cowboy outfit. This outfit had dark blue jeans, tanned chaps, cowboy boots with plastic spurs, a light blue button-up long-sleeved shirt, a tanned vest, a red bandana around his neck, and a black cowboy hat on his head. \"I don't know, I thought I'd try some of these outfits on\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sundance, you gonna go find yourself a beetle to ride across the wide open backyard?\" Logan smirked as he scooped Keith up and dangled him by the shirt in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith folded his arms, \"You think your so funny Logan\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm laughing\" Logan said, and headed for the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we off to now?\" the little guy asked, unfolding his arms as he looked around. Logan quit dangling him and repositioned him in his right hand better.</span></div></div>",

For what?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm part of a team, the X-Men\" Logan stated, entering the elevator that would take him to the sub-basement level of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X-Men. I've heard of you guys, on the news\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't believe everything you hear on the news kid, we're not as bad as they make us sound, well, at least not the others\" Logan said as he pushed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is it you guys do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help guys like you\" Logan answered, then added, \"Mutants that are mistreated by society. The Professor always said it's because they fear what they don't understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. But, what do they have to fear from someone like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mean pinch perhaps?\" Logan said, half grunting and half laughing at what he'd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator arrived and opened to metallic walls, floor, and ceiling. \"Whoa, I feel like I stepped into a science fiction movie or something\" Keith stated as Logan walked down the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little man, you're smaller than my pinkie, and I can heal and make six claws pop out of my body. We passed up science fiction a long time ago\" Logan stated, he turned and entered a room; the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt humid in the locker room, even to Keith. No one else seemed to be there as Logan walked around, arriving at what must have been his locker; it had a few claw marks and dents in it. Logan opened the locker up and sat Keith down inside. He then quickly took off his shirt, then pants, leaving Logan standing in his boxer briefs and socks. He took the socks off as well and set them down on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith blushed madly, basically right in front of him was the world's biggest strip show, and a very, very sexy one at that. Sitting on the shelf, Keith was able to look at Logan the way the regular sized folks could. It was nice, from up here he felt more like an equal instead of a tagalong. Logan reached up beside Keith and pulled out a karate gi outfit. he dressed himself and then tied the black belt around his waist. The last touch was a pair of tabi socks. He put them on and was prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training is pretty important to you I take it?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that, need to make sure I'm prepared\" Logan stated in reply as he gathered his other clothes and placed them in the locker. He had been careful again to make sure he didn't get Keith mixed up in the pile of clothes. He then scooped Keith up in his hand and headed out of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you knew martial arts\" Keith spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Logan grunted with a slight nod as his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what fighting style do you practice?\" Keith asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of 'em\" Logan answered, still not looking down to Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith chuckled a bit, \"All of them? Sure Logan, you're tough, that's obvious, and I don't doubt you know how to handle yourself in a fight, but there's countless fighting styles out there, it would take forever to learn all of them\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually share a lot of moves, and when you've lived as long as I have, well, you pick up on these things\" Logan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith didn't say anything this time, his mind was full of questions though. As they entered the training room, called the Danger Room by the residents of the mansion, Keith went ahead. \"How old are you? You look around my age\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember fighting in the Civil War, if that helps\" Logan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith's eyes widened and looked up at Logan with absolute confusion. \"Logan, that was in 1860, that's well over 100 years!\" Keith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it\" Logan said, as they walked in and Logan locked the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mutant power?\" Keith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I can heal, and apparently it's kept me going and looking the way I do\" Logan stated, he cleared his throat, \"Now, enough chit chat\" Logan stated and pulled his belt forward and stuck Keith between the pants of the gi and the black belt. He tightened the belt slightly to make sure he was secure. \"Just don't move around too much, and you'll be fine\" Logan said. He then went silent and bowed to a non-existent opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Logan began to fight as though he were being attacked by an endless horde, all coming after him. He punched, kicked, used his elbows and knees to add potential damage and skill. He leaped in the air and practiced a few more acrobatic moves. He did a mid-air somersault, some spinning kicks, a downward kick, and some other moves. His breathing intensified as he continued with the rigorous exercise. Keith remained quiet during this time and merely watched in awe at Logan's skill and dedication. While the current location wasn't particularly comfortable, he didn't mind, and actually rather liked it.</span></div></div>",

He exited the danger room and headed back to the locker room. When he got there he sat on the bench and relaxed for a moment. He then felt some squirming around his midsection. He gazed down and there was Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Logan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting myself out, you look tired and you reek too\" Keith said, as he managed to finally get out from under the belt, falling to the crotch of the pants. Logan gritted his teeth a bit at that, repressive a hidden primal urge. His mischievous side won out though. \"Giddy up\" he said. A sudden jolt came up from beneath Keith, causing him to fly up into the air some. He landed back close to where he'd been, only to be jolted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment to register that Logan was purposefully causing his cock to jump so that it would through him into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never make it in the rodeo like that little buckaroo\" Logan said, and kept it up. Keith was tossed left, right, up, down, and every which way. When Logan seemed to finally have enough, Keith looked just as tired and worn out as Logan did. He slowly crawled to the edge and landed on the bench next to Logan's colossal thigh and rump.Then, Logan began to rub his swollen crotch through the tabi uniform, watching the little man with roguery. and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went to take off his socks and smirked, his mischievous side still in full control. He scooped Keith up and placed him on the floor between his huge feet. The Tabi socks separated the big toes from the other toes. \"Time for round two, gotta learn to wrestle at the rodeo\" Logan said, and used the space to grab and hold Keith with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Logan, it smells terrible down here!\" Keith said. He had other concerns almost instantly though as the toes began to playfully squeeze and shift the little man around in their strong grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That don't surprise me bug man, I haven't washed these socks in months\" Logan said, bringing his other foot over to help smother and coat poor Keith in the sweat and stench of Logan's rancid feet and socks. Keith struggled, but his strongest attempts were completely useless to the huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan then released Keith, and it seemed like the little man was safe from the torture. However; Logan's large right foot loomed over Keith, causing the little man to look up. \"Logan! No! Please!\" He screamed out as the foot came down on top of him. Logan did this very gently. He did not want to hurt Keith after all, only have fun with him. The mountainous foot weighed Keith down to where he could barely move any part of his body. His face pressed into the bottom of the sock, and Logan's foot, he couldn't even move his mouth. All he could do was mumble. The torturing game was extended for a few minutes, and then, Logan...</span></div></div>",

He kept massaging his balls through the fabric of the boxer briefs. He then lifted his foot and scooped Keith up plopped him on his clothed crotch. A large hand descended and pressed Keith firmly into the large organ and sack that laid beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan! Stop! Please! Don't do this!\" Keith said. He was being used as a sex toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan did no such thing, he began grunting and groaning in pleasure. In fact, he literally tore off the boxer briefs, lifting Keith up first, and dropped him back down where he'd been before, but now there was no cloth barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan began rubbing Keith's body into his organ; a primal lust and hunger in his eyes. The alpha male had chosen his mate, and no one, including the mate, was going to question or refuse him! Logan continued. The motions became faster, and faster, then slowed down, then sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, an explosion. Keith was still being violently shaken up and down along the organ, but was now being covered and drenched in a downpour of white sticky liquid; he knew what that was, and he'd accidentally swallowed some of it too. At last, Logan seemed finished. The motions stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe primal urge and the mischievous side subsided into bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound caught his ears then, he gazed down and saw Keith was still there. Things began to set in then really for Logan. The primal passion and feral urgings gone, Logan knew what he had done now. Keith was crying bitter tears and what had just happened; how he'd been used, he was crying and shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan instantly brought the torn boxer briefs back up and wiped Keith off. \"Oh Keith... I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deafening sound of silence was all that could be heard, Keith made no sounds, he made no movements. In fact, if it weren't for his heartbeat and the very gentle sound of breathing and the feeling of it on his hand, Logan wouldn't have even realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of something to say, but with Keith laying there, badly shaken (literally and figuratively), he could think of nothing, so he kept quiet. Instead he sat Keith down on the bench and went ahead and got himself changed back into his regular clothes. Logan turned and scooped Keith back up and placed him in his right pocket of his jeans again now, then headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I lost control, one of those feral rages. ...no, something else. Just something about the little guy that.. mmm..- Logan thought to himself, but as he thought of Keith he was already becoming hard again! He suppressed the urges and continued up the stairs, arriving back in his room shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Keith out of his pocket and then sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at Keith in his hand. Keith was still quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Keith, I said I was sorry, I- it's part of who I am, I have these rages and urges and, it's not as easy to suppress them because of my mutant powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was still quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mutant powers are, they make me more like an animal\" Logan said, trying to explain, but was he trying to explain it away to Keith or to himself? \"When I get strong feelings, I act on them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Keith's attention and he sat up and looked up at Logan, \"Strong feelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hunger, sleep, thirst, anger..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horniness?\" Keith added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan cleared his throat slightly with a brief cough, \"Yeah, that too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you put me in the matchbox? I'd really just like to be alone right now\" Keith said after there was some silence between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan didn't say anything, he simply went ahead and did so, closing the box up behind the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan sighed quietly, looking at the box. He got back to his feet then and left the room to go work on his bike or something; he needed to get his mind off of Keith and what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the garage though he decided a ride would be best and took off for a bit.

We've been looking all over for you. We were attacked\" Bobby stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan said nothing, he instantly began to sniff the air, his eyes widened and then narrowed in anger. He let Bobby go and began following the scent around. The owner of the scent had leapt from the first floor to the second, over the banister on the second floor. Logan ran up the stairs and continued to track the scent. It led down the hallway to his room, the door had been busted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering, Logan's heart seemed to stop for a moment. The matchbox on the nightstand was gone! Logan moved over and could smell the scent on the nightstand. \"Keith\" Logan said out loud then began looking around.

If that's you, I'm in no mood!\" Keith yelled, Logan's enhanced hearing should be able to pick up on that. No change occurred though. Instead Keith continued to feel the owner of the hand's movements. He was running, and jumping too, at an exceptional rate. After a good long while, sweat began to form on the hand and thus on Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity felt like it had passed by before the movement slowed, then stopped. Keith had nearly fallen asleep due to limited oxygen and the warmth of the hand. However, he snapped back wide awake as the hand began to open. He looked around, then froze. This face wasn't Logan's, or anyone he recognized at all in fact, yet there was something that was familiar. \"Who are you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was being held in an open palm, at chest level. Looking up, the little guy saw a man's face. He had a pointed yet wide nose, light evidence for a mustache, sideburns and a beard, and short hair. The hair was light brown, his eyes were amber. The eyebrows were slanted toward the nose and the mouth revealed a smile of large teeth, and with a set of incisors that were especially pointy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick rich voice responded, an air of arrogance came with it, \"That's really brave, usually when I show myself people run away screaming in fear\" the man answered, as he did his fingers rose up all around Keith and pointed the fingernails inward. The fingernails looked much more like claws than fingernails though, like those one might find on a big cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... you are afraid, good\" the man said then, seeming to get some kind of pleasure from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie, I can feel and hear your heart beat, I know you're afraid\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith remained quiet for a moment, glancing around at the deadly claws pointing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" Keith asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I like that, you're a guy who really gets it, you get right to the... point\" the man said, bringing up his other hand as he spoke and knocking and pinning Keith down with one of the claws, if he pressed even a little bit harder he'd certainly slice Keith open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger began to rub his claw the long way over Keith's body. The claw's tip ripped Keith's clothes, and the claw began to rub his naked body. The thumb appeared and both claws began to pinch Keith face. \"So, you are not going to talk, ah?\". Keith didn't say nothing, He had his eyes closed and he was terrified. Then, the claws began began to pinch another parts of Keith's body. The claws rubbed Keith's chest and they pinched his minuscule nipples. Keith was surprised and terrified by the carefully that the huge stranger had. The huge claws were sharp, but the man didn't hurt Keith. But he scared Keith. The hard and warm claws started to twist Keith's nipple slowly. Keith opened his eyes and saw how the stranger pinched his little appendix between his claws's tips. It was the worse thing that Keith could see. \"I can make you talk, little horny\". The stranger said while the claws started to move down, to Keith's bare crotch. Then, the claws started to pinch Keith's Penis. First in the base and then in the tip, scraping the sensitive skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...p-please.. I.. I didn't do anything to you!\" Keith said in desperation. He was fearing for his life and was wishing Logan was there, he'd help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" the man answered, not seeming to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.. please don't kill me..\" Keith said, tears welling up as he pushed against the claws out his crotch, though his attempts were entirely futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You're no use to me anymore. With you gone and me leaving an easy trail behind, he'll come right here. I don't need you\" the man answered, peering down at Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Keith said, crying now, \"I'll do anything, just please don't kill me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claws and fingers suddenly pulled away and the man's face filled Keith's vision. \"Anything?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith nodded, though a bit hesitantly as he got up.

Keith did not want to say anything else, and there was an exceptionally long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I did come up with a use for you after all\" the man stated with a sinister smile as Keith was lifted up toward the face.

He.. he rubbed.. me against.. him\" Keith said, about to go to tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pulled away, slightly. \"Oh he did, did he?\" the man asked, apparently intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Keith said, hanging his head down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know, I stole my brother's sex toy\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?\" Keith asked, realizing now why the face before him now had looked slightly familiar. He was too shocked to be pissed or anything about being referred to as a sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... let's see if you're any good\" the man stated and before Keith could object he found the fist coiling around him. The hand was lowered down and went under the pants and the underwear, then opened back up and the hand pulled away, dropping its passenger inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith tumbled out into the darkness. Since it was night time it was dark in general everywhere, and then being inside of the fabric in the confined space made it extremely difficult to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand remained lowered though and now grabbed the crotch of the jeans from outside the fabric, cupping the large bulge, and Keith with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!!!!\" Keith screamed in shock and fear as he was sent tumbling about and then smashed up against soft, warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continued this, \"Keep that up, I love it when they scream!\" he said, continuing his assault as he specifically targeted the area where he knew Keith was. He maneuvered him around until he was under the balls and then cupped his bulge again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith found himself covered by soft skin as he was dragged about by titanic fingers from outside the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.... I can see why he likes this so much\" the man said, picking up pace. Keith was lifted from under the balls to the head of the colossal dick, one that was even larger than Logan's, and Keith had considered that impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man began being rubbed into the soft skin, an appendage occasionally getting sucked inside of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger rubbed little Keith against his huge cock for a few hours, enjoying every time that a Keith's appendix was jammed inside of his pee hole.

Victor didn't turn around to face him, he smirked, but his smirk melted into gritted teeth and fangs as Logan got close. He whipped his left hand around, slamming it into the side of Logan's head, knocking him over. The attack was painful for Victor too though thanks to Logan's adamantium skeleton. He forced himself to ignore the pain though, his healing factor would help him forget it completely soon anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan drove three claws right into Victor's left leg as he neared. Victor roared on instinct. \"That's.. not nice..\" he said as he began to instantly recover, grabbing Logan's torso from the back and lifting him up, pulling the claws out of his legs. using his incredible strength he thrust Logan forward into a large tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan hit his head hard, but the adamantium and his healing factor protected his brain. His claws had been embedded in the tree. He retracted them and turned jus tin time to get hit in the head with a large log by Victor. This was enough to even give Logan pause to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world was jumbling about crazily for poor Keith.

He went to attack, but found his arms had been elevated above him, they were tied to the tree along the wrists by a thick metal chain, his feet were free still, but he wouldn't be able to fight Victor off with those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Struggle all you want little brother, those chains are adamantium, like that thick skin of yours\" Victor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really planned this out didn't you bub?\" Logan asked, still struggling but making absolutely no progress; Victor had made sure that these chains were super tight, no room to maneuver out of them. He stopped finally and glared at Victor. \"Fine, you got me, at least let Keith go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little brother, you're in no positions to make decisions, let alone demands or requests\" Victor said moving closer and grabbing Logan by the chin. Logan began kicking at Victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be careful if I were you, unless you want to crush your buddy\" Victor stated and gave a deep chuckle. Logan did stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm beginning to think that this flea is more than just a sex toy for you, I think you have actual feelings for it\" Victor said, bringing his face intimately close to Logan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" Logan said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo hoo hoo! So it's true! The big bad Wolverine has feelings for the flea!\" Victor taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you get on with whatever you're going to do already? It's enough to get captured by your dumb ass, not even Scott would deserve to have to listen to you go on and on\" Logan said aggravated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you're ready to start the fun, I'm fine with that\" Victor said. He then leaned forward and locked his lips with Logan's. Logan resisted, shaking his head back and forth until Victor gripped his head and held it still. He held Logan's nose closed shut with the other hand, forcing Logan to open his mouth. Victor's tongue forced its way into Logan's mouth, filling it up, blocking the air he was attempting to get. Logan bit at Victor's tongue and began thrashing about trying to inhale. Victor merely chuckled as he kept this up before finally pulling away and allowing Logan to gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Logan recovered, Victor ran a long claw from Logan's neck down his shirt, ripping it in two, he dragged his finger on down past the chest and abs and then ripped the shirt apart and off of Logan, revealing his muscular physique. He then hurriedly unbuttoned and unzipped Logan's pants. He flung Logan's boots, socks, and then his pants off, leaving the hairy Canadian with nothing but his boxer briefs. Victor hungrily eyed the package in Logan's underwear, even licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck Victor, we're fucking brothers!\" Logan said, he'd gotten strong vibes before many times that Victor secretly wanted him, this would definitely explain a lot of things that had happened in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking brothers, exactly, or at least we will be after tonight he said as he took his own clothes off revealing a similar but taller and larger frame and musculature as Logan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've planned this for a long time, this little guy wasn't originally part of the plan though, I figured I'd take one of your teammates, but this works out much better\" Victor said as he reached down into his underwear and pulled Keith out, he then pulled Logan's underwear open and dropped Keith inside, watching him plummet into the forest of pubes and land atop his younger brother's large dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fighting stopped, and Victor wasn't moving as much, Keith was able to focus on what was going on outside, he heard the conversation and realized that Logan had fallen into a trap because of him, and not only that, but his own brother was about to force himself on Logan! Keith wasn't sure if he could do anything but he was going to try... or he was about to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor's sharp claws appeared, followed by the finger and the rest of the hand, entering the underwear swiftly and equally quickly locating and plucking Keith from the underwear. At first, he was wondering if he was indeed being set free. He looked around and noticed quickly that Logan was captured and nearly naked and Victor, also nearly naked, was lowering him toward Logan's large bulge with the underwear strap pulled open. Keith began pleading, \"No! Stop! Let us go! Fuck you!\" he screamed at Victor as he was dropped into a second underwear prison as the opening above closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor's hand then began poking at Logan's bulge at random intervals and locations then, purposefully missing Keith at first, and then went right for the little man and squished him up against Logan's cockhead, and began massaging him into the soft skin. He could feel the little man wriggling and could even hear the faint cries for freedom through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan in turn began to moan as well, though it was definitely hesitant in nature. He was thrashing about a bit, but not a lot. Victor chuckled as he enjoyed using the little man to entice his brother. \"The fun's just beginning Logan\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The incessant rubbing against his cockhead by such a pleasurable squirming body is too much for him. He lets out heavy pants as he feels himself coming close. Victor merely smiles. \"Yes, give in, Logan. Cum over this worthless runt. He's nothing but our sex toy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Logan lets out a mighty roar as his orgasm hits. Hard. You're right in front of his piss slit as a gooey force slams into you, pinning you against his underwear as more and more of the stuff slams into your little body. It feels like an eternity until it ends, and you can't move an inch afterward. At least until Victor pulls open the mess of underwear and takes your gooey body out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, wasn't that enjoyable, Logan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fuck you!\" he spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be rude, brother! I just have you an amazing orgasm after all.\" He gave a cruel smirk. \"I think it's about time you returned the favor.\" Suddenly, you were dropped what felt like over 20 feet, landing with a splat on a familiar warm surface: Victor's cock. You clung on for dear life as your captor stepped forward to adjust Logan's chains, pulling him down the tree just a bit more, until his face was level with his brother's cock. And then, you realized what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating at all, Victor forced Logan's mouth open, and you were suddenly thrust inside the hot, wet cavern. Almost at once, you fell off the cock, landing with a splat on Logan's tongue. A cry of disgust reverberated around you, but that didn't stop Victor from thrusting in and out, battering you against his cock head and the back of Logan's throat. You could hear him moaning in pleasure, even from this unwanted blowjob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, brother, take my cock,\" he purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried desperately to cling to his cockhead, as Logan tried desperately to force his brother's cock from his mouth, but it was all in vain. Soon enough, Victor let out a loud moan, and you were suddenly hit by yet another load, spraying out from his cock. You let out a gurgled cry as you hit the back of Logan's throat...</span></div></div>",

If anyone ever needed help, and he was near by he'd offer his assistance in anyway possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But of course also being in the prime of his life, like any other man..he had needs. And being single for Peter was starting to become difficult. Hormones building up and ranging inside of him. Not to mention a HEALTHY curiosity in himself. He wasn't fixated on a type of person to get intimate with but he would prefer it wouldn't end in a one night stand...even if this meant the relationship would last a week sadly. His heart would go through so many ups and downs. But it's been 10 months since he has had...fun. Others are only guessing he is deciding to be more careful with whom he chooses to sleep with maybe, when in reality he just hasn't been able to catch anyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So as he got into his room, he was about to freshen up from his workout. Right now he stunk something fierce! So as he is about to take his shirt (which is rather small and very tight on the buffed up russian mind you), he hears someone knock at his door. He opens it to see it is Logan. \"Da?\" Peter says looking down at Logan. \"There was a woman out in the school's drop off area, she was speaking hysterically in russian. The only thing we could tell she said was your name.. All she left was a box with a note on it. It's in russian as well, I figured you could handle whatever that was. So here.\"Logan says what seems to be irratated as he hands the box over to Peter. \"Okay?\"Peter says taking the box confused by this whole situation. \"That's all I know. If it's important bring it to the team's attention, otherwise have fun bub.\"Logan says walking away from Peter. When Logan had turn to walk away Peter took notice he had a red hand-like mark on his left cheek, making Peter unsure to feel sorry or laugh, but he just chooses to close his bedroom door. Peter sat on his bed nd looked at thd box, it was nothing more than a shoe box. So Peter looked at the note and...all in russian just like Logan said. Peter began to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div> 'Please take good care of my son. He is a mutant, and I decided his own home is not safe for him. I decided that here will be safer. He's very small, and can be timid. I've herd there is another russian mutant here on the X-men team. I hope he is willing to show my son to be an amazing person and make use of his powers. Tell my son, I am sorry and I love him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter was astonished by what he read. '<i></i>Zeis must be a joke. No way Zere is a little person in zeis box...' Peter thinks to himself smiling. So he opened the box to make sure he was right. To his surprise, there was a kid. 18yrs old like the note said...unconscious and 2 inches tall from what Peter could tell. He couldn't believe just how puny the little guy was to him. Peter got a better look at him as he lifted the box closer. He had very bright almost white platinum blonde hair, his body was in baggy clothes so Peter can't tell the kid's build, but he has on a pair of glasses. His clothes looked hand made, from the baggy jeans, and sandals to his hoodie jacket and plain one color shirt. Peter puts the box down now feeling horrible. He has to break this news to a kid that his mother pretty much gave him up! And he doesn't even know his name!Peter picks up the box again, this time he gently pokes at the kid's body. The kid stirs but then wakes up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div> -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div> Pavel (PAH vyel) only remembers something being stuffed in his face and then blacking out. Next thing he knew he feels something big pressing against him like whatever it is, is trying to wake him. So he opens his eyes slowly with everything a blur. Soon enough it comes to focus. And all he sees next is a huge man's face. All Pavel did next was scream and back up immediately as far away as the box would let him. \"Whoa. It's okay. I...I'm Peter.\"Peter says back away from the box hoping this will calm the little guy. Pavel takes instant notice Peter is ripped. His body is bulging with muscles, and Pavel can't believe his eyes. Peter looks Pavel his eyes and sees they're silver, while filling with fear maybe? \"What is your name little one?\" Peter asks trying to show he is a gentle man. Pavel just stares in disbelief at the humongous man in front of him. \"M-my name is P-pavel...Where am I? W-where is my family?\"Pavel asks starting to switch from fear to panic. \"Ah well...\"Peter says trailing off feeling awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...my mom...she did this! Damnit! She talked to me about this we agreed not do this! But course father probably forced her too...\"Pavel curses whike talking mainly to himself. \"Da. Zeat is what zee note said...look I am really sorry for this whole situation Pavel. Your mother left me to look after you...\"Peter says feeling sad for the small guy. But as Peter tells him the news Pavel just starts to tear up and begin to break down. Peter can't stand to see him like this and he bearly even knows Pavel. So he goes to start to rub his head to try and calm him. Pavel just let's it all out but he feels Peter's massive finger on his head. He looks up and looks to Peter.</span></div></div>",

However, the young man could tell that this creature was far from the every day raccoon as this one's body was human like in nature. And to the mutant's surprise even more the anthro like raccoon blinked a few times before he complained out loud to himself, \"What the heck? Nothing's in here!\" He then saw the brown furred anthro let out a frustrated growl before he added, \"Whelp I guess I'll just send this worthless box out into space via the trash shoot.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait! Please don't do that!\" Keith begged, as he quickly got up onto his feet and waved his arms in a attempt to get the creature's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he had shouted this the tiny mutant saw one of the raccoon's ears twitch while he asked, \"Huh? What was that?\" The anthro's head then looked down, and upon doing so Keith saw the creature's eyes widen in shock as he went on with, \"What in the world?! What's a human doing inside this box? And for that matter why are you so small?\" Then before Keith could say anything in response he saw one of the raccoon's paws reach into the box to which then the human found himself being slowly lifted out of the box by the raccoon. Once this happened he was then brought up to the creature's red eyes when he kept going, \"So tell me, kid. What's your name? And along with that how'd you end up in that box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well my name is Keith, and I'm a mutant. But for some reason I'm stuck at the size you see me right now. Which from what I was told is 2 inches in height. And I was suppose to be headed to the Mutant Academy to figure out how to adjust with these powers of mine. So I was told being shipped inside a box would be the safest way for me to get there.\" He then found himself looking around past the huge body (to him at least) of the raccoon and saw that he was in a metal area of some sort with a table and various tools on it. This prompted him to look up at the creature in the face again as he continued, \"But this doesn't look like the right place at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course it isn't, kid. Because you see you're currently out in space with me and rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Or to be more specific you're with me in my workplace on the ship. Name's Rocket by the way.\" The raccoon named Rocket stated, with slightly smug tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out in space?!\" The young man shouted, shock clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hey calm down, I'll explain. Because you see I was suppose to get a package from a planet. But apparently someone screwed up big time and sent me the box you were in by mistake.\" Rocket told the young man while he walked towards his work table and then sat down. But upon doing so he then placed the small mutant onto the table when he added, \"But you know Keith, I can kind of understand where you're coming from. Well, maybe not exactly, but you'll get what I mean when you meet a few other teammates of mine.\" Keith then saw Rocket place his right hand underneath his chin while he went on with, \"Although that's besides the point because considering how small you are...... </span></div></div>",

Where do you were? The floor also felt warm on your naked skin, but you got scared when something that sounds like huge thunders seems being getting near to your location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the some lights up softly, only enough to see your sorround; the space was as big as a warehouse, but somethings were just out of place, all seems just weird to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge panel down the room just opened, very fast you must said, and a huge shadow (the thing that was making all the thunder noise) appeared in front of the opening. You looked a place to hide, and the nearest thing you find before the huge thing entered the room was a... Ripped tree on the floor, some meters far from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hided behind the tree just in the moment when the huge being entered the room; a huge humanoid creature entered the room, feeling even small for him. The huge alien must be around 100 feet tall but, you just feel small all around him. When it come out of the dark, only wearing dark grey pants and huge heavy black boots, you could tell that he was man; just with green palid skin and a lot of red marks all over his beefy upper body (you could not tell if they were tatoos with some reliefs or scars).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"these small things just keep appearing, it's all so weird. They must be back soon...\" said the huge man, in the moment his face came out of dark, you could notice that his huge eyes were bright blue, and red marks was also in his face. You were just shocked and frozen there behind the \"little\" tree, like he said, looking the huge boots stepping further to you, making leather and metal sounds. Your stupor just was interrupted when the huge boot stompep a car that neither you or the beefy alien have notice before. It was less the half of the boot's size and it was covered completely under the huge heavy footwear. The giant looked down and squatting over the little flat piece of metal that one moment before was a car. \"I hope no poor little man has been inside there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just shocked how easely he stomped over the car, so you started to run away from him without second thoughs, not even knowing where you would go. You look back for a second at the giant's face and noticed from the expression on his eyes that had saw you. Like thunder steps began again while you ran as fast as you can...</span></div></div>",
