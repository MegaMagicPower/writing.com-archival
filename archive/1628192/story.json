He folded his hairy arms just above his ample belly, thinking back to his young carefree days in the early '60s.  <i>McHale's Navy</i>.  My God, how he loved that show.  Loved it?  He was obsessed with it.  To the point it made him join the Navy right out of high school.  Naturally, the Navy didn't have PT boats at that time.  But they did have river patrol boats, and he served on a few of them in Vietnam.  Those missions earned him two Silver Stars an two Purple Hearts, the latter he could have done without.  Getting shot sucked!  After 25 years in the Navy, he retired a Master Chief Petty Officer, and decided to build his own PT boat.  And yes, he called it <i>PT 73</i>, after the boat Commander McHale and Ensign Parker and their crew of misfits sailed on in his favorite show.  He toured all over Florida with it, giving people the history of PT boats and how important they were during World War II.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never imagined his little floating museum would be used in a real war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he do?  Sit on the sidelines while a rejuvenated Russia invaded his country?  New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Charleston lay in ruin.  Russian tank and infantry divisions pushed further south each day.  The Red Navy roamed freely up and down the Florida coast, bombarding whatever city they wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well that's about to change, you pinko bastards.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it really?  He, his daughter and his two nephews had turned the <i>73</i> into an actual ship of war.  The six .50 caliber machine guns worked.  They also added a pair of M-60 light machine guns, a 75mm recoilless rifle and a captured Russian AGS-17 grenade launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah.  There were also the two homemade torpedoes they had built.  God only knew if they would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Shea shook his head.  <i>This is suicide.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what choice did he have?  That Kynda-class cruiser had been hammering Miami for days.  Someone had to stop it, and it looked like that someone was him, his family, and their pals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Shea chuckled to himself.  <i>Ernest Borgnine, you're going to be the death of me.</i></span></div></div>",

The sailor sympathized with those on the receiving end of the bombardment. When the Americans attacked Russia, he'd been in that position too many times. Overriding his sympathy was his satisfaction at being on the cutting edge of the blade that would sever Florida from the rest of the Unites States. In his childhood among the factories, Florida had been a land where gross excess ruled. It had disgusted him to no end. Now, Andreovich was planning to be among the men who fired the missiles at the resorts where the U.S. army made their camps.<br>\r\nAndreovich saw some movement out of the corner of his eye. A small boat streaked towards his behemoth. Having drilled on every possible boat that the Americans could field, the sailor was an expert in naval vessels of the enemy. This one was a relic. But the machine guns and, could that possibly be, a grenade launcher!-could still kill. He was shocked that the radar hadn't seen it. But the whirr of motors nearby told him otherwise. Two of the smaller cannons were rotating towards the oncoming PT boat.<br>\r\n\"Dammit not fast enough.\" he said, looking worriedly at the approaching boat. He swore as two torpedoes jumped out of the boat's launchers and swiftly cut through the water towards the Kynda-class. One struck right under his feet, but bounced harmlessly off. A dud. The other one seemed to be having steering problems. It swerved wildly before finally striking the bow. This one worked fine, blowing a hole in the ship. But, Andreovich noted proudly, not big enough to seriously damage the cruiser. The guns opened up on the PT boat with a deafening roar. Andreovich manned his own weapon, a 50. Cal with a protective armor shield around it. Water jumped up on all sides of the smaller vessel, but none were hits. It raked the Russian boat with its own fire. Part of the deck next to him exploded from a grenade.<br>\r\n\"Probably for me,\" he whispered while pouring fire onto the boat. Finally, some of his shots hit home. A small fire erupted in the rear of the boat and oil slicked over the water. It turned to run back to the swamps.<br>\r\n\"Andreovich! Come on, we're going after that thing!\" Andreovich's commander hollered at him. Another sailor rushed to take his gun position. Andreovich sprinted for one of the hovercraft landing vehicles the ship had been outfitted with. A squad of marines sat in the troop compartment. They saluted as he passed into the cockpit. Dmitri, his co-pilot was already ready. <br>\r\n\"Shall we pursue him, Andreovich?\" Dmitri asked happily. His small coastal village had burned during the American offensive. Along with his family.<br>\r\n\"Let's get him.\" The fans powered up and the craft glided out onto the open waters.</span></div></div>",

The floating troop carrier's stern just scraped the water surface as the three Kuznetsov engines powered up to maximum speed, driving them to a speed of 55 knots. Soon, their adversary was within visual.<br>\r\n\"Lock and load, men. Let's get that <i>svoloch</i>!\" Andreovich yelled over the roar of the engines.<br>\r\n\"Shall we put a few thirty-millimeters over their heads?\" asked Dmitri.<br>\r\n\"Ha! Good one. See to it that that happens, Dmitri. Use the first Plamya on the starboard side, you'll get a good shot from there!\"<br>\r\nDmitri gave a nod as he unstrapped his safety harness and climbed into the grenade-launcher turret. Several seconds later, he fired off three rounds as the entire five-hundred ton mass of the Zubr-class LCAC shook with ferocity. Andreovich watched his friend's shots land near the boat, but not close enough to set something off. He called for Dmitri to fire more to the left, and he did.</span></div></div>",

I had just gotten off of the plane, and put my boots on American soil for the first time. I had always wanted to go to Seattle, specifically for the Space Needle, but it was destroyed in a bombing run before the invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeliks walked off of the runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, he observed the destruction to the terminal and the still smoking city in the background. He made his way to a forming parade, and stood with his battalion. The commander of the battalion laid down the rules and procedures of the base to the fresh recruits, before dismissing them, and speaking to the company leaders, who then went on to speaking to the platoon leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was new, Private Vitaly had experienced the worst of the war. He grew up in a war-torn village that the invading NATO forces had occupied, and he witnessed some horrid sights of combat at a young age. Once the Russian Army pushed NATO out of the motherland, Feliks was exposed to propaganda, showing the NATO countries to be backwards, and wrong, showing them to have the intent of mass murder and rape. Like many others, Feliks developed a hatred towards the invaders, but the war in Europe came to an end as he joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Russian Army had captured Poland and surrounded Berlin. NATO then looked for peace, but the war came at a cost. A limited exchange of nuclear weapons had hit Russia, America and other European countries. EU and NATO had disbanded, leaving a lot of countries fending for themselves. The only countries that managed to survive the onslaught and protect their major cities, was the US and Russia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the 3rd of July, the Russian air force launched a costly air raid against Seattle and military installations near it. Once the raid was complete, Russian VDV troops parachuted into Seattle, and with intense skirmishes, pushed the US troops out of Seattle and set up a proving ground for the invasion. Feliks arrived the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, if you want to add to this scenario, send me a message first, outlining what you want to add. I know this seems a little far fetched, but that doesn't really matter, I just wanted to explain a few things.</span></div></div>",

There had been reports of a major protest near an occupied shop, one of the designated points for the locals to receive their rations. The people were demanding that the Russians leave, and threw rocks and occasionally, ones who managed to sneak a firearm past the door to door inspections, would open fire at the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Vitaly aimed his AK-12 to the floor, and had in on safety as him and his patrol moved forwards to the rioting mess that was downtown Seattle. Behind them was one of the many newly arrived GAZ Vodniks, but it was halted by the swarm of people blocking the roads. One of the protesters, armed with a metal pole stared Feliks down, who was already overwhelmed with intense anxiety. They locked eyes, and the man started taunting him, as he started to walk over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe switched his rifle off of safety, and raised it.<br>\r\n\"Don't come any close, I will shoot!\" Feliks threatened with shaky hands. <br>\r\n\"C'mon then you piece of shit, shoot me!\" the man said back as he lifted his chin and walked faster.<br>\r\n\"Shoot him, Vitaly\" the squad leader said with a chillingly calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a racing heart, Vitaly put his finger on the trigger and looked down the iron sights of his rifle...</span></div></div>",

The man looked to be 30, he had a cap on and he was a giant, could most likely kill a man with one punch. With an exhale, he pulled the trigger, a single round hitting the man in the heart. He fell to the floor, and Vitaly lowered his rifle. He looked over to the Sergeant beside him, who pulled a cigarette from his mouth, and disposed of it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few startled screams, the sound of silence made the soldiers uneasy. Pushing through the static crowd, came a women, she was in her forties, and she wept. The women got onto her knees, beside the man who Feliks shot. She put her arms underneath him, and held him up to her, she hugged him and cried. Feliks saw his face, and realised that he was probably younger than. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was 19! You mother fucker!\" She yelled with tears running down her face. Feliks felt sick, he looked on the floor beside the young man and didn't see the pole anywhere. Then it occurred to him, he was just trying to get through the line and go home. The propaganda had warped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules of Engagement said that if you feel threatened, you can engage anybody within 200 metres of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd got rowdy again and started to walk over to the soldiers, this time they were armed, and Feliks was sure of it. The Sergeant tapped Feliks on his shoulder and looked behind him, to the other soldiers.<br>\r\n\"It's a free fire zone\" he said in Russian, without breaking a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe KPVT machine gun on the Vodnik opened fire, hitting the crowd with a hailstorm of 14.5MM rounds. Vitaly sunk back in his squad as they advanced, and started to fire.<br>\r\nFeliks felt nauseated as he watched the massacre unfold. He lent against the wall and started to cry, closing his eyes and pretending that what just occurred, never happened. A hand grabbed onto his shoulder, and turned him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a bitch? Pull your head in!\" A squad member said to him.<br>\r\nThe screams stopped, and Vitaly looked over to what was once a crowd of people. The gunpowder in the air made it hard, but he could see the bodies all over the floor.<br>\r\nFeliks knew he needed to shape up if he wanted to survive this war, and if the Squad Leader saw him like this, he would be beaten to a pulp. He realised that he wasn't cut out for all of this.</span></div></div>",
