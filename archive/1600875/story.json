You shake your head and think \"I wish I knew more about girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up feeling different. Sure, you are half asleep, but you feel if you're shorter, slimmer and lighter. Except in one place: your chest feels heavier than usual. You open one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and open both eyes. The room is different. It looks like a extremely girly girls' bedroom. Clothes lie all over the room. A vanity is in the corner, and it looks like it is filled with make-up. You count at least a dozen pairs of shoes. You look down to see the bedspread, and notice it is pink and white. Then you see your new girlish hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are long and slender, with pink glitter polish on them. With increasing alarm, you look to see long slender arms, and a glace of shoulder length honey blond hair. You put your hands to your chest, and feel the breasts you feared you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip out of bed and look in the mirror and see an extremely cute teenage girl. Do you</span></div></div>",

Hurry, please, you'll be late for school.\"  You call back, \"I'll be right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to put on the dress, and notice that it fits your new form flawlessly.  It hugs at your every curve.  You begin to reach for your jeans and a shirt, but then the voice calls out again, \"Honey!\"  With that prompt, you grab a pair of flats...there is no way you're going in heels.  Then, you walk over to the dresser...there seems to be lots of make up.  Your arms start moving and grabbing different items on their own volition.  It's as if your body knows how to do this even though you don't.  You feel different things being applied to your face, your lips, your eyes...\"Wow.\" you say aloud.  For the first time, you actually listen to your voice and look at yourself.  You are beautiful.  You look at yourself a moment longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fashionfuss.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/alice-olivia-hot-pink-stretch-silk-dress-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fashionfuss.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down stairs and your mother smiles, your father looks up from his newspaper and gives you a kiss on the cheek and tells you to have a good day at school.  You start to walk out, and your mom says, \"Honey, you can't forget this...your keys are in it.\"  You grab your purse and take your keys outside.  You look at your keys and see the picture of a horse on them...\"I have a mustang,\" you say aloud.  You hit the button, and you see the yellow Mustang on the street and its lights go off and on.

But now it was another school and you are another person and this person is a girl..<br>\r\nYou shudder as you park your new yellow Mustang at the schools parking lot and exit the car in your beautiful pink dress, not knowing what to do, or how to act. But over all You think that you have the view that this may be an opportunity to find out about girls. You decide to go into the main school building.

You realize that many people and they were not only boys cheek you, this is Chloe and a chick, out with more or less lusty eyes!<br>\r\nThe walkway to the school building seems to last weeks\u2026<br>\r\nYou enter the building then finally when you see two girls talking to each other. One blond, the other has raven colored hair. Both are slim like Chloe. When they spot you give a little scream and rush up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chloe, did you remember that we have cheerleading practice today?\" the raven haired girl asked.

You're starting to regret coming to this school, but you can't get out now. besides wearing this dress makes you noticable, and you wish you picked something less obvious, but the idea of wearing a cheerleader uniform.

You know that's what you would be thinking if a hot, busty blond chick recently split up with someone. No doubt this guy seeks to win points by playing on your supposed vulnerability, saying he'd be there for you or some crap like that. Having once been a guy yourself, you recognize all the signs of a dirty mind. The way he's subtly looking you up and down, appreciating all the curves your pink dress is showing off, lingering just a little bit longer on your bosom. And the dress shows off the slopes of your breasts quite nicely, you realize with disgust. <i>Sorry buddy, but you'd best go prowl somewhere else. You've got no chance...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain locks up when you realize something. On some level, you're actually...enjoying how he is sizing you up and taking in your curves. Enjoying the fact that you're catching the eye of a guy! Of GUYS! And worse, you find yourself taking note of his attributes as well. How well he fills those tight jeans, that cute ass, that cute, perfectly-trimmed beard of his, his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ACK! I don't believe it! All these girly hormones are wreaking havoc on me already!</i> you realize in horror. <i>Must... think.. quickly... Get away, clear my head.</i> \"Errr, thanks, but for the moment, I don't want to talk about it...\" you manage to get out, hoping the right mix of firmness and uncertainty carried over in your now-angelic voice. At first, you feared this guy was going to push the issue. But to your utter relief, he nodded and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, you turn to your locker and get the lock off. <i>Hang on, how did I know the combination!? How did I know what makeup to grab this morning, for that matter!?</i> you silently wonder in horror. <i>Oh no no no, I have some of Chloe's memories and instincts! So how long before... NO! Don't even THINK about that!</i> You barely suppress a shudder, not wanting to think about becoming a girl in mind and soul, as well as body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as with grabbing cosmetics earlier, you hands seem to move of their own volition, snatching up certain books. You decide to go with the flow and do what this body instinctive wants...for now. Perhaps that will ensure Chloe isn't acting out of the ordinary in the eyes of others. So you shut the locker and let Chloe's body do the walking, letting instinct guide you down hallways to what you hope is Chloe's first class of the day. On one hand, it's a bit of a relief, letting Jake's mind take a breather. Waking up as a girl and going to a strange school...you were still coming to grips with that. If only you weren't acutely aware of how Chloe's ample bottom wasn't swaying in this pink dress, or how much it showed off Chloe's toned legs. And the way it felt when your skirt's fabric brushed over your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing, however, compared to how your big breasts bobbled and wobbled with every step you took. The bra's support that felt so welcome before felt almost nonexistent now. Especially with how you were noticing the eyes of guys drawn to you and your bobbing rack. You tried to tune it out as Chloe's body guided you to her first class, but...</span></div></div>",

The realization was sinking in that the dance was less than twenty-four hours away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision was dark. You had the sensation that you were traveling. At last, you stopped moving. A door opens with Tom standing outside, holding the car door. You slide out of vehicle and place your foot forward onto the ground. You scramble to grab a hold of the upholstery as your high heel wobbles on the asphalt. Luckily, you save yourself from injury and embarrassment. You shoot a quick glance at Tom to see if noticed. He continues grinning from ear-to-ear as he's still in awe of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take his arm as you walk into the ballroom. Extravagance is an understatement when describing the ballroom. For some strange reason, you two were the only people in the hall other than the caterers and servants. Tom leans toward you and whispers, \"I hope you like it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it? You love it! Any girl would be a slave to any man who would do this on a first date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom leaves your side and walks to the dance floor. He turns and looks to you, \"Care to dance\"? You unwillingly take up his offer and meet him on the dance floor. He takes your hand out to the side and rests his other hand on your hand. You follow suit as he leads you in the dance. You start to hear a familiar song as you dance the night away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat familiar tune was your clock radio alarm. A jolt struck your chest as you awoke from the dream. Your neck pulsates as you sit up in bed. You're still Chloe. You exhale deeply as you face the day that's ahead of you.</span></div></div>",

The two of you told your dates that you would meet them at the dance so she would have some time to get you ready and prepared.  She even helped out by bringing over a nice light blue dress that was about the right size but too big for her in the chest area and a bit too small for your ample boobs but she helps adjust it and it doesn't show too much cleavage.  The skirt is a loose chiffon that stops just above the knees.  After spending all the time getting ready, you had to admit that Brooke did a great job.  Even now, you can't help but feeling confident and pretty.  But then the Jake in you makes you shake your head to try and shake out those stupid thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok... um... Chloe?\"  Brooke asks with a truly concerned voice.  She is stunning in a long silvery backless dress.  She, like you, is wearing 4\" heals.  Although you aren't as graceful as her, you are able to walk without tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm just a bit overwhelmed.  I mean, just a couple of days ago I was completely different.  Now I'm this totally hot girl and wondering if Tom will like what he sees.  I mean I was totally into girls a few days ago but I can't get the image of Tom out of my head now.\" You sigh deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe takes your hand to comfort you.  \"Well, if you're like the real Chloe, you probably wanted to know how girls think.  Think of this as an experience and enjoy it!\"  She gives you a friendly smile.  \"Besides, it sounds like you kind of have a thing for Tom and now your a girl so its completely OK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is justifying Brooke's logic when you see Tom come up.  You look up at him and feel your heart pound.  You are vaguely aware of Ryan, Brooke's date, as he comes over to her.  Tom smiles, \"You look amazing!\"  You are a little surprised that he is looking into your eyes and not at your boobs like most boys and, for that matter, most men.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nInstinctively you take his arm and the four of you go into the dance.  It is decorated with the typical decorations of a High School formal but it looks wonderful, not as wonderful as the ballroom in your dream but still nice.  Brooke and Ryan head over towards Jess and her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would you like to sit?\" Tom asks as you look around.  The dance floor has a few couples and several more milling about.  \"Or would you rather dance first?\"</span></div></div>",

I wanted to see what it was like as a boy so I cast a spell to make myself a hetero guy and move Jake into my body. But he became a lesbian....so I sort of used another spell to make her straight. It didn't really work as you can know see. Or it made her into you....by making you a girl too. Eventually Jake would forget having ever been Jake, unless I reversed the spell. But on my first day as a boy....I had sex!!! It was way better than the other way! So I kind of want to stay this way! So we should discuss this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one who gave me those damn dreams and tried to fiddle with my sexuality! What the f*** is wrong with you!\" you retorted. \"Wait, what?\" expressed a confused Tom. \"Look\" began Jake, wringing his hands together \"I don't exactly know how to reverse this exactly, but I mean I hear lesbian sex is awesome, so it could work? Right? I mean you two are so perfect for each other now. Why don't you try being a lesbian couple for a while? I am kind of Leah's date. And I was hoping to use a spell to fix her arm and have a good time. Once I figure out how to fix this, we can talk about changing things ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not ok! I was a straight guy and you made me gay as a girl, then a guy and now a girl again. Ok, that's not...you know what I mean! I am a straight guy, not a lesbian or straight woman! You need to turn Tom and I back to guys NOW!\" Jake's eyes narrowed in a terrifying glare. I clung to Tom whose breasts were now larger than mine! \"NYMPHO, SAPPHO, COSQUILLAS!\" chanted Jake. My dress and Tom's tuxedo dissolved as we were soon left in our birthday suits. Tom was a gorgeous woman whose body was toned, large in the chest and bare between her legs. I could see matching desire in her eyes. I need her, I wanted her. I moved forward and she kissed me tenderly.</span></div></div>",

The female side of your brain melts and feels all warm and tingly.  The Jake side wants to run.  Before either side can win, Tom takes you in his arms and kisses you.  The voice that is Jake is silenced and you kiss back.  Tom then opens the car door and helps you in.  You put on the seat belt and notice how it goes between your breasts.  As Tom gets in, he notices as well and looks at your DD's as he starts his car.  Blushing, you look forward, thinking that maybe the two of your will kiss some more and you'll go home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom doesn't live very far away, and after 5 minutes of small talk, he pulls into the driveway.  He gets out and goes around to the door to let you out.  Taking your hand he leads to into the house and kisses you again.  He tells you, \"I can't believe you're here.  Every guy in school would kill to be here with you now.\"  The 'Jake' in you wants to gag as you giggle.  He leads you over to sit on the couch.  His arm goes around you and you let him start making out.  The intense tingles between your legs make you squirm.  Then he puts his hand on your thigh and the tingles get more intense.  Encouraged, his hand moves up to your tummy area.  Your eyes go wide as you realize he is working his way up to touch your large breasts.  You pull back to protest but he continues to kiss you.  Then you feel a hand on a boob.  Tom is rubbing it through your dress and bra.  He can feel your now hard nipple and you can't believe how much more intense things feel.  Still, you are a guy, at least you tell yourself that, and you don't like this!  Right? But Chloe's body loves the tingles and even the Jake side has to admit that you've never felt like this even when you masturbated in the shower as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of this loosen you up and Tom can feel you relax a bit.  The other hand starts to unzip your dress.  Before you can protest, Tom has it open and is starting to unhook your bra.  The male side kicks in as you realize Tom is trying to get you naked.  He has moved to kissing your neck.  You are breathing hard and feel flushed.  The warm and tingly sensations a building.  Maybe it's time to put a stop to this.  You've let the Chloe side enjoy kissing Tom but more than this will be just too weird.</span></div></div>",

He keeps kissing you and moves the tip of his cock to your pussy lips.  Chloe's body has already decided that Tom is going to do this and you feel your legs wrap around his.  Tom pushes in a little and starts to stretch you open.  Shuddering, you smile up at him.  Encouraged, he pushes in slowly, pulling out and pushing back in until he reaches resistance.  \"Ready?\" he growls.  You nod, then feel the pain as he breaks you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to move in and out, going deeper with each thrust until you only feel the delicious pleasure.  Your arms and legs wrapped around him as you push up to meet his thrusts.  After about 5 minutes you start to feel an orgasm building through your whole body.  You can't help but cry out.  Tom grunts and stiffens up and you can feel him pulsing deep inside you.  The Jake part of you is glad that at least he is wearing a condom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lays on you as his large cock softens and finally falls out.  Kissing you he says, \"That was amazing.\"  In spite of the male side wanting to vomit, you have to admit that it was the most pleasure you've ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You whisper and hug him.  He moves you into a spooning position and snuggles up against you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents won't be home tonight. You want to do more? \" He asks as he gently rubs your breasts from behind.

Again I can't go asking people, else they'll think I'm crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far you have been respectful for your feminine body, remembering that it isn't yours, hoping that if you don't abuse it, and get all horny, you will be changed back. However this hasn't happened. You still don't want to play with it, but for a different reason. Seeing you reflection, and your response last night frightened you, and you don't want to be turned mentally into a chick. Being one physically is bad enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, you have school, and like before you can't decide what to wear. You definately don't want to wear something too feminine and attact male eyes, yet you don't want to attact attention because of unattractive clothes. You decide to wear a cami and jeans, since they don't look too bad on you.</span></div></div>",

My arm is almost fixed, and the cast will be off on Saturday.\" With that you and her hug. While you feel pleased for her, this slightly disturbs you since you know this is typically female behavior, and that you aren't acting or playing the part. These responses are spontaneous and you wonder if this body is affecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let\u2019s do some shopping\" you say. Leah's eyes light up again, saying \"Good idea.

It seems Leah wants to look for a new dress for the dance, and she is dragging you along. The shop assistant looks you and notices the two girls walking into her store. \"Can I help you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. My friend and I have a high school dance soon, and we want some dresses.\" Leah says. \"What sort of dance is it?\" the assistant asks. \"Not the prom, we want something pretty, something to attract a date.\". \"I think I've got just the thing for you\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't been paying attention for most of the conversation, but you certainly heard 'attract a date' and you are frightened about the prospect, most properly Tom in your case, then again you feel like trapped, you don't want to continue on this path. You decide half-truths may be best. \"Leah, I don't want to be too attractive. I want to know if someone likes me, not these\" you say, pointing to your breasts. Leah looks at you and smiles. \"Still having those doubts, Chloe? Later you have to tell me about this Tom again\u2026\"<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t answer or comment on this:<br>\r\nSo Leah speaks again: \"Don't worry about Tom, Chloe. Just relax and take it easy. And the first step for this will be to wear something nice\"<br>\r\nLeah is smiling, while your mind is still worried and confused thinking. \"Tom might not be a bad choice, but I know nothing how to behave as a girl\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more time for thinking: The assistant returns with some dresses, and you are stunned.

I can\u2019t imagine having that sort of attention,\u201d Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, I don\u2019t have much trouble with those. Used to. Kinda awkward wearing the ridiculously girly ones though,\u201d Kara sighed, \u201cEspecially, since my new mom seems to love encouraging me to wear them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds horrifying,\u201d Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that horrifying anymore, but it\u2019s really annoying,\u201d Kara said, \u201cHave your feelings started changing in any way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanging? What\u201d Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing. Never mind then,\u201d Kara said, \u201cWe could talk about who we used to be, but it\u2019ll probably just depress you. Want to play a game or something?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You learn when she had her first period, two weeks after the change, when she started to think about guys, rather gradually and reluctantly up until now when she says an nice guy in school is getting her attention. That last part is scary and disturbing, and she note it would have disturbed her months ago.

You take Chloe's pink rug from the floor and put it away, and exchange the girly bedclothes and bedspread for a more neutral white and gray set in the hall closet, leaving the room feeling much more gender-neutral.</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes again, they instinctively gravitate back to the image in the vanity mirror. Before you can deal with anything else, it seems apparent what your first line of business should be: putting some clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, the tall, slim, freckly-faced Irish girl that you've turned into with tangled dirty-blonde hair and dancer's limbs, is there for you to see in almost every intimate detail, like a teenage Venus except for the maroon sports bra and faded-white panties providing her with some modesty. It sinks in now how exposed you are. The sports bra thankfully keeps your breasts in line and not jiggling around with your every panicked motion, but you can feel the back of your underwear creeping into your butt. You pry it out, feeling weird, trying not to pay attention to the flat surface of your crotch just a short distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Chloe was a vision that came to you in a dream, and this was the state of dress you saw her in, you would not object in the slightest. However, as the new steward of her body, you feel embarrassed on her behalf and decide that it's best for the both of you to get covered up and then figure things out from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes now adjusted to the half-darkness, you make your way to Chloe's closet and pull it open. Coming from a closet where you only had, on average, five t-shirts, three long sleeves, and two pairs of jeans with various other garments piled up messily on the ground, you become immediately overwhelmed upon seeing the meticulous, fussy compartmentalization of a whole rainbow of clothing, either on hangers or in bins, of all sorts of shades and colors. <i>That's right,</i> you think grimly. <i>I have to figure out how to dress as a girl... Oh boy ...</i></span></div></div>",

It's a simple combination, and one that you feel safe assembling together without committing some egregious fashion faux pas that people who know her would never suspect Chloe of committing (which, based on the breadth of her wardrobe, seems a safe assumption). You lay the two articles out on Chloe's bed while you remove her panties, eyes closed the whole time, and quickly slip on a pair of pink boy shorts, the closest thing you can find to boxers. Then a few more minutes pass while you switch bras, struggling with a few non-sports bras, figuring out the best way to unhook them and hook them back on around your back, before giving up and saving that for later. Putting on the v-neck and eyeing yourself in the mirror, it doesn't look like the lack of a bra is too obvious, and you can't really see Chloe's nipples (although you can feel them rubbing up against the inside of your shirt). After a painful minute of going back and forth in your mind, you decide that this is the best outfit you could have chosen given your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more comfortable now that you're not prancing around half-nude, you wonder if you should leave Chloe's room and explore the rest of her house, maybe meet her mom, who you assume was the woman who checked in on you when you screamed. Dawn has now changed resolutely to daylight outside of the window. The clock on Chloe's nightstand says 6:55 AM. If it's a school day too (as it was when you went to sleep last night), then you'll be have to get ready for that very soon too...</span></div></div>",

You strip of you jeans and top as fast as you can, unzip the gown, step into it, and zip it back up. Seeing that the gown isn't quite right on your body, you adjust the corset part of it, hoping that it still wouldn't fit properly. Unfortunately your adjustments work. You can't believe that the gown feels surprisingly good on your body, and you hate it, since you wanted an excuss not to continue wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out, looking very pretty, but feeling like some kind of freak. You hear comments like \"she looks pretty in that,\" or \"It suits her\" and you feel worse than ever. \"Mom looks over and says \"It looks great on you, Chloe. I'll buy it for you.\"  She also buys you some gloves to 'complete the look' You' want to scream, but you're glad to get the thing off you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse is to come, as she says that Chloe has a great gown, so she needs to look her best, so she decides there is enough time for a small maveover.</span></div></div>",

Worse, they decided that your face looked a little plain, so they added a little lipstick and make-up. You feel foolish and like a freak, but the boys do think so.

You also hope if you respect this body, you can get out of it quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing the bra feels wierd. It is limiting your breating, but at least that bouncing feeling is gone. \"Easy part done Jake\" you mutter, \"Now for the hard part.\" There is no option but to wear either a dress or skirt, something you hope you won't have to do again. </span></div></div>",

She looks so hot right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you checking me out?\" she turned to you suddenly. You try to stammer a response and she surprises you. Her lips lock against yours and your eyes close. You squeal when her fingers run against your belly. \"Still not used to being a girl, are you Jake?\" She called you Jake. How did she know? \"I asked something to switch you with Hannah! She is kinda sick of guys right now...so she wanted to be one! I don't get it either. Anyone she knew I'm....shall we say female orientated? So she found a boy who had a crush on me to take care of her body! So for the next few weeks, you and I are a couple!\" she explained, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her, stunned. You try to say something, but the words don't come out. \"Next Friday, I'm spending the weekend at my friend Kayla's house at Cosquillas Bay. Come with me!\" she offered. All you could do was nod. \"Oh, Chloe's a cheerleader so we will spend a lot of time together. If anyone asks, you are experimenting with me. I have only recently come out to my parents, but I'm not ready to do that here, yet! Too many homophobes! So do you want to come over to my place and swim in my indoor pool?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, before realising something. \"Hannah....We have to go back, so I can get a swimming costume!\" She whispered into your ear \"You don't need your bikini or anything else. I won't be wear anything either!\" You start breathing quicker, the thought is getting your pulses to quicken and your heart to race. \"So is that a yes?\" she enquired, smirking.</span></div></div>",

She beamed at you, pouring you half a glass. \"It's sweet, not too robust with a pleasant chilly aftertaste! My father loves to drink champagne. Only the top notch vintages for him.

You turned red and didn't answer. \"Watch me!\" she spoke to you in a firm voice. You hastened to obey as she unveil her chest to you. They were large with dark tips. You yearned to touch them, but she shook her head. \"Put the drink on this tray and let me see you, Chloe!\" You were still blushing as you managed to get the wine class on the table tray without spilling any. You shivered but managed to expose your own chest, holding on to her panties to keep from covering your self. She approached you, openly gazing at your melons, before commanding you to turn around. Again you obeyed and she lowered your underwear to the ground. \"Beautiful, like perfect bubbles. I could squeeze and rub them all day long with baby oil!\" she remarked, saucily as she reached for them. You moaned as she squeezed your cheeks with a strong, but gentle grip. A squeal was released from the back of your throat when she briefly applied her nails to Chloe's peach like globes. \"A ticklish pair of oranges! That's what I'm talking about! Turn around, Chloe!\" she commanded, imperiously. You did as you were bid, completely under her thrall as she lowered herself between her legs. \"You need a shave! I like it bare, so I can get deep! Get in and take a sip!\" she declared, her tone imperious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the pool, the champagne glass in your left hand.

You stagger towards her, managing to reach the panties. \"Well remove them, babe!\" she demands. You reach for the panties, the beautiful smell of an aroused woman driving you a little wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expose her, politely placing her underwear on the ground. Unlike you, her lips lack any kind of epidermal protection as bare and smooth as a cue ball. \"I know how beautiful I am down there! Now my focus is on you. Come to me!\" She proclaimed. You hastened to obey as she lifted your legs around her waist as she lowered you both to the lower steps. Your young lips connected, you felt her tongue caress and massage your own. Her hands rubbed and stroked your globes, inspiring reactions that made your body sing as volts ran through your form. You pressed yourself tighter, your intimate region making contact with her belly above her own nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke the kiss with a smile and moved your legs upward. You used your hands to keep from going into the water, stretching your nubile new body. Your hair entered the water as her tongue penetrated you for the first time. Like a bolt from the blue, you suddenly understood why so many women preferred their own gender as romantic companions. It was as if knowing their own body allowed them to calculate the best way to produce endorphin delights in the tender flesh of another. You stiffened, wrapping her legs firmly around the back of her neck as she began to slow down, tickling rather then emerging into your swollen entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not be dissuaded as giggle left your throat into of guttural expressions of lust. You pulled her closer, trying to thrust her organ into your own, but her response was to blow raspberries against your sensitive area, causing you to howl. It got worse as her fingers began examining the sensitivity of your globes. You feel pressure against your bladder and feel fear that you may be in danger of not experiencing that ultimate milestone of your first climax from a woman. Of course, the tactile stimulation is driving you to drink as it quickly becomes an unbearable ordeal. Right as you feel, you can hold the flood gates no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall into the spa. She giggles and helps you back to your feet. \"You didn't hurt those glorious globes when you went pee pee did you?\" she teased. You turned scarlet, shaking your head. \"Well treasure, you need a shave, then a bath! Then we will do something really kinky!\" she revealed. \"What?\" you asked, a little concerned. \"You'll see!\" she remarked, slightly tauntingly. She wrapped you in a towel as she dried herself off, walking into the house as bare as a voyeur's wet dream. \"Like what you see?\" she enquired, saucily. I could only nod as we made our way to the bathroom. \"Shave first!\" she exclaimed, gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little embarrassment, you risked mortification as she opened your legs. She went to cupboard and took out a bag. \"This is my special shaving kit!\" she revealed. Your eyes widened when she took out a feather. \"It's heated, so the hairs sort of dissolve. And it can either tickle or well bring out other feelings!\" she revealed, a wicked glint on her eyes. Her smile was broad and beaming,they shone like white pearls perfectly formed. I fought back trembles as she approaching me with the torture instrument and began. Keeping my legs together proved a huge challenge as the evil device brought tears to my eyes and pain to my throat. I fought buckling as the ordeal continued. \"I love how ticklish you are! I have to learn all your best spots!\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt an eternity the feather stopped as the sound of liquid hit the bathtub. Now you were truly mortified by your actions. Hannah placated this shame by displaying affection, expressed by her caresses and fluid motions of her tongue. You buck, feeling close to exploding over her ruby lips. Hannah started to add her finger tips, leaning to further moans. This gaping hole inside you began to feel filled and completed. You cried out in rapture as she danced with our most intimate region, taking you to the brink. To your dismay, she halted again short of youy release and declared \"The bath is too dirty! I think we should share a shower!\" she suggested as if it wasn't her original design all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted her suggestion as it was both your intentions to explore each other further. You yelled as she squeezed her fingers against your firm peach like cheeks, leaving a mark that quickly faded. \"Love how pinchable you are!\" she stated, entering after you turned the water on. You decided it was time for reciprocation as you grabbed her, pressing yourself against her. It felt so right to be touching such a beautiful woman. Her own tight and firm posterior was just as pleasant to your touch. She lifted you up, pressing you against the wall. \"I'm thirsty!\" she declared. </span></div></div>",
