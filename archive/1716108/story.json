Upon entering, the innkeeper gives you a scornful glance, but you shrug it off and pick her pocket as you pass by.<br>\r\n<i>\"Being a rogue is wonderful.\"</i> you think to yourself as you head upstairs to your room.  You empty your packs of whatever you'd stolen for the day and toss it all into the dresser drawer.  Too exhausted to be bothered with putting on anything else, you just strip off all your clothes and jump into bed.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nThe next morning... you open your eyes and find yourself in a completely different place...  Looking around, you see nothing but a sea of blue silken sheets.<br>\r\n\"What the HELL?\"  you shout to whoever cares to listen.  But there's no one around.  Or at least as far as you know...  You stare blankly at the wall before you put all the pieces together in your mind.  You're exactly where you had been when you went to sleep last night.  The only thing that had changed... was you.  You were now only an inch or so tall!<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened...?\" You ask yourself.  You flinch as you hear someone clear their throat and you turn around to see..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gasp as you see the gigantic blood elf paladin standing there, staring down at you with a silly grin.  He has shining silver hair, and the signature glowing green eyes of a arcane-addicted blood elf.  Looking at him for a moment, you remember who he is... as you've seen him on all the wanted posters around Azeroth.  It's... Gatrie Jenkins!  Wanted for unspeakable acts of treason.<br>\r\nYou gulp in fear... thinking that this could be exactly what he's wanted for... You scoot back a bit, trying to get away from him, when he grabs you in his hand.  As he lifts you into the air, you realize your stupidity for not stealthing yourself and running away.  But it was too late now.  Maybe you could do that later... but for now, you were trapped.<br>\r\nThe titan-sized paladin brings you to his face and smiles even wider and goofier.<br>\r\n\"Hey there...\" He says with a laugh, \"Guess what?\"<br>\r\nWith a deep, reluctant sigh, you look at him and shrug, \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I shrunk you.  And now... you're my slave!\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" you say sarcastically, \"That's <b>exactly</b> what I've always wanted to be!\"<br>\r\nHe laughs at you and begins to toss you up and down in his hand.<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess this is the luckiest day of your life.\" He winks at you as he now throws you back and fourth from one hand to the other.  You begin to feel seriously sick and flail about in the air.  He laughs again at the little show you put on, and you scream for him to stop throwing you.  But this only makes him throw you even faster.  Finally, he throws you down onto the floor and places his bare foot on top of you.<br>\r\n\"Since this is only your first day, and I know that was <i>tiring</i> work... I'll let you rest a minute while I decide what you should do for me first...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sigh as you lay there under his foot.  Your bones ache from hitting the floor, and you're still very dizzy and trying not to throw up.  But, regardless of all that, you strangely feel very safe under his huge sole.  It was soft, and warm... and thankfully, it smelled nice.  Smiling to yourself, you close your eyes and try to rest, but he shouts at you when he figures out your first task.<br>\r\n\"Hey, little slave!  Guess what!  Since you're already down there, you get to rub my feet!  Lucky, right?\"<br>\r\nHe snickers and sits down on the bed, holding his feet over you, wiggling his toes eagerly.<br>\r\n\"And don't act all sad about it... if you do a good job, maybe I'll reward you later.\"<br>\r\nHe smiles as you stand up and place your hands on the sole of his left foot, rubbing at the ball of his foot, then massaging his arch.  You've only just started, but he presses his foot down on you.  He obviously wasn't happy with what you were doing, so you lick his sole in worship, continuing to rub his arch.  But he only grinds his foot into your face.<br>\r\n\"You're terrible.  You're not even worth keeping as a slave.  Maybe a toy would be better... Or a snack...\" He laughs evilly as the wheels begin to turn in his head...</span></div></div>",

This was the first time in your life you ever needed to beg for mercy from anyone, and your life depended on it more than ever this time.  He thought about it for a moment, and his stomach growled loudly.  You gulped, seeing his eyes light up.  Your fate had just been decided.  And you knew it.<br>\r\n\"I would love to, as you are very cute, and I would love to keep you around, but I'm also very hungry, and I would love to <i>not</i> be hungry.\"  He snickers as he picks you up, petting your head with a fingertip.<br>\r\n\"And look!  You're already nice and naked, you must have known this was going to happen.\" He winks at you mockingly as he licks your bare rump, moaning softly.  He must have liked the taste, because he laid you flat on your stomach in his hand, and licked all the way up your back, from your bum to the back of your neck.  He did this again and again, then licked at your feet, tasting you thoroughly.  You blush brightly, whimpering and squirming about in his hand.  He pins you down under his fingertip and flips you onto your back, smiling at you.<br>\r\nYou look up at him, wondering why he was smiling so much.  He looked like he was going to burst out laughing, and you suddenly realized why when you looked down at yourself.  You were sporting a rather large boner, which of course to him, was extremely tiny.  Regardless, he cleared his throat so he wouldn't laugh, and patted your head.<br>\r\n\"You like me, and you're cute.  Maybe I'll give you divine protection later so you wont die in me.  But we'll just have to wait and see~!\" he tells you in a sing song voice.<br>\r\nWithout warning, his mouth opens and he licks up your entire form, moaning again.  He then tosses you into his mouth and snaps it shut behind you.</span></div></div>",
