Thankfully, there was a timer so Danny could shoot him self. It was set to \"uncram\" and he got in front of it. However, there was a few sparks that came from the crammer. Could it be broken?

Danny walks in with Sam and Tucker watching with anticipation. It was dark in the portal so Danny had to feel along the wall to find his way. Suddenly he felt a small bump on the wall and felt it move. As he saw a bright green light only two words went through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to run, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANNY!\" Sam cried. Tucker quickly went to the remote panel and activated the manual override. Sam and Tucker dragged Danny out of the Ghost Portal at their unconscious friend. At least what they thought was him. He was the same size and had the same face.

She cocked her head to the side as she noticed twin buttons on one side of the portal. As curiosity got the better of her Sam did not even attempt to resist the urge to press one of the buttons so she slowly reached forward to place her finger on the green one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds seemed to pass by in slow motion for. Just as Sam pushed the button in Danny noticed that the machine was still plugged in,  He gave out a scream of warning that got both Tucker and Sam's Attention. Tucker turned his head to look at his friend while Sam released the button which only added to the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a second after she released the button, green ecto energy filled the portal, surging through her body. She let out a scream that rang through the house loud enough to shake the window paines. It felt as if her entire body was being turned inside-out then everything went black.<br>\r\nDanny and Tucker rushed to her aid only to be stunned at their friends new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((A little while later))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam. Sam, wake up!\", Danny's voice played in Sam's ears as she was com ming to. The last thing she remembered was that green light engulfing her. She opened her eyes to look into those of a worried Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\", she asked weakly. Tucker was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know\", Danny said not sounding any less worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I know something happend\", she said slowly sitting up and sounding a little worried herself,\" Why did you scream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the portal was still plugged in i try-ed to warn you\", Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You where thrown out of the portal by some sort of green ectoplasmic bolt and you...\", he stopped speaking for a moment trying to think of how to put this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it Danny?\", she asked trying to encourage her friend to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You did not look like yourself Sam\", At seeing the look on her face Danny continued,\" You turned into a ghost of some sort. And then you turned back\", he sounded like he was having a hard time believing what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,m... a ghost?\", she questioned numbly, looking at her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuck and i both saw it... And you kind of turned back and forth while you were out of it\", He said looking at her in the way a doctor observed his patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I look like?\", She asked forcing curiosity to be her strongest emotion lest it all overwhelm her and she pass out again from the mental exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny merely held up a hand mirror. The sight that met Sam nearly made her feint out of shock. It looked like her staring back at her through the mirror, but it also didn't. Her black hair had turned snow white, her already pale skin seemed much more so, her once violet eyes had turned a eery green color, The colors of her clothing also seemed inverted. The black of her jumpsuit turning white and vice versa she also seemed to give of some sort of glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Danny for a moment in silence before speaking one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.......</span></div></div>",

You also find that everyone has their bladders under their nether regions just behind and below their dick and ballsacks for the guys and just behind and below their vaginas for the girls. You also find that their bowels are just behind and below their asses. So bassicly their bowels are underneath their body in the back and their bladders are underneath them in the front you also find that all the guys have a dick and two ballsacks on top of their neck on the front part and that their butts are in top of their neck on the back part and that the dick two ballsacks and the butt are joined together in the back. The same is true for the girls just with a vagina instead of a dick and two ballsacks. You also find that everyone has had their head<br>\r\nCloned. They now have a head where there dick and ballsacks or vagina used to be and a head where their butt used to be they only have one mind and can see hear smell taste and do anything that a head can do in those positions with both heads at the same time and that anything done  must be done with both heads you see that their clothing has changed so that anything that are worn on the bottom half of the  body has two holes for both heads. You also find that all clothes that are worn on the top half of the body has  no head holes and instead covers the dick, two ballsacks and the butt for guys and the vagina and butt for girls and that the part of clothing that covers the top half of your body that covers the dick, two ballsacks and butt for guys and vagina and butt for girls does not leak and everything stays the same except for the fact that it does not leak you then find out that everyone pees out their asshole and poops out their dick if their a guy and pees out their asshole and poops out of their vagina if their a girl. You find out that people still have to move their legs to walk, run, speed walk, jog, sprint or do anything of the like you also find out that when people lift their right leg the right side of their heads, their bladder, their bowels and their nether region lifts up off the ground as much as their right lifts up from where it rest in the air and that when people lift up their left leg the left side of their heads, their bladder, their bowels, and their nether region lifts up off the ground as much as their left leg lifts up from where it rests in the air. You also find out that when people jump up in the air all of heads, bladder, Bowles, and the rest of their nether regions lifts up off the ground as much as both your feet lift up off the ground. You find that if your left leg is higher when you jump that the left side of everything is higher and that if your right leg is higher when you jump that the right side of everything will be higher and that if when you jump neither leg is higher that all of it will be the same height. You also find out that when you make the left side of everything or the right side of everything or all of it come up off the ground that it will only hurt the right side of everything the left side of everything or all of it  as much as it would hurt either leg or both legs to land on whatever the the right side of everything would land on or the left side of everything would land on or what all of it would land on. You also find out that the pain is also dependent on height for example if you jumped on a concrete street from five inches up it would not hurt but if you jumped on a concrete street from a height that would sprain or break either one or both of your legs then you would feel pain. If you would have sprained or broken your right leg then the right side of everything would either be sprained or broken the same goes for if you would have broken or sprained the left leg if both legs. You also find that any pain that would have normally been felt in your right leg will now be felt on the right side of everything and any pain that would have normally been felt in your left leg will now be felt on the right side of everything and any pain that would have been felt in both legs at the same time will now be felt on all of both heads, all of the bladder, all of the bowels, and all of the rest of your nether regions. You also realize that all legs feel nothing. You also realize that both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the rest of the nether regions feel everything that the legs used to feel as well as what they already feel. For example if you run a marathon both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the rest of your nether regions will feel like they have always felt as well as feel like their legs used to feel after running a marathon. The same goes for everything that the persons legs can do. You also realize that if you are swimming or doing anything else that your heads, your bladder, your bowels, and the rest of your nether regions will do whatever your legs are doing. You realize that both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the nether regions can stay on skies, snowboards, skateboards, surfboards, water-skies , jet-skies, paddleboards, boggieboards, kitesurfing boards, windsurfing boards, and anything else that you can  do any kind stand on, and kind of squat on, any kind of sit on, any kind of neel on, any kind of crouch on, and any kind of laying down on. You also find that if part of one leg or part of both legs would be hanging off of something that that part of that side or that part of both sides would hang off as well and that it would do what ever you legs are doing and that you be able to stay on whatever it is you have stuff hanging off of. You also realize that if a person bends their right leg that the right side of everything will bend and that if a person bends their left leg that the left side of everything will bend and that if a person bends both legs that both sides of everything would bend. You also realize that this applies to any leg movement. You also realize that anything that happens to one head happens to the other head exactly the same way and that it feels exactly the same for both heads. For example if one head sneezes the other head will make the exact same sneeze and both heads will do and feel exactly the same things before the sneeze during the sneeze and after the sneeze. This applies to everything that the heads do. You realize that everyone has huge butts. You also realize that everyone has long hair on both of their heads and that their heads are separated from their bodies and that people have no neck in the back of either head as any part of a persons  neck that is in the back is now connected to the bladder for the front heads and the bowels for the back head and you also realize that the skin on the back of a persons neck on both heads has skit in half and gone to either side of their now conjoined back of their necks and covered it one both sides and the bottom. You also realize that people\u2019s hair cover their scalp on both heads and that it then splits in half and goes down either side behind their ears on both heads and that one it gets below their conjoined back of their neck on both heads that it becomes long enough that if your head was still on top of your body that it would reach to the dead center if your butt and you also realize that hair grows from the skin on the bottom of their conjoined back of their neck on both heads and that it is the same as the hair on their scalp and you also realize that it becomes as long as the rest of your hair and you also realize that you cannot cut hair any shorter than this. You also realize that every part of both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the rest of the nether regions both inside and out feels everything that your legs would feel after doing anything and that every part of both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the nether regions would move in whatever way the legs would move and that if the left leg would have felt something and or moved that this would only effect the left side and that if the right leg would have felt something and or moved that this would only effect the right side and that if the right would have felt something and or moved and the left would have leg felt something and or moved but each leg would havefelt something different and or moved in a different way that each side would feel whatever that sides leg would have felt and moved in whatever way that sides would move you also realize that both heads, the bladder, the bowels, and the rest of the nether regions are as flexible as the legs. You realize that the right side of everything is only as flexible and as mobile as the right leg and that the left side of everything is only as flexible and as mobile as the right leg. You also realize that you and sam\u2019s bodies change and you realize that both your ghost form and your human form changes and that all the ghosts change to become like everyone else and your minds as well as the minds of everyone on earth and the minds of all the ghosts Change to believe that all this just happened to the entire world and all of the phantom zone a couple of seconds ago.</span></div></div>",
