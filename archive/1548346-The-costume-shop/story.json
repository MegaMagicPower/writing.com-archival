When you put the suit's head on, you feel a strange warmth on your skin all over your body. This becomes a constant pricking, before ceasing altogether. You stroke the fur on your suit's arm, but as you do, you actually <i>feel</i> it. You attempt to remove the suit, but all it does is cause you pain. \"I think that dude sold me a Fusion Fursuit!

But as you scanned through the aisle, you found the Renamon costume you were looking for. However, you realized that there were two versions of this costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a regular version of the costume that looked highly attractive. But when you looked at the second version of the Renamon costume, you can clearly see the difference; the second version of the Renamon costume was a fat version of the famed Digimon. You weren't sure why, but you became curious about the fat Renamon costume, as you pulled the bloated Renamon costume from the rack to get a better look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hoisting the clothesline hook on a display rail, you got a better look at the fat Renamon costume. Judging from the shape of the costume's body design and how loose the costume was, the Fat Renamon costume was designed to allow it's wearer to use either a one-piece fatsuit or separate pieces of padding to make the wearer appear fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unexpectedly, you heard a voice nearby as it said, \"Ah, the Fat Renamon costume. Are you one of those 'Fat Admirers' I have heard so much about?\" You quickly turned around to face whoever it was, only to see that the person speaking to you wasn't the elderly man back at the Checkout Aisle, but rather a young woman around your age. She had dark red hair and a pair Emerald green eyes, and an attractive body to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you remembered what the girl said to you, as you replied, \"Actually, I was curious. Why does this store even have this kind of costume anyway?\" \"To tell you the truth, hun; This store actually sells costumes that turn people into a character of their desires if they wear them.\" She answered, hoping you wouldn't laugh and think that she and the elderly man were crazy. But when you saw the expression on the young girl's face, you realized that she was dead serious, as you said, \"Wait, you're serious about these costumes, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female redhead responded with a single nod, as the expression on her face went from serious to slight melancholy and replied, \"That's right. As for why there is a Fat Renamon costume in my family's costume shop, well, let's just say that there are some people in this town that are aroused by women with a some of cellulite on them, whether these fine ladies are human or not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard what the female redhead said to you, you looked at the Fat Renamon costume and then the regular Renamon costume in comparison. But, for some odd reason, you felt like you were compelled to wear the Fat Renamon costume, as if the plus-sized costume was begging for you to wear it. What are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

You see the image of an overweight fox being a fun and lovable dork, playing games, having drinks and jiggling its blubber butt to electro music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You find a changing room as the redhead watches from afar. She sees you head inside with a shrug before getting back to work. You were undressing until you only had socks and boxers on as mentioned on the walls of the changing room. You held up the costume and examined it, also putting it in front of yourself in front of the mirror. You chuckle before actually putting the furry fat suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For its size, it was rather snug. The legs hugged your rather nicely to be honest. You tugged the suit up to cover your bottom half before slipping the sleeved sleeves of the suit over your arms. The zipper was a bit tricky to reach, but after some stretching you grabbed it and zipped it up. You looked to see if it was fully zipped, not seeing a zipper at all. You thought it was correct before slipping the head on. Once that was placed correctly, you feel about a couple hundred pounds of fat weigh you down. You didn't know it was from the suit since you blew off what the redhead said. You smiles as you look yourself over, seeing realistic blubber on your yellow body. You start to leave until the same girl stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"So, you want to be a fat renamon for the rest of your life?\" Her arms were crossed with a teasing smile. \"This is just a costume. A realistic one, but still a costume.\" You huff and grab your pants, fishing for your wallet to pay for the costume. She raises an eyebrow. \"Explain your higher voice, moving mouth, swaying tail and the blush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your eyes widen as you look behind you and to your muzzle. You didn't even notice your voice change, like it was that voice to begin with. \"Uh... Just take the money.\" \"You keep it. You need it to by new clothes anyway.\" She patted your belly before walking off. You were seemingly anitomically correct, but some fur and fat covered most parts. Clothes wouldn't hurt and yours won't fit the grown rear of yours.</span></div></div>",

You sigh, the tone throwing you off as much as the residual jiggling your yellow figure does whilst you gather your thoughts. As could be imagined, you're finding your portly figure to be a bit more of a hindrance than a help. Plus, your now three digit hands aren't too pleasing to rub together, even with almost pillowy consistency to each finger that slides together. You let your similar three toed feet slowly clack onto the ground as you waddle along, eventually pausing to fetch your wallet. Uh, your wallet that's within your pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrud, seems all you're pawing at is supple underbelly, as mildly appealing as that sounds. Your breaths turn into huffs, as you struggle to formulate a plan to get your money back, or at least into a setting where having clothes isn't a terrible idea. That is, until you realize you've got fur, right. The stuff seems to coat your figure decently enough, an especially big tuft on your chest, and being rather pleasant to the touch. Of course, that doesn't remedy your other issues, namely the fact that your wallet, and come to think of it phone has up and disappea-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*brrmpt, brrrmpt*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems your stomach is vibrating...

It had a short stubby tail, and a rather hungry looking face. You smile and unzip the back and quietly set you foot in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe toes were digitigrade and looked rather odd on your feet. Next thing was to get the arms through. You bend over and pick them up and you slip your arm through. You pull the costume's head over you and you make sure it snugly fit's through. You zip it up and walk over to the mirror and glance at an very loose costume. You smile then stop as a feeling suddenly sweeps through your body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour kin feels like it's dissolving.This feeling permeates through out your body. You feel it swell up and become fuller wit the costume. The feeling of your feet filling up the costume's and your muscle and bone growing to suit it. The same thing happens all over your body. Your chest grows smaller as it swells to fit the costume. Your neck does the same thing, choking you for air. You feel like your asphyxiating, you scramble around and try to desperately get air, only to black out near the door. As you black out, you shrink.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou wake up much later. You moan in discomfort, only to have it turn into a slight yelp near the end as you notice an Agumon claw. \"What the?\" you mutter, looking down at your self. You walk over to the mirror and gasp.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe first change is your face, now a rounded looking protrusion. You open your mouth to a cuved tounge and a row of rather pointed and spred out human teeth (you assume that your still an omnivore). The next thing you notice is your actual body, still rather human in nature but your chest is smaller and the same color as the costume, starkly contrast to your yellow/orange skin. You continue down further, glancing at your (conveniently) covered groin area.You take a quick peek down. Unsurprisingly, your genitals have become more suited to your body. In the rear, you notice that your underwear has a hole in it, which you assume is for your tail.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou test your tails dexterity and strength by moving a variety of positions and moving objects around the room. You also note that our new feet give you a variety of freedoms. You smile as your body becomes more familiar to you, a sudden thought crashes your fun.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Now what?' you think.

They have his jacket, shirt, pants, shoes, and a tight latex mask with real hair and a red hat. You think it is the coolest costume ever. It kinda glows, but you pay no attention. You buy it and run to your house to try it on. You bolt up the stairs past your mom nagging about where you've been for the past three hours and shut the door to the bathroom and lock it. You look down at the costume and it still looks nice. You quickly undress yourself and slip on the black shirt. It seems wet, though. It also smells a bit off, like it has been used before, but the store wasn't that nice, so it was probably returned before. You slip on the white and blue jacket which is surprisingly warm. The jeans felt normal, tho. You slip on the shoes, which feel wet like the shirt, but they smell sweaty. Like they had just been run in. They feel nice and broken in though. The mask is the final part of the costume, and when you look at it, you are excited. You try to put on the mask, but it is a very tight mask. It's wet like the shirt and shoes, but it's not smelly like that. You continue to pull and to pull until the latex mask shoves down onto your head. You center the mask to see out the eye holes and the mouth hole. Suddenly, you feel different. The mask begins to rumble and make sounds. It's wet inside, so it glides across your face and it eventually begins to contort. The mask suddenly begins to melt a bit, sending a stream of skin colored latex down your body. It floats down your stomach and legs, arms and all. It pours into your mouth, and it tastes salty, like spit. Soon, your whole body is covered in latex skin. You close your eyes. You feel your body changing. It's melding with the costume. You open your eyes, and Ash stares back at you. </span></div></div>",

Even empty and fleshless, with no eyes visible through its half-closed eyelids, \"Misty\" looks utterly sweet and adorable, and seems to have enough of a chest to be well into her teens, no longer an unripe little girl but someone you'd have no qualms about having sex with.  It's hard to tell exactly with her boneless face, but she looks about sixteen years old, or maybe an unusually girlish nineteen or twenty at the very most.  She appeals to you as a hot young woman would, not as a little girl.  Sexual desire for her seems entirely suitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself wondering whether you could get a date for that costume party and have her wear this costume while you get an Ash costume.  Then you admit to yourself that you'd rather wear this Misty costume.  You don't have any transvestite tendencies... or maybe you do, deep down, that you won't admit to yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat settles it is a little label hanging from the oddly-shaped hanger (a normal clothes hanger would leave thr empty Misty head dangling behind the costume's back, but this one keeps it facing upright):  \"One size fits all -- GUARANTEED!\"  In smaller print it continues: \"Wearing this costume will make you look and sound exactly like MISTY (tm) brought to life, or double your money back -- no exceptions!\"  The \"(tm)\" is the trademark symbol, and the \"MISTY\" is printed on a little label in a slightly different typeface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this seems almost to compel you to put on the costume, if only to prove that it can't possibly work as claimed.  Greed doesn't hurt: double your money back?  Surely a costume this detailed -- it's like the skin of a young woman to the tiniest detail! -- must be expensive, You could max out your credit card on it, then get twice the money back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Misty costume over your left arm, you go to</span></div></div>",

You go over to the mirror and gasp. Now your growing a beak with spread out teeth. You assume it's no problem, It's just teeth. Now your body is changing, and a few minutes later.. It's fulliy changed. Red and white is all over you, and you have claws on your hands. Then, you look at your rear, and you don't see your buttocks anymore, But tons of red skin. You start testing yourself, and you kinda like it, But are still worried. Soon you decide to fly off. \"Where will I go?\" You think<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You slowly float outside where you see Jaden cooking something. \u201cMEW?\u201d \u201cGood Morning, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2026 You\u2026 Cooking?\u201d \u201cPancakes.\u201d \u201cPancakes?\u201d \u201cYeah, they are going to be good trust me.\u201d \u201cI\u2026 Trust\u2026\u201d \u201cCome here.\u201d You do and fly over to him as he kisses your forehead. You blush a Scarlet hue again. \u201cHa, got you embarrassed again.\u201d You simply nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon has them done and waiting where he releases his Eevee as well. \u201cDig in Gals.\u201d You all start eating when you sense something powerful nearby it is a psychic type, close to your form. \u201cWhat is this Creature?\u201d Suddenly an Energy Ball flies out of nowhere at Jaden. You form a bubble around you Jaden and Eevee. \u201cMew what the hell.\u201d \u201cMEW mew mew mew!\u201d There in the clearing is a Creature looking similar to you except taller, purple, and had a look of disgust on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there MEW. Battle Me!\u201d \u201cMEW?\u201d \u201cYes, you.\u201d \u201cMew, Mew?\u201d \u201cBecause I am a Clone of you. I AM MEWTWO.\u201d \u201cMEW?\u201d \u201cI am determined to see who is stronger!\u201d \u201cMEW!\u201d \u201cYes, I attacked the Human.\u201d \u201cMEW!\u201d \u201cTake this!\u201d As he charges a large purple ball and hurls it at you. You are sent flying upward. \u201cWeaker than expected.\u201d You simply Charge on of your own. Then let it fly at Mewtwo. Him not seeing it is sent tumbling. \u201cYou have more fight than I thought.\u201d \u201cMEW!\u201d \u201cThen let us commence!\u201d You both are going full out when you let out a huge beam! It makes a direct impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is sent flying through trees. \u201cUgh, That Hyper Beam.\u201d He then falls down unconscious. You fly over to him and focus as you give him energy. He starts to move slightly getting up. You hold a Shadow ball in your hand. \u201cYou win. But why did you not destroy me?\u201d \u201cMew mew mew MEW!\u201d \u201cYou care greatly about everyone and anything.\u201d You nod. \u201cBut, what about me I am not like you I am a clone.\u201d \u201cMew, mew mew mew.\u201d \u201cYou still care about me as I have as much rights on this planet as any other.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I really hope you like that costume.\" He says rather sincerely. \"Tell you what. Since everyone likes that costume so much. I'll give it to you free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free?!\" You ask excitedly, looking at the rather real looking anthro Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" He says, and tacks on a rather friendly \"scram kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry out of the costume shop toward your car and scramble home. Traveling at the speed limit in an effort to go home and try on the costume. You slam on the brakes and quickly put the car in park. You get out and rush inside and to your room. You finally get to have some peace and quiet to try on this costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove all of your clothes and fold them neatly on the bed in front of you. Next you take the Lugia costume out of the box and look at it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume was in the traditional Lugia colors, white with a blue underbelly. It had a nice long tail, and a rather intelligent looking face. You smile and unzip the back and quietly set you foot in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes were digitigrade and looked rather odd on your feet. Next thing was to get the arms through. You bend over and pick them up and you slip your arm through. You pull the costume's head over you and you make sure it snugly fit's through. You zip it up and walk over to the mirror and glance at an very loose costume. You smile then stop as a feeling suddenly sweeps through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour kin feels like it's dissolving.This feeling permeates through out your body. You feel it swell up and become fuller wit the costume. The feeling of your feet filling up the costume's and your muscle and bone growing to suit it. The same thing happens all over your body. Your chest grows larger as it swells to fit the costume. Your neck does the same thing, choking you for air. You feel like your asphyxiating, you scramble around and try to desperately get air, only to black out near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up much later. You moan in discomfort, only to have it  turn into a slight yelp near the end as you notice a Lugia wing. \"What the?\" you mutter, looking down at your self. You walk over to the mirror and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first change is your face, now a pointed and beakish looking protrusion. You open your mouth to a pointed tongue and a row of rather spread out human teeth (you assume that your still an omnivore). The next thing you notice is your actual body, still rather human in nature but your chest is fuller and a deep navy, starkly contrast to your white skin. You continue down further, glancing at your (conveniently) covered groin area.You take a quick peek down. Unsurprisingly, your genitals have become more suited to your body. In the rear, you notice that your underwear has  a hole in it, which you assume is for your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou test your tails dexterity and strength by moving a variety of positions and moving objects around the room. You also note that our new feet give you a variety of freedoms. You smile as your body becomes more familiar to you, a sudden thought crashes your fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now what?' you think. 'How should I live my life?'</span></div></div>",

After grabbing it and putting it up to you, you see that it looks like it fits.  After removing the costume from the hangar, you go up to the elderly man behind the register.  Upon looking at your costume, he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be five dollars,\" the man stated in a surprisingly deep voice.  After rummaging around your pockets, you grab the five dollars and give it to the man behind the register.  He looks at you from his tired-looking eyes as you leave, saying a cheerful \"Have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you arrive home, you cannot wait to try on the outfit.  It was made of surprisingly tough-feeling materials that seemed to be made by the hands of an expert tailor.  Looking into the suit reveals that there are four arm holes for the sake of knowing which parts to slip your arms into.  Upon closer inspection, there is a tag attached to the dark purple lining.  The faded yellow slip of paper has neat handwriting that, upon closer inspection, details the instructions for wearing.  You read the slip of paper, paying close attention to the instructions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Remove clothes and go outside.<br>\r\n2.  Put on the body, followed by the head.<br>\r\n3.  Do not panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind begins to race upon reading the last part.  Does the suit fit weird?  Does it take effort to remove?  Whatever, you think as you remove your clothes put on the six-limbed outfit.  You place your feet into the bottom-most limbs of the suit, noting the surprising comfort that the suit provides.  After pulling up the legs to a comfortable position, you zip up the front of the outfit after putting your arms into the arms closest to the head.  After fully zipping up the torso of the suit, you awkwardly walk into your back yard, making sure there's plenty of space.  After making sure there's plenty of space, you slip on the well-made fabric head, completing the getup.  Upon looking into a nearby mirror, you see that your outfit fits you more perfectly than you imagined judging by the little eye holes that adorned the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you notice a weird sensation in your feet and hands.  The outfit seems to stretch along with your body as it conforms to the inhuman shape that was forming in front of you.  After a while, a third pair of legs grow out of your side as you fall on your newly-formed six legs, unable to stand up.  Finally, your- and the outfit's- neck lengthened out and bulked up with the rest of your body, finally ending in the head conforming to the headpiece.  Upon further examination, the finely-made tailoring of the suit was replaced with skin matching the coloration of the rest of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, feeling the breeze on your skin, looking around.  Upon looking into a nearby reflective surface, you can notice that your sclera are pure black, contrasting your red irises.  Inside this surface, you notice a purple glow from behind you.  Inside that glow is a portal.  Upon looking at your wings, you notice that you can fly.  You think long and hard about whether or not to enter the portal or to fly off elsewhere.

In the changing room is a full-length mirror and a seat. You look at the clothes in front of you. A pair of long, red, leather boots that would come above your knee. A white satin one-piece. A blue skirt and a long blonde wig. You are so excited you don't know where to start. You take off your clothes and look at the costume before you. You then realize that it will be a very tight fit. You lift up the wig and out falls the lunar wand. You hold it in your hand and you start to glow. In the mirror you see yourself undergoing the Sailor Moon transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot believe the rush you are feeling as the costume magically fits to your body. After the transformation you examine yourself in the mirror. The costume makes you look a lot more petite. Your stomach is flatter and your chest is shaped to look like breasts from the one piece. A thought flashes through your head. What if the costume didn't fit to your body, but your body fit to the costume. You feel a surge of panic at the thought of your lost manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift up your skirt to check.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The novelty of them even having a costume like this in the store was more then enough as a talking point. Ranma 1/2 was hardly among the popular anime in the mainstream after all. \"At the very least Jake will probably get a kick out of it.\" you muse to yourself as you head to the register, Shampoo is is favorite of the girls... many other costumes seem to call out to you but you manage to make it all the way there without grabbing another. It was surprisingly affordable as well, similar cosplay online likely would cost triple the price. You'd definitely have to keep this place in mind come con season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at the register gives you a knowing look as bags the costume up, though you not sure what to make of it. The walk to Jake's was a bit awkward as you think back to the original reason why you went to the store. A costume for the party. Though technically it WAS a costume... You could really troll him by dressing as his favorite girl. Hell it probably wouldn't be the dumbest thing you've done for a laugh. You glance into the bag catching a glimpse of the purple wig inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that even fit me though?\" you muse lightly before falling into silence... The thought continues to repeat in your mind even as Jake's house comes into view</span></div></div>",

Clearly you wouldn't be able to think properly think until you tried it on. You knock on the door and wait impatiently for a few moments, glancing to the contents of the bag. After a subjective eternity, the door unlocks and Jake offers you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, whats up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, can't I use your bathroom real quick?\" you found yourself asking before you even realize it. He looks confused but motions for you to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure man, you know where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say hurriedly as you fast walk into the living room and make a beeline for the downstairs bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, A surprise! I'll show you in a sec!\" you call over your shoulder as you rush into the bathroom and close the door behind you, locking it. Your heart is beating rapidly as you stumble forward and place the bag on top of the toilet before looking at yourself in the mirror. \"What is up with me today?\" you whisper before your eyes are slowly drawn back to the bag. You can't take it anymore. You reach in and lift the costume from the bag staring at it longingly. Your eyes lock onto a tag on the hanger. 'One Size Fits All. Guaranteed' That was enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Shirt and pants were thrown aside as you pick up the loose pants of the costume. There were a pale pink with elastic around the ankles and a draw string up to. Even if they were made for a woman they probably would still fit just fine. Hold the pants down and step into it feeling a tingle rush from your toes up as you pull up the pants up to your waist. You end up leaning back against the sink as the tingling continues along your entire lower half. Just before you lost grip on the pants it starts to fade and your able to collect yourself. That was oddly intense for a pair of pants... You started to wonder if something was seriously wrong with you. Shaking you head you angle  feet to push them out the ankles. A smooth and manicured foot poked out the bottom of the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You shakily try your other foot and get the same results. You get a sinking feeling as you look into the waist line seeing a pair of panties in place of your boxers. You let go in shock and the pants drop revealing a pair of shapely smooth legs and woman would be proud of. You place a hand on the wide hips and rounded ass in awe. Your entire lower half was female, if the lack of bulge in your new panties had anything to say about it... but somehow you felt stronger. Even though your legs were ever so slightly short from your masculine and pudgy upper body, they felt sturdy and had a strong layer of lean muscle without sacrificing appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you couldn't say it out loud... you kinda liked it. You pulled the pants back up and tied the waist tightly before looking to the top of costume with tempered excitement. Your mind screamed at you to stop but your legs felt so good, you'd never been so in shape in your life. Just a little ore couldn't hurt. Without a moment of hesitation you grab the top and quickly pull it over you head. Even as you moving your arms into the sleeves and pulling it down the intense feeling begin to surge forth inside you. By the time your head is through the neck hole you have to brace yourself on the sink. You can feel your body shifting this time. Your excess body fat melting off of your stomach along with you chest hair. Your belly flattens and hardens. Your arms slim and tone, you are able to watch in real time as your fingers thin and become more dainty. it just feels so good. You have to bit your lip to keep from making noise. The tingling began to fade from your arms but grew even more intense on your chest. with every shuddered breath you could feel your breasts growing. Larger and larger. By the time the tingling faded you could feel the new weight and had to adjust your balance as you straighten up. You look down and start laughing to yourself, taking a handful of your newly grown breast and feeling it the motion. they were real... despite not having a bra they were quite perky despite their size. As your legs did before your arms and grip seem stronger. You feel like you could do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing left. You make face and shaggy hair sat atop this prime female form, somehow you knew the wig would change that... it only stood to reason. you pick wig and realize just how long it is, it would likely go nearly past your rear. You run your hand through the hair and can't help but enjoy the silkiness of it... You feel that longing in you to put it on right away, fighting with the little voice telling you that something is wrong... You already made your decision. You look dead in the mirror as you flip the wig back and pull it onto your get. You want to watch the change... you don't count on the intense feelings being amplified on just your head. You wobble and the world goes black, the last thing you see is the tile floor rising to meet you before purple falls over your face...</span></div></div>",

In impatience, you decide to put on the headband while walking. You turned early, missing the dressing rooms, and ended up in the restrooms. You stop and look back at the door you just walked through, knowing you couldn't have been so hyped that you forgot to look around. You walked back through the door and walked back down the hall, looking for the dressing rooms again, but ended up in the bathrooms again! You groaned and wondered why you were so lost, until you realized that the headband must be causing this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You attempted to remove it, but it tightened, and your hair turned darker. You gasped and looked down at the costume you were carrying, which, to your surprise, was your own clothes, and you were wearing the costume already. Your teeth chattered and you backed up into the showers by accident, and tried to catch yourself, but instead turned on the cold water. You shook your head to dry it, your pig head, that is. You squealed in shock and struggled to jump and reach the water controls, turning it to hot eventually. You pulled yourself out of the shower and lay face down on the floor, exhausted. You used a wall to help yourself up, and put your clothes back on, which of course turned into the costume again.</span></div></div>",

She's cute, but sort of a lame character.  You could see yourself getting your girlfriend to wear an Anzu costume -- if you had a girlfriend -- but you don't particularly want to be in drag as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume isn't just a set of cosplayer-style clothes imitating the usual school clothes that Anzu wears.  It seems to be a head-to-toe human skin with nothing inside, on a padded clothes hanger, the clothes hung over it.  The girl's hollow, empty head, its long hair trailing, is attached to the costume's neck and hangs behind the rest of the costume.  Clearly this Anzu costume is meant to cover its wearer head to toe!  You take a close look at the \"skin,\" particularly its face.  It looks like the skin of a live girl, with the glow of life and health a real live girl's skin would have.  This suit is not meant to make its wearer look like a character from an animated cartoon, but like a real girl who, if she can act, would be perfectly cast as Anzu in a live-action Yu-Gi-Oh series or movie.  Its material feels a lot like skin, only room-temperature and remarkably elastic.  It would certainly stretch to fit you, but with your body inside it, how could it possibly look right?  You're entirely the wrong build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvenient little dressing rooms are scattered through the shop.  There's one only a few paces away.  You feel an odd pull, not quite a compulsion though almost, to take the Anzu suit and its clothes to the nearest one and put them on.  Then again, you'd like to know more about this costume, and you really should ask permission before trying it on...</span></div></div>",

You'd cause a sensation and have a blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome instinct tells you to put down this rather uncanny girl-costume and run out of the shop.

There are plenty of hooks and hangars for your clothes.  You strip down methodically, hanging up your clothes and putting your shoes in a convenient cubbyhole.  Then you start removing from their hanger the clothes that come with the T\u00e9a/Anzu costume, hanging them up separately.  The shoes, stockings, and underclothes are in a bag attached to the hanger.

There just isn't any girl-body inside it, and it has something rather like a zipper only less toothy running from crotch to chin.

Then the changes hit as you watch your image in the mirror.  Putting your bigger, thicker male body inside this smaller, slenderer girl-skin distorted it, but now it swiftly undoes the distortion, taking its proper shape again and making your body shrink perfectly to fit it.  The process is almost painless.  In maybe three minutes, a beautiful slender girl looks back at you from the mirror.  The Anzu of the cartoon show is the most brilliant possible caricature of the girl in the mirror: if she were based on a real, live girl, that girl would be exactly like you.  You feel naked: the skin of the girl suit is now your own true skin.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of struggling, you managed to fully zip it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked at yourself in the mirror and saw that the costume looked incredibly realistic even with the waist length dark blue hair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pull off the heavy Jiraiya cosplay outfit off the rack and look it over. <br>\r\nThere's a mesh pants and top, green gi, a red vest jacket, a headband with a larger-than-normal metal plate, and rather large wooden geta sandals. You know Jiraiya is about the perviest character in the Naruto universe, and you know you're about th perviest person you know, so you might as well see how you look as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug off your clothes and start on the outfit. You have a little difficulty putting them on as they're quite large. You finally slide on the red vest jacket, and tie the headband up on your forehead. You step into the geta sandals, and try to balance as well as you can on the precarious things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling over to the mirror, you try to admire yourself. You do look kinda like Jiraiya. If he were younger, short, skinny, and had shorter hair. Very unimpressing.<br>\r\nThat's when the change starts.<br>\r\nYou almost stumble off the sandals as your feet swell to fit. Suddenly they're fitting quite well and not likely to drop you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down in shock as your shins and thighs are stretching before your eyes. You feel warm muscle squirm up your calves, thighs, and pelvis, before moving to your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as your chest and shoulders widen, taking the costume from its previous bagginess and pulling to a much more comfortable fit. Warmth fills your back and front as your chest, stomach and back slowly firm, and harden with a man's physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth spreads down your biceps and forearms as they swell with muscle and age. Your hands shift and thicken as you watch intrigued. This should scare the living hell out of you, but you feel at ease, and oddly enough, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in interest as your hair turns white and starts growing over the top of the headband. It falls in two curtains to frame both sides of your face. You can feel it still growing as white hair cascades down your back before it stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike bloody tears, a red line appears at the far lower corners of each of your eyes and crawl down your face until they disappear under your jaw. Slowly but surely, your jaw and cheekbones shift and broaden as your skin ages to match. Your young tight skin changes complexion to a clear, weathered tan with healthy laugh lines and a little pouchiness to it. Your eyes darken to an almost black brown. The same eyes change shape and narrow with discernment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there rather shocked, but though the transformation has finished, you don't move. <br>\r\nThis isn't a dream is it? You think.<br>\r\nYou lift one large arm and look at the big, calloused hand. You touch your face gingerly and feel the new texture. As you rub your square jaw, you grab a section of your cheek and pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp in a deep voice thats not your own, and rub the sore spot delicately. You run your hands through the shaggy white mop of hair, across your broad chest, your hard stomach, and other places. Huh.... So I'm Jiraiya, now? You wonder... <br>\r\nWell, everyone did say I'm the perviest person they know. Now it fits! What should I do now?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take down the recognizable chuunin outfit from the rack. It consists of the usual outfit: dark blue longsleeve shirt, green chuunin vest, navyblue ninja pants, open-toed/open-heeled slippers, and a metal-plated headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to know which character it belongs to, considering quite a few of the characters wear the same thing. The small clues are two bangles, there's tape below the shoulders of both longsleeves, and a light blue loincloth with a red japanese symbol over a darkblue circle. You shrug, and undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels odd slipping the clothing on. Its as if it's just a few sizes too big, but not uncomfortable. You can't see your toes out of the slippers, and even though the sleeves of the longsleeve are rolled up, they fall past your wrist. You put the forehead protector on and tie up the loincloth around your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, how'd I know to tie it around my waist? You think, confused. You look in the mirror and size yourself up. The whole thing would look okay if you were about 10-15 years older or so. You're just too young to make it work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge tremor runs through your body. You convulse wildly and almost collapse. You grab onto the mirror and wall for support. You try and get a good grip, but your hand, slippery with sweat keeps sliding up, as though pushed from below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you're getting taller. Looking down, you can see your feet expanding and lengthening to fit the slippers. The very skin texture and color, harden and tan before your eyes. As new looking toes stick out of the tops, your shins and thighs crack a few more inches before stopping. You suddenly feel your muscles burning and expanding, your legs filling the pants until they're fitting perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you actually collapse. You crash into the wall whimpering as your spine pushes up a few inches. You crawl forward unevenly as your short arms are offbalance with your new longer legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your chest seems to be inflate. You gasp in pain as you grasp them. The ribcage itself feels as though its being pushed apart. It stops suddenly. Then you feel heat flood your stomach, chest, and back. The heat burns in an almost comforting way, as you feel large curves start to form over your front. You run your hands over your broad-feeling chest, and moan in surprise at how firm and large your pecs feel. You rub lower, and feel a hard cobblestone surface of sixpack abs. You realize slowly that you're changing into whoever this cosplay is of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard burn moves into your shoulders, which become wide and broad, taking up a good portion of the vest and shirt. With a sick crunch, your arms stretch out to an adults length. Muscle begins lacing its way through your shouders, and starts to move down your biceps. Your now-visible lower forearms and hands change to that weathered tan color. Your forearms suddenly vein-up and show a harder definition. Your hands crack and pop as the palms widen, and the fingers grow longer and thicker, your long unkept nails shortening and widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl awkwardly in this new body to the mirror, knowing there's only one more place that can change. You're on your knees before it, warm, thick palms placed against its cool surface as you await the inevitable. You choke loudly as your neck stretches and thickens. You watch as your adam's apple swells, and you let out a pained grunt that is much deeper than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skull suddenly crunches loudly. You can hear it both in your ears, and in your head itself. You cluch it as pain momentarily blurs your vision. For a second you marvel at how much bigger your hands feel on your head. The pain fades to a tingling burn and your vision returns. Your hair turns black and pulls itself backwards. The same black hair begins to grow into sideburns along the sides of your face. They thicken and start to itchily grow down to the crook of your jaw. From they're more hair begins to grow down your jawline and on your chin. It thickens into a solid beard, with a goatee point at your chin. Your face starts to reshape between your hands. Your eyes change to brown and narrow slightly. Your skin tans and ages to a weathered age 30 type. Your jawline widens and squares slightly. Your nose widens a bit at the bridge and tip, before broadening out. Just like that, the burning pain stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to cool off, you're frozen at the sight of your new self. You tentatively touch your skin. Its warm and rather sweaty, but its skin and the feeling thats coming through indicates its really yours. You poke and prod your soft, yet firm face. You stroke your new beard thoughtfully. You tug it lighly and wince at the pain. The foreign face in the mirror pulls the same look. You stand up unsteadily, trying to get used to the height difference. The whole outfit seems as though it were tailored for you now. Though you should be shocked, you don't really feel scared. Rather, at the back of your confused thoughts, you wonder where you can get a cigarette around here...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reasoned that it would probably be best to change into the costume here and walk home with it on, that way no one would see you carrying it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door, you quickly stripped down to your underwear. The suit came with a set of instruction in the bag it was in telling you to remove all clothing and step in through the mouth of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, weird...\" You said, expecting there would be a zipper at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrug and follow the instructions, stepping in one foot at time into the deflated Tsunade skin. You're rather tall and lanky compared to Tsunade's height of 5'3, but the suit stretches really well and you can fit both legs inside after a little wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fits like a glove, you pull the costume all the way up to your neck. Fitting your hands into the arms proves to be somewhat difficult as the suit keeps sticking to your skin but eventually you have the entire thing on from the neck down. It's tight but at the same time cozy and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the flaps of the now over-stretched mouth of the mask, you pull the suit's face over your own. It takes a few seconds to align it in the mirror, but once you finish you look like a near splitting of Tsuande from the anime. Except of course for the body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not bad.\" You say, admiring how the mask actually moves when you talk. \"I can't even tell it's a costume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check out the clothing in the bag. It has all of the Tsunade apparel, but there's a slight problem. It seems to be made for someone her own size, which is of course far too small for your over 6 foot frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

But you couldn't help it: you always had a secret crush for her, but you never told anyone; you would've been as wierd. You took the costume off and went to a nearby changing cabin. The costume consisted of her usual gray baggy sweater with the fur on the hood and sleeves, navy blue pants, the usual sandals and her forehead protector. You began taking off your clothes and you put on the costume. Even if it was very baggy for her, it was a bit tight for you, especially considering the fact you're much taller than her and much more muscular. But past that, you were finally able to get in. Finally, as a last touch, you put the headband around your neck, 'just like Hinata wears it', you think dreamily. However, your dreams are cut short by a sharp pain all over your body. Taken aback, you fell down, panting heavily. Suddenly, your legs started to burn intensely and when you looked at them, you realized that they're beginning to shrink and get chubby. From there, the visible muscle mass in your legs was now gone. After, the pain intensified to the upper part of your body. You're trying to get up, but it's difficult with your new legs not used to all that weight up there. But then, it began to lighten up, as you started to shrink to your crush's height, while your crotch begins to recede and disappear and your arms lose a lot of their muscle as well. You were now fitting perfectly in the attire, but that was the least of your worries. You felt like you're going to throw up any minute while 2 small bumps on your chest began to inflate and form a pair of small breasts. You felt your neck shortening drastically and your Adam's apple disappear. As you began to scream in pain, you realized your voice was getting squeakier and squeakier until it reached young Hinata's tone of voice. As you looked in the mirror, you understood there's only one thing left to change: your head. That's when a searing pain, worse then before, went through your skull, reshaping itself and getting rounder with a slightly pointed chin. Your nose began to get smaller and rounder too while your eyes doubled in height, your nutty brown becoming white with a slight tinge of lavender. Finally, your long brown scruffy hair began to recede and change to a blue-purple colour while arranging itself into her classic haircut. Finally, the pain stopped just as suddenly as it came. You took a long look at yourself, examining every inch of your new body, save for the new woman part (you are a gentleman, after all). Suddenly, without thinking, you started to poke your fingers. Then, without warning, memories flood through your brain. Memories that weren't yours... or maybe they were, after all. Your confident self began to get pushed away, replaced by an overly shy personnality. You are Hinata Hyuga, and you were wondering what you were doing in a cabin. Gently, you push the door and find yourself in...</span></div></div>",

Once on your feet, you notice your clothes are sticking to the Kagome costume. You try to pull them off, but to no avail, like they were merging with the material. \"What is...\" As you spoke, you saw the mouth of the costume move in sync with your mouth... no, you felt... it <b>WAS</b> your mouth. In panic, you reach for the zipper, but can't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you begin to feel a sticky sensation as the costume constricts on you. On your chest perky C-cup breasts fill the sailor fuku as you feel your loins tighten up. It was becoming clear the costume was merging with you, turning you into Kagome... or was it? You saw Kagome's hair was no longer black, but a bright red, closer to your own hair color. Even though you now had giant anime eyes, they were green, not brown like Kagome's. You saw yourself lose height, but you were familiar with Kagome's height, and found you stopped shrinking halfway between your original height and Kagome's height. You watched your clothes merge with Kagome's school uniform, changing her fuku into a black spaghetti-strap tank top, her green pleated skirt into a denim miniskirt, and her socks and loafers into knee-high black steel-toe boots. In the corner of the room, your wallet becomes a purse, while, the biggest shock, the Swiss Army Knife you had in your pants merged with a piece of the costume you didn't notice before; a prop bow and arrows. The two merged and became an Uzi sub-machine gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare in disbelief, feeling yourself over, finding no seems, no zipper, and every touch elicits a reaction only touching your own skin could produce. Then looking once more in the mirror, you say, \"Real Kagome my foot...\" You cover your mouth, hearing your voice, for when you spoke, you sounded just like Kagome!! You remember what the tag said. \"'This costume will make you sound like the real kagome or your money back in full.' Well, nuts. They got me on a technicality... but wait!!! How did this thing merge with me in the first place, and why did it keep changing after turning me into Kagome? If I didn't know better, it's like I've become some kind of fusion of Kagome and myself.\" You pick up your, er, purse, and look inside, checking your license. The picture on it was the face now staring back to you in the mirror, and it said your were female, but your name was still the same. \"This is getting weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the store's PA, a creepy voice akin to Markula (from Aqua Teen Hunger Force) says, \"We're closing in 5 minutes. Pleases come up front and make any purchases and get the &amp;^$% out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling no choice but to head up front, you go to the checkout line, only to find a catgirl Sango dressed in a white blouse, yellow sweater vest, and grey pleated skirt outfit resembling a Japanese high school uniform carrying a perfect scale replica of Hiraikotsu, a female Inuyasha wielding a very realistic Tessaiga (or Tetsusaiga, however you like to spell it), a dead ringer for Miroku, and a blonde girl in a red t-shirt and short shorts that had Kirara's ears and tails. The man the counter, himself a wispy old man with pale skin and long white hair, a long, well manicured fu man shu beard on his face, told the other \"customers,\" \"What the hell you talking about? You haven't bought anything, nor are you wearing any costumes, so stop bugging me, and either buy something in the next 30 seconds or get the &amp;^$% out!!\" A bell rang, and the man re-issued his demand for them to leave. Catgirl Sango yelled, \"But...\" Next thing everyone knew, they were on the curb, and all the lights in the store were out. \"How'd we get out here?\" she said. Suddenly, they turned and saw you.</span></div></div>",

Without time to react, the light clocks you over the head, stopping in mid-air for the man that looked like Miroku to say, \"Isn't that the... Shikon-no-Tama?!\" Just as he said that, it shattered into hundreds of tiny shards and scattered to the wind, leaving only one shard there. The concussive blow dazed you to the point that you fell out unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up after dark, you find the same cadre of pseudo-Inuyasha characters around you, but now they were joined by three more people. These people apparently had been customers of the costume shop as well, but weren't wearing Inuyasha-themed costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the catgirl Sango was what looked like Soi Fon... well, more like a bimbo Soi Fon, her hair a light blonde, skin moderately tanned, lips massively pouty and painted a dark and slutty violet, breasts huge (about an I-cup) &amp; gravity-defying, with a tribal tramp stamp tattoo just above her butt, dressed not in Soi Fon's captain's uniform but in 6\" platform heels, black micro miniskirt, black thong (with straps exposed above the top of the skirt), and star shaped pasties that barely cover her areolas. However, she was still wearing the sealed Suzumebachi, except it was now on the belt loops of the micro mini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the female Inuyasha is a girl that looks just like Lucy Heartfilia from Fairy Tail, dressed in her top and pleated miniskirt, but also happened to be a centaur, the fur on her horse half matching her blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, next to the bimbo Soi Fon was a female version of Goku from Dragon Ball Z, but with tail intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... What's going on?\" you groggily ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the Shikon-no-Tama shattered over your head, these three people showed up, having bought costumes from the same shop as we did, and looking to get this fixed, only to find the shop closed.\" the catgirl Sango told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figure we should get to know each other, since we're in the same boat now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Greg Kimbles. I'm a defensive back at Southern High. I came here with my girlfriend Alice...\" He holds up the centaur Lucy Heartfilia's hand, \"...and bought one of this store's costumes for the Halloween ball today. When I put it on, this happened. At first, it looked like I was going to become a carbon copy of Inuyasha, but I tripped and fell into the dirty clothes hamper, and the only thing in it was my sister's underwear at the time, so for some reason it turned me into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel McAllister is my name,\" the centaur Lucy states, \"and like my boyfriend, I bought a costume here, and I put it on today, but it so happens I live on a horse farm, and judging from what everyone else has told me, I must have had some latent horse hairs on me when I donned my costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl Sango says, \"I'm Hitomi Arisawa. I got this costume as a gift from my mom, who knew I liked Sango. However, my cat jumped in my lap, and she fused into me, turning me into a catgirl when the costume merged to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bimbo Soi Fon spoke up, stuttering and blushing, \"I... I'm... I'm Akiko Arisawa, Hitomi's sister. My friend got me a Soi Fon costume from here, claiming they'd come to the Halloween ball as Yoruichi. However, as I got dressed, she spray tanned me and stuffed my shirt with falsies, saying she was going to swap by costume with her Yoruichi costume at the last minute, because she suddenly wanted to be Soi Fon. She's always pulling jokes like that. H... However, by then, the costume had begun to fuse to me and change me. N... N... Next thing I know, I look like a cheap floozy hooker version of Soi Fon. When she saw how I changed, she freaked out and ran away. I'm so embarrassed!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Goku said, \"I'm Yuzu Arisawa, and the youngest Arisawa sibling. I went to put on my costume, and became this girl Goku. I figure what kept me from becoming a boy was the fact that I refused to remove my undergarments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kirara girl said, \"I'm Andrea. I came in with my friend Michelle here and wanted a simple costume, so I grabbed a Kirara ears and tail kit, and now they're real...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And I'm Michelle...\" the genuine Miroku uttered. \"It seems I'm the only one who put on their costume properly without error or contrivance mucking it up... of course I want to hurry up and fix this. I want to be a girl again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with being a guy?\" Greg blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of things, especially this dumb sac between your legs. It hurts like hell if it gets hit!!\" Michelle retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiko says, \"Well, from what I can tell, the store locked up as soon as we donned our costumes, as though the owner wanted us to change. It means he had no intent on fixing us, and knew this would happen. Also, there could be other 'victims.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!!\" gasps Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiko goes on, \"I also believe, along with the Jewel being real, we may have the genuine powers of the characters we've become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull...\" Greg discounts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiko however decides to prove her wrong, drawing Suzumebachi. \"Sting all enemies to death!! Suzumebachi!!\" To everyone's shock but Akiko's, Suzumebachi released into its Shikai form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gasped, then said, \"Then that means my Tessaiga is for real too!!\" She draws it, the rusty blade becoming the giant fang the half-demon wields in the manga. \"Wind Scar!!\" She slashes, sending a demonic slash towards a parked car, blowing it up. \"Oh crap!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone sprints from sight, they talk again. You say, \"Well, we can't stay this way, can we? We have to find the costume shop guy and beat the way to fix this out of him or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel retorts, \"But what about that shattered jewel? What if it falls into the wrong hands?\" You do realize just how dangerous the Shikon-no-Tama could be, and you swear you feel a shard or two faintly away from you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you guys do?</span></div></div>",

So that's how I ended up here looking around the anime junk , and I do mean junk . There wasn't a single cosplay I wanted to try on , then I saw it . On a display was an Inuyasha costume . The costume consisted of  a pair of fake ears , the prayer bead necklace ,  and an outfit like he would normally wear. I found my father and asked about it , he told me that if I want to try it on I'd  need to talk to his boss.Mr. Wong. <br>\r\n      I asked and he said \" I'll tell ya what , that costume is very special . If it responds to you then I'll let you have it for free.\". I of course asked what he mean by responds . He wasn't listening though , he was to busy getting the costume off the display. Mr . Wong passed it to me then directed me to the changing rooms . I figured he was just trying to get my goat about the \"responding\" thing so I decided to try it on anyways. I heard the door click behind me then I turned on the light. <br>\r\n    I looked down at the costume in my hands , then put it down on a bench. I undressed and started to put on the costume , it was meant for someone a little taller than I was . I took off my shoes , since Inuyasha doesn't actually wear shoes. The necklace and ears went on next , after that I looked into the mirror and saw myself . I looked more or less like Inuyasha ,  but I had black hair and I was shorter than him. <br>\r\n    Then I felt strange , my body started to burn . The ears fell of my head , they were pushed off , by my ears ?! I was turning into Inuyasha !? I ran out of the room . The changes were still going on as I ran to find my Dad , I yelled for him as soon as I saw him. I got about half way down the asile , then I fell to the ground  . The pain was to much , I screamed an held my head . My ears were traveling up the side of my head. I started to grow taller , and my face and body changed . The pain dulled and I felt my hair flow outward , while it turned white. I felt my vocal chords change and then every thing went black. When I woke up I was </span></div></div>",

It even has an exact replica of his zanpakuto, Hyorinmaru. You take it off the hanger and examine it further. <br>\r\n'Wait, you're thinking, his hair isn't there. That's weird, maybe I should ask the man.'<br>\r\nNo sooner then you think that, the old man appears behind you from God knows where, freaking you out in the process.<br>\r\n\"May I help you, young man? he asks.<br>\r\n-Actually, yes, you could. It seems there's no wig or anything with the Hitsugaya costume. It's not everyday you see someone walking on the streets with white spiky hair.<br>\r\n-Do not worry, he replies. There's no need for WIGS. As soon as you put on that costume, everyone will know exactly who you are.<br>\r\n-Uhhh, okay, you say, uncertain. Then is there a cabin where I could change?<br>\r\n-Down the hall, you can't miss them,\" he says, pointing to curtains in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the direction he points to you, wanting to thank him, but he vanishes. Shrugging it off, you go to the cabins to take a look at what you'd look like as a captain. You close the curtain behind you and take off your clothes save for your underwear. You then start putting on the uniform, but it's not that easy, but you make it. Finally, you put on the haori and the sash holding the sword on your shoulders (the sword is on the right side). You have to admit, you look pretty good as a captain, even though the clothes are kinda tight, since they're made for someone Toshiro's size. But then, you feel a tingling sensation that quickly becomes more and more painful and unbearable. You start to sweat intensely and take a look at the mirror in front of you and gasp. You're... SHRINKING?! HOLY CRAP, what's going on? But then you realize that you feel much better, now that you're the same size as the clothes. But the pain is still there and it's still very intense. Suddenly, you feel your arms and legs thin up and your feet shortening, with your whole body becoming much stronger at the same time. You now feel like you can leap over a building. You take a look at your hands and realize they're becoming smaller and more tanned. You look in the mirror and see that your face is now changing, too. Your face takes on a v-shaped form, your eyes are becoming bigger and narrowing, your eyebrows become barely visible and your lips become near non-existant. Finally, the last touch you need for a complete Hitsugaya costume: your hair begins to bleach until it takes a pure snow white color and becomes spiky as hell. Finally, the changes are over and you just stand there, flabbergasted. You take a look at and feel your new body and realize how strong you've become. It seems like you still think as yourself. Suddenly, you want to try out your new powers. You think about that door they make an appearance from when coming from the Seireitei and it suddenly appears in front of you. Excited, you want to step in, but you hesitate. Maybe you should practice your new skills a bit before you immerse yourself into a whole new world. But you really want to go in there. Imagine: being the captain of a whole army that obey your every single command. Wouldn't that be grand? Hmmm, decisions, decisions, decisions. So what will it be?</span></div></div>",

Your biggest inspiration, your favorite Bleach character in the whole wide world without a single doubt, is now  hanging in front of you... well, by a hanger. Yep, hanging there is a pitch-perfect costume of the sadistic, combat-obssessed captain Kenpachi Zaraki, the one and only. It includes the whole Shinigami uniform, including his ripped haori, his power-sealing eyepatch and even his broken Zanpakuto who's name is unknown even to you, his biggest fan. Feeling extatic, you take the costume and hurry to the cabins, where you take off your clothes and begin putting on his uniform. Finally, with the haori on you, you take a good look at yourself and try his trademark creepy grin, but it doesn't fit at all on your face, especially with the fact that the clothes were WAY too big for you. Feeling a little disappointed it didn't fit you, you decide to take another costume. But before you can do so, you get caught by a painful burn throughout your entire body. Feeling like you might throw up any minute, you fall on your knees, the pain getting unbearable. You suddenly feel an extraordinary surge of power flowing through you as you see your hands get bigger, your fingers longer and veins popping out. You can feel yourself growing much, MUCH taller, now a whooping 6' 7\". After, you feel like you're getting cut from everywhere as you see scars all over you. And then, it dawned: you were now becoming your favorite character, and it looked like you were almost done, as you feel your six-pack chest and your amazing strength through every fiber of your body. You then begin to panic; sure, you're a very big fan of Kenpachi, but not to the point of actually BEING him. You do not want to be as sadistic and obssessed with fighting as he is but it is now too late. Already, the changes reach your face. As your skull reshapes to a v shape, you let a big cry of agony and it seems you now sound exactly like him. Crying in fear, you see your mouth getting larger, your nose getting bigger and your eyes change to a green color, your eyebrows fall down and a scar appear on your left eye. Finally, your hair lenghten and goes up and small bells attach themselves on each of the spikes. You then begin to see memories of bloodscenes and murders. No, these aren't yours, they're Zaraki's. Quickly, you try to remember some of your own memories: your parents, your dog... your loved one, Yachiru, Ikkaku getting beaten by a petty Ryoka. At these thoughts, you can't help but do your creepy smile. What were you doing in a cabin, anyway? Carnage is waiting for you, and so is your squad.</span></div></div>",

You were never a fan of that overreacting pile of muscles, but you always did think he was kind of funny. Your friend, however, hated Armstrong with a passion and you think of how hilarious it would be to piss him off. You take the costume and hurry to the cabins. You take it out of the plastic and realize that there's no wig (a bald one, that is) or even his mustache. But then again, you can always draw a mustache and you DID need a haircut: you had hair sprouting everywhere on your skull (although that wouldn't be your dream haircut). You put on the vest and then realize it's way too big for you, but you keep putting on the pants, belt and finish with the boots, about 3 sizes too big for you. 'Oh well, you think, disappointed. Guess there's always some other cos-' But your thoughts get interrupted by a sharp pain all over your body. As you feel your legs getting bigger and stronger, your feet swell into the boots, now perfectly fitting you. Your pants begin to get tight when you realize your waist growing. 'Maybe it's the belt,' you think, loosening it up. After you do so, you feel a little better, but the pain still resides and it's now stronger than ever. You can feel an incredible surge of strength through your upper body as you feel your ribcage expanding, now an incredible six-pack. Next, you arms begin to elongate and get bigger with muscles, your hands thicken, and your fingers elongate. The vest, which was much too big, now fits you like it was tailored for you. You take a look at you in the mirror. Save for the face, you look exactly as Alexander. But not for long. As the pain worsens, you feel your skull reshaping completely as you jawline squarens and widens, nearly all you hair fall off, save for one tuft at the front of your face that changes to blonde, you gain a double chin, your skin becomes rougher, your nose broadens and widens, your eyes change to an ocean blue color and narrow and, finally, you see a mustache grow and curves at the top. At last, the pain stops. You take a good look at yourself, now completely unrecognizable from your old self. You tug the mustache to see if it's real, and you yelp in a much deeper and masculine voice than yours. \"Well, you say in your new voice, I can officially say that this is definitely mine, now.\" As you ponder over your situation, you wonder what you should do now.</span></div></div>",

Just clip them in first before putting on the suit.\" She advised and went on about her business. You just shrugged blushing like a tomato. The girl was apparently ok with you wearing the girl suit. You Shrugged and continued on your way to the changing room. It was strange. You really didn't know why but you really wanted to try on the suit. You never wanted to wear girls clothing before but the suit strangely compelled you. Was it your crush on the character? What is your love of the anime? Who knows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the curtain of the changing room behind you and slowly stripped down to your underwear. You looked silly with the suit in hand. Almost like Shinji in episode 8. You chuckled at that thought. Remembering the clips you pinned them to your hair clipping them to few free strands of hair that looked nothing like the hairstyle Asuka had. Remembering Asuka dressed in the suit naked you reluctantly dropped down your underwear. You slowly and carefully not to damage it stepped to the baggy suit and pulled it up to your waist. Then you did exactly the same thing Asuka did. Pulled the suit higher and fit your hands to the gloves. When you were done with both hands the suit rose up to your neck by itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked incredibly silly wearing the baggy suit. It felt nice on your skin. The soft silk material lining the suit was something you never saw in your life. Then when you were about to take it off you remembered that these suits had to be activated. Surely this wasn't the case... There also wasn't any zipper so what else could it be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the six-sided wrist cuff adorned with yellow buttons and you pressed it. You could hear a hiss coming from the life support pack placed on your back as the suit slowly tightened around you. This was different. In the show it was quick. It has to be low on battery or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts quickly left your mind as the suit accelerated and tightened all the way around your body pressing and flattening your crotch and figure to the feminine shape. </span></div></div>",

Of course, I use the term boy loosely.\" She said amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\" You asked standing up and checking your crotch to confirm the absence of boy parts. You brushed your long ginger hair out of your face as your hands went to the chest. There was certainly a mass behind the cups but to your relief, there was still too little to fill them completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mua? Naah. I didn't do a thing mein little Analphabetin. It is that shop you walked into.\" She explained giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reall funny. Could you at least stop laughing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want liebchan.\" She calmed down a bit with an occasional giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here? Where is here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... how to explain. The proper word would be thinny. At least the way you personally perceive it. You are here because of a chance. The store you were in is actually an illusion of a place. You entered a free roaming tear in reality. \" Asuka explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but this still doesn't explain what happened to me.\" You replied absentmindedly. You were brought to the present by a very sensitive part of your newly forming breast brushing on the inside of the suits cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinny is reality tear. It is kind of sentient. Some people go mad, some disappear... in your case. You change.\" You reach to your chest and with a horrified expression discover you are still changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why you? Why me?\" You are asking while inspecting the changes further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad time bad place? Maybe the right time and the right place. Who knows. I only know that we chose this. You picked the suit ergo we are here.\" She explained briefly weaving her hand. The shimmering humming wall appeared before you. It looked like liquid metal. You could see in the reflection that now looked identical to her only wearing plugsuit instead of the yellow dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached to you and adjusted the pins on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better don't you think?\" She sais as you turn your back on the metal shimmering wall slapping her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be mean. After all, not just anyone gets the chance to be me.\" She said pushing you to the liquid metallic wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" You screamed reaching your hand towards her praying she grabs you. </span></div></div>",

You don't feel up to either, to be honest, but anything is better than angel attack right? With no time to spare you run out of the sliding door. In your rush, you fail to notice brownhaired boy waiting for you in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schei\u00dfe!

He nods and follows behind you. 'Just great! now I have to deal with him.' You think to your self tapping your foot leaning on the elevator wall with the other. You can feel the kinetic shock of the elevator in your gut making you queasy. There is no time to think about who you really are how you got here and how to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator chimed and the door slid open to reveal the holding cages. You leave the boy in the elevator and look around. The sickly smell of what you can only think is LCL penetrates is hanging in the air. You spot the red giant and head towards it. You can hear the boy walking timidly behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you are painfully aware of your new anatomy. Your breasts while supported still jiggle a bit in the cups of the suit. Your thighs swish around each other and your hips sway with each step. The hair tickles your neck and whips behind you as you turn your head. Your steps sound hollow on the metal grid walkway extended above the tank of LCL. You sigh and climb to the entry plug. All the clues aarround you tell you that this time it is.</span></div></div>",

You settled into the command seat of the red EVA noticing how soft and comfy the seat was. 'At least I can relax a bit.' You thought as the orange liquid poured at your feed and slowly rose up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh hell no!\" You yelled trying to hold your breath. You failed and choked a bit on the liquid before your lungs fully filled. 'Fuck! That felt like drowning!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright Asuka?\" Said the blond on the screen that just popped up in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" You said trying it to sound convincing and failing. You made yourself comfortable in the seat once again. Trying to relax and tune out all the sensations your uncomfortably alien body sent you proved to be fruitless. Your mind wondered. You could feel the presence of the EVA but just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka your sync ratio is down 4 points. What are you doing? Concentrate harder.\" Asked head scientist of project E. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am trying to.\" You replied. This was really messed up. You had much more important issues to think about. You gripped the controls tighter and the material of the suit creaked rubbing against the rubberized metal handles. This was going to be a long day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you managed to raise back up your ration. You wondered how is this possible. 'This Isn't my EVE. I am not Asuka! Does the EVA think I am her or am I really her?' You suddenly noticed that you didn't breathe for a while. 'It has to be the LCL. Shinji was right. It really smelled like blood.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like days you climbed out of the entry plug soaked with raging headache and grumpy as a wolverine. You swiftly made your way over the platforms to the elevator not waiting for others. You managed to score your ratio on top of the three and it bothered you more than if it dropped through the basement to the raging hell. It meant that the EVA and more importantly miss Soryu considered you to be her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Asuka!\" Shinji called and stuck his hand to the door just in time to stop the elevator. You gritted your teeth and grumbled a little. 'That god damn idiot! How dare he stop the elevator!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on coming on top again.\" He said as he pressed the button for the door to close. 'God this guy was irritating. It was like he was hitting on you!' You stood there looking pissed off dripping with LCL that was slowly pooling under both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! You forgot your towel.\" He handed you the red towel with 02 embroidered on it.\" You forgot to notice he even held it in your rage. Still, it's not like you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Came out of your mouth in the end. both of you went to your respective changing rooms. It was strange for you to follow the red female symbol. You went to the showers discarding the towel to the bin at the door. You put on the hot water and just relaxed. The feeling of the nasty orange substance washing away was heavenly and your new body reacted accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, on the other hand, you were a bundle of nerves. You just couldn't take it anymore. You slid down along the tyled wall and sat in the shower crying. You had no idea how to get home. No Idea how to get your body back and ost of all. You knew what the future holds for you if you stay here in this body. You thought about slashing your wrists open right there but the thought of what would happen if you failed disgusted you. That helpless little weeb would just love to wank over your sedated body. The body you feared to live in. You didn't even want to take off that suit knowing what you have to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the albino girl walked in the showers and picked the shower next to you as the orange gunk rained down to the ground from her pristine white suit. She then unsealed her suit and slowly peeled it off of her. Your eyes wandered towards her. You felt dirty but you liked what you saw and your new body reacted accordingly. 'Screw this! Now I am lesbian!' You thought while averting your eyes from the clone next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong pilot Soryu?\" Asked the blue haired girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" You replied withount flinching.</span></div></div>",

Running silky smooth, your hair feels finally clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself, then at your wrist. You unseal the suit and pull it down revealing pale smooth skin. Yanking the hands of the gloves and pulling the suit down to your waist is a relief. Shortlived one as you look down at yourself and see a pair of perky breasts sitting on your chest. You could feel them through the suit all those hours in the EVA but now and out in the open, you can feel how sensitive they are as the water slides over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In for a penny...' You think to yourself pulling the suit all the way down and stepping under the showerhead again. You swiftly wash away the sweat built up over the duration of this crazy day and pull the towel out of the rack.

The shoes are ugly as hell but not too uncomfortable. Next, come the clips. After a while, you get them to clip in the way they are supposed to fit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You bundle the transparent suit on your arm and rush back to the main path between the aisle, craning your neck around until you spot a sign leading to the changing rooms. Without a second thought you beeline right to them and shut the door. You look down at your arm, where you can feel the bodysuit rest but it looks like nothing is there... Your not sure how this thing works, it hurts your brain just trying to fathom it so you just throw all the aside and decide to put it on. You hang up the suit and carefully remove the bag of accessories, after all if the suit fell off the hanger it would be a pain in the ass to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's in here anyway?\" You open up the accessories and pull out the boots, socks, and gloves. They look nearly identical to the ones from the show, which was a nice attention to detail. The small black Choker you spotted earlier was next, it seemed like a simple strap with a disk in the middle. On one side of the disc it had the text 'Over throat' written. Curious you place the disc to your throat, it sits pretty comfortably there so it seemed it wouldn't be intrusive. \"Wonder why i-\" You pull it away in shock... that was a girl's voice! \"A voice changer? What the hell is this a spy movie?\" you mutter in your normal tone as you stare at the innocuous choker. Despite your outburst the thought of it all it pretty amazing. You put the little device through it's paces, placing it and removing it randomly as you talk and every time it smoothly transitions between the girl voice and your own, no glitches or anything. After a moment you shrug. \"Why not, at least this way if I run into anyone I know they won't question why I'm in the girl's section.\" Your voice raises in pitch mid-sentence as you lock the choker in place. You can feel in there but its not intrusive. Now onto the main event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip out of you shirt, socks, and Jeans before turning to the hanger on the door. You carefully reach out to grab the bodysuit, making sure not to lose track of it. It's a bit of an ordeal to find the opening again and it takes a bit more to find the zipper... the invisible zipper. Zipping it down leaves you looking into a hole in space, You do your best not think about it as you step inside and watch your leg disappear. You have to feel around a bit to find the leg hole but once you do the material slides along easily. It's soft but stretchy, It feels really nice on your skin. You've never felt anything quite like it. Once one leg was safely inside with no adverse effect you sat down to put your other leg in. A bit of shimmying and a few tugs and you were now just a floating torso. Catching a glance at your bizarre reflection gets a chuckle out of you, though thanks to the choker is comes out as a girlish giggle. This strange disconnect only makes you laugh harder, needing to take a minute for you to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it got a bit more challenging, as once you got your first arm into the sleeve all the way down to the fingers you lost track of where your arm was. After a bit of flailing around and high pitched curses you managed to get both arms all the way in. Frowning for a moment you pause and look to the gloves sitting off to the side. \"I guess these really do have a use...\" you mused lightly as you carefully paw at the pile until you can grab them. Once the gloves were on and you were able to see your hands again the rest of the dressing process was much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the material tight against your chest and reached back to start zippering up, as it passed the material tightened comfortably until you were just a floating head and gloves. You could feel the face mask resting against your chest. The idea of sticking your head into a void in space took a lot more courage then the rest. \"It's okay, it's just a costume.\" your nerves making your high pitched voice trill even higher. Holding your breath you pull it up over your face. Inside was darkness, enough that you could feel yourself start to panic but once you pulled it tight against your face everything cleared up as if you weren't wearing anything. You zip it up and look to the mirror all you can see in a pair of floating gloves. With an unseen smile you wave watching the gloves respond in kind, not even the slightest visual hint of your limbs or body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... This is so cool.\" you 'squeal' excitedly and then feel awkward. Maybe the choker was a bit much but for now you leave it be. You sit back down and grab a sock before realizing once again you can't see your feet. \"Oh, hehe. Right.\" having to trace the sock down your body to the foot you can't help but enjoy the sensation. This material is fantastic... Repeating the process with the other you can't help but feel accomplished as you wiggle your now visible toes. \"I wonder if Tooru had to go through this growing up...\" you muse softly, feeling a bit of sympathy for the character. She's very much a joke character in the series but she must have some strength to get by in the day to day and stay so cheerful. Tying your boots you stand up and look at the floating gloves and boots once more before offering the mirror a V with your fingers as Invisible girl often would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat this costume Jeff! Ha!\" You challenge the reflection, baring a wide grin known only to you...</span></div></div>",

You should be finding some excuse to leave so you can change back out and avoid embarrassment... despite all that you can't help yourself, you're filled with an insatiable curiosity and your sole target is Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not really. I share a bunch of classes with him at school.\" she admitted slowly, eyes glancing away from your general direction. \"We haven't talked much but he stood up for me when some other girls were giving me a hard time. Then he just suddenly invited me to come to the party.\" she sounded surprised herself and a little happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that was sweet of him.\" in your mind that had been more sarcastic and teasing but by the time it left your mouth you sounded genuinely touched... and if your were honest with yourself you kinda were, Jake was your friend for a reason after all. Good on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Alice agreed softly, briefly cracking a smile. oh yeah, she liked him. \"I've never gone to a costume party, but it sounds like fun. Admittedly I really had no idea what to wear... when I heard about this place and it's special costumes I thought maybe I could find something that would give me some more... I don't know. Confidence?\" she looked to the large pile of outfits she had gathered and sighed. \"Though I'm not sure I can even try these on, they really aren't me at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the whole point of a Costume though, to be someone else.\" You chime in without missing a beat, the irony heavy in the air though you ignore it as you stand and your surprised. She wasn't nearly as short as you thought she was. She was only few inches shorter then you. You push that aside and step forward placing your gloved hand on her shoulder, she turns your way but obviously doesn't know where your face is. \"Don't worry about what people thank and just find something fun to wear! I'm sure we can find plenty of outfits that would look super cute on you.\" you exclaim cheerfully... wait we? Did you just volunteer yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... If you really think so.\" Alice seemed overwhelmed by the enthusiastic support. \"Thanks Bree...\" she said softly, offering you a small genuine smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to help!\" your voice is confident but your face is resigned, looks like you'll been keeping this up a while longer... She turns to the pile of costumes and gives a nervous giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought so many I don't even know where to start.\" she offers you a sideways glance. \"Do you want to try some on too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" is all you can vocalize as panic sets in. Once again your glad your expression is hidden because your not sure how deep you've dug yourself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, If I have someone else to do it with I won't be as Embarrassed...

As you finished the armbands and bracers the strength filling you seemed to pushed you higher. Your felt bigger and stronger, girl or not you could defiantly get used to this. You had muscles and curves and strangely you could feel long hair tickling you neck and cheeks though it was invisible, despite someone being outside of the bodysuit... but at this point that was the least impressive change you'd experienced. \"Just the Boots and I'm done, so that should be enough.\" you admit aloud, noting a deeper more womanly tone escaping your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right,\" squeaked the unsure voice of a young girl. \"If we're just going to change again I guess I'm done too.\" curiosity insatiable you turn to your companion and look down.

You had promised... So with great reluctance you relented. \"Sure, why not.\" you say in a more casual tone then you feel, but you new alto voice seems to give the statement a level of authority. As you actually have to untie the back stings of the breastplate not that it fits so snuggling to your curves, shimmying it off your hips and to the floor... you can't help but notice that your not changing back... \"Um Alice, I'm still all amazon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard from the owner that you can only change back by putting your own clothes on when your done...\" she replied in her squeaky child voice as she managed to slip out of the layers of frills. Leaving just a little girl in her underwear. \"As long as you don't leave the store in costume or mix costumes you can always change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, i was getting worried there for a moment.\" your light giggles being replaced with a husky chuckle that you had to remind yourself was coming from you. You made a mental note not to mix and match any of the costumes, your invisible body suit not I even coming to mind as a 'costume' in it's own right... It's probably fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arm bands and bracers were easy enough and before long you were once again in just in the bodysuit, though now with a much more impressive body, you a finger along your flexing bicep, the hard corded muscle under the smooth suit giving a pleasant feeling. You actually had a defined set of abs! but looking to the small childlike dress on the bench you know it's going away. Alice was already pulling the breastplate over it, it was comically large. If she crouched down she'd probably be able to hide inside... at least until the costumes magic began to trigger. She began to grow in rhythmic spurts, body tensing with each one to keep herself from falling. With each spurt she looked stronger, fiercer imposing. It took less then a minute before she was eyes to eye with you, a mature hardened woman rather then the frail child she'd been moments earlier. it was night and day even from her original form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...That was a rush.\" Alice said in a shaky voice, a ghost of a smile sneaking on to her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait till you try the arm bands.\" you say knowingly taking advantage of your Invisibility to get a good look of Alice's new more  athletic form and it's quite nice but lacking your usual equipment the rush of arousal is hard to get used to, but it wasn't unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget your costume Bree,\" she reminded locking her first arm band in place, her arms visibly gaining definition. \"Oooh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" you pick up the child sized dress and raise a transparent eyebrow. \"That being said I have no idea how I'm going to fit in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body will figure out a way.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was just ridiculous. \"I don't think this is going to-\" as you start to vocalize  your frustration your hit with a massive bout of vertigo. You her spins as you feel like you falling despite feeling both feet on the ground. The hem of the dress seems to expand rapidly. slipping over your bare shoulders can further down. The breasts and muscle melting away  until your nearly covered by the cloth. You fight and scrambled until your head pops out through the neckline of the dress with a gasp.The fresh air seeming to settling the uneasy feeling... Though the realization is replaced with shock as you take in your surroundings. everything is huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you\u2019re so small now.\" Alice\u2019s voice causes you to crane your neck up to see your amazonian classmate. Even as she crouched down she still loomed large, a mature woman in front of a child. \"I kinda wish i could have sent that change without the invisibility.\" she admitted with a low chuckle and you could feel your face heat up. You felt simultaneously embarrassed and vulnerable in the presence of the warrior woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s... certainly something.\" your voice rings like a small bell, higher than even the voice changer had placed it due to your newly gained youth. You touch your throat without really thinking about it and your hand freezes and you feel your smooth neck... The Voice changer was gone, you didn't feel it fall off. It was inside the body suit so it should be pretty obvious if it did. Maybe since your currently a girl it's not needed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't help but feel there\u2019s something more to it... It's not visible due to the  body suit but you've gotten more and more attune with perceiving yourself without visual cues.

Long hair seemed both in and outside of the skin suit trailing down past your pert bottom, you could no longer feel the drag of body hair against the suit. You'd slimmed out considerably, save for your chest, and felt you may have even lost some height somewhere along the way... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your mind was jumbled, a mish-mash of knowledge from many different cultures and fictional settings clouded your thoughts.

You asked one of the employees how much it was and they replied, \"well... How about you try it on first?\" And pointed to the dressing rooms. You nodded ok, and he pulled it off display. You wondered why they would give you the display model rather than a stored model in the back, but didn't bother thinking about it too much.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You dragged the armor into the dressing room and laid it out, piece by piece. The elite suit seemed to include something similar to a wetsuit. You unclothed to your underwear and put the wetsuit on, making sure it fitted tightly. First you put on the foot armor, which clamped onto the wetsuit without trouble. Next, you put on the knee and thigh armor, which strapped around your leg uncomfortably. Then came the arms and the wrists, which seemed too loose and too tight in some places. The chest piece followed, which didn't even extend to your stomach. Finally, the helmet, which sat sadly on your head, wobbling loosely.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     You looked in the mirror for a while, looking the costume over. It didn't fit you well, and you were about to take it off, until you had a shocking pain everywhere across your body. The helmet clanked on the ground when you fell, but the shock at least put you back in control of your muscles. You stood up in front of the mirror, and watched your face, the only part of skin not covered by the wetsuit, was turning grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You panicked. At first you thought maybe you had a concussion when you fell, but the next events were surreal. The wetsuit got tighter and tighter, until it felt like it disappeared, but, looking down, you noticed that the wetsuit had become your skin; grey, smooth, and lacking some anatomy. The surprise made you jump, but looking in the mirror you saw your jaw split. Just by seeing it, you seemed to experience excruciating pain that you hadn't noticed before. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     'Keep your mind off it, your hallucinating!' You thought to yourself, denying the anomaly. You looked down at your hands, and your ring and little fingers instantly fused into another thumb! You screamed in a voice of an elite. Looking back in the mirror, you noticed your face was complete, and you were scared, more scared than you could describe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your feet began to hurt now, and you seemed to react by standing on your tip-toes. Your toes fused into two larger ones on each foot, which seemed to provide perfect balance. You examined your reflection closely and in disbelief, wondering if this had really happened or not. You took of all the armor to see if it would fix it, and tried to peel off your skin, thinking maybe it was still a wetsuit. You couldn't even feel the underwear you were wearing anymore, which on closer investigation had appeared on the dressing room bench beside you. You reluctantly put all the armor back on, lastly the helmet, which shone in the light from the overhead lamp.</span></div></div>",

You are scared and want to stop the changing, but in vain. It is too hard for you to move. A few minutes later, you feel the change stops. You open your eye, and see a blue-skin hedgehog with a pair of red and white shoes looks at you in his green eyes. You are surprised at first that Sonic the hedgehog is looking at you, but then you found that it is a mirror! Actually, you ARE the Sonic the hedgehog!<br>\r\nYou want to go back to the shop to ask for help, but you suddenly remembered that the seller tell you \"NO REFUND AND EXCHANGE\".

It fits comfortably, and you have no trouble with it, to your surprise. An odd feeling comes over you; it's warm and fuzzy while at the same time cold and dark. You close your eyes, falling into the feeling... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness feels much easier, but you don't like it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear voices...or is it just one voice? They're telling you to go to the darkness, but you try and ignore them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your efforts, the warmth pushes back the darkness... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking it away... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's still there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, shaking your head. What was that? Remembering the feelings you had when you picked up the costume, you notice that they're... well, not gone, but separate, as though having two minds. The darker one was pushed back. That was...good, you suppose.<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, you notice something. Everything is bigger. Did it grow somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr did you change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic a bit, turning suddenly towards the mirror. Mephiles the Dark stares back at you. You take a few deep breaths, calming down. Obviously, something happened to make you change. You must have shrunken to Mephiles's height, about 3 feet tall. You decide not to ponder on the Dark mind as you leave the room quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\nSaid Dark mind was currently locked into your subconscious. Mephiles paced the 'room', wondering what exactly had happened. The room was actually just an apparent blackness with invisible walls, ceiling and floor. The only actual feature was a heavy metal door with several locks on the other side of it. There was only one he could open, which needed a key...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been dead not too long ago. Sucked into the oblivion of nothingness; an unknown science experiment at birth and death. The only thing left at his end was his spirit, floating endlessly for eternity. Until he wasn't. Almost as though his soul was being sewn into his new body, he was back. But he couldn't do anything. He thought he had a chance when you picked him up, but it was taken away, and he was once again trapped...for now...<br>\r\n__<br>\r\nYou now had a dilemma. In an unfamiliar body, both to yourself and those around you, what were you supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

Upon entering the dressing room, you shut the curtain.  You pick up the Sally Acorn costume again, taking a long look at it.  It looked and felt like real hair and fur!

Then you put the head on.  you grab the zipper and pull it up, once the zipper was completely up, you started to feel strange.  You shrink down to the same size and proportions that Sally Acorn had in both the SatAM Sonic cartoon and the Archie comics.  You feel the costume merge with your skin!!  You're not wearing a costume anymore, you are Sally Acorn!   Frantically, you try to find the zipper so you can take the costume off, but the zipper was gone!

You took it down from its hook, a smile cracking across your face.  \"I think I'll go with this one,\" you told the clerk.<br>\r\n\"A good choice, that,\" he replied.  \"The changing rooms are in the back, if you'd like to try it on before buying.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, then made your way towards the location he had indicated.  Stepping into the first unoccupied room, you closed the door behind you and begin putting the suit on.  The first thing to be worn was the body, with amazingly soft fur, digitigrade leg padding, and a bouncy tail attached to the rear.  After this came the two feet, which fit snugly over your own, then the four-fingered hand paws.  Brushing a strand of hair away from your eyes, you grabbed the costume's head and placed it over your own, adjusting it carefully until you could see out the eyes.  Everything fit properly!<br>\r\nLooking at your reflection in the mirror, you took a moment to appreciate the mastery with which the costume was made.  But something in the corner of the mirror caught your eye.  Gazing down by your feet, you saw a chain and shackle, the final piece to completing the look.  \"Must have dropped it,\" you muttered to yourself, stooping down to pick it up.  \"Now, which wrist did it go on?\"<br>\r\nRemembering the answer to that question, you placed the plastic prop over the suit's left wrist, snapping it into place.  Oddly enough, as you hold your hand out to inspect the shackle, it grew heavier on your wrist, as if the grey plastic was turning into the iron it was supposed to mimic.<br>\r\nThen you realized that it actually was turning into iron, the smooth surface gradually becoming shinier and more textured, much to your confusion.<br>\r\nConfusion soon turned to panic, however, as the room started to get fuzzy around you.  Beginning to feel strange and unsteady, you lifted your hands upward, but were unable to remove the costume's head - you're arms were becoming weaker by the second, and the inside of the mask seemed to be tightening around you.  Finding it difficult to stand any longer, you collapsed to the floor.  As the room faded to darkness...</span></div></div>",

You almost immediately dismiss it, laughing at the idea of dressing up as a girl. However, something pulls you back. Something about that purple and white dress, those gold trinkets, that brown wig, it made you want it. You had never really considered crossdressing before, aside from as a joke, but right now, the option was looking more and more appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to make sure no one is watching, before taking the Zelda costume off the rack. As nice as it had looked hanging up, it felt even better in your hands. There was no going back now. That said, you were still a bit embarrassed about this, and didn't feel ready to put on a dress in public yet, so you decide against trying it on in the changing room. Instead, you pick one that seems about your size, and head straight to the counter, hoping no one sees you on the way. You quickly hand the costume to the man at the counter, trying to avoid eye contact with him. Maybe it was just your mind playing tricks on you, but you could have sworn you saw him crack a smile at seeing the costume you had chosen. You pay him, and he puts the costume in a bag for you, along with a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thrown in a few extras,\" he explains, \"Free of charge. Just a couple things to make the costume more convincing. Have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" you mumble, quickly leaving the shop, taking your new purchase with you. You have a little look inside the bag he had given you your costume in, and discover that the \"extras\" he had given you seemed to be things to help you appear more feminine, so you didn't just look like a guy crossdressing while wearing the costume. This seemed to include makeup and a pair of breast forms, among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it home without incident, and quickly rush up to your room so no one sees you and asks what you bought. After closing and locking your door, you empty the contents of the bag, and lay it all out neatly on your bed. All the extras the store clerk had given you seemed like they might take a while to get it all on, along with the costume. Now you had a choice to make; you could either put the costume on now, making sure you had plenty of time to get everything ready, and maybe some time left over to get used to walking around in a dress, or you could wait until you actually went to the party, and change into your costume there, making sure only people at the party would see you dressed like that, allowing you to play it off as a joke to your friends, and avoiding embarrassment.</span></div></div>",

As you look in the mirror you notice a certain bulge begin to decipriate as it retreats back into your body and with a quick blast it forms a new vagina. You are then welcomed by the two fake greats forming on to your chests to become your real breast and they continue to expand until they are around a 36DD. You begin to panic as your manhood and all that was left of your previous life has been left and replaced by female parts. However the changing has not finished as you notice your hair change colour from an auburn red to a bleach blonde and it grows until it reaches mid back. Your whole body began to become more feminine and you developed an hour glass figure with very petite hands and sudden manicured and pedicured pink nails on your hands. The last to change was your face, it began to form a more female form and make up began to form. As you looked in the mirror it became clear your face was full of girly make up and it clearly showed you had just been transformed into Princess Peach. You faint.

There doesn't seem to be a price on it\".<br>\r\nThe clerk rolls around the edge of the counter \"well let's see what we have here\". He eases the costume out of your hands and props it on the counter. \"Ah yes, this is the Wakka costume from Final Fantasy X. Have you played the game?\" You nod \"I'm actually in the middle of playing it, I keep getting dying to one of the bosses.\" \"Seymour Flux?\" \"Is that the one on the mountain?\" \"Ha yea, the very same. That's a big wall for a lot of people, keep at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the company your focus returns to the costume. \"So, how much is it?\" The clerk thinks for a second \"I need to check the database to see, but in the meantime try it on to see if it fits!\"<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, where are the changing rooms?\" \"Down at the back, on the right\"<br>\r\nPulling the costume from the counter you head down to the changing rooms as the clerk typed away on the store computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the two cubicles are vacant and enter the one closest to the entrance and shut the door behind you. <br>\r\nYou hang up the costume and to strip down to your underwear.<br>\r\nOpening the seal on the costume you see that there is a lot more to the it than what you had initially thought. Pulling out the pieces one at a time you lay them out of the bench beside you. A wig with an attached blue headband, forearm and arm guards, sandals weighted at the bottom of the costume bag, yellow slips for the pants with straps on top, black shorts with an attached belt and compression shorts, and what could only be described as a stripper top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing is first.\" You grab the black shorts and begin to pull them up over your underwear but for some reason they were not rising any higher than the ends of your undergarments \"Eh?\"<br>\r\nCloser examination shows that the compression shorts are too tight to be worn with any other clothing. Dropping the shorts and thinking for a moment \"Well...\" You shrug and pull down your underwear. Bare to the mirror before you, you quickly pull the black shorts up to your waist with ease. You tighten the belt around the waist and pull on the yellow slips over the shorts and attach the straps to the top of the shorts.<br>\r\nQuickly slipping on the top piece and sandals you pause at the complexity of the two arm pieces. The smaller of the two slips past your right hand and onto your forearm with little hassle but the other arm piece required some effort. Pulling at the top of the piece you manage to drag it up to near the top of your left shoulder and squeeze your hand into the glove slot the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour turn to the mirror and examine yourself \"it doesn't look the same without the hair\" you doubt your choice of costume. You grab the wig with attached headband and strap it onto your head. You not and non nonchalantly begin to flex despite lacking any real sense of muscle. Your voice cracks a bit as you laugh at how different you look with the costume on.</span></div></div>",

The small scaled bikini top and short shorts looked even more revealing when you try to picture someone actually wearing it. the Wig was of surprisingly high quality and even came with a pair of extra long ears. This would make for an adorable(if risky) outfit for some petite gamer girl or bold young girl but was just out of the question for you... the tag on the hanger read <i>'One size fits all. Guaranteed.'</i> and you gave an incredulous frown. It didn't take a genius to see there just wasn't enough fabric to cover any more the a young girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Problem sir?\" A voice made you jump, having not even heard the owner approach. He seemed friendly enough but something about him made you uneasy. You manage to collect yourself and motion to the tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think your fooling with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried it on yet?\" he replied immediately as you gave him a look. He was seemed genuinely curious, after a moment you gave an annoyed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you know it doesn't fit?\" He pressed with a knowing smile. \"All of out costumes are guaranteed to fit. If you can find one that doesn't fit perfectly your next purchase is free.\" He said proudly, without a hint of falsehood. You glance to the tiny outfit in hand... what was a few minutes of embarrassment to score a free costume for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on.\" you grin, bundling the Nowi costume in your arm. \"Were are your changing rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to the right there sir.\" He relied with a smile of his own. His seeming confidence only spurred your decision to try it. You marched confidently over to the changing room and only once closing the door did you realize what you were intending to put on... You keep telling yourself its just for the freebie as you reluctantly take off your clothes and set them you the side. Now in just your underwear you look to the hanger and decide where to start. The stockings would likely be the easiest without damaging the costume. Taking a seat on the bench you held up one of the slim pink stockings, even laying it across your leg showed the clear different in length and width. Giving it an experimental tug it wasn't even all that stretchy. This would be the easiest costume you'd ever earned. With confidence you place the small opening over your large foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and watch in shock as it slid in cleanly. You mechanically pulled and the socking continued to slide up you leg with no resistance, your large calves and thighs melting easily into the slender legging until you reached to top of your thigh. You stared as your bare left leg dwarfed it's dainty pink companion to the right... It was even clearly shorter then your other leg but you could easily wiggle your toes and feel as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you whispered in shock.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way this was happening but you mismatched legs said otherwise. You look to the other stocking and hesitate slightly before grabbing it. Just like before it slides easily up your leg until it rests at the top of your thigh. Your legs now match, still retaining full feeling and movement but look completely at odds with your hip upward. You can even kick your feet without touching the ground. \"This is so unreal...\" you look to the rest of the hanging costume and back you your dainty legs. How would the rest of it fit? You can't help but wonder with a mix of thrill and fear. You move to stand, having to hop slightly down for you feet to touch the floor and quickly having to brace yourself to keep from falling. Those tiny legs are not built to hold up the rest of you... You manage to at least grab the hanger before stumbling back. scooting back up onto the seat you look over the remaining bits of costume curiously, swinging your feet unconsciously as you consider the next piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird shift from your hips to you legs is a bit disturbing to look at so you carefully pick out the shorts decide to take the plunge. They easily fit over you slender legs but you hesitate once it reached the unchanged part. Your hands are shaking slightly but you push on and after a deep breath you pull them up. They fit snuggly but move just as smooth, in a single pull your entire lower half is that of a young girl's... of Nowi's. Even your underwear had changed as it passed over your tightly whities.Peeking inside the shorts pure white panties could be seen...with not even the slightest bulge. Inside panic waged war with an odd acceptance. it's clear what this costume could do, was it really any surprise it even made him match down there? Finding comfort in this odd logic it was easy to ignore that panicking voice telling him to stop and grab the gloves, not nearly as dramatic as your legs had been since you'd already mostly come into proportions but your hands definitely became smaller as they enter you wiggle your fingers smiling at the novelty of it all. Your eye turn to the shoulder cape. It was pretty long, probably the most a mount of fabric in the whole outfit, it went down to Nowi's knees after all... it put into comparison just how short she would be in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How short I'm going to be...\" you whispered to yourself with a shaky grin. before you could find a way to talk yourself out of it you through the cape over you shoulders and began to tie it in place. You point of view lurched downward was your torso shrank in like with your lower body. You still have a males build but it was slender and lean. more like a young boys then a teen. You laughed unsure how to feel about the change but it was too far to go back now. You examined the scaled bikini top with it's cute pink bow and unhooked the back. You wrapped it around your thing torso and began to hook it back you feel your body shift in response. Looking down is an uncanny feeling. It was clearly a girls body, all remaining hair was gone and there was the slightest of curves between her hip and chest... and though they were small you could feel he slight rise of breast underneath the cups.... there was only one thing left. the last bag contained the long flowing wig with the tiara and ears. The owner had won this bet but you might as well finish things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ears slipped on over the top of your own and immediately felt at home you touch the tip and laugh nervously as you can feel your finger. The tiara slides onto your forehead just as easily as the stocking did your legs despite being clearly too small. There's a brief wince of pain as you head seems to adjust finally coming fully into proportion with your body. You shake the wig out and stare at it fore a moment before closing your eyes and placing it on your head you feel your scalp tingle and all at once it's a part of you. The long tresses being felt nearly to your rear, only your cape keeping them from ticking your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels-\" you cover you mouth as Nowi's voice came out of it. \"It changed everything.\" you say shakily in your new girly voice, your nervous chuckle converted into a giggle. You stare at your reflect in the changing mirror and you can't see any remains left of the person you were. All you see in Nowi offering hesitant smile, you slowly raise your fingers into a V, the cute gesture somehow making it easier to give an more genuine smile. That one seemed much more natural on the petite dragon girl's face... on your face. The boots were moot at this point but you slipped them on so you wouldn't get your cute stockings dirty. With a moment of reluctance you pushed the changing room door open. You are greeted by the same smiling man though he now towers over your tiny female form. despite that you don't feel scared... You feel strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust everything fits?\" he said with a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, you were right.\" you mutter with an annoyed grunt. \"No need to rub it in.\" you crossed your arms and puffed out your cheeks in a little pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dream of it sir.\" he said humbly but kept his grin. \"So will you be purchasing the costume today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell.\" you tilted your head to the side touching a finger thoughtfully to your lip. \"It is pretty cool. Does it come with a dragon stone?\" you ask hopefully. Despite how skimpy the outfit was the somehow not having a stone was what made you feel naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only with purchase, no dragon forms allowed in the store, not after last time.\" he noted with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You mean it's a working dragon stone!\" You found yourself bouncing with excitement... Something about this body made you emote so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, all of our costume are 100% accurate.\" he assured you and you can barely suppress your squeal of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!... wait.\" you feel you tiny shorts and realize everything it back in your old clothes. \"I'll meet you back at the register!\" you assure him as you scramble back into the changing you to grab your clothes... there so much bigger now. Almost comically large, but you know its Your that have gotten smaller, not the other way around. you Toss your original outfit into the bag the costume came in without a second thought and start to skip your way back to the front desk. You were going to get to change into a dragon!</span></div></div>",

Fortunately the man seemed to take it in stride, merely smiling at your attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course.\" he reached under the counter and slide it toward the edge so you could reach it, which you did so with a giddy smile. \"Remember wait until you get <b><i>outside</i></b>.\" he added with a bit more firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay~\" you reply cheerfully, hugging the dragon stone to your chest as you skip out of the store.  You barely step out of the door before raising the stone over your head. That little voice inside you insists that it shouldn't work, even though that costume somehow changed you but you don't even listen to it as you reach for the power inside you. \"It's Dragon time!\" you cheer as you are enveloped in a pink cocoon. Even more so then when you put on the costume you can feel your body shifting and changing, growing in power. In a short moment the cocoon bursts and you emerge soaring upward. Your flying. Your actually flying! You laugh, your bright girlish voice layered alongside a deeper, growly one. After rolling backward to come back and land on the sidewalk, the asphalt feeling strange to your now talon feet. Your green scales radiating magic. Your tail swishes happily, which is an odd feeling as your not used to having an appendage back there. You look around as several people stare in shock. They're expressions are just hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me~\" you call out cheerfully. \"Just your friendly neighborhood dragon!\" as if the spell was broken the gawkers scream and runaway. What wimps. The bystanders quickly leave you mind as you flex your wings, the buffeting air blowing your bag of old clothes away. \"Oops hehe... oh well it's not like those fit anymore.\" Your mind is already racing on what to do with your new power. \"Ooh, I gotta show this to Jake! He'll totally freak.\" your happy squeal is layered with a Draconian growl.

Wicke was an interesting character to you. Even with the darker things going on in the background of the Aether Foundation, Wicke seemed to still be on the side of good. She'd also become quite popular online when she was first revealed thanks to her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you kind of wanted to try the costume on. It seemed a little silly, that a boy like you was considering trying on a costume based on a woman like Wicke, but you couldn't deny that you wanted to. You obviously lacked the curves it would take to pull off the costume, but perhaps you could just stuff some stuff inside the costume to simulate what you lacked. If the people at your friend's party realised you were crossdressing, though, you'd be a laughing stock. Perhaps with the wig and the glasses, you'd be able to hide your face enough that they wouldn't recognise you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you had practically convinced yourself to get the costume, even if you hadn't yet convinced yourself to wear it to your friend's party. You pulled the costume off the rack. It seemed about your size, but you couldn't be completely sure considering the costume was made for a woman rather than a man. You could always try the costume on before buying it, seeing as there were changing rooms in the store, but you were already feeling a bit self-conscious about buying a girl's costume in the first place, so the thought of trying it on in a public changing room rather than in the safety of your home was more than a little embarrassing. What if someone happened to walk in on you? Ultimately, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to not try it on in the changing room. You were worried enough about what people would think if they saw you buying this costume, so you certainly didn't want anyone to see you dressed in it in public. At least not yet. The costume did seem about your size, anyway. You take the costume to the register, and hand it to the guy at the counter, trying to avoid eye contact. He places the costume in a bag, and hands it to you after you pay. Without another word, you take the bag and leave the store, hoping the man wasn't judging you too harshly for buying a woman's costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry home, eager to try on your purchase. Thankfully, no one else seemed to be home, so there was no one to question what you had bought. You quickly head up to your room, and lay out the costume on your bed. To your surprise, the costume not only came with Wicke's outfit and a wig based on her hair, but there was also some underwear included. You weren't entirely sure why, considering it would never be seen under the costume, but you decide that since it is indeed part of the costume, you might as well put it on too. You strip completely naked, before putting on the underwear provided by the costume, it seems a little loose, but stays on well enough. You figure that if it starts to fall off you can always just put on some of your own underwear instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you the sweater over your head. It seems to fit snugly, even on your male body, but you suppose the fabric would just stretch to accommodate the assets of someone with a body type more suited to the costume. You pull the skirt up your legs, thankfully finding the top of it to be just tight enough to cling to your body once buttoned up, although it feels a bit loose around your hips. You grab the odd, white, cape-like garment and wrap it around your shoulders, briefly wondering what purpose it serves. You pulled the large, black wig onto your head doing your best to hide your real hair underneath it, and put the glasses over your eyes. Finally, you sit down on the bed and pull on the tall, high heeled boots. They were a bit tight, but you eventually manage to get them on all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up off your bed, wobbling a bit thanks to not being used to walking in heels, and take a step, and then another, walking over to the mirror in your room. The more steps you take, the easier it seems to get. Looking at yourself in the mirror, you're surprised by how good you look. You didn't match Wicke's proportions, obviously, but the costume didn't look too bad on you, considering you were a man in woman's clothing. You face wasn't too masculine, so combined with the wig and the glasses, you didn't look too out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two obvious parts that failed to complete the look, however. For one, the skirt seemed to sag around your pelvis, seeing as you lacked the hips and rear to fill it out. And secondly, your chest was almost completely flat, with only the smallest bumps where the bra cups sat underneath the sweater. While this could work for a girl who wasn't particularly large in those areas, since the costume covered up any masculine parts of your body quite well, it didn't seem right for the costume. the costume was Wicke, not a skinny girl dress as Wicke, and your lacking areas seemed to clash with the rest of the costume. Besides that, though, the costume fit well enough, as you thankfully picked out the right size, and you rather liked the feel of it, so you were pleased with your purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

You think back to your idea from when you were first considering getting the costume. Perhaps you could stuff something inside the costume to augment those assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your sock drawer, already getting rather used to walking in these boots, and pull out a couple pairs of socks. You unbutton the cape-like garment, so that it won't get in the way, before stuffing the socks down the neck of the sweater and into the cups of the bra you were wearing. It seemed to be doing the trick, but the bra cups seemed rather large, so you grab a couple more socks. By the time the bra cups are full to the point where the bra now fits you snugly, you've practically emptied your sock drawer. Now that you had successfully given yourself a chest worthy of Wicke, you close the drawer, and put the cape-thing back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the hips. Obviously, you didn't have any socks left over, but you did have something else that could work. The pillow on your bed was getting a bit flat, and you'd been meaning to replace it, but it should still have enough fluff to it to work. You unzip the back of the skirt, and stuff the pillow down it. Unfortunately, while the socks stayed put thanks to your bra, the pillow had nothing of the sort keeping it in place, and it swiftly fell out the bottom of the skirt. You briefly ponder what you could use to keep it in place, before remembering that the panties that came with the costume seemed to be a bit loose. Pulling the skirt down to make your job a bit easier, you pull at the waistband of the panties, and place your pillow inside of them, wrapping it around your butt and hips. It feels weird having the pillow touching your bare butt, but it seems to work well, as the panties are no longer too loose. In fact, it felt a little tight at the front over your bulge, but it wasn't too bad. You quickly pull up and zip up the skirt again, before walking over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were more pleased with how you looked. The socks in your bra gave the illusion of two large breasts bulging out underneath your sweater, and the pillow wrapped around your butt filled out the skirt so it didn't look so loose anymore. It wasn't perfect, of course. You could still sort of see the outlines of the pillow and the socks if you looked close enough, the socks felt a bit itchy on your chest, and you didn't particularly like the pillow touching your bare butt, but unless anyone examined you particularly closely, you doubt anyone would think you were really a man in woman's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what to do now. You were rather enjoying your newly purchased costume, but you were also starting to get hungry, and wanted a snack. While there was no one home right now, someone else could arrive home at any minute. You could take off the costume before leaving your room, as it would still be here if you wanted to put it back on again later. Alternatively, you could just head down to the kitchen dressed in the costume, and risk having someone walk in on your dressed as Wicke.</span></div></div>",

Somehow, this costume must have been magic or something, and it transported you into the world of Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs cool as it would be to explore Alola yourself, this wasn't exactly the most ideal situation in which to do so. After all, you were clothed in a copy of Wicke's outfit, with the only other clothes on you being the socks which filled your bra. You turn around, hoping you can head back into your room and back to the real world. However, your hopes are dashed as you see your bedroom door has been replaced with a futuristic-looking automatic door, and peeking through it, you see an empty laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were really panicking. Not only had you been transported into a fictional world, while cross-dressing no less, but you now had no way of returning home, at least as far as you could tell. Not only that, but judging by how deserted the corridor was, and the laboratory behind the door in front of you, you were pretty sure this wasn't a place visitors were supposed to be. If someone found you here, yu could be in serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, you thought so until you looked down at yourself. You were still dressed as Wicke. Remembering how you looked in the mirror before you'd suddenly found yourself here, you remembered thinking that no one would think you were really a man in woman's clothing, at least at a first glance. You were suddenly very glad you made the additions to the costume you did. With the costume, and the padding you'd hidden underneath it, you were pretty confident that if anyone saw you around here, they'd just think you were Wicke. Of course, that didn't mean you could just hang around here as much as you wanted. If someone examined you closely, they'd realise you weren't who you were dressed up as, and there was also the problem of the real Wicke probably being somewhere around the facility. Your costume should avert suspicion long enough to allow you to escape, and potentially find some more suitable clothing before you figure out how to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just a matter of finding where exactly the exit was. You take a deep breath, before heading down the corridor, hoping to find a map or something to expedite your search for the exit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While deciding on whether you should take off the costume yet or not, you suddenly start to feel rather strange, but you can't put your finger on why. At first, you think that perhaps you're just hungry, but it soon becomes apparent that it is much more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pace around, you suddenly start to feel the pressure ease off your feet. Although you had managed to get the boots on before, they were still rather tight, but now they seemed to be almost made for your legs. You brushed it off as nothing, thinking that perhaps the boots had just stretched a bit after you had walked them in. Next, your scalp begins to feel a bit itchy. You attempt to lift up the wig a little to scratch your head underneath, but for some reason, you can't find the edge of the wig. You walk over to the mirror to try and figure out why, but something else catches your attention. You face seems to look a bit more feminine than it had before You think that perhaps it's just your eyes playing tricks on you, but after looking closer, you eyelashes definitely seem longer, and you eyes seemed to have turned a gold-ish colour. You take off the glasses in an attempt to get a better look, but everything goes blurry once you remove them from your face. Putting them on again, everything seems clearer. It seemed as if the plain glass in the glasses had been replaced with actual lenses, and you needed them to see properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was no way you could blow this off as nothing. You quickly reach up and grab the mass of hair sitting atop your head and try to pull the wig off. Alas, all you manage to do is cause pain in your scalp, as the wig appears to have become your real hair. Wanting to stop this before it went any further, you try to take the costume off, however, your attempts are fruitless. Obviously the wig won't come off as it is your hair now, and you needed the glasses to see, but the rest of the costume didn't seem to want to be removed either. The cape wouldn't come undone, the skirt refused to unzip, the sweater stayed firmly tucked into your skirt, and even the boots which seemed to have already done their job clung to your feet. There didn't seem to be any escape from this. After your failed attempts, you notice than your hands have also taken on a more feminine appearance, taking away the last bit of masculinity that wasn't hidden under the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, said masculinity wouldn't remain for long. Under the skirt, you began to feel your thighs pressing against the sides, and then against each other, feeling the smooth, hairless skin that now resided there. Your arms slimmed, and you felt the skirt pull your waist in a bit. The biggest changes, however, came with the parts of the costume that you'd added yourself. Slowly but surely, the itchiness on your chest seemed to fade, although the bra still seemed to fit snugly around your bare chest. You quickly reach up the the orbs bulging out underneath the sweater, only to find that they are very real, and firmly attached to you. As you deal with the revelation that you now have a pair of breasts, the changes move south. You can feel the fabric of the pillow starting to disappear, the silky panties once again touching your rear, although their tightness remains. It presses tightly against your genitals, until suddenly, the tightness is relieved all at once, the panties now fitting perfectly snugly like the rest of the costume. You are almost afraid to check, but your run your hands down the sides of your skirt, feeling that it is definitely your real hips and butt filling out the skirt now, not a pillow. You run a hand across the front, finding it to be completely flat with no bulge of any sort. You are 100% female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" you mumble, hearing a woman's voice escape your mouth instead of your own. This is all a bit too much for you to handle, and you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you recognise the room you are in as...</span></div></div>",

As costumes though they had some pretty cool outfits, besides none of them would fit you anyway. You look closer at the nearby costumes and frown... every single one is marked 'One Size fits All. Guaranteed'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not?\" You were less then convinced but you also had time to kill. You pluck a costume off the rack at random and give it a quick once more. \"Flandre huh? It looks pretty accurate.\" Someone really went to the effort of getting all the details... and just like the others that bold promise. One Size fit's All... time to put it to the test. Shouldering the costume you work your way out of the Touhou section getting an odd look from a girl who was pursuing the section. You pay her no mind. This was for science. You find the closest batch of dressing rooms and head inside locking the door behind you. The Costume comes in three pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A pair of red Mary Janes with frilled socks<br>\r\n-Flandre's signature red dress and Soft pink undershirt<br>\r\n- her pink mob cap tied off with a red ribbon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug you decide to dive right in. You peel off your tee shirt and pick up the child-sized dress looking for any way to loosen any of the bits but it's all connected together, even the oversized back bow is sown in... the only way to put it on would to someone pull it on over your head. It seems like a tall order... but they said 'guaranteed' so you duck in under the hem and put one arm up into the tiny dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's far too small as you expected... but when you push you find you're able to get a bit further in. Despite feeling like there's no give you always seems to push further in... It's a strange feeling as your having to fight it the whole way and after a minute you shimmying and struggling you can barely see. But somehow your making progress. So you keep pushing, your able to make enough room with your arms to get your head into the torso and feel something dragging down your hip and thighs, pooling at your knees. Seems like you pants came loose, so troublesome... somehow you manage to free you legs without falling and into the process get your right arm to start fitting in the sleeve. The left arm soon follows with with your arms leaving there's more space to pull the dress down further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost...\" Your voice it muffled but off, higher maybe? You throw it aside for now as you managed to get your head all the way up the to the neck opening... Your arms are free and after feeling around you find a couple small buttons you can undo, It's delicate work but once you finish you have enough wriggle room to make one last push. You gasp deeply as your head pops out the neck how and the dress settles on your frame... surprisingly comfortable after all that fighting. The shoulder span was fine, the sleeves only traveled slightly down your upper arm and poof outward cutely. You can feel the tickle of lace on your bare knees. It fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what do ya know-\" you say impressed before grabbing your throat, your voice definitely doesn't sound right... You turn to the mirror and have you rub your eyes to make sure your seeing things right. You looked younger, no older then 12. With slender hairless limbs, your face was still identifiable as you but had softer features that matched your current appearance better. Your not done changing, even as you watch your reflection you can see yourself loosing inches and muscle mass... You get it now. The clothes don't stretch to fit the wearer. The wearer gets changed to fit the clothes. \"This is so surreal.\" You touch the mirror just to make sure it's actually there. You glance back to the Hat sitting innocently on the bench of the changing room...</span></div></div>",

What was a Touhou character without her head accessory after all. You turn and walk back to the mirror watching your reflection closely as place the hat onto your head... as expected it sits perfectly on top and ties the whole outfit together. You just about to take it back off when you notice your hair... it's getting longer. You watch mesmerized as your short hair slowly creeps out from under the rim of the cap, just as it's reaching your shoulders it stops and then slowly starts to turn blond from the roots down to the tips. All the while you lose a couple more inches. You can't be older then 10 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool...\" you say in your soft tenor as you go completely blond. Next you feel a tickle in your nose. You wiggle it a bit but it just grows stronger. You can't stop yourself as you rear back and sneeze, it's big one too. You close your eyes and instinctively cover your face wit your hands.Though accompanying that is the cutest little squeak of a sneeze you've ever heard. Until you realize it's from your own throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and for a moment you think your looking at a stranger. The face was clearly a girls, with a small nose and softer features. But it was your face. You touch a few times just to make sure and it's definitely you, but you look like  a little girl. In curiosity you lift up your upper lip and see a tiny pair of fangs on either side of your mouth. It clicks in place after a  moment and it seems so obvious in retrospect... Your Flandre, fully save for the missing 'wings'. This costumes were not joking around. You step out of the now oversized boys socks and grab the tiny jack socks from the bench which fit your petite little feet much better. You slip on the mary janes last and turn around triumphantly. You offer a cute smile that flashes your fangs and look the picture of innocence. Though considering who your dressed as that's not entirely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was fun, but I should probably change ba- ahh\" you lean forward on the mirror as your back begins to burn slightly. Shaking you can only watch as a pair of twisted rods slowly began to grow of of your back. It didn't hurt so much as feel hot with a slight pinching sensation but nonetheless you can't move... \"Ahh!\" They grow out further and further and further, their twisted shape causing you to tense and relax your muscles erratically as they move. The release of them finally stopping sends you down to your knees. As you catch your breath from the odd sensation you hear an odd jingling sound. You look up to see multi-colored crystals hanging along the twisted rods, moving awkwardly as you flex your back muscles making it sound like a wind chime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty...\" You mutter to yourself in a dazed tone before shaking the fog from your head. Looks like you found Flandre's wings. \"But... if they came out of my back, how would they come back off?\" you wonder, clearly concerned, though your  childish new voice undermines it somewhat. You bite your lip and turn back to your clothes with the intent to changing back but pause. There's a strange yellow 'eye' sitting on top of your clothes. In fact They're all over the place actually... \" What the hell?\" when you reach your hand out to your clothes the eye gets closer, as if drawn to it...</span></div></div>",

The mask itself has two red eyes and a toothy grin permanently etched onto it. With a smile yourself, you recognise the attire to be a Taokaka costume. You always liked the ditsy cat vigilante and her antics in the series. You snatch the costume from its display and rush to the nearest changing room, eager to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping down to your underwear and socks in the confines of the changing room, you start to pull on the costume. Because Tao's hoodie has no open sleeves, you start with her thigh-high boots. As you put on the boots, you start to feel a little tingly but just pass it off as excitement. You pull on the mask next, half expecting to be bathed in darkness. You are pleasantly surprised to see that you can actually see out of the mask. Once again, the tingling sensation is back as you fit the mask to your head. Last and certainly not least is Tao's signature hoodie. You pull up the hood before slipping your arms into the over-sized sleeves, wondering just how you're going to grip the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the zipper to the hoodie flies up by itself, sealing you inside the costume. Freaking out a little, you turn to the wall-length mirror to see what you look like. Yep, you look like Tao, alright. Your whole body starts tingling at this point,  but you ignore it as you demo the costume by posing and reciting a few of the Kaka vigilante's lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reow, you're in trouble neow!\" You try to imitate Tao's voice as best you can while you pose in a faux-combat pose. \"Tao's gonna be a super vigilante!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. Your constant imitation must be paying off: you sound almost just like Taokaka! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growls at you violently, resorting to less subtle means to tell you to feed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tao's SO hungry. Tao could go for a meatbun or ten right neow!\" You grumble indignantly, saddened at the lack of food around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second. Did you just refer to yourself as Tao in the third person? Maybe it has something to do with the rapidly intensifying tingling sensation all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing weak-kneed, you sink to the floor as your visible features become more slender and feminine, your underwear turn into red panties, and your pecs grow and round out to become a set of sizable breasts. You feel your unmentionables fade and reform as a vagina. The blonde braids in the hoodie attach themselves to you existing hair, bleaching it the same colour and lengthening it. Your previously human ears disappear and furry cat ears find their places in the yellow ear slots of the hoodie. Finally, the tail attaches itself to your nervous system on your tailbone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to meow?\" You mutter quietly, realizing your voice now sound exactly like Taokaka's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts and memories the cat girl has had fill your mind, attempting to derail your own in order to replace them. As the foreign memories implant themselves, you begin to feel carefree and optimistic. Why fight it? Becoming Taokaka couldn't be THAT bad, could it?</span></div></div>",

So ecstatic, in fact, that you could probably kiss the shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But you won't, of course, because kissing a strange old man would be really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, it would break the rules of the story on no gay stuff, so it's best for you to just get your butt to the dressing room and try on the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from your convoluted and fourth wall-breaking thoughts, you proceed to take the costume into the previously mentioned dressing room to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much to your surprise, it fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the \"costume\" was pretty much just a striped shirt, jean shorts, and a pair of shoes with socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and a hat. Cant forget the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And a franklin badge that looks super cool and authentic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you take a short moment to admire your own reflection for a few moments.<br>\r\nIn fact, you were SO invested in looking at your own face, that you failed to notice the soft glow coming from your franklin badge. This glow only became stronger and brighter, and by the time you noticed it, you had to shut your eyes tightly and hope that the apocalypse wasn't coming all because you tried on a Ness costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the light faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were wondering what you were going to do for Joel's birthday party. It was supposed to be a costume party, but you didn't have anything that would work. Then you notice a new store, and it was a costume store! Perfect! As you walked in, it seemed to have a huge selection! Even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd little man walked up to you, \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained to him about the party, and Joel being your best friend. \"I know that he was really into Stargate SG-1. I don't know a lot about it, but if you have a costume for that, it would be great. I would really like to make him happy for his birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at you oddly, then said, \"I have just the thing! And I can promise that you will please your friend!\" He chuckled oddly, \"Please follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed him through isles and around displays. When he stopped, he flipped through what seemed to be military style coveralls. You kind-of remembered that the show included people in the Air Force, so that seemed right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held up a package for you that contained a set of coveralls and a pair of military style boots. He smiled up at you, \"Did you say that you were on your way to the party?\" You confirmed it, \"Wonderful! You may change here if you like. After you pay of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the package. It had the name 'Sam Carter' on it. You shrugged. You had no idea of which character was which, but you could deal with being a 'Sam'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid the man, the started toward the dressing room. He confirmed your thoughts about being an odd guy as he said, \"Oh, and don't worry about the missing details. The costume will have made most of the adjustments by the time you get to your freind's house. The rest will happen soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head with a smile. This would be more than enough. And since the price was not bad, you didn't care about a few missing details. Putting the on the coverall was easy. It slipped right over all of your clothing. The boots fit perfectly, though they were annoying to lace up. When you were done, you were surprised at how comfortable the thing was. It seemed to fit snugly to your body, but didn't feel tight. And you were concerned that you would get too warm wearing it over your other clothes, but it was cool and comfortable. As you walked out, you held up your sneakers, \"Um, could you keep these for me for tonight? I can pick them up tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Of course. Though I doubt that you will want them back after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few blocks to Joel's house.It was strange, but the longer you wore the costume, the better it seemed to fit, and the more comfortable it felt. As you planned, you stopped at another store on the way.to get a present for Joel. You were sure the entire world was going crazy when the girl at the checkout said, \"Will that be all Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"That is everything, thank you.\" Did your voice sound funny? Maybe you were going bonkers too. You stopped there before, and you could have sworn that girl was smaller than she seemed to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you were at Joel's. As you reached up for the doorbell, it somehow seemed much higher. You MUST be going bonkers. Then Joel opened the door, and things got even more strange. He stood there staring at you, but you also stood there staring at him! A strange tingle went through your body as you brushed some blonde hair our of your eyes. Joel not only seemed much taller to you, but, well, he looked handsome! Even sexy! You knew you should be freaking out about feeling that way when looking at your friend, but somehow, it felt natural. Finally , you spoke first, \"Um, happy birthday Joel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and studied your face. Then he looked confused, \"Ken?\" Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled, and didn't notice how feminine it sounded, \"Yes. I take it that you like my costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"I love it! How did you get yourself to look so much like Sam though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped in, you realized that, somehow, you really were much shorter than Joel. More than that, the attraction you felt toward him grew. \"Um, the guy at the costume shop said the costume would make all the needed adjustments, so I guess it did.\" You do like it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuttered, \"I love it!\" He looked shy for some reason, \"Um, go ahead and join the party. Believe me, I will look for you as soon as I am done greeting all of my guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea why he acted that way, but for some reason, you considered it cute. You mingled a little bit,and wandered around. Things seemed normal for a costume party until you just happened to pass a mirror. As you looked in the mirror, you saw a pretty blonde woman wearing the same costume as you! But when you turned to look for her, you didn't see her anywhere. You looked back, and a confused woman looked back at you at the same time. You brushed some hair out of your eyes, and she did the same thing at exactly the same time! Wait! You waved your hand, touched your face. This was now possible! That woman in the mirror was YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed to the bathroom! You were glad nobody was in as you closed and locked the door! You rushed to the mirror. There she was again! There could be no question! Your hands went up to the bumps on your chest. You had real breasts! A quick feel between your legs confirmed your worst fears. You were a real woman! How could this happen? Even more, how could this happen and you not notice? You knew part of that. Somehow, it felt natural. Even normal. You knew you should be a male, but in spite of a mild shock at an unexpected change, you didn't feel the least bit odd at being female. No wonder Joel stared at you earlier! You giggled at remembering the look on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what do you do?</span></div></div>",

I'm going to try it on, but absolutely NO pictures.  Cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.  That's fine.  This is too funny,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the changing room and before too long, you've removed all of your clothing, save your underwear.  'Well, here goes nothing,' you think to yourself.  You start off by pulling up the black leotard type pants.  It's definitely a little cramped in certain areas, and loose in others.  You suppose that's just the difference between teenage boys and adult women.  After that, you slip on the pumps, which you couldn't even strap closed since your feet were so much larger than what the costume offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo standing there awkwardly, you see the bra that you have to put on. It was black and white zebra stripes, with an underwire and push-up effect.  It kind of made you laugh at just how trashy Peg Bundy was.  This costume was going to be a hit, you just knew it.  After fiddling around and getting the straps around your shoulders and the bra clips in the back, you grab the tacky blouse that came with the costume.  As you put it on, you notice it's tight in the shoulders, loose in the chest, and tight in the waist.  The final addition to the costume was the wig.  It was so ridiculous looking.  Bright red, and almost a foot tall.  You put the wig on... and that's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too noticable at first, but you could tell something was off.  It started at your feet, which felt like they were asleep.  Either the shoe was stretching to fit your feet or your feet were actually shrinking to fit the shoes.  You quickly realize that your feet were definitely loosing mass quickly.  And that was just the beginning.  Those awkwardly fitting stretch pants were about to fit perfectly on you.  It began with your feet and moved up to your calves.  Your leg hair fell out, and you felt the muscle in your legs weaken and get smaller.  Moving up, you felt your thighs fill out with some extra padding, which moved up to your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the biggest change you felt so far, you looked horried in the mirror as you saw your ass expand and not just fill the leotard, but stretch it out to to fail point.  Then it happened, immediately after your rear end exploded in size, you felt your front end get sucked in and change into something completely different.  Now from your waist down, you looked like Peg Bundy.  Your knees were close together, your rear end showed years of neglect, and you had lost your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation continued upward.  Your belly swelled minorly, just enough to show that he had spent years in front of the television watching his favorite soaps.  That bra that took so much time to put on quickly filled.  His breasts were pushed up and together and looked like a little ass was actually sitting on his chest.  He was definitely showing some significant old lady cleavage.  His shoulders narrowed, as did his waist.  He saw the hair fall right off his arms and then saw his arms loose much of their mass.  He looked in the mirror, and watched as the transformation finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his face begin to rearrange, which was horrifying to say the least.  His lips became much more full, and donned with red lipstick.  His check bones raised up, and his eyes changed from their normal brown to a bright blue.  His eyelashed became more full and his eyebrows thinned out.  Finally, he felt the wig on his head become real hair.  It was actually his hair now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling freaked out and regaining some of your composure, you decide that this whole experience isn't exactly for you, and it's high time you took this ridiculous get up off. You pull at the big bubble of red hair attached to your head, but it's become your real hair, and sends a great deal of pain into your head as you rip and tug at it.

You knew things were bad, and if you wanted to just look like Peggy Bundy you needed to get out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran/minced outside as fast as you could, your body moving like Peggy\u2019s would whether you wanted it to do so or not.  Outside you began to mince down the sidewalk as fast as you could, no clear destination in mind, you just knew you needed to get away from here until 11 p.m. on Halloween.  \u201cBut where am I gonna go for a week?\u201d you whined like Peggy would.  You realized you were carrying a clutch, one you were sure you hadn\u2019t had before, and nervously opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside you saw that your idea read \u201cMargaret \u2018Peggy\u2019 Bundy\u201d and read you home address as somewhere in Chicago.  Inside was also a series of credit cards in Peggy\u2019s name, some keys, condoms, makeup, and random cash.  About $400 dollars in cash.  \u201cI need to find someplace to stay for a few days,\u201d you decided.  You knew where there was a cheap motel, but it was going to take a few hours to get there on foot if you had to keep mincing on these outrageous heels.  You pondered whether you should use the cash to take a cab, \u201cBut I may need it later.  I\u2019m gonna have to walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but stare at everyone who you thought was staring at you.  You grabbed the sleeves of your cheetah skin blouse and pulled them closer, wrapping yourself in a hug.  \u201cWhy are they looking at me?\u201d you asked yourself and just like that you were answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but are you Katy Sagal?\u201d a man asked you, a smile on his face telling you he was ecstatic to possibly meet his favorite T.V. housewife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you replied breaking eye contact with him.  \u201cI\u2019m Peggy.  I mean Peggy.  I\u2019m Peggy,\u201d you took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m Peggy.  But not from the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d the man said disappointed and confused.  \u201cI must say you look a lot like Katy Sagal, you know dressed as Peggy.  Bundy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d you said a little ruefully.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.  No I get that.  Well sorry to bother you Peggy.  Have a good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too,\u201d you waved him both goodbye and off at the same time.  You continued to mince on your way to the hotel only to have the similar conversations with at least 6 more people.  One was a woman who seemed really disappointed that you weren\u2019t the Peggy Bundy she wanted you to be.  A quick assurance that you would at least try didn\u2019t help, and the knife was twisted a little more as you realized another con at being a teenage boy trapped as Peggy Bundy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the motel, you were absolutely beat. It was along, draining walk when your stride was less than a foot with each step.  The man who ran the motel seemed quite pleased to watch you drink down a few cups of water, though you suspected he was more pleased to watch that bead of sweat roll down your chest and into your cleavage.  You were pleased, and relieved, to see that the first of your credit cards went through and allowed you to stay here until Halloween.  \u201cHere you go sweetness,\u201d he handed you back your credit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you took it looking at him from the side of your eyes.  \u201cBut please don\u2019t call me sweetness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he leered and handed you the keys to your room, \u201cI just figured you were as sweet as you looked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I just figured you were as disappointing as your beds look,\u201d you smiled mockingly.  Apparently not only did you have Peggy\u2019s looks but her ability to emasculate men as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man simply sputtered out a retort of no consequence and you made your way to your room to think of your next move, only this time you minced with Peggy\u2019s characteristic confidence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A trashy kind of hot, but you were hot none the less.  You had never realized it from watching the show, but Peggy had big beautiful eyes, and some big DSL\u2019s.  \u201cI guess I just noticed how her breasts and hair were oversized,\u201d you told yourself as you stuck our tongue out at your reflection.  You decided to go back to looking at the thing that fascinated you the most, your new butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing, no matter how you turned or bent the black, Capri spandex pants highlighted every curve no matter what the angle.  And it always looked good!  \u201cI\u2019m gonna get goosed so much over the next few days,\u201d you frowned as you made that butt jiggle like jam.  For a second you fantasized a bout a Marcus transformed into Al Bundy caressing that masterpiece of a behind, but quickly shook it from your mind.  \u201cI wonder who he changed into?\u201d you asked quizzically to the empty room, but then figure with everything else going on with you it was probably best you didn\u2019t find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed your nose up and stuck your tongue out again while closing one eye.  \u201cMan, Katy Sagal was a piece of ass back in the door.  Still is,\u201d you corrected yourself.   Throwing your hands up you minced over to the bed and flopped down on it backwards.  \u201cWhat the Hell am I going to do?\u201d you asked the world as you stared at the ceiling.  \u201cAnd how do I get these pumps off?  They\u2019re killing my feet!\u201d You sat up and immediately scooted to the edge of the bed and tried your best to massage your feet through your heels.  It didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to watch T.V. to take your mind off all of this and reached for the remote, which was on the other side of the bed.  That\u2019s when you found out that having big boobs would be something to get used to as they got squished very uncomfortably, something you were not prepared for.  \u201cJeez that hurts!\u201d you rubbed your chest to get rid of the pain.  You stopped when you felt your nipples get hard.  \u201cNot ready for that,\u201d you quickly told yourself as you flipped on the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove and Marriage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove and Marriage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d you slapped your forehead.  According to the lower third of the screen it was a \u201cMarried with Children\u201d marathon, and lucky you was just in time for the season in which Peg was pregnant.  \u201cI can not watch me being pregnant,\u201d you sad turning off the T.V. and throwing the remote to the side.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to much going on to watch a pregnant me eat copious amounts as she trolls for sex.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to occupy some of this time with food, the greasy spoon diner down the street would be a good place for some chili cheese fries, and greasy food always made you feel between when you drink, so hopefully it will do the same for this, \u201cWhatever this is,\u201d you whispered as you grabbed your keys and your clutch.  A closing of the door signaled your goodbye to the room and hello to a whole new slew of uncomfortable situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mince down the sidewalk, drawing stares from all sorts of skeevy people as they watched your magnificent ass sway from side to side with each short step.  You sucked your teeth and turned your nose up at them, deciding to ignore them for being the perverts they are, and if you were truthful with yourself they were like the pervert you were just a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the diner you entered and was a little taken aback when so many eyes turned in recognition of you.  \u201cOne please,\u201d you told the maitre d and followed them to a booth towards the back of the diner.  You sat down and crossed your legs; your left one hanging off your right.  Looking over the menu as you bobbed your left leg up and down.  It felt nice, good even, and a smile formed on your face.  You started to bob your leg a little faster, and felt a little better for it.  \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m turning myself on,\u201d you yelped as you dropped the menu.  \u201cNo wonder she did this si much on the show!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to order hon?\u201d the waitress asked you, rousing you from the warm pleasurable feeling building between your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, chili cheese fries please,\u201d you ordered with an unintended dismissive tone.  \u201cAnd a beer if you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDomestic good for you princess?\u201d the waitress asked annoyed with how you seemed preoccupied with your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, in a cold glass please,\u201d you answered as you continued to stare at your crotch as you wagged your leg even faster.  All of a sudden that comfort food didn\u2019t seem so important, it was like you were entering into a whole new world as Peggy Bundy.  \u201cOh, waitress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah hon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s come up,\u201d you smiled lecherously, \u201cYou think I can get all that to go?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that your spandex Capris and underwear were pulled down to mid thigh and you didn\u2019t have those urges anymore spoke volumes as to what just happened.  And it solved a question about how you were going to go to the bathroom over the next few days.  You may not have been able to take your pants and underwear off but you could get them down enough so that you wouldn\u2019t mess yourself.  Small victories on top of big ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid the final fry in-between your cherry red lips and into your mouth.  You licked the chili from you finally manicured fingers and cooed in satisfaction the second time in the last thirty minutes.  You pulled up your pants and underwear and a das realization dawned on you, \u201cI\u2019m soon going to need something that vibrates.\u201d  But where could you get something like that?  \u201cMy sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at first nervous about this plan, but it dawned on you that no one in your neighborhood would recognize you if you look like Peggy Bundy!  It was weird; it dawned on you as you minced your way towards home that you never realized just how horny Peggy was.  I mean they joked about it on the show, but you didn\u2019t realize that pleasuring yourself with a vibrator would soon become the only thing you could think about.  \u201cI\u2019m amazed she could even function if this is how she always felt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrived home, something you would have never dared just a few hours ago, but you also never felt this sexually aroused before either.  All you could think about was getting that vibrator.  You checked to see neither of your parents cars were there so it should be just a quick snatch and go.  You knew where your older sister kept her black, rubber coated companion and she never locked her window either.  So getting in threw her window grabbing it and getting out of there should take all of two minutes.  \u201cThank God our house is a single floor,\u201d you muttered as you stepped onto the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when you learned that the heel of a pair of pumps will sink into ground very easily.  Bad enough you minced everywhere you went, but now you had to move extra slowly so as not to get stuck.  \u201cThis sucks,\u201d you frowned, but the rewards made you smile like Peggy herself when she would pull upstairs for what she needed the most.  It took you way longer than you had originally thought to get to your sister\u2019s room, but you finally got there and slowly slid the window open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put one trembling foot inside and then ducked you head under the window and pulled the rest of yourself through.  You quickly minced to your sister\u2019s dresser drawer and found what you were looking for.  Licking your lips you placed it in your clutch and made your way back to the window.  You had one leg out and were just beginning to duck your head when you heard, \u201cWho the Hell are you lady!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your mother and you whipped you head around to see her; eyes wide, a look of fear on your face, a stutter trying to form words that was stuck in your throat, \u201cUh, uh, uh\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d your mother cocked her head and put her hands on her hips, \u201cAre you Peggy Bundy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you said as quickly as possible and scrambled out the window as fast as you could.  You left foot got hooked on the windowsill and you fell face first onto the ground.  Your mother rushed to the window to grab you and find out why you were there, just as you had made it to your feet.  You briefly made eye contact and began to run off, getting your heels stuck in the ground with every step and disrupting your balance, but you continued to move forward.   \u201cWaaa!  Wah!  WAAA!\u201d you screamed in Peggy high pitched way as you tried to get to the sidewalk, and it only got wore as your mother stormed out the front door.  Mincing away from her as fast as you could while looking over your shoulder at her led to you slipping in some mud and falling face first in the mud spraying it everywhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were convinced you were caught as you mother got with in a few feet of you.  You wiped the mud from your face and flicked it away making your mother take a step back.  Peggy\u2019s smile shoed up on your face again, and you threw a little mud at her as you made your way to your knees and just as you had hoped your mother took a few steps back.  You got to your feet with an armful of mud and your clutch under the other.  \u201cYou come back here,\u201d your mother yelled at you sternly.  You just threw a few more mud balls as you back down the sidewalk and your mother was held at bay.  \u201cI\u2019m warning you!  You flung the mud and turned to do the thing that was the closest thing to running in your ability and hopefully escape.  Even if it was as a muddy mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use, your knowledge of the neighborhood and your head start let you slip down a back alley and into a neighbor\u2019s back yard where you hid for a good twenty minutes.  When you were finally sure you smiled smugly and began to head back to the motel, happy as a Peggy in mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wandering back to the hotel you were drawing stares, as few people had ever witnessed Peggy Bundy covered in mud before.  \u201cHow am I supposed to clean up when I can\u2019t take these clothes off?\u201d you wondered.  You wiped some of the mud from your arm and was shocked to see that you had completely knocked the dirt from your clothes (costume?) leaving it look just like it did when you had first put it on.  A few more wipes and your chest was clean, and your loins a little engorged from running your hands over your breasts.  It didn\u2019t take long until you had completely cleaned yourself of the mud, well everywhere but your face but you took care of that when your returned to your motel room and was able to wash up in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but stare at Peggy\u2019s face in the mirror again.  You didn\u2019t notice it last time but her, your, make up didn\u2019t smudge.  No matter what you did it stayed perfect on your face, especially those cherry red lips of yours.  You were getting turned on again, and as you looked back at your clutch a giant smile crawled across your face.  \u201cI can always stare at myself later,\u201d you smirked before mincing over to get your new best friend.  You spent the next hour or so getting to know your friend better, and all you could definitively say at the end is that he definitely put a smile on your face. \u201cNow, I get why Peggy smoked after sex on the T.V. show,\u201d you giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided the best way to pass the time, before you got together with your friend again and that was going to be soon, was to watch T.V.  You grabbed the remote turned on the T.V. and heard it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove and Marriage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove and Marriage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get into watching me for a little while,\u201d you smiled in that Peggy Bundy way.  You hadn\u2019t yet noticed how your mannerisms and behaviors were slowly becoming more and more Peggy\u2013like all the time, and you hadn\u2019t even been Peggy for a full day yet.  You watched Married with Children for an episode or two, paying close attention to whenever Peggy appeared on screen.  You were barely aware that you would rub your thighs together more rapidly whenever she appeared on screen.  \u201cOh wow,\u201d you moaned gently, \u201cI need to touch base with my new friend again.  Wow!  Is it always gonna be like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you became reacquainted for about 45 minutes, before he blew your hair back.  You quickly cleaned up, pulled your pants up and decided to se if he really blew your hair back.  Could you get your hair blown back?  You minced over to the mirror in the bathroom, and sure enough that towering red bouffant of yours was still looking perfect.  Not one hair out of place.  \u201cThat can\u2019 be right,\u201d you frowned quizzically.  You then reached up to your big bouffant and sunk your fingers into it.  You then proceeded to shake it and muss it up as much as you can, and when you pulled your hands away you couldn\u2019t believe it.  \u201cNot one hair!\u201d  Everything was still in place, again, not one hair out of place.  \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou minced back to the bed while fluffing your bouffant, even though it didn\u2019t need to.  You were feeling good about being Peggy Bundy, an idea that horrified you mere hours ago.  In fact you were feeling so good about it you decided spend some time with your friend.  When you heard that buzzing you couldn\u2019t help but smile lustily.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right now you stood in the convenience mart across the street from your motel and were alternately staring at the microwave and the burrito in your hand.  \u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure about this,\u201d you bit our lip.  You remembered Peggy\u2019s cooking skills from the show and worried that you had them too, since all the other qualities of Peggy were slowly showing up in you.  \u201cBest not to chance burning this place down,\u201d you said aloud, which seemed to alarm the Korean storeowner.  After a heated exchange with him in which he threw you out you decided all on your own to just leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still learning your new body and assumed you normal ability to eat was also the capacity for Peggy Bundy\u2019s body to eat.  And based off that assumption you minced your way over to George\u2019s Home Style Buffet, and all you can eat restaurant for cheap.  And with limited cash you were all about cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went with an initial plate of collared greens, broccoli, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and the meatloaf they served that you really dug.  You ate quickly throwing you arm around the food like you were guarding it.   The only time you looked up is when the cute waiter dropped off your soda.  You gave him a quick Peggy Bundy smile, showing the vegetables stuck in your teeth and he smiled back nervously.  You smiled smugly to yourself, thinking how he totally wanted to bang you.  \u201cTotally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up going back for two more plates, the usual amount you would eat if you were going to eat here normally.  The problem was that you weren\u2019t a growing teenage boy anymore but the beautiful Peggy Bundy, and she couldn\u2019t put way as much food as you normally could.  So now you sat there stuffed, your belly taut and full.  You groaned in discomfort as seat rolled down your forehead.  You thanked God that your Capri pants were a very stretchy spandex material.  You saw the waiter again and even though he didn\u2019t make eye contact you couldn\u2019t help but stare at him, \u201cI don\u2019t care how stuffed I am I could still eat you up!\u201d  You began to rub your thighs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back in your seat and rubbed your full belly, patting it every now and then.  Some very satisfied belches accompanied a few of your pats.  \u201c<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>BUURP</b></font>!  Excuse me,\u201d you giggled at the other customers who were watching the spectacle you were making of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid your bill and got up to leave.  You were still full and your belly taut making you walk with a slight waddle.  On your way out you saw the waiter and decided to approach him.  You cornered him close to the door, putting one arm against the wall and blocking him form getting away.  \u201cHey, how are you doing?\u201d you asked suggestively, your full belly poking out and bumping into his abs.  You didn\u2019t care.  He didn\u2019t answer right away so you took the opportunity to press him further, just like the Peggy Bundy on T.V. would.  \u201cYou know I could just eat you up,\u201d you made a playful biting motion towards him as you twirled some of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled weakly at you as he edged away from you, trying to get you to move your arm out of the way.  \u201cNo!  No, no, no, no sweet thing, don\u2019t you go any where!  Just listen to what old Peggy has to say!\u201d you pleaded with him.  He stopped and took a deep breath; he could feel you push your potbelly further into him, along with the edge of your breasts.  \u201cJust let me say this, let me say this one thing.\u201d  You opened you mouth to say something to close the deal when you body answered for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>FFFFFFRRRRRTTTTTTTT</b></font>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you stared at each other, neither wanting to admit to the fart you had just ripped into existence.  The silence just continued to grow as the gas you had let loose began to make its presence know to not only you two, but everyone around you. but your eye and his had remained locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a motel nearby we can go to,\u201d you smiled at him demurely, despite the bits of green leafy pieces still stuck in your brilliant smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But this was now, and when he went to take off you pants and underwear he found he could only get them down to mid-thigh.  This stopped you from getting your legs too far apart, and no matter how you tried the two of you could not get into a position that the little space between your legs would allow for any pleasurable coitus.  You finally had to settle for some fun the waiter could provide using his hand, but you had to provide him some oral sex first to convince him of this.  You ended up not quite ahead in this deal.  You readied yourself for bed, with one thought in your head, \u201cI need to have a talk with someone tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly morning you found yourself mincing back across town, only stopping when you arrived outside the costume shop that had, well not destroyed but maybe, changed your life.  You took a deep breath and psyched yourself up to go inside, \u201cYou can do this, your Peggy Bundy!\u201d  You put your head down, you placed your hand on the door, pushed it open, and entered with just a little courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Googaley Moogaley,\u201d the Wizard threw his hands up as he saw you approach him.  \u201cI told you!  You need to come back between 11 pm and 12 midnight on Halloween!  I cannot.  Help.  You.  Until.  Then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I need to somehow get these clothes off!\u201d you yelled at him as you grabbed your blouse and tried to pull it off, but of course you didn\u2019t even pop a stitch on it.  \u201cI can\u2019t just wear these clothes!  There\u2019s got to be some way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot change you back into a boy until -!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to change into a boy,\u201d you sneered.  You smiled to the other customers who were now listening to every word you said.  \u201cHey everyone,\u201d you laughed,  \u201cNot a big deal, just go back to what you were doing!\u201d you said playfully.  You were happy to see them quick to follow your advice and begin to ignore you again.  You leaned in towards the Wizard and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a boy, I just want to take these clothes off so I can, how do I say, be more Peggy Bundy-ish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wizard\u2019s eye lit up with understanding, \u201cReally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you shook your head a little.  \u201cThis body is more than just looks, and some of these\u2026feeling\u2026are making me desperate for more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can help you with that,\u201d the Wizard nodded approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank God,\u201d you laughed, \u201cMaybe afterwards I\u2019ll even pick up some clothes from your store!\u201d  You looked around at all the clothes, and all the transformation that you could possibly go through flashed before your eyes.  \u201cOr not,\u201d you laughed again, backpedaling.  The Wizard was only partially amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you need something to remove your clothes and make up,\u201d the Wizard stroked his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d you shook your head at the Wizard.  \u201cLet\u2019s leave my makeup and hair alone, you bounced while fluffing your bouffant.  \u201cThe way my make up is applied is the way an artist applies paint to a canvas; it looks magnificent, makes all who see it happier, and can only truly be done correctly one time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, gotcha!\u201d the Wizard shakes his head understanding exactly what you wanted and what you needed.   He looked around the store and finally over his shoulder until he found what he was looking for.  Grabbing it off a display he handed it over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA ring with a pearl?\u201d you asked perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust slip it on,\u201d he gestured to the ring, \u201cand slip those off,\u201d he gestured to your clothes.  \u201cHead into the changing room if you don\u2019t trust me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the ring and bit your lip before eyeing the changing room.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it,\u201d he waved you off.  \u201cGo ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou minced over the door and tentatively opened the door.  You looked at the Wizard, who smiled at you, and weakly smiled back.  You entered and steeled yourself.  \u201cThis better not turn me into some fat, farting woman or something equally stupid!\u201d you growled as you clothes your eyes and slipped the ring over your left ring finger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes one by one and looked in the mirror.  No changes.  Now you had to test your make up, you tried smudging it with your thumb, and it didn\u2019t move.  A quick handful of hair was pulled and released, and everything was right where it started, not one was out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to see if it performed as advertised,\u201d you said skeptically.  You sat down on the bench and got your feet into position.  You used the tip of your shoe to push the back of the other one down.  You almost clapped in happiness when the shoe fell from your feet and clamored on the ground.  \u201cOh my God!  Oh my God!\u201d  You jumped to your feet, lopsided now that your one heel was off.  You started bouncing up and down clapping like mad, \u201cOh my God!\u201d  You threw open the door to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>THIS IS A GAME CHANGER PEOPLE!

You ha no more credit on that one card, but you at lest looked good, so, \u201cWorth it!\u201d  You smiled wider at the sound of the click clack your new boot heels left on the concrete.  You looked so good in the over the knee leather boots, and the shiny spandex black disco pants made your ass look even more desirable than even your last pants.  You wore a cropped top long sleeve, cowled cheetah print top underneath a big, black, fur coat with white trim that came down to mid-thigh.  You were on cloud 9, a brand new Peggy Bundy thank to that ring.  Who would have though 3 dollars would be the beginning of you amazing adventure into the world of Married With Children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blew some kisses to a few men as you passed them on the way back to your motel, a wink or two for the really cute ones.  You were embracing the fact that you could dress anyway you wanted to now, that you could really be Peggy Bundy now. You practically danced up the stairs of the motel to your room and threw the bags on the bed.  You looked in the mirror and fluffed your towering bouffant before coming to a decision, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to a bar, and Peggy Bundy is gonna land herself a man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had completely surrendered yourself  to the costume.  You started to think of yourself as Peggy Bundy, you wanted to be Peggy Bundy in every detail you could be, you needed to be more Peggy Bundy than Katy Sagal herself.  And this was all within 24 hours of putting on the costume as a joke, Hell 24 hours ago you were desperate to be out of this costume and back to your normal teenage boy self.  Now you doubted you were going to go back to the costume shop between 11 and midnight on Halloween to get the costume removed.  You were currently okay being Peggy, truthfully more than okay, and you were so sure that being Peggy was the right thing for you that you were ready to let a man inside of you.  \u201cIt\u2019s been an insane 24 hours!\u201d you laughed as you waved goodbye to your reflection to start your hunt for a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever having been in a bar you were excited when the bouncer wanted to see your ID.  You pinched his butt as you walked by him and into the bar all excited to find your first conquest as a woman.  And then you were promptly deflated when you saw a handful of men drinking quietly by themselves, stinking of beer and sadness.  You shook your head gently as you realized the first rule of getting laid; never go to the bar at 2:30 p.m.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing exactly what to do, you sat down to the guy you judged to be the most attractive.  You ordered a drink, which you had heard in movies that women would order to cut loose; a long island iced tea.  Never having actually drunk alcohol before you took a deep breath and gulped down as much as you could.  And you felt it right away.  \u201cThish was pretty good,\u201d you told the disinterested man next to you before gulping down the rest.  \u201cDelishious!  Anudder please!\u201d  You were a real lightweight.  \u201cPeggy\u2019s a light weight.\u201d  The guy turned away from you.  \u201cWhatever, you ain\u2019t the only fish in da sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and more men had come into the bar, and you definitely had some sweet choices to choose form for your first time, some you would even brag about later.  Too bad you were falling down drunk.  You would\u2019ve looked even more of a mess if it wasn\u2019t for the magic that kept your makeup and big red bouffant perfect at all times.  You were barely able to sit on your stool, your coat was half off, and you had to practically lie on the bar in order to keep any balance.  But you were primed and down to clown, and you weren\u2019t going to let something like being drunk stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid off your stool, almost falling down, and stomped up to the man and his two friends you were most attracted to, \u201cHey cutie, you look eat enough to delicious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he asked you as he looked to his friends for help.  They weren\u2019t going to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping we could, you know,\u201d you ran a finger down his chest, \u201cget to knows each other?  A little &lt;BURP&gt; bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady-!\u201d he began before being cut off by his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you Peggy Bundy?  You are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d his friend asked.  You smiled; glad to be mistaken for Peggy once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shurtainly am Peggy Bundy,\u201d you gestured to the friend, spilling some of your drink on him.  You then tried to move closer to the one you wanted to have sex with, but tripped slightly and ended up pressing your breasts into him.  \u201cOopsh,\u201d you smiled seductively and winked at him as you dragged your breasts down his chest slightly before taking a stutter step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend spoke up, \u201cDude, it\u2019s Peggy Bundy.  You totally have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other friend concurred, \u201cTotally. Peggy Bundy, man.  You jerked off to her all the time as a kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?\u201d you asked fluffing your hair with one hand.  \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he relented \u201cLet\u2019s do this.  Bathroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you scrunched your face at the idea.  \u201cI have a motel.  Close by.\u201d  That was good enough for him, and you threw some money on the bar to pay for your drinks and grabbed him by the hand.  As you dragged him behind you, he kind of holding you up because you still had trouble standing, you thought to yourself, \u201cBest three dollars I ever spent.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was not.  I so was not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hands shaking you went to the bathroom and showered.  Stepping out of the shower you took note that your hair and makeup was still perfect as per the magic.  You looked at the ring you wore, the one that allowed you to change clothes, and sighed.  \u201cIt seemed like such a good idea at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dressed in a pair of red spandex Capri pants and a white zebra print cowl necked sleeveless shirt.  You put on a ton of bangles and a string of pearls followed by a black shrug.  After slipping on a pair of black and white booties you looked at yourself in the mirror, unable to accept what you had done.  You frowned even harder as the sight of yourself was turning you on again.  \u201cI\u2019m just always so horny,\u201d you grumbled as you began your rub your thighs together.  \u201cOh screw this!  I need a drink and a taco!\u201d  You grabbed your cheetah print coat and threw it on as you stormed out of your hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomped down the street, your oversized handbag swinging back and forth occasionally hitting someone, and you did not care.  You only stopped you self-loathing fueled rampage when you arrived at Fiesta Familia, a Mexican themed family restaurant.  Entering you sat at the bar and slammed your bag own on the bar.  The bartender came up to you with a smile and opened his mouth as if to asked how you were when you simply shouted at him, \u201cTequila and a taco!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d he said confused at what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTah!  Coe!\u201d you yelled again, and he scampered off out of your sight.  You took a handful of the complimentary chips and shoved them between your cherry red lips.  You frowned as you put an elbow on the bar and used that arm\u2019s hand to prop up your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that last night,\u201d you lamented as the thought of his junk made you rub your thighs together in arousal.  IT wasn\u2019t that you were ashamed of or angry at having had sex, as the actual act made you purr like a horny kitten, but the act also made you realize that you were still a guy trapped in the body of T.V.\u2019s number one trailer trash MILF.  It didn\u2019t help that the idea of guys and guys\u2019 junks still made you flustered and sometimes even wet.  The tequila showed up in its shot glass and you threw it back.  You shot up to a sitting position, your eyes bugged out and you mouth making the same \u2018O\u2019 a blow up doll\u2019s mouth did.  \u201cAnother,\u201d you panted and gestured to the bar tender, \u201cAnd a Coke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your taco finally showed up, you had three little shot glasses in front of you, all empty.  As you bit into the delicious treat you stared at the other customers through the mirror.  There were some fine looking boys out there behind you enjoying their dinners with friends and families.  There were even more amazingly beautiful women having fun.  And both groups were making you ache with need.  \u201cBeing a perpetually horny Peggy Bundy is really beginning to suck!\u201d you slurred ever so slightly.  You spun around on your stool and used your arms to brace yourself against the bar.  You stared out into the crowd.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And thanks to the magi that had cursed you not one hair was out of place.  Still it was always good to stare at your reflection, a reflection of Married with Children\u2019s Peggy Bundy.  \u201cI\u2019m so hot,\u201d you slurred as you smirked at yourself, and you were.  You were the gorgeous embodiment of trashy 90\u2019s America, with a pussy that was sweeter than the bon-bons you now had a sweet tooth for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you are Peggy,\u201d your friend Andrew laughed at you.  You back handed him and smiled at him.  You had missed your friends, even if it had only been a few days.  \u201cYou know Marcus is till pissed at you since you left him when he got changed into Buck the dog.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s been happy enough to lick his nuts non-stop since then,\u201c you said witheringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Two Hours Earlier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled into the street, shaky on your heels as you had the better part of a bottle of tequila inside you and only one taco to soak it up.  \u201cTah Coe!\u201d you yelled at the stranger who passed by you, before shaking our booty at him enticing.  It was harder to ignore your sexual urges as Peggy Bundy when you were drunk.  \u201cI miss being a boy,\u201d you whined, \u201cI miss being me.  I miss my friends.\u201d  And that\u2019s when you made your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just go visit my friends, that\u2019s all,\u201d you shrugged.  \u201cI\u2019ll go over to Andrew\u2019s house first, he\u2019ll do anything a girl would ask him,, so as hot ass Peggy Bundy he\u2019ll be putty in my palms.\u201d  With your plan decided on you started mincing your way across town to Andrew\u2019s house.  You figured you\u2019d get him to come outside tell him a few things only you would know and he\u2019d believe you were his best friend.  \u201cYou know typical body switch movie stuff,\u201d you slurred with a smile.  \u201cHow hard could it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it was so simple to convince me what happened,\u201d Andrew told you as he pinched your ass on the way to the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop pinching my ass!\u201d you hit him a few times to emphasize the point.  \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to a lady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven when she\u2019s my best friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d you yelled at him with Peggy\u2019s shrill tone.  \u201cJust because I\u2019m Peggy Bundy for the time being doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m cool with men groping me!\u201d   You hadn\u2019t the nerve to tell him how you had lost your virginity last night as Peggy.  Some things were still rough to talk about and even admit to yourself.  \u201cSo what movie do you want to see when we get to the theater?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever one\u2019s empty enough for us to make out in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped your mincing walk and put your hands on your hips, \u201cWe are not making out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Andrew asked jokingly, but the underlying tone wasn\u2019t really a joke.  He was attracted to you as Peggy, as most straight males would be considering how gorgeous Peggy Bundy is, and legitimately wanted to know why you wouldn\u2019t crush your body against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it will look like I\u2019m making out with my son?\u201d you shot back.  \u201cOr how about, no one would believe you\u2019d ever be able to get a girl -correction- woman like me?  Or my personal favorite that no one would believe that the half pack of lifesavers in your pocket could ever get a real woman\u2019s interest?\u201d you told him bitingly following it up with Peggy\u2019s condescending smile.  Andrew just got red in the face and lowered his eye to you.  Now you felt bad so you tried to let him off the hook,.  You began your mincing walk and quickly moved in front of him, \u201cNow come on, I don\u2019t want to miss the previews and you don\u2019t want to miss the chance to watch my magnificent can wiggle back and forth in front of you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was all action and spectacle, absolutely no romance.  Hell, you\u2019d settle for a slightly pornographic sex scene at this moment.  You were also unaware that your attitudes and interests were once again beginning to mirror T.V. Peggy\u2019s.  You didn\u2019t realize it but unless something happened to jolt you acutely aware of your situation, something like having sex with a man for the first time when you were really a boy yourself, then you would slowly act more and more like Peggy, develop her interests more and more like Peggy, desire sex like more and more like Peggy.  Well no one could actually desire sex more than T.V.\u2019s Peggy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought the carton of popcorn to your sexy mouth and upended it letting whatever was left over slide down into your mouth.  Growing bored you started to look around the theater for something interesting, and thought you had failed to find anything until your eyes landed on Andrew\u2019s crotch.  With those skinny jeans on you could tell he was a decent size.  \u201cAnd I have an empty carton...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d Andrew asked without taking his eyes off the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d you smiled as you punched a hole in the bottom of the carton.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he responded not really caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then placed the carton on his lap and reached down into it, and before he could say anything unzipped his pants.  You reached inside and pulled his dick out and started jacking him off. You just smiled smugly at him as he looked over to see if this was really happening to him.  \u201cWhat can I say?  I\u2019m bored!\u201d  You worked Andrew over for a little while letting him get close, but teasing him on that edge for way longer than you should have.  Watching him practically drool on himself you finally took pity on him and let him finish, pulling your hand out just in time to keep it clean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned as Andrew spasmed in pleasure.  Now you were jealous that you didn\u2019t get yours.  A typical reaction from T.V.\u2019s Peggy Bundy, and now it was a perfect reaction for you.  You tossed him some napkins, which landed on top of his mess in the carton.  You stood up and told Andrew, \u201cClean yourself up, we\u2019re going!\u201d and then stormed out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m mad!\u201d you whined in the truest form of Peggy\u2019s voice you had ever used.  Her mannerisms had really gripped you at this point, and in an interesting twist it seems the hornier Peggy is the more bitingly sarcastic she gets.

Al?  Al where are you, Al?\u201d You minced around the area looking for a husband that was not there.  \u201cAl where are you?

Even the ones that would normally repulse you as Peggy had something about them, usually the outline of an incredibly he bulge.  Suffice it to say you only knew one thing that could satisfy you at this moment instead of a man, \u201cBon-bons!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a trip to the corner store a few boxes of the delicious treats were yours to have.

You had eaten every last bon-bon from every last box that you had bought.  \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be one more,\u201d you whined as you started tearing the boxes apart looking for another little sugary treat.  \u201cOh, poo,\u201d you pouted when nothing could be found.  You flopped back in your chair and sulked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon distracted by your belly.  After eating all those candies you had a small potbelly.  And on Peggy Bundy\u2019s extremely thin frame a small potbelly really stuck out.  You playfully slapped it, watching it wobble back and forth.  \u201cHmm.\u201d  You smacked it again and again watched it wobble.  You did this a few more times putting a big beautiful smile on your beautiful face.  You eventually started rubbing it, moving your hands back and forth over it.  \u201cOoooh!  That feels nice,\u201d you cooed.  You playfully slapped it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUURRPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!

Thank god the ring made it so you could take your clothes off now.  You took off your clothes and crawled under the sheets.  You held up your friend and smiled at him, before he disappeared under the sheets.  He began to hum a tune for you and you seemed to get very excited for it, strangely enough you became even more excited when his humming became muffled.  That\u2019s when you decided to show your appreciation for him extra loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact you were under a magic curse this whole situation would have looked like you had lost your mind.  As it was Married with Children became a little more cartoonish in later seasons, with fourth wall breaking moments, and moments where things would talk, like the statue that told Peggy to buy it.  so it wasn\u2019t any great strain on the magic to make you think your little friend was calling out to you, but it was still strange behavior none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost track of time playing with your friend under the sheets, but he morning rays of the sun breaking the horizon tipped you off that it was sun up the next day.  You pulled your friend free and smiled at him lovingly, \u201cYou sure do now how to show a woman a good time!\u201d  Putting him back you made your way to the bathroom to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided you weren\u2019t ready to become better acquainted with the shower massager after the number your friend had done on you, and cleaned the grime from amazing boy, paying special care to your under-boobs and undercarriage.  Drying your hair and body off you looked in the mirror and saw that your hair and makeup were still immaculate.  \u201cThanks to the curse,\u201d you smiled.  \u201cThough can I really call it a curse anymore?\u201d  You wondered.  It was also a sign that your friend had kind of reset your thinking; you no longer were thinking of yourself as Peggy Bundy anymore and lost in that delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should call Andrew up,\u201d you thought as you slipped on a pair of black capris, red pointed toe pumps.  \u201cI bet he\u2019d like to catch a movie or something,\u201d you mused as you slipped into a cheetah skin faux wrap dress that came down to mid-thigh.  \u201cI should go and see him!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I get so horny sometimes, and when I do I start to become Peggy even more than I am now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?

I think I was looking for Al Bundy earlier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were asking where he was when you were insulting me,\u201d Andrew mumbled while lost in thought over the matter.  \u201cSo how do you snap back to being you?

You also realize you have the flabby arms of a woman who spends all day on the couch, and pose little to no threat to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... there must be something you can do for my bud here.\" your friend says rather diplomatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper squints at him, more receptive to his kinder approach. \"Well, alright.

Get me out of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to be a woman? It can be a lot of fun!\" he smiles. You shoots him an icy glare, and he gets the idea. He pulls out a switchbox of sorts, a flat black panel full of buttons, and pulls the antenna out of the top of it. He twists some knobs, adjusts some sliders, then points the device at you. After clicking a button, you feel your body beginning to shift in different directions. Your breasts begin to pull away from your body, and you feel them press against your skin as it flattens out. Your large booty feels as if it's deflating, your hips straight out to their original form. The big mess of red hair on your head seeps out of your skull, turning back into a wig. You breath a sigh of relief as you feel all your parts settling themselves back into place, but, something was still amiss....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the mirror, and see yourself as a male still dressed in the Peg Bundy costume. You still have the same body shape and curves as before, but as you grab your ass and chest, you feel that they're fake breastforms and hip enhancers, not real at all. Your face still has crazy overdone makeup on it, but it's clearly your features set atop a drag queen body. You laugh, so does your friend, and you decide to give the costume back and head out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to go is the wig. You pull at it, but the cap grabs tight to your head and won't let go. You pull again, and again it refuses to budge. You stumble closer to the mirror in your heels and lift up your bangs, trying to pick and feel at the wig cap, but it stays stuck to your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you say, moving on to the breasts. You tug at them, but the breast forms cling to your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" you yell out, trying to rip the shirt from your body. It resists your attempts, and clings to you like a snake swallowing a helpless victim. Nothing will budge, the costume is stick firmly to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down son,\" the shopkeeper says. \"I thought you didn't want to be a woman anymore. Is this what you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you yell out. \"I want to get out of this stupid outfit and get home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already, you can take the outfit off in a week. Between 11pm and midnight on Halloween. No ifs, ands, or buts... although you certainly still have quite the butt still, even if it's fake.\" he giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly grab all over your body, trying to find a zipper or a way out, anything. Hope dwindles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't go asking me to change you again, that took a lot of power to help you out, so you're staying that way. If there's nothing else I can help you with, you can leave now. Consider the costume on the house, due to the inconvenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your friend for any sort of support, but he seems to find the situation hilarious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, but you seriously look ridiculous in that get up. It's only a week, just lay low for a while.\" He laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He crosses his arms across his big fake chest, and stares in horror at the large cloud of fabric hanging off his waist. He goes to scratch his head, and his hand shoots out in shock, and he runs his hands over his massive hairdo and sees exactly how big it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go home, come back at 11pm on Halloween, and everything will be cool.\" you say. \"Just like he said, we're betting each other $100 who can wear these outfits the longest.

You have no problem fitting through the door, but your friend immediately gets stuck when the bulk of his gown won't fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, help me!\" he cries out, almost losing his balance. \"I'm stuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab his hands and lean back, pulling as hard as you can. The fabric slowly seeps out the door, and eventually you pull him free, lose your balance, and fall on the sidewalk. Your huge padded ass breaks your fall, and you break your friend's fall as he lands on top of you, covering you both in a big froth of crinoline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me!\" you yell out, your big fake breasts mashed against each other. \"I'm TRYING!\" he says, squirming and fighting the maze of the wedding gown. He finally rolls off you, and you get to your feet, the heels making it amazingly difficult to do so. He sits in the middle of the sidewalk like a jilted bride, pouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get out of here.\" you say. As you're about to leave, a car full of girls pulls up beside you, and they're very excited to see you both dressed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD!\" one of the girls screams. \"You guys are SO CUTE!

The shopkeeper knows this, and simply laughs it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend shuffles toward him, but is hindered by the huge bulk of the skirt, and can't get anywhere near the counter. He grunts and pulls, but he can't squeeze in enough to reach him. Frustrated, he winds up and throws the bat at the shopkeeper, hitting him square in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!\" he cries out, grabbing his skull in pain. Your friend looks satisfied for a moment, until he sees blood oozing out from his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you little bastards!\" he yells, his jolly playful demeanor suddenly becoming very intense and terrifying.

Hoping that he was going to turn you back and ban you from the store, you breath a short sigh of relief. Instead, he hammers a big red button, and in an instant, the entire costume store vaporizes around you into nothingness. You're left in an empty lot with your friend, and wouldn't you know, you're both still wearing your outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big crowd of people have begun to gather, as they just witnessed a store vanish into mid air. Their astonishment turns to laughter when they see both of you in your outrageous costumes, and the cellphones and cameras come out on cue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot a panicked look at your friend, and again look over your body. You pull at the front of the shirt, but whatever is keeping it on your body won't let go. The wig stays put, the makeup won't rub off, and your friend is finding his wedding dress to be quite permanent as well. You both scream in terror, and push past the big crowd that's formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both take ages to get home, your heels making it hard to walk, and your friend walking a fraction of the speed he usually does, considering the weight and size of his dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we need to get out of these stupid things!\" he says to you, giving his breasts a pull. \"We have school tomorrow!

You stop and look, and the dress is still as new as it was when he was first stuck in it. You turn the saw to your breasts, and again sparks fly, but it doesn't make a scratch.

They laugh, are confused, then horrified to find you're trapped in the Peg Bundy outfit. They take you to numerous doctors and specialists, but no one can figure out how you got into the outfit, or how to get you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your life has turned into a nightmare, your friend's has turned into a living hell. There is no way he can function in the real world wearing such a huge dress, and his parents have decided the best way to turn this into a positive experience is to take him on the talk show circuit. He is in tears at the idea of it, but they tell him he can live on the street in drag, or earn some money on TV. He spends the next year or so in the tabloids, millions of people laughing and confused by his story. No one believes the outfit is permanently attached, which prompts people to try ripping his wig off, a constant reminder of the permanence of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up every day for the rest of your life, head into the bathroom, and see Peg Bundy staring back at you. </span></div></div>",

Like the others, it's on a special hanger rather different from those used for ordinary clothes, because like them it looks like a human skin with no flesh or bone inside it!  The hanger includes a foam wig block to give the head shape, and the wire hook from which the who thing hangs comes out through the slit in the costume's neck.  These costumes all have the healthy look of normal, living human skin -- at least what you can see of them, because the clothes that go with them are hung over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually you have a pretty good look at the  false skin of the Kelly suit, because the clothes are a sleeveless and somewhat stretchy gray blouse and a pair of very short cut-off jeans -- those are safety-pinned to the blouse so they don't fall off.  You get to see the suit's fleshless arms and legs pretty well. The pink sneakers that go with the outfit are in a plastic bag clipped to the suit's left ankle.  It's all rather creepy: this simply iS Christina Applegate as Kelly, with a set of typically Kelly clothes, apparently wearing ordinary girl makeup rather than television makeup -- just that she's got nothing inside her skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little paper tag on the wire, dangling near the slit that starts at Kelly's chin and disappears into her fleshless and deflated cleavage, reads \"One size fits all -- GUARANTEED!\"  But you're clearly much too big to wear this false skin over your real skin.

You flick the light switch and close and lock the door behind you, and find it's well-lit and simply but nicely furnished.  You start taking the clothes off the Kelly suit and hanging them on convenient clothes hooks.  When you pull the gray blouse off and over the Kelly head and the wire hook of the hanger, it finally dawns on you: the false skin of the costume is warm!  You put the blouse on a peg and press your hand against the false face -- and it's exactly like the face of a live girl!  Well, except that there's just a foam wig block behind it, not flesh and bone.  It's as warm as a real, live human face... it feels like living girl-skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you have all the clothes off the hanger and it's merely Kelly Bundy's skin hanging there, floppy and hollow except for the wig block giving shape to its head.  Kelly's fine breasts aren't at their best with nothing inside them, sadly.  You check whether her hair is a wig, and find it's rooted to her scalp exactly like a real girl's.  This is a warm, apparently living girl-skin that just happens to be slit from chin almost to navel and have no flesh or bone in it... it's creepy but weirdly erotic.  You could rub this wonderful skin against yourself and sort of make out with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the end of the slit, just above Kelly's navel.  On the inside there's a little nubbin, and you find that this can easily be slid upwards along the slit, closing it the way a zipper pull closes a zipper.  The weird thing: when you do this, the slit closes up so that there's no trace of it ever having been there!  It reappears with no problem when you slide the nubbin downwards, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the Kelly skin -- it's easy to think of it as a skin -- from the hanger, the face becoming barely recognizable as Kelly's without the foam behind it.  You put it on the padded bench in the middle of the room, and you hurriedly strip off all your clothes.  Then you</span></div></div>",

The costume stretches so that the shirt easily fits over your flat chest, and the skirt slides up easily too. You look at the boots and think that there's no possible way they will fit, but somehow they do. When you stand straight up from slipping them on, you have a moment of vertigo.   You push your long blonde hair out of your eyes. Wait. Long blonde hair?  You look at the mirror in a state of shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jeffach.deviantart.com/art/Supergirl-60-325179315\" target=\"_blank\">http://jeffach.deviantart.com/art/Superg...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How did you come up with that one, didn't get a cake for your birthday recently?\" Baloo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's from a...\" you stopped as you realized that no one here's ever heard of \"Portal\" until today. If you told them the truth about it was, they wouldn't know what you meant. You decide to finish your sentence with, \"book called 'Portal.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't have anything to do with the 'Portal Gun,' would it?\" Kit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Portal Device is from Portal, along with the long fall boots,\" you answered truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are the boots and Portal Gun connected?\" Wildcat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Portal Gun can be used to create an endless fall, which allows one to build up speed. That speed could be converted in high jumps and longs if another portal is placed correctly. To avoid serious injuries from those stunts, the long fall boots were made to prevent dangerous landings,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it would make for a great comic book series. Any chance I could read it?\" Kit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know what I did with it. I'll try to find it if I get a chance. I do know the story pretty well. Maybe I could tell it to you later if I can't find it. Right now though, we need to focus on the task at hand,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo agreed saying, \"Alex is right, we need to save Beckers. Let's not waste any more time.\" And with that, you were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran through the corridors of the giant ship for about 10 minutes. It was lucky you had the others with you since they knew their way around. When you reached the cell block where Rebecca was being held, you stayed behind with Molly while the others distracted the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing doing here? You're not here to free the prisoner are you?\" Mad Dog asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Don Karnage invited us for cake. Thing is, he never said where on the ship it was, so we're smelling for it. Can you smell it?\" Baloo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no cake. The boss would have told us if there,\" Mad Dog explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our noses disagree. We can smell it. Maybe he didn't tell you because he didn't want you to have it, but we'll share if you find it for us,\" Kit explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumptruck took a whiff of the air and then said, \"I think I smell it too. I want some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go get some. We'll stand guard while you find it,\" Baloo offered. With that offer, the two pirates ran off searching for the cake, which allowed you all to sneak into the cell block. You waited with Molly and fired an orange portal at the wall next to the door as you prepared for your next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baloo, you're here. Did Molly send you? Is she okay? Did you get the key from the guards?\" Rebecca asked as she was happy to see her pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly asked us to come and get you. We couldn't leave her behind, but we couldn't decide who should watch either. We decided on a 'safety in numbers' strategy and brought her with us. We didn't get the key, but we have someone who claims to have another way of getting you out of there. As for where the guards are now, we sent them on a wild goose chase for cake,\" Baloo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you me about the person who can help me out of here? I get the feeling the door's been rigged to an alarm, so you'd need someone really strong or someone good at disabling alarms,\" Rebecca asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Alex. I'm not sure she's strong or good at disabling alarms, but she did survive a seven story fall earlier today. She looks a lot like you, but her personality seems much calmer,\" Baloo answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else you would like to tell me?\" Rebecca asked with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she did have Wildcat create some toys for the kids. She even planned on making one for Don Karnage as a backup plan if things went wrong. She even had him make one for you as a bit of an apology gift,\" Baloo said as showed her the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca saw the device and started thinking, \"A white gun with a claw. This must be what Don Karnage wanted. Obviously it was Alex who he was after.\" She then asked Baloo, \"May I see Alex? I want to talk with her.\" Just as Baloo open his mouth, you and Molly walk towards her cell. She starts to get angry and shouts, \"YOU! You're the one who got me in this mess! If you hadn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly interrupts her mother in hopes of calming her down, \"Mommy, Alex came here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help you, but you need to calm down. Your rant will just increase the odds of us getting caught. If you're still feeling angry after we get out of here, we can talk it out like adults. Until then, just try to calm down,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of 'getting out of here', how do you plan to get this cell open? Wait, you're not planning to blow a hole in the wall, are you?\" she asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the Portal Device at the wall behind her and say, \"Something like that, yes.\" She starts to worry as you fire a blue Portal at the wall. After a few seconds, she starts to wonder if something went wrong and asks, \"How did that help? It didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"Try looking behind you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and notices the portal on the wall. \"What is that? Where did that come from? Where does it go? I guess it's my way out,\" she asked as she entered the portal. \"Hey, over here!\" she shouts near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, how did you get over there?\" Baloo asked as all of you ran towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the Portal Device does. It can create two linked holes on surfaces, but it doesn't work on all surfaces,\" you explain briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make it yourself, or do you just know how to work it?\" Baloo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't make. It was a gift. I just know how to operate it. Anyway, I think we should get going,\" you replied. And with that all of you left the room.</span></div></div>",

He must have planned to make an announcement and forgot to shut it off. \"I don't know how you found out about the cake I got for when I got that device that makes those holes, nor do I care. I want to know what makes you think you DESERVE IT! Especially since you abandoned YOUR POST! You're also telling me the prisoner is unguarded, yes-no?\" he shouted with anger. You thought this was funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response they gave added to the humor, \"Der, these two bears told us you invited them here for cake and offered to give us some if managed to find it. They offered to watch the prisoner for us if we did,\" Dumptruck replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many lies. I can't believe you idiots FELL FOR THEM! Why would I invite those two bears for CAKE?! THEY'RE OUR ENEMIES! NOW GET BACK TO THE PRISONER BEFORE THEY SET HER FREE!\" Don Karnage screamed as he was about blow his top. You were trying really hard not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo noticed this and asked \"What's so funny, Alex?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"I'll try to explain later if you still want to know, let's get out of here first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your laughing to cause us more trouble. I'm going to carry you the rest of the way since it's not much farther,\" Baloo says as he picks you up and carries you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on in Baloo's plane, you've managed to settle down a bit. You all were on the way back to Cape Suzette. You reset the device so there was no active portals and put the glasses back into the compartment. Rebecca was curious about everything that just happened. Baloo gave her the toy Wildcat made for her. As she looked at it, she thought about what happened and how it would make a great story. However, she wants to know more about the story behind it, so she starts asking questions. She starts with, \"Okay, I think know what the Portal device does now, but what about the glasses and the boots?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"Not every surface can sustain a portal. The glasses are designed to help determine which ones will work. As for the boots, one safety issue is brought up when the device is used to create a continuous fall. In those cases, a falling object will continue to fall at faster speed. The boots serve as a safety measure to allow people to survive those kinds of falls. I was going to let Wildcat examine them so he could make a pair for himself,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get Portal gun? Who made it?\" she asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling it might be Buzz,\" Baloo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the device was made by a company known as Aperture, but it does not exist my reality, yet,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you saying your from another reality or the future?\" Kit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by the way the gun and boots look, I'd say Alex isn't from the Cape Suzette we know,\" Rebecca answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I'm not. I'm from a different reality and about 70 years from the future compared to yours,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling you don't have any place to stay. If you want, I could let you stay with me. As long you don't try anything funny and stay on my good side, I'll let you stay with me. My bed's got extra room for my space-bending rescuer,\" Rebecca offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I really appreciate your kindness,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the least I could do to thank you for saving me, Alex,\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on at Rebecca's apartment...</span></div></div>",

You swoop down for a smooth landing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top floor of the spacious two-story house your friend's parents had thoughtlessly abandoned for the weekend, a group of guys and girls in a variety of odd costumes were having a great time, buzzed off of liquors and dancing energetically to a selection of electronica music.

Then, you noticed the the dark purple &amp; pink pony tail Twilight had, as it was positioned just above the costume's perky &amp; furry butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking up toward the costume's upper body, you noticed that the Anthro Twilight costume had a pair of perky Double-D Cup breasts, along with a set of humanoid arms covered in short light purple fur, as each arm had a hand with four fingers and a thumb. But like the arms, most of the costume was coated with short light purple fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as you looked at the costume's head, you couldn't help but notice how the costume's mane felt so life-like, letting your free hand gently glide along the dark purple waist-length hair, along with showing off that pink stream of hair in the costume's mane. However, since Twilight was a unicorn, you instantly noticed the spiralling horn sticking out from the mane's bangs, along with the mask's snout, making the costume feel more akin to a fursuit, not to mention the light purple equine ears poking out from the upper sides of the costume's head.

You then zip up the zipper on your back, sliding your hands into the front hoof sleeves, your body rearanging itself to fit. You then put the head over your head, your vision is suddenly clouded for a few seconds, as unbeknown to you, the coustume merges with your body. Your vision returned after some blinking, you notice the costume blinks corosponding to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wierd. This is pretty realistic!' You think to yourself. Everything feels so real, even the wings spread at will! You twitch your ear, and do a few trots in a circle, admiring the realism of the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they ever get this so real-looking?\" You ask to yourself, when you suddendly shut your mouth.

And to no surprise, you looked rediculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, by surprise, you felt yourself change. Something in your chest expanded, making the bra feel snug, your crotch began to feel strange as well, as the panties began to feel much more comfortable. Your hips widened and your waist became thinner. Any trace of body hair immediately fell off, as your arms and legs became smooth, and slender, your skin turning a light orange. You felt your hair melt into the wig as your face became smooth, and feminine. You stare at your reflection, baffled at what happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" You say, then covering your mouth as you heard Sunset Shimmer's voice instead of your old voice.

On the outside, it shows the image of a powerful looking two-headed dragon. One side of it is a brilliant shade of red. The other side is a bright shade of cyan. The writing on the outside said that this costume was for two people. You figure that since you were heading over to your friend's house, he wouldn't mind trying out this awesome costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab onto the box, and take it to the front desk. The old man sees you coming, and smiles. \"I see from your expression that you found one you like.\" It takes a closer look at the box and his smile turns almost devious looking. \"Awww...yes the two-headed dragon costume. A very interesting choice. May I ask who will be joining you in the costume.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand the man the box as you respond. \"Just a friend of mine. He is into dragons as much as I am, so it should be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can assure you that you and your friend will become much closer.\" The man laughed. Suddenly, his expression turned serious. \"Before you go and buy this though, I have to warn you about my policy.\" You look at him funny. \"Oh, its nothing to worry about really. I just want to let you know that all sales are final. So, no refunds or exchanges!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I won't want to return it anyways.\" You smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. So...the total comes out to be $10.00.\" The man smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 10 bucks. Wow, that's a steal.\" You excitedly hand him the money. He hands you your costume, and you quickly leave. You can barely hold in your excitement as you approach your friend's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked even cooler then the picture; the scales really popped out in the light. It almost looked real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief argument about which head you would each take, you agreed to take the blazing red head, and Jake took the dazzling blue head. Fitting your bodies into the costume wasn't an easy task. Finally, you manged to make it work. You put your right hand into the right claw of the costume, and your friend did the same with the left claw. Your remaining arms were wrapped around each other's shoulders for balance. Each of your feet were placed into the two legs of the costume. You then helped each other put the masks on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is a nice costume.\" You and Jake were admiring the costume in his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, we forgot to zip up the back.\" You quickly reach over, and pull the zipper up.

It feels like you have something on your back. Your butt feels weird too; its almost like you have a tail. Your right arm and leg feel huge and powerful...<i>Wait a second!</i> you thought. <i>I can't feel my left side.</i> From the left side of your neck down, your feeling just disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little scared, you call out, \"Jake, are you there?\" <i>Funny,</i> you thought, <i>Is my voice really that deep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly to the left of you, Jake answers, \"Y-yeah...I'm here...kind of...um...I think...we...might have a...slight problem with the costume.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow!</i> you thought, <i>When did Jake's voice crack?</i> The spots in your vision finally faded, and you could see things clearly. You turn your head over toward your friend. You are more than shocked to see the cyan colored dragon head in his place. It moved and blinked. Its mouth opened as it breathed, allowing you to see a layer of dagger sharp teethe inside. The light bounced off its scales, making it look very impressive...and powerful. But, you could see...your friend through its eyes. The cyan dragon was your friend, and he had a very worried look on his face. \"Jake...\" you breathe. \"What happened to you? Y-your the dragon from the costume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Zack...I think you mean we're the dragon from the costume.\" Jake timidly said. Jake motioned with his head toward the mirror, in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze into the mirror; your eyes widen and your mouth drops. Instead of seeing your human head, you see the same red dragon from the costume. Only, the red dragon, or you, look so much more...dazzling than the costume. Even with the shocked look on your face. Once the shock wore off, you smiled at your reflection. You say in your head, <i>Maybe this isn't so bad. Jake and I used to always imagine being dragons. Not having to go to school would be a plus.</i> Finally it dawns on you. <i>Wait a second, Jake said 'we're the dragon from the costume.' The dragon from the costume was...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified upon the realization, you glance down at your body...or actually, yours and Jake's body. At the base of your neck, your two different colored scales collide. Directly to the left of your neck is Jake's neck. You slowly shift your gaze back to Jake. His face horrified face matches yours. Jake clears his throat, and then whispers, \"Where did you get the costume?\"</span></div></div>",

We have to work together to do something as simple as walking. We have to hide whenever people get near. We will... never be able see our families again. Zack, this is bad.\" Jake insisted. Jake let his side of their body slump, forcing them to lay down. He moved his head as far away from Zack's as he could. Which wasn't all that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it seems horrible if you only look at he negatives. You have to look at the positives too Jake.\" Jake turned his head to listen better. \"I mean... we don't have to go to school now. We can eat, sleep, and poop whenever and wherever we want. We don't have to hide all the time people get near. It might be fun to give a few scares now and then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake laughed at that. \"Yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And\" I continue, \"now that we're are stuck with each other, we will never get lonely.

You were surprised to find your neck respond, as it bended around. After getting rid of the nauseous feeling of having swung your head to fast, you see a large reptile like body, with big, yet nimble looking front and hind legs. A tail swung around the air, but you soon noticed a difference in color. Everything to seemingly the middle of your body was colored red, while the other half was colored blue, you felt the legs at the other side, but found them not responding to your commands. Then you felt something move next to your neck, as you felt it pulling and putting on its weight on your shoulders. Turning your head back to its original in front position, you try to look to the other side.

Geeze!!!!\" You exclaim in frustration. \"Fine...\" You say to yourself, conceding to your impatients. \"DAMION! Come here, I want to try something with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few moments later, you can hear footsteps as your younger brother, Damion, scrambles up the stairs. He walks in through your open doorway, \"What is it Zack? I'm in the middle of watching something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can wait. I want you to try this costume on with me.\" You hold up the two masks of the dragon costume, just now admiring how incredibly life-like the masks look and feel. Throwing Damion the ocean blue dragon mask you say, \"Jack and I were going to try it out, but he bailed. Something about having to finish his homework because his parants were on him for his poor grades. So... your all I have to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamion catches the mask and runs the fabric through his hands. \"Why me? Just try it on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would... but this is a two-person costume.\" You pull out the rest of the dragon costume from the large box; it was a lot bigger than you thought. \"Your the only other person I have to try it, unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamion gazed at it, a smile spreading over his face. Despite obviously being enticed about how life-like it was he quickly tried to hide it with a frown. \"Well, your way of asking doesn't really want to make help you. Besides, it looks big enough to fit four of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Damion!\" You pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly rubbed his chin, as if still thinking about it; you already knew the answer before he said it. \"Fine. But you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now lets get this thing on.\" You quickly say, already fitting your fiery red dragon mask on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting your bodies into the costume wasn't an easy task but you manged to make it work. You put your right hand into the right sleeve of the costume, and your friend did the same with the left sleeve. You each wrapped your remaining left and right arms respectively around each other's shoulders for balance. The pant legs were big enough to fit each of your feet so walking wasn't a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing infront of your shared bathroom's mirror, both you and Damion admire how well the costume actually looks. \"Look it fits us fine, even though your a foot shorter then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamion gave you a soft sock in the stomach, \"Whatever. But I do have to hand it to you; it does look pretty awesome.\" Damion leaned a little closer to the mirror, noticing something wrong with the costume. \"Hold on, the wings seem off. They're all saggy.\" He reached back, trying to fix them when he grazed past the zipper. \"We forgot to zip it up all the way, hold on.\" </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the costume only works when the victim, you, puts it on of his own free will. However, I have found a way around that! They can either be one of my elves, or one of my reindeer.\" He said as he withdrew a larger bag from his enormous red coat with a brown costume in it. \"Oddly enough, no ones gone for the second option... well, there was the one.

After that you grabbed the large black leather boots. They fit surprisingly well also. Next came the belt. It reminded you of a almost animal hide version of batmans utility belt. Next you moved to the chest. It was pretty much just a blue cape, with a sling and bag. The sling held fake plastic vials and various small weapons. And finally the beard and hair. It was a red color, and had a long braided beard, with long red hair that curled a little at the bottom. Picking up the axe, you took one step. A sudden intense pain shot through your whole body. It was like thousands of firery needles were stabbing you everywhere. And then, it all went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally woke up, you were laying in your room.

You waddle/run over to your mirror and look at yourself with excitement/horror. You never really liked how your body was, but this was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about 4 feet tall, with a big belly. There was red hair coming from your chest. Your beard was long and braided.

Next came the necklaces. They were made of thick, glass gold and silver beads, with blood red string to hold it all together. As I took one, I wondered how all this could possibly be a ghost costume.<br>\r\n       I walked back to the man at the front desk. He was sitting behind it, reading a fashion magazine.

It was difficult getting into it, since I was so used to the normal shorts and T-shirt outfit, but I managed. After I pulled my sneakers back on, I pulled the night-vision goggles over my head.

Your eye then catches something silvery. You take the costume out &amp; your mouth almost drops. It was a full suit of armor! The writing on the inside of the suit said that it was for people with a height of 170cm. You were a little shorter than that but it didn't matter, since you found an awesome costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take 2 cards with a picture of the armor on it a take it up to the counter. The old man sees you coming, and smiles. \"I see from your expression that you found one you like.\" He takes a closer look at the cards and his smile turns almost devious looking. \"Awww...yes the knight in shining armor costume. A very interesting choice. May I ask who will be joining you in the costume.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand the man the cards as you respond. \"Just a friend of mine. He is into medieval stuff as much as I am, so it should be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can assure you that you and your friend will become much closer.\" The man laughed. Suddenly, his expression turned serious. \"Before you buy this though, I have to warn you about my policy.\" You look at him . \"Oh, its nothing to worry about really. I just want to let you know that all sales are final. So, no refunds or exchanges!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I won't want to return it anyways 'cause it's so awesome!\" You smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. So...*in his head<i>$7.50 by 2 is</i>*...the total comes out to be $15.00.\" The man smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 15 bucks?! Wow, that's cheep!\" You hand him the money. He hands you the costumes, and you quickly leave. \"Thank you!\" you yell as the door shuts. \"Your Welcome, kid!\" the old man chuffed. You can barely hold in your excitement as you approach your friend's house.</span></div></div>",

But there's no sign of that slit that allowed you to get into the fake girl skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, the impossible has happened.  That girl skin is now your real, live skin and what was your body is now the body inside that skin.  Physically you're now an adorably pretty young woman, surely no older than twenty, who's dyed her light brown hair (except at her crotch) black, painted her nails blood-red and her lips to match, applied pale makeup to her face and neck, darkened her eyelids and the area around her eyes for a bit of a skull look.  Probably she's been wearing industrial-strength sunscreen to keep her slender arms and slightly short but shapely legs pale.  Your guy clothes are way, way too big for who you've become: you're tiny even for a girl your age, maybe five feet tall.  Cute little freckles show through your makeup on and near your little snub nose, undercutting the whole Goth look and making you look approachable, even cuddlesome.  Why can't the scrumptious, tiny girl in the mirror be your girlfriend, with or without the Goth shtick?  Why does she have to be you?  It's not fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh like an exasperated girl -- it, and the expression on your pretty face when you do it, would be cute and sexy if they weren't your sigh and your expression  -- and start to get dressed in the clothes that make up the rest of the Goth Girl costume.  You don't want to be naked and your old clothes really are out of the question unless you wear your guy shirt as a sort of crude short dress -- forget that.  You put the costume clothes on as if you've always been a girl: black bra, black panties, black sleeveless blouse that bares your trim and pale midriff, black knee-length stockings, short black pleather skirt, spike-heeled black shoes... you decide to go all the way and add the jewelry that's part of the costume: spider-shaped earrings, a necklace with a heavily tarnished silver locket you don't bother to look inside, a black snake-eating-its-own-tail bangle for each wrist.  You look at the result in the mirror.  You're adorable, too cute to be scary, Goth enough to be oddly sexy -- though you suspect you'd clean up well into an ordinary pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're -- the girl in the mirror is you, no denying it -- ready to leave the dressing room.  Surely there's someone in the shop who can explain your metamorphosis.  You go through the pockets of your guy clothes to get your wallet and keys before you leave.</span></div></div>",

You look to see the blood you felt on your hands, but see it has magically evaporated, and that your fingertips were tipped in petite, cute claws, which were still painted in a dark violet nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, you see that you mostly still look like a goth girl, but your blouse has lost its sleeves and became a low-cut tank top bearing a red anarchy logo, holding your massive bustline, and even showing a tiny bit of side and under boob, and the pleather skirt had shortened into a miniskirt. Your shoes had become high-heeled platform boots without you even noticing. However, the biggest thing was your new horns and tail. Clearly, you knew what ring had done. It had made you into some kind of devil or succubus. \"But I don't feel evil. That's good.\" You sigh. Apparently these costumes only make you look like things, not actually turn you into them... \"Well, then, maybe I should get this ring off...\" You try to slip the ring off, but find it had vanished!! \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to step out of the dressing room, but find yourself suddenly home. You look around to see that, for the most part, your room still looks the same, but there is the intermittent feminine items. Looking around, you hear your sister in her room, listening to music. She looks up at you and says, \"Hey Azriel!! Why don't you try and pick up your dirty clothes after you shower like a normal person!!\" She throws an assortment of suggestive goth clothes at you, smacking you in the face with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" you wonder, \"Alice is acting like my being a goth succubus girl is perfectly normal.\" Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not the wizardly-looking old man, but an adorkable little redhead girl-woman in outsized glasses, the lenses obviously thick and functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave we met?\u201d you ask the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as other people,\u201d she says. She goes over to the door of a small closet and takes out a hanger with a combined skin-and-clothes costume that\u2019s recognizably the old man who welcomed you into the shop! \u201cGot tired of being him, so I thought I\u2019d be me instead. Less of a wizardly ambience to the shop, but a cute shopgirl has her own appeal. So how do you like being Amy Grubek?\u201d She puts the wizard costume away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems, well, great!\u201d you almost squeal in delight. \u201cBut is it real? Am I really Amy? Is she, am I, a real woman with her, my, great job and great boyfriend and everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re real now,\u201d says the redhead. \u201cAnd the boy you were exists only in your memories.

You clearly remember your former self, younger and male and less intelligent, and delight in how different you have become, in being a cute short woman excellent at a job she loves, in love with her exemplary boyfriend. Your former self would have found your Amy body very attractive, which just adds a little extra delight at it being yours. <i>Rather be the cute girl than never get her,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you\u2019re about to get into your car, your phone rings in your purse. It\u2019s a recent iPhone, not the barely-a-smartphone the old you had. You find it promptly and answer the call: it\u2019s your boyfriend. \u201cTyler! Is our date still on for tomorrow?\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Amelia Anne,\u201d he says. Everyone else calls you Amy, but your given names roll off his tongue beautifully and you love to hear him say them. (You also hated your boy name and Amy is already a great improvement.) \u201cWish it were tonight as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you talk as you drive home \u2014 to your very nice apartment, not where you lived as a boy, another improvement due to Amy-hood. You\u2019re both good at flirting, and your Amy brain gives you a quick wit you never had as a boy, and you hear Tyler\u2019s rather sexy laugh more than once. When Tyler has to end the call, you say, \u201cI\u2019ll have a surprise for you tomorrow, Ty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it, Amelia Anne,\u201d he says, and you say your goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go home and start working: you want to have tomorrow free to prepare your surprise for Tyler. At dinner time you microwave a few frozen things and eat them at your computer, and it\u2019s almost midnight when you realize you\u2019ve gotten more done than you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you wake fairly early. After a quick breakfast you start working on your surprise for Tyler: de-Gothing yourself. Soon your fingernails have clear polish rather than blood-red. You take stock of your clothes and see what you need to shop for. You decide to leave your dyed-black hair and eyebrows and eyelashes alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wig shop near the local hospital (catering largely to chemotherapy patients) has a sign out, advertising a sale, and you go inside on a whim and score a wig on closeout in roughly your natural hair color and in a reasonable style. You go to a few thrift shops as well, and find some very not-gothic clothes in your small size. It\u2019s so right, being Amy and knowing how to do all this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your apartment\u2019s door to Tyler\u2019s knock around 5:30, your dyed-black eyebrows and eyelashes are the only things visible of your usual Goth Girl appearance. Your brown wig isn\u2019t obviously a wig, you\u2019re wearing no obvious makeup and every cute freckle on your face shows, you\u2019re in a high-cut long flowery dress with long sleeves, and you\u2019re wearing cream-colored pumps with two-inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sees you and he\u2019s</span></div></div>",

It was your regular sex routine, a few different positions like doggy, reverse cowgirl and finished with a blow job and a spit, but it was incredible and you came three times last night, you then fell asleep in each other's arms with you snuggling against him as the little spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at last nights memories as you bend over and give Tyler a kiss on the cheek then make your way to the bathroom. You take a quick shower making sure to keep your dyed hair dry with a wrapped towel around your head and step out for your daily makeup routines. Today you decide to go light on your usual gothic makeup persona and go for a more natural look that complements your dark black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn goes the Foundation, Concealer, Bronzer, Highlighter, Blush, Cream Blush, Eyeshadow, Eyeliner, Brow Pencil, Mascara, Eyelash Curler, Lip Color then finally the Lip Liner. Whew! If you weren't such a girl you would never have remembered how to do that! But the results are stunning as your smile back at yourself from the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walk out to your closet and pull on a white floral designed Victoria's Secret bra and some blue and white striped boy shorts. Next on goes a long sleeved pink and white striped blouse and then on go a pair of slightly torn denim short shorts. You really love your job though not just because it pays well, and you can often work from home, but because they don't give a crap what their female employees wear on Casual Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last kiss on your sleeping boyfriend's check, you grab your black purse, latest iPhone model encased in a hot pink protector, and slip on your low heeled black pumps and next you are in your pink Mini Cooper pulling out of your apartment complex's garage. You don't know why but your vagina has been moist this entire morning and its been bugging you though in a good way, but you can't wait to get home from work tonight to see your boyfriend again for another round of last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make one detour from work to your local Starbucks and walk in with your sunglasses on. \"Morning Amy, the usual?\" says the cute blonde haired barista chick you know as Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes, a Triple iced espresso with 2 pumps white mocha in a grande cup with extra ice, please.\" you smile as you pull out your black Michael Kors handbag, then take out your credit card with your Amy name on it to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turns to make out your order you can't help but stare and notice how cute she is, especially her behind! In another life you would have definitely have described her as someone you'd love to have in bed with you, but you are a completely heterosexual woman so you can only appreciate her beauty from a platonic stand point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had gotten your order you sipped on it all the way to work. You swiped your keycard at the electronic door then made your way to your cute office decorated with pics of you and Tyler and some cute cat photos. As you sat down and were looking through a few work emails your coworker Mia who works at lobby of your agency had called you on your desk phone. She informs you that there is a man who has been out in the main lobby asking for you this morning. She also mentions he's acting kind of funny so she might call security on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you inform her that you would be in the lobby in a second to see who could it be, just so there is no mishaps with security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd you think, you don't know who would visit you at your work without and email or a call first. As you make your way down to the buildings lobby with your coffee in hand you finally get a glimpse of the guy from behind the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's sitting in one of the lobby's chairs nervously rubbing his hands together and slightly bouncing his heels. You look at him for a second and you realize you don't know who the hell this guy or why he would be here. You are about to tell this to Mia, when the guy who is not much younger than you looks up and stares right at you. You don't know why but a sudden familiarity sparks in you like you somehow know this guy, like he was some long lost friend from college or high school....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy then sits up and nervously begins walking toward the front desk where you and Mia are standing. He never breaks eye contact and you are about to run back towards your office from this creep when the dam bursts in your mind and you realize that this guy IS...WAS <b>YOU</b>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts the male body you had yesterday wearing the exact same clothes and everything, you nearly spit out your coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy walks up to the front desk then asks you..\" Are...are you Amy Grubek?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" you say after a short pause<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why are you me?\" says the nervous guy you once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe if you're not properly dressed in the bridal getup, you won't find yourself in the church basement when you leave this dressing room but still in the costume shop.  You put on your bra and panties and shoes -- low-heeled sandals -- and wear your guy shirt as a sort of dress that goes a bit lower than your panties.  You tie your long hair back into a ponytail using a garter.  You look absurd in this getup but adorably cute: you'd definitely do the girl in the mirror if only you were the usual you and she weren't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door a crack.  You see the church basement -- and the appropriate part of the costume shop!  Somehow they both seem to be there at once... the view just seems to warp your mind.

It was certainly a strange maid costume but it was the same uniform the maids in the mansion wore except they wore white stockings. You disrobed down to your underwear and donned the uniform. Once you had finished closing the zipper in the back, you looked in the mirror and smiled. \"I like it.\" giggling, you said. \"I'm sure to be turning heads at the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something strange, it was as if someone had lit a match, your entire body felt as if your entire body was suddenly on fire. You grunted then screamed as the burning became more intense. That was when it happened; your muscles exploded, swelling to massive proportions as you quickly grew in height! \"What's happening to me!?!\" your voice dropping, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the mirror, you saw that your teeth were changing shape, becoming sharp, canine like, as your hair turned black and grew down to almost mid back length while your muscles, your entire body continued to expand to inhuman proportions. When it was finally all over, you looked at the mirror in shock. You had become a massive six and a half foot muscular giant of a man in a maid's uniform! As you stared at this frightful new image, something clicked in your mind. \"Wait, I know this character.\" your voice booming, you said. \"I've become the amazing and fearsome Kogarashi, the masked Maid Guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, your voice shaking the room. \"This is better than I have ever imagined!\" amused, you said. \"This costume is sure to not only win first prize but maybe score me a job at the mansion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with your purchase, you paid for the costume and walked out. Only, as you left, the elderly store owner said, \"Be sure to come back within seven days, if you want your old life back! Otherwise, this is will be your new true form!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About two blocks from the bookstore, you decide you can't take the lack of stares anymore and try to figure out what is going on. \"Maybe if I draw attention to it...\" You stand up and begin swishing your tail in another girl's face. She sneezes from the fur tickling her nose, then grabs the appendage, and pushes it down, shouting, \"Would you please get your tail out of my face, ma'am? It's bothering my sinuses!!\" Annoyed by how blase she acted about your tail, you were about to yell at her and ask why she didn't find your tail the least bit out of place, when the bus stopped at your destination, the bookstore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can wrangle some clues from my friends!!\" you think, holding your fist up as you make your way out. The girl you swished your tail in front of said to another woman, \"What was her problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. She acts like we've never seen a girl with a tail before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bookstore, you quickly find your friends in your usual haunt in the store, a set of sofas and chairs around a coffee table outside the prerequisite coffee shop. \"About time you got here, Megumi (you)!!\" a boy said. He was not fat, but he also wasn't a portrait of health, either. His short red hair only accentuated his abundant freckles. It was Coby. With him was Kevin, Packard, Luke, and Rajita, who (until now) was the only girl in your group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, thinking there was some other girl around they never told you about named Megumi, but when he came over to you saying, \"Haha, very funny!!\" you realize reality itself must have changed, and now your name is Megumi, where it used to be Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPackard, the resident expert of shojo manga, said, \"Have you read the newest Sakura Hime yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Et tu?\" you wonder, surprised they are saying nothing of the fact you are now sporting a tail, let alone a girl. Finally, you have to ask the question. \"Guys, do you find it odd I have a tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoby asks, \"Actually, it seems more odd you'd ask a question like that. You never had a problem with your tail before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before...?\" This swirls in your head. Did this blasted costume rewrite your entire life's history? \"I'd just like to know, why do I have a tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright?\" Luke asked. \"Did you hit your head or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these eyes on you, but for the wrong reasons, you stumble into a lie. \"Why, yes I did!! Hit it on the way here!! Think I might have a touch of the amnesia, that's all!! Now tell me why I have a tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be in a hospital then.\" Rajita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, in a minute. First, answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it'll get you to go get medical attention, I'll remind you... You were born with it, as were several other girls around the time you were born. Had something to do with a fragment from that comet that hit Jupiter ricocheting off Jupiter's atmosphere and hitting the Earth. Supposedly it had it had some mutagenic virus in it that affected only female embryoes. Now all girls born have a 1 in 4 chance of being born with a tail of a random animal species. At first, doctors considered amputation, but the tails would simply grow back in a matter of weeks, and for some reason, girls with intact tails seemed to begin showing signs of possessing superior physical capabilities, but seem to lose them when their tails were cut off. As a result of the combination of all these things, doctors simply stopped bothering to amputate, and now girls with tails are largely accepted. Even Rajita has a tail, or did you forget that too?\" She stands up and reveals a dog's tail that looked like it belonged to a Labrador Retriever sticking out the seat of her skirt, the only reason you didn't notice it before was how she had it curled behind her in the couch cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I feel better now!! Thanks.\" You really didn't want to go to the hospital, especially to have to hear your parents chew you out for faking a major head injury (and running up a major medical bill).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your friends had a different plan. \"Oh no. Go to hospital now.\" Coby said sternly, practically trying to drag you out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as you reach the store doors, you blurt out the truth, all of it... The costume shop, the magic catgirl maid costume, reality as it was before you donned the tail, what you did with the ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, the girl you waved your tail in front of was at her doorstep, drenched in sweat, sneezing profusely. \"I knew I was allergic to cats, but I've never had an attack like this before...\" Suddenly, she groans as she falls on her knees, dropping her keys, as a tabby striped cat tail ripped out the seat of her jeans. \"This is... impossible...\" she utters, looking back to see her tail, then she looks forward again when she hears footsteps. Her eyes were growing heavy, but she swore she saw a an auburn haired maid with cat ears standing over her, saying, \"I'll make it all better, nya!!\" The maid leans over and licked her ears as she passed out, and unbeknownst to her, her ears began to transform, beginning to match the shape of the maid's ears...</span></div></div>",

Buds grow from his chest, blossoming into sizable C-cup breasts. His waist narrow as his hips widen, followed by a powerful pressure in his crotch and abdomen. He holds himself as he feels a powerful sucking sensation, and then, he finally makes that fateful leap from 'he' to 'she.' She then felt his legs get more tone, as all the excess body hair fell off, leaving the only hair on her body on her head. \"It's thhesse ears!!\" She was finding she was becoming increasingly sober as she reached for the ears, but when she grabbed them, felt warm tissue, and odder still, felt the ears as though they were her own. In shock, she felt for the headband, but couldn't find it, nor could she feel her original ears. \"Nya!! What's going on!!\" She screams in a high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her clothes began to change. Her dingy t-shirt and pants mends themselves, the stains fading away. Beyond confused, the bum watched as her pants and shirt fused together as the legs of the pants rode up and fused, forming a simple dark blue dress that reached to her knees, but had a neckline that dipped way down to show off plenty of cleavage, Out of nowhere, a white frilly apron popped into existence and tied itself onto the bum, and the skirt portion of the dress fluffed out. Under said portion, a white lacy slip forms as his shoes become loafers atop white knee-high stockings, red ribbons threaded through the top and tied on the outer sides into a bow. White elbow-length gloves in the same style as the stockings form on her arms as well, as her blue eyes turn green, and her change jar becomes a feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like...\" the bum tries to reconcile what is happening, but feels his mind now under assault, new memories and desires filling her mind. \"...like...\" She felt like she had to be somewhere... no, with someone... \"...a maid!!\" Everything snaps, as the bum's personality is overwhelmed with 'maidly' desires. \"Where is my mistress? Why am I in this alley...\" She rummages in her apron to pull out a gold pocket watch on a chain, and sees the time. \"That's right!! Mistress went to the bookstore!! I must be there to attend to her lest she becomes cross with me, nya!!\" She runs out, and quickly jumps on an arriving bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bookstore, you are with your friends Coby, Packard, Luke, and Rajita. You just got there, but yet they don't it odd you're a girl, let alone a girl with a cat tail. \"Guys, don't you find this odd in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoby: \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPackard (never taking his face from a copy of \"Sakura Hime\"): \"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke: \"Can't see what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRajita: \"Why aren't you wearing the tail bow I bought you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grumble, the bookstore's bell rings, signalling someone came in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You don't really know why you picked this weird costume out in the store but you find yourself curiously drawn to it, so you bring it into the nearest dressing room in the store. You then disrobe and slip your hands through the silken blue garb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tie the Kimono around your waist you can't help but feel like one of those anime weeboo losers you've seen online, but before you can feel any more embarrassment and take it off, you feel a slight uncomforted feeling spreading all across your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly look down to your wrist to see it has slightly changed colors and the pigment is racing up your arm, your skin in slowly changing colors you realize in shock! But thats not the only thing, a long strand of hair brushes your face and as you swat it out of your vision you feel that the strand was actually connecting to the scalp of your head. You then reach up and grab a fist full of your hair and see that they are all now quite longer than they were a minute ago, then you realize they are also lengthening! They are slowly growing thicker and darker by the second too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also feel your legs beginning to buckle, but you look down to realize you are slowly but surely growing shorter compared to the rest of the room. You then feel the uncomfortable from before filling your face making it tickle. You look into the mirror to realize your face has now changed into a slightly darker complexion, but not only that your facial features began to change. Your cheek bones start to become more prominent, and you notice your once light colored eyes turn into a deep dark brown color. You feel your nose shorten but also widen out, and you watch as your upper and lower eyelids begin to move closer to one another, they give you a squinting look but you realize your eyes are totally open. You watch as the slight stubble on your face shrinks back into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your once brown hair has now become a midnight black color and has shaped up to make bangs above your forehead...You realize you are no longer a guy of Irish American decent, but of an oriental nature! But before you can fully take that thought in, your hair lengthens down your back, you see your chin soften, and your adam's apple disappear too. Then you feel a tingle just below your crotch it only lasts for a second of pain then a feeling of nothingness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back into the mirror and realize you aren't just oriental now but an oriental female...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mouth wide open you can only speak. \"What the hell just happened!\", at least thats what you wanted to say, but instead it came out as: \"<br>\r\nIttai nani ga okotta no ka!\", in a clearly feminine and accented way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand to your throat and say \"My voice!\" but again it didn't come out the way you wanted it was: \"Watashi no koe!\", thats when to your horror you realized event your thoughts have mimicked your voice, no longer were you able to think in english but in Japanese! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn to grab your cellphone from the pile of clothes you left on the seat in the dressing room behind you to find a pair of feminine clothes in its place. Your white shirt now was replaced with a white blouse, your blue jeans replaced with a blue skirt, and your black boxer shorts replaced with dark clearly woman's underwear. You also notice a bra and a purse has also joined the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you frantically sure the pile for your phone, you realized your wallet is missing from the pile too. You look up at the purse, which is designed to have a cat like face on the front. You open the purse and reach in to find your i-phone still intact, but the black case has changed into a pink hello-kitty case. Frantically you open the phone to a screen saver of several asian girls all posing together, and you realize one looks just like the girl who you see as yourself in the mirror..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stare in shock, the girl is posing with a peace sign near her face smiling...\"No this can't be me...\" you think to yourself. You want out of this insane joke, now! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nDisregarding the new clothes on the bench you open the dressing room door to the costume shop looking the exact same as before, but thats not what surprises you, its the outside from the windows, the outside has completely changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice a smiling older oriental man at the counter now, he waves and says, \"There you are. I thought you'd never come out.\" But he doesn't say it in english rather in a unique tongue you never heard before, but surprisingly you understood every single word of what he just said.......</span></div></div>",

You soon realize your name is Sarah Alvarez and you teach art and photography classes at Fort zumalt high school. You look down at your big new pregnant belly and memories kick in that you are 35 weeks pregnant with a girl and you and your husband Don are still deciding on a name for her. You also find that you are now 32 years old. You instinctively rub your belly as you decide to see what this life is like as a extremely pregnant high school art teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your lunch and sit down at your desk to feed your big belly. At least it is the last day before christmas break so after today you can sit at home and relax while still pregnant. This body is so cool, I always thought what it would be like to be pregnant\" your old mind thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the bell and know that it is time to teach your next class. Soon, you find that it is hard to stay on your feet when you can't see past your big belly and when your ankles are swollen and your back is killing you, not to mention all the kicks from the baby in your belly. You decide to teach the kids from your desk and stay off your feet as much as you can. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe final bell rings and it is finally christmas break and you can go see the house you will now be staying in for you life now. It was exhausting being a high school tracher and being pregnant at the same time. You finally arrive and your new husband is already home making you a pregnancy snack. You now focus on laying down, eating, and rubbing your ginormous belly. I guess it was fate that I found that costume and put it on and was given this new life as a 32 year old pregnant art teacher. You fell right asleep and thought this whole experience was just a weird descriptive dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next morning. You expect to be back to normal but you look down. You again see the same big breasts resting on top of your big pregnant belly. \"I guess i really am stuck like this forever.\" You think to yourself. You are actually happy with this new life, being pregnant is amazing. You can eat practically anything you want and your belly grows huge. All christmas break, your husband treats you like a queen and serves tou hand and foot. But now you have ro go back to teaching for 5 more weeks until this baby is born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return and students ask you how you are feeling with the pregnancy and everthing. Some of the girls want to rub your belly and you most certainly oblige. Belly rubs fell so good as you get bigger amd bigger. The first two weeks fly by and you are gearing up for labor. You have to sit a ton while teaching with all this weight in your belly and breasts taking a toll on your back. Teaching art is fun and cool especially seeing all the finished projects. But when you are super hormonal during pregnancy, it can get stressful. Every night your husband reads to your belly in hopes that the baby will hear him. Then lotions and rubs your big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

You find you can grip your waist tighter as it narrows, your hips and rear widening and expanding. A strange heaviness catches your attention, but you don't know what it is, focused more on the pain in your spine, as a silky fabric catches two new E-cup breasts. Sounds seemed to fade and distort, before becoming sharper, the sensation that your ears were moving and lengthening unnerving. Just then, a loud rip from your now amorphous underwear, followed immediately by a rip in the sea of your jeans catches your attention, and you manage to look back to see a black furred cat tail whipping around behind you, the sensations of its motions wholly alien to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the pain dissipates, and you look in the mirror. To your amazement, you see someone that looks like you, if they had been born a girl. Your short hair was still almost exactly the same, but had a hint of feminimity. Your face was a perfect mix of female features, and your eyes were still green, but seemed larger. Your clothes were still the same, but seemed to now be modified to fit your female frame, a frame that appeared to be a size 4, but you could tell you now had a bra under your favorite T-shirt, and your boxers were now silk panties.

Literally! One woman in a million is this intelligent. And so, so pretty! You might not be able to tell because there\u2019s nothing inside her empty skin, but she has the loveliest hands and feet, not to mention the rest of her! Look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you an empty foot and hand of the girlsuit and they\u2019re indeed delightful to see. You\u2019re not a foot fetishist, but you could see yourself caressing and kissing a girl on the foot if her feet were so dainty and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...

It feels <i>good</i> when you fit your feet into the delicate hollow girl-feet and the flesh and bone shrink and take new shapes before combining completely with what had been fake skin to become real, near-perfect girl-feet. And so it goes with your legs and thighs, and the intense orgasm resulting from your boy-bits becoming a young woman\u2019s is just a dirty trick on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again you\u2019re being bribed with pleasure and beauty to continue getting into the girlskin. Your new breasts aren\u2019t the largest but they seem perfectly shaped and the feeling of them growing on your now-delicate chest is enough to give you a female orgasm. New hands and arms... they\u2019re just so <i>right</i> for who you\u2019re becoming. Finally your skull takes its new shape and with a feeling that you\u2019re being transformed into a higher form of human life, your pretty good brain becomes one of the finest brains on the planet \u2014 and completely a heterosexual woman\u2019s. You feel as if you\u2019ve been cheated of a proper brain all your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve lost track of how many female orgasms you\u2019ve had. Somehow this dressing room now has a shower stall as well, and you take a shower, then dry yourself off with big fluffy towels that were... just there, somehow. You look at your naked girl-body in a convenient full-length mirror: the suit you\u2019ve combined with has made you a thoroughly heterosexual woman, so instead of being aroused by your own beauty you\u2019re merely pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed. The clothes fit well. Your nerd-girl glasses aren\u2019t a prop but essential. You\u2019re actually too pretty to be adorkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a woman now. It feels great!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You\u2019re not sure why you take the now-complete Science Genius Girl costume to one of the convenient, comfortable little dressing rooms, why you\u2019ve become eager to try it on. You just wanted a costume for a friend\u2019s birthday party... if the little woman-skin of the costume could really shrink your body and make you look like a real girl, you\u2019d fool everyone but they\u2019d think you were just a cute female stranger crashing the party...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, in your dressing room you take the clothes off the hanger and get a good look at what looks like a living skin of a pretty, rather short young brunette who could be anything from fifteen to twenty-five. It feels like skin to the touch, though it seems more elastic and somehow it\u2019s warmer than the room is, though not as warm as a living human\u2019s skin. There\u2019s a slit from just under its cute slightly-pointy chin to just above its crotch, swerving a little to avoid its \u201cinnie\u201d navel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen afterwards you try to remember putting on the girl-skin, it\u2019s all a bit of a blur. Certainly you stripped and bundled up your clothes neatly. You sat down on the edge of the bench and put both feet into the hollow thighs at once... somehow from feet to crotch your body shrank perfectly and fitted inside and combined with the skin. Somehow your male parts became a female\u2019s, somehow it was easy to get your arms inside the skin\u2019s and your head inside its head. At some point the empty glasses-frames acquired strong lenses suitable for what weren\u2019t your 20/20 blue eyes but the woman\u2019s myopic dark ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, surprisingly quickly you\u2019re looking at the reflection in the mirror of a naked and quite pretty girl-woman \u2014 you! If you were your usual male self you\u2019d want her as a girlfriend: her body is fairly curvy but trim and compact, her face freckled and slightly droll but still pretty, with an intelligent expression \u2014 and behind the now-real thick but cute glasses are eyes so dark you can\u2019t tell where the pupils end and the irises start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the memories of being this woman start to cascade into what you\u2019ve already realized is a much-improved brain. At first your memories of your usual self seem to have been wiped out, but once your new brain is fully stocked with a lifetime of memories of being Sophie, including not only your Sophie knowledge of science and mathematics but literature and music, your abilities as a singer and pianist... then you remember who you were before. The memories go back to boyhood but they seem to be of things that happened to someone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a beautiful and highly intelligent young woman now. There\u2019s no sign of a slit down your front, just excellent skin flawed, if they\u2019re actually flaws, only by a dusting of freckles. The cute little backpack you use instead of a purse has replaced the bundle of boy-clothes. You put on your panties and bra, and they\u2019re cute on you though they\u2019re meant for comfort. Long skirt, lacy blouse, white socks and tiny black sneakers... a few things from your backpack help you put up your long brown hair into a loose bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re Sophie Masters, only eighteen but a graduate student at the local research university. Your former self would have had the hots for you, but you\u2019re far out of his league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your backpack and leave the dressing room. You\u2019re</span></div></div>",

The only thing keeping you from literally jumping for joy is the sheer normality of your body and mind and self: you have to set aside the memories of being the nondescript teen boy you were, or the utter delight of being not that boy but a beautiful woman with a magnificent brain will overwhelm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you\u2019re back at the counter and the old man and the short, lively woman are there. Clearly they\u2019ve been waiting for you. You look straight at the woman and say, \u201cI don\u2019t care how intelligent you\u2019ve made me! I\u2019m not going to clean the Augean stables of modern physics for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks crestfallen. \u201cOh, well, it was worth a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man says to her, \u201cNerissa, how many girl suits have you turned into Einstein-level nerdy cuties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the one that made her out of that boy,\u201d she said. \u201cActually more than Einstein level.

And <b>for Science!</b>\u201d you conclude in a thrilling voice thanks to yet one more gift of your transformed self, your new acting talent. Then you break into a beautiful, infectious laugh that the other two can\u2019t help but join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey won\u2019t accept your money. After hugs and chaste if enthusiastic kisses, you say your goodbyes and \u201creturn\u201d to the University.</span></div></div>",

You get out of bed, put on your glasses, go to the bathroom, and hurriedly put up your long, thick hair, its warm brown now shot with pure white. You catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror and you\u2019re the same beautiful woman you\u2019ve been for twelve years, only a well-preserved thirty (you and Jake rather like the white in your hair) instead of the girlish eighteen of the woman created from the highschool boy by the girlsuit. The smell of Jake\u2019s excellent cooking proves too much, and you quickly remove your glasses, kneel by the toilet, and throw up. There wasn\u2019t much in your stomach, and after a few more seconds of dry heaves it\u2019s over. You get up, wipe your mouth on toilet paper, put on your glasses, rinse your mouth, go to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake has hot tea for you, or rather dried ginger root steeped in hot water. You accept it gratefully: you\u2019re tired of it, but it does seem to help with the nausea. \u201cSorry to put you through this, Sam,\u201d he says, as he\u2019s often said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want this kid as much as you do,\u201d you say. Strangely, you\u2019ve been off contraceptives for over two years, but you were able to get pregnant only when you and Jake had published your groundbreaking paper. The ideas were yours, but Jake\u2019s genius for math had again and yet again proven vital, and you\u2019re grateful for a husband who\u2019s also your most important collaborator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that after the ginger tea you can tolerate a two-egg omelet freshly prepared by Jake. As you eat, you think back over twelve years as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big difficulties were with the science and the associated math \u2014 nothing else! You\u2019ve led a charmed life, and often you wonder whether it\u2019s literal magic that\u2019s warded off sexual harassment (you\u2019ve seen all too much of that directed against other young women), rather than respect for your extreme intelligence and awe for your beauty. Even the most entrenched of the string theorists have all along been giving you a fair hearing.<br>\r\nThe oddly cute Jacob Park, Jewish like his chemist mother though otherwise taking more after his Korean mathematician father, showed up at just the right time to be your personal math wizard, friend, lover, husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re genuinely surprised when the phone rings and it\u2019s someone from the Nobel committee, telling you and Jake that you\u2019ve won the Physics prize. You were sure they\u2019d wait until next year.</span></div></div>",

You pictured a woman with fifty inch high heels stabbing  everything with them as she waded across the battlefield for a moment, smiling at the image. After putting on the breastplate and chainmail, you look at yourself in the mirror. Apart from your face, with moustache and stubble, head and hair, you could be a female warrior. You sighed. If you were going to cross dress to this party, you might as well do it properly. You went into the bathroom, and shaved off your beard stubble and mustache. You then put on the wig, looking at yourself again. Although women of that time did not wear makeup, you borrowed some of your sisters lipstick to make your lips look fuller, and curled your eyelashes to make them look longer.

As we arrived to the front door of the shop the sign in the window read as \"Closed.\" A second sign posted just inside as setting on the floor read as \"Early fitting appointments available, go to the alley side door and ring the bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noted the alternative sign, pointing it out to Tyler, seeing him, his facial expression as one of more than worry, like he was scared. None-the-less, we walked to the alley and along its darkness to a steel door surrounded in a morning haze of expelled steam coming from vent pipes there in the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the button to ring the doorbell, and heard what sounded like a old style phone ringing then inside the building. A moment later and the side door opened but the person greeting us was not the shopkeeper, but a woman, the dressed in a skin-tight Zebra costume. She stood there and then smiled, her teeth looking like those of a real equine, white, squared, a front row top and bottom with the gap where might go a bit attached to a bridle. We gawking at her, saw there the essence of a woman but standing precariously on the hind like legs of a zebra, having black hoofs, a swishing tail, and lots of stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enter, and I suspect you are Tyler and his good friend here for your personal fittings of the pony team!\" She said, as I was a bit surprised she could speak so well considering her lips and mouth was quite equine of form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe entered past the door, walking as would men going to their expected deaths and followed by some manner of perdition. Walking then along a narrow hallway between rows of hung furry and or hairy costumes. As finally we entered what was the costume shop sales floor, and saw there the old man standing, he holding a pony costume in each hand while smiling with a devilish grin.</span></div></div>",

The fur colors are a dappled gray/black across the back to rump, with heather colored mane and tail, all black from the cannon bone to fore hoofs, as from the hind hocks to the hind hoofs.

When yesterday I entered your shop and we talked, I said nothing about my friend Tyler, nor did I suggest he wanted what I was of interest to enjoy if only for an overnight renting.\" I said, as the old man handed me a clothes hanger holding one costume, as Tyler, looking like he were in a trance stepped up and took then his costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look at Tyler, seeing his face as dull of expressions, his eyes wide and not blinking, he looked like a zombie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what did you do to Tyler...,\" I said as speaking the name of my friend, I too felt a hood of deeming power take control of me. I wanted to ask more but stood as watched the zebra lady escort Tyler to a dressing room, she entering it behind him, as smiled at me when she closed the dressing room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there totally immobile, powerless to move or talk, as waiting, the shopkeeper there too, was waiting for Tyler to come out and model for me his new pony self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accounting to time we waited came by way of Tyler moaning several times, until hearing him cry a shrill pony like whinny before then the dressing room door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra woman walked out from the dressing room, she holing a lead rein attached to a head halter strapped around the new face of my friend Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking then as on all fours, he, Tyler looked as if born to being a pony. His head bobbed as he strode each stepping forward, his tail swung with every step taken, he acted as if a passive mindset to his being exactly like a real born pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woman led then Tyler to an open area where she led him to walk in a circle giving me the thoughts of what it would be like when I was to join my friend in being a pony animal. I fell to kneeling as she jerked the rein and Tyler stopped as stood there looking directly at me. I saw his lower lip quivering, his dark eyes, and and ears laid back suggesting to me he was terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he modeling what the costume looks like, or did she use the salve to make this as his new, real self?\" I asked the shopkeeper, only to see him then smile and nod his head to affirm that friend Tyler was then a boy being a pony, as in time learning to act as would a brute animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler I am sorry,\" I said, as my friend stretched his neck to press his long pony face to my chest and cried a sad sounding whinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what then of Tyler,\" I asked boldly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, along with his brother pony shall be trucked from here later today to a farm some twenty miles away. As once arrived there to the farm the two of you shall be placed in a stall and daily given training for working in a harness as a pony team to draw a wagon. Your ultimate use is for a coming sale to where you shall live as ponies, being part of an act in a circus. The circus is owned by a dear friend, she of Italian heritage, her name being Kirke! As you will find Kirke to be a heartless woman demanding much from her animals as she delights from knowing that what I sent to her were all previous of being animal were human born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour being a boy and soon a pony shall gift you some wild as wonderful experiences, of what some came asking and gained a new lifestyle feeling strong and masculine every day they were alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time as with the learning to be as act like ponies and animals, the commonality friendship you had with Tyler will be as jealous beasts knowing little more than hunger and attune to your being alive. This was what you originally entered my shop with the thought as fantasy for becoming, if for a overnight thrill, as this thrill is something ongoing and for a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh too, the being born a human, as part of that godly gifted gracing, you being a pony changes nothing of the biblical account of a normal human lifetime being of three score and ten year. A score is as twenty years, and with being transformed the number to your years returns to A-number one. So you may expect as the least your lifetime being a pony as living the some seventy years, or maybe longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen then you arrive and become part of the circus animals, seek out Jonas, he has lived for more than a hundred good years being a white Percheron horse, what Kirke rides into the ring to announce each coming attraction. Jonas was a dear friend so long ago, and has, after being gelded, become at ease with life, he a horse for some two hundred plus odd years. Consider Jonas as a role model and if you find life of a pony as satisfying, do as he did and live a long life feeling your fantasy thrills.\"  </span></div></div>",

The baby bluesleeper fit perfectly on you as it should on any baby. Your diaper is clearly visible to anyone who cares to look at you, becaus of the bulge around your waist.  The outfit along with the pacifier still lodged in you mouth, which you are subcontiously suking on, makes you look as innocent as an infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to walk around and get the feel of the clothes your in. The diaper makes you waddle a lot more than you are used to. You notice how warm and cozy the sleeper is combined with the diaper you are wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel very dizzy and soon everything goes black. There is a loud \"THUD!\" as you hit the ground. When you wake up a couple of minutes later you can't remember anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it all comes back to you, the party, the costume shop, all the baby stuff, everything. You turn over onto your stomoch and try to get up, but it's harder than usual. \"I guess that's what happens when you hit the ground as hard as I did.\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finally get up yo notice everything is different. Everything is bigger! You are very confused as to what happened so you turn around to see the mirror. You ar horrified by what you see.  You see a baby boy dressed in a light blue-footed sleeper, obviously wearing a diaper, sucking nervously on his pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill scared you move around just to see the baby copy your every movement in sync with your own. You rub your eyes to make sure they weren't playing tricks on you, but the baby was still there.  You quickly (well, quickly for a baby) move to the door.  \"No this can't be right\" you think to yourself. As you reach the door it was still cracked, the way you left it. As you open the door there was a bright light, you cover your eyes to sheild yourself.  When you open them you see....   </span></div></div>",

You see a changing table stocked full of supplies and a ton of diapers taking up a lot of room.  There is a play pen with what seemed like hundreds of toys and stuffed animals. There's a crib filled with even more stuffed animal's and a mobile with winne the pooh characters hanging above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou stand in awe for a minute, you cannot believe what you see, \"it's a huge nursury!\" you say to yourself with difficulty around your binki in your now high squeaky voice.  You turn around to get out of there and go back home, but the door is gone and you have no way out. Wait you see a door on the other sid of the room with light coming from the crack of it. You waddle toward it with your chubby feet, but about half way there the door starts to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walks a beutiful woman with long blond hair and very large breasts. She seams huge to you.  As she walks in she looks around, and then spots you standing there. She starts to quickly walk over to you.  You are scared to death, so you start to back up, only to trip over your clumbsy feet and fall on you patted bottom.  You can't help it tears start to well up in your eyes and you start Crying, harder than you can remember, from all mixed emotions of sadness, terror, frustration, and humiliation.  The strange woman quickens her pace to get to you.  \"Awww my poor baby!\" she says as she finally reaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"shhhh, shhhh mommy's here for you.\" she said as she picked up the crying infant. She craddles you close and rubs you while trying to soothe you. \"shhh, shhh it's ok I'm here now, mommy's here for you.\" she kept repeating while rocking you in her arms, holding you close to her bosom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you finally settle down to sniffles. You look up at her and notice her beutiful blue eyes, like your being lost in another world. She patts your bottom a couple more times to help settle you down.  She then asked \"Uh oh, did someone make a stinky?\". Your eyes go whide when you relize she's right, you justed messed yourself and didn't even know it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifts you up in the air with her hands under your arms and makes airplane noises as she flys you around toward the changing table. \"Alright let's get you all cleaned up little one\" she said as she started unbuttoning the sleeper. When she gets you undress, exept for your dirty diaper, you try to tell her your not really a baby but all that comes out is \"baaa gaahha abaa\". Then she....<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You continue to wiggle your feet and kick them gentally, until she takes both your ankles in one hand and lifts your bottom off of the diaper. She wipes you gentally wit a warm baby wipe, making sure to get everything clean. You take this opertunity to see what happened to these regions as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou no longer see the dick of a teen-aged boy. You seen nothing more than a tiny, hairless baby's peepee, no more than an inch long. You are very upset about what you see, so upset that you start to cry again. The woman quickly notices \"shhh, it's ok we're almost done\" she says in a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes wiping you up, and puts you back down on a dry diaper. She then reaches for somthing, it's baby powder! She sprinkles some on to your crotch area, on your bottom, your tummy, and in every crevise on your body. She rubs it into your skin.  This soothes you down from your tantrum. She finishes by pulling the front up between your legs and tapes it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits you up with a big smile on her face, you look at her confused.

We can't have that now can we?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to the dresser and drops it in a container filled with what looks like water.

You suckle harder on your pacifier as she pats your bottom sweetly with on hand. Finally,  it's over, and she takes the shaft out,  declaring you well.  She then gets the nurse to administer a shot in your bottom, causing you to cry behind your pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor does s few more tests then has the nurse finish your diapering. After covering you in a thick cloud of baby powder, you are taped up into a fresh diaper, and handed off to \"Mommy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good boy for the nurse, now I want to take you to.... \"</span></div></div>",

You feel a strange warmth spread out in your diaper. You had not only peed yourself but had messed your diaper. You felt your body losing control again. Sarah looked at you and began rocking you again seeing that it had upset you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then set you down and grabbed a package of diapers, baby oil, baby wipes, and baby powder. She then grabbed a pacifier. She walked up to the register. The lady working there looks at you and asks Sarah how old you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles, \u201c12 months actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas he started to talk yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little here and there,\u201d Sarah said to the woman.

Sarah pushed the carrier out and began to walk towards a bathroom in the store next door. Sarah changed you and then she began to walk the carrier towards the party.</span></div></div>",

Looking at your skin it conformed your feelings, looking down you watched your skin rip open, your blood osed out, yet then turn and flow back in to your body. It was Hell, no it must have been worse than that. Your bone cracked and reasmbled, your skin ripped and streached, your whole body was pull or snapping or ripping or all three at the same time, in a desprate bid for help you managed to lift your arm up, before it went limp, you just managed to grab the poster/information sheet of the wall before you blacked out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and stured, boy did your head hurt, you struggled to your feet, what had happened?

You put the blaster back in its holster and then anogther piece of your new kit cort your eye, you carefully pulled a strange looking handle of knife out of belt, and with a click of a button on it a foot long energy bayonet appeared in your hand, you pressed the button again and the laser blade retracted, and you put it back in your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how, you didn't know why, but somehow you had become this space age comic book charater, this 6 foot 7, musclear, heaverly armed comic book charater, you decided to get a little more information on what was happening, and the only source that you potsesst was the poster, you started reading; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAPTAIN COSMIC, freedom fighter of the ninth galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the year 2458, were the nineth galaxy is ruled by the evil gronornds (creatures that are half octopuse half toll), it is up to the great freedom fighter Captain-general James Cosmic and his thirty strong crew to beat the gronornds back till the armies from earth arive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou continued reading till you got to the end, and just to recap, you are now Captain-General James Cosmic and freedom fighter in the twenty-fourth and over a half century, you lead a crew of humans, aliens and convicts, you possesed weapons like a lazer gun and a box that made its target feel pain, you were trained in science, chemistary, combat and many other things and you had super human physical and mental powers as well as X-ray vision, not to mention your head was wanted through out the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else could go wrong?</span></div></div>",

You lock the door behind you, then start pulling on the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like it's modelled after the blob from the X-men Origins movie - grey singlet, sweatpants, boxing gloves. Of course, everything's 10 sizes too large. You pull the clothes on anyway, and they hang loosely off your thin frame. You have to tighten the pants to hold them up, though. You pull on the gloves, then look in the mirror. You look ridiculous! The costume's far too big for you - why'd you even put it on in the first place? You sigh, then go to take off the singlet when an intensely warm sensation wells in your stomach. Almost instantly, you start growing heavier. Your bones thicken and stretch painfully, and you grow several inches taller. Your hair turns blond, and a tattoo appears on your arm. Your muscles begin to grow as well, and you watch in shock as your biceps inflate with bulging muscles before your eyes. Your chest expands outwards, and your flat stomach develops a rock-hard six pack, while your legs grow stronger too. Your ripped body pulses with raw strength, and it feels amazing, but you can't shake the feeling that something's off. Wasn't the blob supposed to be fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the thought registers, you start growing again. Only this time, you're packing on fat, not muscle. Your chiseled abs are quickly swamped by a swelling gut, while your pecs inflate into huge man-boobs. Your arms and legs are invaded in thick layers of flab, and the previously ripped muscles transform into jiggling sausages of blubber. Your rock-hard jaw sags and turns into a double chin, then a triple chin as it engulfs your neck, forming a thick flap of fat around your face. Your gut and breasts are soon pressed tight against the fabric of the singlet, but just when it's about to tear, you stop growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself in shock. You're huge! Was the Blob always THIS fat? You barely fit into the stall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou somehow manage to unlock the door, and step out of the stall with a bit of difficulty. What now?</span></div></div>",

You shake your head, wondering how you got that idea in the first place. But, for some reason, you didn\u2019t hate it either.

Barbecue, burgers, and deep-fried southern foods danced in your mind, despite how unhealthy they were, it just tasted so good, and you were craving it badly. You\u2019re starting to salivate thinking of a full-course meal consisting of nothing but fatty fried foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still remember that you\u2019re heading to Mark\u2019s place\u2026 But a detour over to the nearby steakhouse wouldn\u2019t be too bad, would it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This would be something the Blob from X-Men would wear, you thought. Surprising, there was a manual included in the suit. Here is what is said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The suit grants you powers strength-based and others that are similar. It grants you superhuman strength over 100 tons, superhuman durability, superhuman stamina, superhuman immune system, resistance to drugs, alcohol, and toxins, tissue and bones 5x denser than normal, near invulnerability, embodiement of nearly irresistible force, self-sustinence, regenerative healing power, superhuman endurance, superhuman agility, superhuman senses, and able to withstand nearly all outside forces while standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought this was great, so you decide to put the suit on. However, because of its enormous size, it looked more like a sleeping bag compared to your size. After nothing happened, you were tempted to take it off. However, a warm feeling developed in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you began to increase in height. Eventually, you grew just to be about 9'1 ft. Second, fat begins to build up. The legs and arms began to swell with fat. The gut begins to pile up on that same substance, becoming bigger than an average human itself. And your face begins to puff up and add three more chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, you tried to get out. It was very cramped in the changing room considering your size. Eventually you came out. You decide to buy the suit from the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like this suit please. How much is it?\" you asked. \"Pretty much $50.99\", the cashier says. Very pricey, but you enough money for that. After you bought it, you began your trek home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your size, you took most of the space in the sidewalk. It was struggling to get pass the people as they stared at you and often lay have to walk through your sides just to be through. Eventually, you reach your house, where you decide to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very hungry, and decided to eat what was either in the house or decided to order something.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s hard to press the buttons on the phone with your fat fingers, but you manage to do it and get a man on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, welcome to Marco\u2019s, can I take your order?\u201d He asks in a sort of monotonous voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019d like 12 dozen pizzas please.\u201d You say in your deeper, sexier, Blob-ier voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, a-a dozen pizzas\u2026\u201d He seems a bit surprised, \u201cThat\u2019ll be\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not ONE dozen pizzas, TWELVE dozen.\u201d You repeat yourself, licking your lips as you think of how delicious they\u2019ll be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Twelve dozen\u2026?\u201d He sounds lost for words, \u201cBut, sir, that\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c144 pizzas.

Still, if it\u2019s worth what you paid for it, you don\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up on the man, you go to the kitchen to prepare a \u2018small snack\u2019 out of almost everything in your fridge to help tied you over. It hardly helps. All you want is pizza! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after far too long, the doorbell rings. You run over to it, massive footsteps shaking your house and causing pictures to fall off the walls and furniture to fall over like a small earthquake. Opening the door, you see the deliveryman with several pizza boxes stacked high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Is this the right address\u2026?\u201d He asked, unable to see behind the tower of pizzas. \u201cIt is.\u201d You reply as you greedily take the boxes from him, rip open the first one, and start chowing down. He stares at you, \u201cA-Are you\u2026 Fred Dukes?\u201d You cock an eyebrow and give him a sly smile, \u201cMaybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deliveryman stands there in awe as he looks up at the huge figure in front of him. It makes you feel powerful. \u201cIs this all the pizzas?\u201d You ask. The man shakes his head. \u201cN-No sir\u2026 T-There\u2019s more in the car\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, go get them and bring them in then\u2026\u201d after effortlessly finishing your slice, you wipe your greasy hand on your singlet as you stand aside to let the man into your house behind your massive belly. \u201cI\u2019m very hungry\u2026\u201d You grin at the amazed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the couch with the pizza boxes in your arms, you finish off slice after slice, before eventually the whole box is gone. You let out a big BUUUUURRRP before tossing the empty box aside and starting on the next. The man hasn\u2019t even made it in with all your pizzas yet, and you\u2019ve already finished a whole box and started on another one. \u201cDamn! How fast can you eat?\u201d He wonders. You shrug, \u201cThis is kinda new for me\u201d. You\u2019re already halfway done with your second box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brings the rest of them inside, with great difficulty, as you polish off box after box. As he carries in the last of the 144 boxes, you take them off his hands, having finished the ones he had initially handed you, and start going to town on them. The deliveryman can\u2019t stop staring. \u201cYou like to eat, huh?\u201d You\u2019re about to answere, before you hear a creaking noice. Suddenly, the couch you\u2019re sitting on snaps in half and drops you to the floor. You laugh loudly, \u201cI guess you could say that! Haha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is completely transfixed on you. You know he should\u2019ve already left by now, but, noticing his stare, and the bulge in his pants, you smile. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d He blushes as you notice him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s natural when confronted with a man like me! You can sit with me if you want.\u201d You finish off another box, and let out another belch, \u201cI\u2019d like the company.\u201d The deliveryman gulps as he walks over and sits beside you on the destroyed couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can sit on my knee if that\u2019s more comfortable.\u201d He shakes his head, \u201cNo, this is\u2026 fine\u2026\u201d He rests against your fat belly as you continue to eat, and eat, and eat from the pile of pizzas beside you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You pull it off the rack and head to the change rooms, then start pulling it on. The costume consists of a pair of breeches, some shoes, a leather vest, a cape, and a crown. The fabric is surprisingly comfortable and silky - kind of like the stuff an actual king would wear. Sadly, it's all several sizes too large for you, and you look ridiculous. You pick up the label that came with the costume, which shows a fat, bearded man dressed in the same clothes you are in currently. Beneath him are the words \"One size fits all!\" - yeah right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, then move to take off the cape when you realise that the costume has gotten tighter. Odd, you don't remember tightening anything; maybe the outfit's shrinking? You look down, and discover that the costume's not shrinking - you're growing! Your flat stomach is bulging outwards, and your pecs are following suit - within seconds, the vest is stretched tight around your generous gut and breasts. Your arms and legs swell, and layer upon layer of thick blubber begins to fill in the costume. As you grow fatter, a thick beard sprouts over your (now double) chin. You grasp at your growing body, and try to take off the outfit, but your swelling fingers make it nigh impossible to undo the buckles and clasps. Not that it matters, anyway - they're about to break anyway, since your swelling body has stretched them to their limit. But, just as the buckle around your swollen paunch seems ready to burst, you stop growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear god, the costume's tight - nearly every buckle and strap is digging into your skin in some way. At least now that you've stopped growing, you can loosen a few of them - you undo the clasp on the belt, and your stomach explodes outward. The rest of the buckles also loosen, for some reason, and the pressure around your body lessens; you end up sagging outwards a few more inches in the process. Time to see what you look like - you turn to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat, bearded man looks back at you through the glass. He seems oddly familiar... Of course - the picture on the label! You take another look at the image, then compare it to your current appearance. The resemblance is uncanny. However, despite the shock you're feeling, you can't help but grin - this is a pretty awesome costume. It'll be perfect for the party, in fact. You leave the change room, and step into...</span></div></div>",

Sort of, it looked like the guy in the picture wearing the costume, but upon closer inspection it was your face on the portiat.

You strip down naked, and put it on. You look in the mirror, and smile. But then, you feel like you're in pain. You clutch your sides for confort, but the pain started to grow stronger. You started to notice some changes to your eye color on the mirror when a jolt of pain came from your back, forcing you into all fours. Sweat startx to drip from your brown hair as you felt the costume tighten around your petite frame. Suddenly, a tightening noise comes from the top half of the costume as it started to tigthen around the back.<br>\r\nYou could feel all your muscles revoltously changing size, growing out of their normal proportions in a very fast pace. Again you heard the back of the costume tightening and an excrusiating pain on your back as you felt your body somehow shrinking.<br>\r\n Another loud <i>TIGHTEN!</i> sound, and the top half became ao tight you felt like it would burst off. You noticed that your skin became itchy as it became brown, black and furry, and your back still pulsating in pain of the growth of a new appendage.<br>\r\n You felt the bottom half of the costume tighten, unable to contain your growing legs and torso as they bulged with newly grown muscles.<br>\r\n Soon after, the throbbing feet of the costume starts to bother you too much, so you kicked them away in time to watch her stiill-socked feet bulge with new size, your entire bone structure crackling with the changes.<br>\r\n The unbeareble pain on Your back started to fade a little, only to be traded by another pain on the tips of your fingers and toes. In horror, You watched the hands of the costume tighten as your fingers grew out with newly formed claws in place of nails, and what remained of Your socks was shredded by growing claws on your toes. And soon, your furry butt feels painful as a long tail grows.<br>\r\n This all happened too fast and as fast as the pain came, it started to fade away, leaving you stunned with a plethora of new sensations to explore.<br>\r\n You fainted for some minutes and when you woke up, your sight was all blurry and you had to blink to adjust your eyes to the light. With little effort, you got to your feet and immediately drew your attention to the mirror. \"Where am I? Wow...all that I remember is putting on a German Shepherd costume-OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\n You were overwhelmed by the sight at the mirror before you. In place of you usual self, You saw a very brown and black face with a muzzle, your teeth were now fangs and your usual grass green eyes were now a shade of brown. <br>\r\n You looked around your body, newly changed it was still strange to you. You were definitely a bit smaller and your slim teenage frame was now a very curvy and athletic build. To add, you even had a collar around your neck<br>\r\n As you took a step, you immediately felt that the soles of her feet were a little more sensitive. \"Oh my, what should I do? If that pain from earlier made me become a German Shepherd Hybrid, what has it done to my friends?\"<br>\r\n You, seeing you had teats and a vagina, were embarresed.You then found a towel and put it on to cover your new animal female parts. You were actually thinking about leaving the room and seeing what had gone outside. Still, you started to think about what manner of fate awaited you if you left the dressing room.</span></div></div>",
