For two whole months to boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahooooooooo!\" Martin exclaimed, and with a sudden burst of energy, threw the covers aside and stood up in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two whole Months with no Mom, no Diana, and no mission!\" Martin shouted, jumping up and down on his bed in euphoria before finally jumping down onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do I do now?\" He asked himself, walking downstairs into the kitchen and putting some bread into the toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what am I doing? Toast? I can eat anything I want!\" Martin shout, abandoning the toaster, and instead yanking open the freezer door and pulling out an unopened tub of Double Chocolate Swirl ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin then proceeded, to grab any and all available junk food he could find; chips, cookies, candy, popcorn, soda, chocolate; and relocating it to the recliner in the living room. He even ordered a few pizzas, though the people there were a little surprised anyone wanted a pizza this early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to himself, Martin pulled up the foot rest on the recliner and began to munch on some potato chips and his ice cream as he switched on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Mom being who she was, she had been entitled to a few perks, and as such, their TV had nearly every channel known to man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin fliched, as a drop of cold ice cream fell from his spoon onto his exposed skin. Since it WAS his vacation, he hadn't even other to get dressed, and was still in his boxers. Not wanting to waste even the slightest bit of his food, Martin ran his finger across the drop and then licked the drop off of his finger. He'd have to eat the ice cream fast if he didn't want it to melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging channels, Martin smirked to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be an awesome vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
