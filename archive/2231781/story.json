She had a blast full of hours of dancing! Though had accidently taken her old boots, which where a bit too small for her big delicate feet. And hours later, are feeling terribly sore. Unluckily the same day her car was at the shop...<br>\r\nAbout an hour later she grew close to home, but took a stop at a park bench, where an old lady sat too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Hopefully she won't mind, I really need to take these things off for a moment!\"</div><br>\r\nShe says to herself, as she begins to tug at her tight boots. Eventually, she gets each off with a sigh of relief, wiggling her pudgy, sweat-drenched toes to the cool air.<br>\r\nThough the lady beside her was not as thrilled about it. In-fact, she could smell the funk her sore feet and boots let out, even outside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Ugh, young lady, can you please put your shoes back on? They REEK!</div><br>\r\nShe grumbled. But Chelsea ignored, paying little attention to anything besides airing her tired soles, and letting them breath. <br>\r\nAfter asking a few more times, the lady got up and walked away, grumbling something... Little had Chelsea known, it was a curse! A curse that would make things worse, starting tomarrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>The Next Morning...</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
