You also have a very fit body with impressive musculature, large pecs, 8-pack stomache and huge round biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you stay so fit, not by training your combat skills. You train your bed skills with your lioness queen, or should I say queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Lion you can have several wives and you take the advantage of it pretty well, picking the most beautyful and sexual lionesses in the land. You currently have 4 of them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeka - a 25 year old blond lioness with with big boobs and wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasa - 20 year lioness with short black hair, and hourglass figure and a nag for the kink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIla - 21 another brunette lioness with darker fur and pretty curvey ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSana - 18 year old lioness, also blond and with the set of boobs bigger than her head, which seems pretty empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, all of your wives are a bit ditzy in various degrees. Also they all have pretty short hair (in various styles), being female lions. They all love living in luxury, being worshipped and having sex. In fact that what's most of what you do all day. The land is at peace and people (furries) are happy, so you don't have much to do. All you do all days if fucking in various ways, or have fun in other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it's not's just between you and your wives all the time. Sometimes either you or one (or more) of your ladies want to have fun with your subjects of people at your castle. Sometimes it's you with a main, or they with one of the guards. Your wives enjoy teasing your older advisors with their \"features\" in their reveiling outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time you like to go out (officially or not) to the city or even country and meet some local ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does your story begin?</span></div></div>",

You usually ignore the scolding of your first minister Cera, (who, despite being a deep rack bovine, was smart as a whip)  , but as you are current surrounded by the naked furry flesh of your Queens, maybe, just maybe making sure the kingdom run smoothly from king to King, (or queen) may be more important.

Now though, you sat up straight, holding your head high and looking down the grand throne room at the far door. You quickly smoothed your dress across your voluptuous body and made sure that your circlet crown was properly seated amongst the locks of hair spilling from atop your head. Today would be the culmination of nearly a month of diplomacy and military action, and there was no reason to not look your best for the occasion. The neighboring nation of Ethor had proven to be a bit too aggressive in recent years, and you and council decided it was time for a response other than calmly repelling their forays. Now, each of the high ranking noble and merchant families of Ethor was being forced to turn over at least one son or daughter to serve you and your lords and ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your royal guardsmen entered the hall, his armor gleaming in the sunlight streaming through the skylight that ran the length of the room, and his long cloak billowing behind him as he quickly marched along. His quick strides soon covered the distance and he dropped into a bow before your throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Grace, the tributes have arrived as you requested. There were some minor squabbles on the trip, but no major injuries were inflicted as you commanded,\u201d the tall fox said without lifting his gaze from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bid him to rise and told him that he had done very well. There was only a slight hint of a curl to the edge of his lips, but you knew that was quite a response from the usually restrained man. He barked out a command and the far doors now swung wide open as a crowd of people were brought in with guards flanking them on every side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with a quick glance, you could see how most wore what would have been high quality clothing, but were now more than a little worn and shabby looking due to the long journey. Ranging from teens to adults, most of their number looked to be young adults. The number of species present was numerous, as was the shapes that they came in. Some were rail thin, while others were so fat they looked to have trouble walking about; some were exceedingly tall, while others looked to be almost child sized. You also noted that more than a few of the females were pregnant, adding further to the number of people that had been turned over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards stopped the crowd so that the closest were still a number of paces back from you, giving what should be ample time for any possible threats to be dealt with. It didn\u2019t look like most of them would be much trouble though, too shocked and hopeless about their new situation. Despite the number of people before you, your gaze caught on one in particular.</span></div></div>",

Never once did she look up and stare in awe at the grandeur that surrounded her, unlike many of her peers. Her dress hugged her curves, especially around her breasts, breasts that were nearly but not quite the size of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only finally looked up when you started speaking, your voice ringing off of the walls; \u201cChildren of Ethor, welcome to Asmen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom somewhere in the crowd, you heard someone shout out, \u201cAs if we had a choice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling right past that comment, you continued, \u201cTo ensure the survival of your homeland, you families have made a sacrifice: each and every one of you here today. I will admit your lives will almost certainly be far different than those you experienced before, but remember that your presence here in Asmen ensures the continued existence of your families and your nation. Do as you all are told, and you may even come to enjoy your new lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your speech, you noticed that some of the crowd below you sank even deeper into despair, while others looked decidedly angrier with the situation.

You gave the command for the whole lot of them to be escorted away from your palace, cleaned and given new clothes, before showing them to their temporary lodging. In the coming days, lords and ladies would come and choose to take one or more to serve as desired. A number of them would be remaining with you though, mostly to add to your palace staff; you had a special plan already for that dragoness though. A quick motion over your shoulder brought one of your handmaidens scurrying beside you; the white tigress bowing low before waiting patiently for what you wanted her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelena, do you see that dragoness over there, the one with the black hair,\u201d pointing her out to Selena. \u201cSend word for her to be brought to me tonight after the initial preparations have been made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shall be my pleasure, Your Grace,\u201d the tigress said, bowing again before darting off to carry out your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2013+\u2013+\u2013</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed quickly, there were several matters of state that you had to take care of including confirming the arrival of the tributes to your council. Throughout the entire time though, you often found yourself letting your mind wander and imagining that dragoness, only to need to shake the thoughts away and return to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was, later that evening, now finished with the day\u2019s tasks and your supper, you sat alone in your chambers, fingers toying with the stem of your wine glass as the wind blew from the balcony bringing the scent of flowers with it. A knock on your door was followed by your voice calling out and the response that it was a pair of your guards bringing the dragoness as you had requested. You bade them to enter and they did so allowing you your first up close glance at the dragoness. You could now see that she was even more beautiful now that she had been cleaned up, her scales each looking like tiny jewels that shimmered as she moved. She also stood taller than you had estimated, nearly matching your own exceptional height. Piercing violet hued eyes briefly looked up at you before returning to their usual location on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dismissing Selena from your service for the night and telling the guards to go about their duty, you told the dragoness to sit down with you.</span></div></div>",

You resumed toying with your wineglass while looking her over again. The dragoness kept her eyes firmly placed on the table now; she gave a slight shudder in response to your scrutiny, but she didn\u2019t make any other moves or try to get away from your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me your name, please,\u201d you finally requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at you with those luminous eyes again, and momentarily compressed her lips before hurriedly responding, \u201cMir\u2026Miranda\u2026Knight.\u201d Though they were out of sight, you could tell that her hands were fidgeting beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Miranda Knight?\u2019\u201d you repeated and received a quick nod in return. \u201cSo you would be daughter of Bartholomew Knight, the textile importer, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes briefly widened in surprise and she went stiff, before relaxing just slightly, nodding again, and saying, \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d Then as an afterthought, she added \u201cMy lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight smile tugged at the edges of your lips before you said, \u201cThe typical way of addressing me would be \u2018Your Grace\u2019 but I suppose I can let that slide this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe visibly and audibly gulped before blurting out \u201cThank you, Your Grace,\u201d and bowing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back slightly in your chair you then asked, \u201cDid you get enough food on the journey? I suppose it wouldn\u2019t quite be up to the standards you were used to eating, but did you go hungry at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Your Grace\u2026that wasn\u2019t an issue. We all\u2026\u201d You could see how she almost suppressed a shudder before she started again, \u201cNone of the \u2018tributes\u2019 went hungry on the journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head again; glad to hear that match up with the report given by the guards as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, this isn\u2019t necessary then,\u201d you said reaching over and pulling the covers off several other plates that were waiting on the table. Between them, there was more food than most people would eat in an entire day. After uncovering the last one though, a sly grin crossed your face as you said, \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t let this go to waste, should we? Why don\u2019t you have it anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in shock again and it was obvious that she was thinking about resisting, but seemed to remember her new situation as she then pulled the first plate closer to her and dug in. Sipping your remaining wine, you watched as she soon finished off the first plate and reached for the second. That one went just a bit slower though and halfway through the third there was no doubt that she was starting to struggle. Her breathing was quick and she started letting off little burps to try relieving some of the pressure. You watched with a smile as she would often a stop for a moment and reach at least one hand down to rub at her overstuffed stomach, before getting right back to it no matter how her body felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stood up, she faltered for a moment as you slipped around behind her. Her shock further compounded when you slid your arms down around her, your long dexterous fingers kneading her turgid belly. She quickly resumed glutting herself, though you could see her eyes glisten briefly before she blinked the partially formed tears away lest they fall. With you whispering encouragement and easing her bloated stomach, Miranda soon finished off the last of the food you provided her. Her eyes were unfocused and her breathing was still strained, but you thought you could see the hint of something approaching pleasure in her face as well, but it was hard to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your seat again, you saw how Miranda had returned her eyes to the table. Reaching over, you lightly pushed up on her chin so that she was staring right at you. A blush colored her cheeks but she didn\u2019t try resisting. As you started to slide your hand away, you thought again and instead mopped up a bit of the leftovers that clung around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your fingers directly in front of her, you commanded, \u201cLick them clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her mental sharpness returned enough that she hesitated for just a moment before slowly extending her forked tongue and licking your fingers until they were free of all traces of her meal. You praised her for a job well done before giving her a moment to rest. You then took your hand away, though she didn\u2019t instantly turn her gaze down away from you, instead it lingered on you for several seconds before slowly drifting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, slowly recovering and digesting, you could tell that there was something on her mind, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to say whatever it was. You decided there was little point in rushing matters for now, so you let her work through her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she seemed to overcome her reluctance, \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026heard\u2026rumors\u2026about you\u2026\u201d turning her gaze up towards you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d you asked, \u201cWhat rumors would those be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ones about\u2026\u201d Miranda fussed with her hair and bit her lip before she finally blurted out, \u201cThe ones about you having magic, and that is reason why your forces were able to defeat us\u2026again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, those rumors,\u201d you started, nodding in understanding.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes, the part about how I have magic, that\u2019s true,\u201d you responded and just to prove the point, you waved your hand and a small orb of lightning appeared above your palm, cracking with energy and filling the air with the sharp tang of ozone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda jerked back in her seat, and you chuckled slightly at her reaction. With a quick flex of your fingers, the ball flared briefly before flashing out of existence with a small bang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was not personally involved with the defense against your nation, and my magic didn\u2019t play a part either,\u201d you proclaimed as the last little sparks faded away. \u201cThe rumor that I used my \u2018demon magic\u2019 to curse Ethor\u2019s armies is just that, a rumor made to cover up the fact that your leaders continue to pick fights they cannot hope to win. That is why I had you all brought here, to help encourage the Ethor leadership to stop these futile and wasteful attacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on the dragoness\u2019s face showed that she had heard every word but didn\u2019t look quite convinced either. With a sigh, you decided that was a matter for another time. Ringing a small bell, you summoned one of your guards. Vivian \u2013 a tall and lithe rabbit\u2013 swept into the room, her relatively light armor doing little to impede her quick pace. Her half cape was also in its usual place around her shoulder, helping to disguise her missing arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow may I serve you, Your Grace?\u201d she asked bowing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted how she kept an eye pointed Miranda\u2019s eye even as she waited for your command; \u201cGuide Miranda here to her rooms, and see that she is settled in for the night. And send word for some of the kitchen staff to come up; I\u2019m finished with dinner,\u201d emptying your wineglass to illustrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crisp nod was the response and the rabbit beckoned for the dragoness to follow. Miranda momentarily hesitated again before getting to her feet; a groan was easily audible before she cradled her swollen stomach. She briefly looked over her shoulder before they reached the door, though you were more content to watch the sway of her hips and tail as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, you called for a bath to be prepared as well and spent some time enjoying the warm water surrounding you. Eventually \u2013thoroughly cleaned \u2013 you retired to bed, your dreams filled with interactions with Miranda and what you were going to do with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2013+\u2013+\u2013</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your plans had to be postponed as over the coming days, you were kept far busier than usual. Between picking some others from among the tributes to be added to your staff, and settling disputes over who received certain high demand members of the tributes, all in addition to the other duties that you had for your realm, there was little time left for yourself and Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did keep an eye on her through your various guards and servants though, and the story was much the same no matter who you heard it from: the dragoness kept mostly to herself, and for the first couple of days she never even left her rooms. Eventually she did work up the nerve to ask some of the guards about the gardens behind the palace and if she could visit them. According to what you were told, she was utterly surprised by how she was told that you had already ordered that she was free to explore the palace and the surrounding grounds. From then on, almost the entire time that she wasn\u2019t by herself in her rooms was spent in some of the more secluded spots throughout the gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you were almost getting ready to make some time for Miranda, no matter what. Fortunately, an opportunity presented itself before you had to force the issue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Feast of Voella was coming. With everything else happening, the event had almost slipped your mind. Looking out over the city below, you could make out the colored streamers waving in the breezes. The wind also carried the scent of the festival foods being prepared. You inhaled deep, filling your nose with the aromas and your mind with memories of simpler times. Then you turned back to the table and the task at hand. A blight had taken hold in one of the northern regions, affecting much of their produce. Tensions were rising as supply lines stretched and storehouses ran low. The fear of the affliction spreading gripped the neighboring regions as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours sped past as you and your council debated and deliberated. Anger boiled beneath the surface, sometimes boiling over before stabilizing. Your head pounded like a blacksmith's hammer as a plan started to come together. Out of the many proposals, a compromise built out of the parts of most came forth. It was far from perfect, but it had the best possible chance of success. The council left then, to carry out the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instead slumped back in your chair, massaging your head, paying particular attention to the area around your curving horns. Summoning Selena, you gave her orders to send for the royal physician, and bring him to your bedchambers. She bowed low before carrying out your order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to your rooms, you didn\u2019t have to wait long. The wizened wolf pulled at his snowy beard as you explained the issue. Predicting what the situation was from previous times, he pulled out a tincture he already prepared. He expressed some concern for how often this was happening. You waved his worries away, taking the vial. Gulping the bitter mix down, you felt a shiver pass down your spine. Shaking it off, you could feel no relief yet, but knew that it would be a while more before the pounding ache would lessen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless the wolf went on about too much stress in your life, and that you should find some relief before anything worse happened. You commented that the festival would help with that, and you were hoping that something else would work out. The wolf scowled, but still agreed that it might prove beneficial before he took his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you next summoned your handmaidens to begin your own preparations for the festival. The headache faded away during the process. It did little to improve your mood though as they scrubbed you clean, styled your hair , and then dressed you in layers upon layers of clothing. You felt a bit like a fool buried under so much finery, but it was part of the ceremony. One bright spot carried you through, that of seeing Miranda again. One of your handmaidens said that her preparations were well underway as well. The dragoness proved to be more than a little confused by the circumstances and activities, but went along with them with no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last lingering traces of the sun cast their glow across the clouds as your entourage escorted you from your chambers to begin the festival.</span></div></div>",

There is fear, resignation, defiance, murderous rage on a few...and then...hmmm, this is interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze rests on a male who upon first glance seems singularly unremarkable.  The wild and the exotic are all there, but here...standing at just below average height with a wiry but toned build, is a canine of the pitbull variety.  His clothing is certainly of quality, but simple.  Built for function over form.  His bruises seem only cursory, showing that he probably didn't pick many fights on his way over, but his build and stance show someone who could fight (and likely win) if he chose to, suggesting toughness over raw power.  It's his expression that catches you.  What is it?  It is not fearful or submissive, yet not overtly defiant either.  He simply seems to be watching, learning, taking everything in and processing it.  Then he meets your gaze without fear or anger, but a kind of...interest.  This fellow is indeed a curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're familiar with typical canine social structures.  They tend to have the drive to rise to nobility, but not ruling class.  Most of them work for those of higher station and maintain their place in the social hierarchy by carving out niches as valuable servants and entrepreneurs.  But woe to those who betray them.  Once a canine has given his trust and it has been betrayed, you must kill him and make very certain he is dead, or he will not stop until the betrayal has been avenged seven fold.  One thing about canines that is nearly universal:  they are very thorough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that one such as he could be highly valuable to you if you can convince him to give you his loyalty willingly, and so long as you do not sacrifice that loyalty through betrayal, but it would take time and effort to secure that.  Are you up to the challenge, or would you prefer to dally with someone easier to handle?</span></div></div>",
