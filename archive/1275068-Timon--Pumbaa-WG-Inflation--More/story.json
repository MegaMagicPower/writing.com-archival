And one stinkbug was crawling in the half open mouth of one snoring Meerkat. At the moment anyway. <br>\r\n\"ACK! PTHBBBBB! YUCK!\" The cry rang out over the savanna from a nearby oasis. <br>\r\nMuch closer at hand, another creature stirred. \"Timon? Is that you? What happened?\" The companion of the meerkats muttered groggily and stretched slowly. Nearby he could see Timon head down in the stream, making all sorts of sputtering noises. <br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what happened,\" The irate meerkat muttered. \"I was having a nice dream about the most delicious succulent grubs in the world... And then I wake up to find a stinkbug in my mouth!\" <br>\r\nThe warthog winced. \"Ew, nasty!\" <br>\r\n\"Exactly Pumba. It's gonna take the rest of the day to try and get the taste out of my mouth. If I can it all.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Though it is kind of weird don't ya think?\" <br>\r\nTimon gave Pumba an odd look. True the Warhog was not terribly bright, but he had his moments, and Timon had learned that, while annoying, such moments were not to be ignored. \"What Pumba?\" <br>\r\n\"It's just that we're bug lovers and yet stink bugs are gross. Don't you think that's weird?\" <br>\r\nThis apparently was not one of those times. <br>\r\n\"Pumba, they're /stink/ bugs! How appetizing can they be if they smell so bad!?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh. Right.\" <br>\r\nTimon sighed. \"I need a little time alone. See you in a bit.\" <br>\r\nAnd without looking back, Timon strode off through the undergrowth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth the walk lasted a lot longer than a little while. Not that Timon would ever admit he was lost in a place he'd called home for a few years now, but he'd never learned the full layout of the place. And with every underbrush smack in the face his bad mood grew. Finally Timon slumped down under a bush to stew. He'd barely sat down for a minute though when the nasty taste in his mouth asserted itself again. <br>\r\nGagging Timon tried grabbing some nearby leaves to wipe his tongue down with. Oddly enough, Timon found the taste dissipating. <br>\r\n\"Mm, these leaves aren't so bad.\" he smiled, glad to finally have that taste out of his mouth. Plucking another leaf from the bush he was sitting under, he looked at it closely, but to him it looked no more special than any other plant. Hesitantly he nibbled on the leaf surprised at how good it tasted. It was like his dream from last night had some true, though he was surprised to find himself thinking plant leaves were tasty. <br>\r\nDowning the leaf in a few chomps he began gathering more to take back with him to Pumba, but as he started walking he started munching on the leaves as well. And before he was even out of sight of the bush, he was surprised to discover the bushel he'd had in his arms was almost all gone. <br>\r\n\"What the heck...?\" Timon turned and went back to the bush and began gathering more. This time he'd made it even less distance before the leaves were all eaten. <br>\r\n\"Something weird's going on here.\" <br>\r\nThen came a loud noise through the bushes. It was...</span></div></div>",

Behind the bushes Timon could not believe what he saw. Pumbaa had stuffed his face with the leaves (looked just like the one's he had been eating) and had expanded in size Timon got worried. Would this happen to him too?<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" asked Timon for his own concern more than Pumbaa's.<br>\r\n\"I started looking for bugs in these bushes. I could not find no bugs and I was hungry, so I ate the leaves. They tasted so delicious. The next thing I know I became fat.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean fatter!\" Timon pointed out to his pig pal and burst out laughing.<br>\r\nSuddenly Timon felt a weird sensation inside of him. \"What's going on?\" Timon asked Pumbaa. Pumbaa didn't reply. All of a sudden Timon expands to but became bigger than Pumbaa. Timon was so obese he could not move.<br>\r\nPumbaa's eyes glowed in the sight of his big fat friend and started laughing back at Timon. \"You ate the leaves too!\"<br>\r\n\"So what if I did! I might like being fat!\" Timon tried to think positive about the situation even though it was hard. \"Why do you think these plants make us grow fat?\"<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard a laughing nearby.

Shenzi, Bonzai, and Ed paced around two of the fattest, juiciest looking butterballs they'd ever seen, drool spilling from their mouths and wetting the ground before them.  Pumbaa backed into Timon, his rear resting against Timon's fat-laiden back, Timon's head simply sunk into his bulk and stared at the monsters before him.  \"Uh...oh...\" Pumbaa whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that!\"  Bonzai spoke with resounding glee.  \"Just one of these guys could stuff you for a year!\" He prodded at Pumbaa's flabby belly, straining to hold in his giggling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi laughed almost as hard and stuck her face in the massive body of Timon.  \"What about this porker!?  Hahahahahah!  I think I'd explode if I took a bite outta him!\"  Ed merely jabbered and broke into hysterics at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-now, now!\" Timon attempted to pull his plump face from his bulked out body, wobbling and quivering as he shifted his weight, stifling a belch at the same time.  Pumbaa's overengorged rear end still resting warmly on his back.  \"What's all this talk of biting, and eating?  What kinda mook do you take us for?  We're...we're horrible tasting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...y-yeah!\"  Pumbaa chimed in, his chins quivering as he attempted to look back at his tubby buddy.  \"Horrible tasting!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!  And you wouldn't wanna know what my friend here is filled with!\" Timon stated matter-of-factly about his flatulent friend.  \"Right!...Wait, what?\" Pumbaa looked confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi shook with laughter, Bonzai and Ed joined in, their booming laughing shaking every fat cell in Timon and Pumbaa's body, the hyenas mouths opened so wide as they laughed, slobber flecked against the duo's bods.  \"These tubs think they're funny!\"  Shenzi bellowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hurt!  Hahahah!  We've gotta shut them up!\"  Bonzai was rolling in the dirt and holding his pot-belly.  Shenzi suddenly stopped laughing and the air filled with a serious tone, she snapped and snarled in Timon's face, pressing her snout against his own.  \"Problem is...I'M still hungry big butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon stuttered, his body wobbled violently as he shook with fear...he was too heavy to run, he was going to have to do something.  \"Then...then that's perfect!  We've got JUST the thing!  These fabulous leaves here...\" Timon held up one of the surviving leaves, thankfully hidden in one of his fatty side rolls \"...These are guaranteed to stuff you silly!  You'll never need another meal...particularly of the warthog and meerkat type, heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi snarled, spittle flying against Timon's face.  \"I don't LIKE salads...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, just...try it?  What could it hurt!??\"  Timon could feel his flab shaking, Pumbaa's weighty butt pushing further into his back.

The stripes that lined his back were almost like perverted landing strips on the hills that lined his back.

His body continued to slowly spread out around him, any hope of mobility gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch watched, a smirk plastered across her face.  Her plan was working perfectly.

She'd not anticipated such a willing victim, Timon was becoming a foul monstrous blob, and she couldn't be more excited.  As a few of the insects crawled past her ankles she stepped out of the room, deciding now was as good a time as any to tend to the brew's workings.  Perhaps she was going to get more than she bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's grotesque bulk wobbled and sloshed about, his plump face dripped saliva and bug goop as he chomped on another juicy bug.  \"THIS is the life!  I haven't had bugs this delicious in...I don't think ever!\"  He suckled his fat sausage-like fingers and belched wetly, Timon's plump tongue slipping across his lips.  He couldn't believe the luck he was having, and strangely enough, the insects weren't running away like normal, in fact they seemed to be helping themselves up his flab and to his mouth.  Blissful ignorance kept Timon enthralled at the girth of some of the bugs as they appeared from under his fat rolls, coated in his sweat.  His flesh seemed alive, quivering as they worked their way from every inch of his body, some from between his rear and tail, some under his thick chin folds, it was a sickening sight for most...but for Timon, he'd died and gone to Meerkat Heaven!  \"Oh if Pumbaa could see me now...BEEEUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of the plump, beetle-like insects had positioned themselves around Timon's fat mouth, working their legs between his lips and forcing his maw open.  He eyed the bugs curiously, but by this point he wasn't quite nimble enough to make the movement to swipe them away.  Soon, though, nearly all of the insects had gathered on top of his enormous body, forming a line from an unknown origin past his horizon rivalling gut.  Timon's eyes looked over his beachballed cheeks at one of the largest bugs in the room, a juggernaut of bugdom, bigger than Timon's fat head, and it was working its way up his chins until it was staring Timon in the face.  It clacked and twiddled its mouth parts at Timon before turning around, exposing it's enormous abdomen and sliding it between Timon's lips (with the help of the trio) and resting it on his tongue.  Timon's mouth gushed with drool, it was DARING him to eat it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insect rubbed it's thick lower body in Timon's mouth, teasing and tantalizing the near shapeless meerkat.  Without another thought Timon obliged and bit down with all his might.   He felt the abdomen explode in his mouth, and it was amazing.  The bug was split in two, slimey bug guts coated Timon's mouth, chins, nose, and as if on cue Timon opened his mouth and let his tongue wrap the rest of the juggernaut insect and dragged it into his fat face, crunching it up, snorting and looking at all the bugs as they watched him back.  Timon felt himself mentally floating from the taste sensation, and in that instant his body swelled and distended all over, rolls of sweaty furry flab slapped against the walls and rolled on top of itself, bugs getting trapped and tossed into the air as the meerkat ballooned and grew, flesh filling the room tight.  Timon's tail had become nothing more than a fat knob that barely rose from between hilly butt cheeks.  His arms swelled, looking as though they'd burst from their furred casing before more of the bulk swallowed them, Timon was seemingly totally helpless.  It was the magical bug's cue, and they marched to their destiny in Timon's stomach...</span></div></div>",

As if on cue, the insects began to march up his humongous fleshy gut and into his salivating, mouth.  He welcomed them with his gaping maw.  He let many pile in before crunching down on them, their bug guts oozing with flavor and dripping down his maw.  By now his many neck rolls and chins were sticky from his meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRP!!\" Timon belched, his body quivering.  He was such a fat slob, but he loved every minute of it.  Who cares if he was disgustingly obese, as long as he could eat as much as he wanted, whenever he wanted, it was just fine by him.  Not to mention his new flabby bulk was kinda enjoyable to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch peeked in to see how her fatty victim was doing.  She was surprised to see he was filling the room rather tightly.  Before he could bust out of the room, she quickly chanted some spells and in an instant, the walls around the monstrous meerkat seemed to spread farther apart.  Timon's cellulite flab flopped from the walls to the ground, now more space for him to grow, but by how much?  Timon was still voraciously gorging himself on the bugs.  The witched wondered how someone so small could eat so much and still continue to grow.  She was growing a bit impatient, even though she enjoyed stuffing this meerkat to immobility and then some. \"Just how much can he eat,\" she thought.  She decided...</span></div></div>",

His eyes clenched in pain, and before he even had his lips around the bug's rear end, another massive juicy bug had begun to pry Timon's mouth open and stuff itself in after it's commrade.  Timon's entire head took on the bulbous shape of an over-ripe melon, each bug squirmed and worked it's way into his belly before it felt as if they'd exploded inside of him.  Timon belched louder than before, the room shook as drool and bug slime pouring from his mouth and coated his fat rippled front.  Timon sat, goop dripping from his snout as he noticed the bugs appeared to be getting further and further away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, Timon was merely growing AGAIN, his body distended not only outward, but upward too, his rear end grew higher until he could see each cheek and his dinky plump knob of a tail, and his own belly reaching higher than anything he'd seen before.  The stripes on his back had become larger and lighter now, his fur becoming stretched so far on endless rolls.  His head was located in what now appeared to be a \"pit\" of fat rings, the lowest spot in the center of the Timon land mass.  His cheeks hung well past his mouth and bunched up around the corners of the pit, slobber dribbled from his mouth as he watched the monster bugs leaping into the feeding pit.  As a couple more bugs stretched his lips over their bodies Timon's body groaned and sloshed, his butt blubber shook and vibrated and an enormous fart billowed out, the wind coating the insects and filling the air.  His body dripped with sweat from the heat increase in the room, as a few more gasious releases exploded from the meerkat.  Timon could only think momentarily how he could rival Pumbaa with ease.  His head swollen grotesquely large with three of the bugs inside his mouth, crawling down his esophogus, the oblivious meerkat only thought of how they could use some salt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch groaned and spat, this blob was going to be the size of the planet before things were said and done, he'd eat himself into eternity given the chance!</span></div></div>",

The witch tried to expand the room again, but the room could only be enlarged so much.  Her previous spells were using up too much of her magic.

The spell also altered one thing.  The insects began behaving more erratic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch walked up to the gargantuan meerkat and explained his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fat slob!

Timon could only listen helplessly as he learned of his fate.  He could not say a word as the bugs stuffed into his stretched mouth.  He noticed something else.  The insects were acting more aggressive than they were before.  They seemed to swarm over him, looking for a way in.  They soon found one in Timon's \"back door.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bugs began to huddle behind Timon's gaseous rear and force their way under and between his monstrous butt cheeks.  He shivered as they squeezed their way in, determined to find a way inside.  The first bug to reach his tailhole was just as large as the one's forcing their way in his maw.  The insect, forced and clawed his way inside, stretching the meerkat's rear.  The next bug followed suit and so on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch laughed again.  \"One last thing.

He felt the bug burst inside of his head, filling it like a balloon with goop, and soon he had bugs on either side of his tiny ears, stretching the canals large enough and sliding inside.  Timon's head was swollen so grotesquely large, he felt like it would pop like a zit.  BLOOSH!  Bug guts squirted from his ears and out his nostrils as the large insects spilled themselves inside the meerkat, his head deflating into it's still bloated fat form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's body grew and grew and distorted further, countless folds of his furred flesh oozed out the windows of the building until a muffled CRACKOOM! sent the walls collapsing outward, the ceiling debris fell into Timon's flab and was quickly swallowed up by the ballooning flesh.  Timon looked like a tick, feeding off the planet itself, there he sat amongst the jungle trees, pulsating and covered in large beetles digging around his flab.  He opened his mouth and moaned in the most miserable of gutteral noises.  Thick drool spilled from his mouth, merely allowing the bugs to lube themselves up as they jumped down his gullet.  With nearly every breath that Timon was allowed to make, his body would swell larger, fat folds collapsing upon themselves and creating new fat masses in a perverted mockery of continental creation.  His sense of up and down was lost, his body sloshed one way and he felt his intestines fill painfully tight...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive fart sent several of the more pervasive insects through the air, limbs of trees blew and snapped off.  Timon's tailhole flexed and finished gassing the unlucky land, but he actually felt a moment of inner-relaxation.  Timon's head oozed from a thick fold of his own body and he looked over his fat cheeks, light, colors, what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Timon I'd been looking everywhere for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that voice...Pumbaa?  \"Puhm...blagh...BLURRRP...\"  What did the witch say?  \"Suffer the same fate?\"  \"PUMBBLAH...BLOOO!  BLOGH AWBLAY!  BLELP!\" thick, viscous strands of saliva spilled from Timon's mouth just before an insect clicked angrily  entering his line of sight, and soon his mouth was stuffed with the fattest insect he'd had in hours.  The only noise afterward was a low-rumbling bit of flatulence from the meerkat blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa stared at his once tiny friend in surprise...he and Timon were no strangers to gorging themselves shapeless...but...something was odd.  \"Timon!  What's the matter?    I can't tell you the places I've looked!  I...\" the warthog snorted and watched as a very large insect shoved itself into his moaning friend's mouth.  \"You found dinner already Timon!  Oh yay!  Yay!  Yay!!\"  He nose-prodded his fat friend, noting to step back as Timon's bulk oozed like lava, folding on itself and easily could have coated the warthog's face in mere moments.  \"Ehhh say, Timon, are you okay?  You must have really found a good nest this time!  That's my buddy!\"  Pumbaa watched as insects seemed to appear from Timon's flab rolls, almost from nowhere... \"Oh boy, oh boy!  I'm so hungry!\" Pumbaa smacked his lips and let his tongue slide out of his mouth, drool spattering the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's pulsating and growth stopped suddenly.  Bugs poked their mandibles out from under his flab and stared down at Pumbaa.  The clueless hog stared back up at his infested friend, hunger in his eyes, and the bugs knew it.  \"PUMBLAH!

Even his long and thin tail had fattened up to the size of a elephant's trunk, bending it was not an option any longer.  So much bulk was being forced onto Pumbaa's chunky frame that it began giving him a hunchbacked appearance.  Pumbaa closed his fat mouth, crunching a dozen of the insects and feeling their gut-filled bodies explode, sending drool and goop splattering down his chins and fat belly mass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-mmm!

The insects blown back, those that hadn't smashed into a tree or rock, all clacked and rolled around, seemingly in pain, legs furiously waving in the air until...each one began swelling up.  None of them reached the sizes of the meerkat and  warthog, but they grew larger and rounder than any of the fat insects had looked before, their carapaces snapped and tore, their abdomens appeared clear before...BAM!

All you could eat all the time, and to food that feeds itself to you.

They crowded around both morbidly obese blob's rears and squeezed their way in between their massive cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's eyes widened in disbelief.  How could they survive that horrible smell!  All seemed lost to him, before his thoughts quickly focused on the bugs invading his rear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, there was a lot more insects than the both of them ever thought imaginable.  Forcing their way into both their rears.  Keeping them both equal size and same rate of fattening.  Their growth seemed to increase now and showed no signs of stopping any  time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa could only let the bugs do their thing, blushing a bit at the way they were being \"fed\".  \"Oh...Looks like we can BUUUUUUUUUUUUURP!  ...give our mouths a rest for a bit...\"  he said, panting heavily.  His large weight now proving to make even the simplest task of talking a chore.  Slobber oozed from his mouth as he talked and breathed.  Every so often, explosive flatulence escaped his rear, often times from Timon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like this was to be their fate for the rest of their lives...</span></div></div>",

Timon and Pumbaa, now too obsessed with growing larger, hardly noticed as they devoured their friends and fellow animals. Still the bugs swarmed over the two obese buddies, and they grew and grew and grew. Soon the two covered the entire planet under their massive flab. Still the bugs did not stop to feed themselves to their masters. It seemed that as fast as the two ate the bugs, more were produced out of the sweaty rolls of their bodies. Soon Pumbaa had eaten so much that his own extremely fat body began to push Timon's up and off the planet itself. Soon Timon was forced onto the moon, leaving Pumbaa to spread his influence over the world. Never one to be outdone, Timon began willing himself to eat faster and faster. Meanwhile, Pumbaa's flesh now covered the entirety of the planet. Still he expanded larger and larger. Timon now covered the entire surface area of the moon twice over. Soon, seemingly as a strange side effect of the curse, each of the creatures' masses had absorbed the celestial body on which they sat into their thick sweaty rolls. Timon soon somehow caught up to Pumbaa. The two continued their gluttony long until they had outgrown even the galaxy that had held them up until now.

In fact, by this new planet's standards, its like they restarted, barely outgrowing the forest...or whats left of it, again.

With a few wet SLORP, SHLOP, BLORP sounds Pumbaa's form deflated, sending the bulbous white mass forward, discarding Pumbaa's fleshy form like some disgusting insect would  It hit the ground with a splat, where it lay for a moment, sloshing around like Pumbaa had been minutes before.  As the mass stirred and lifted itself up, it quickly became apparent that this thing was the spitting image of Pumbaa!  It's wet form glistenend in the sunlight, and by this fact, appeared to be rather translucent, though its eyes had a glowing appearance to them, something Timon found unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ee hee hee, a Fat Golem!\" the evil witch snickered.  \"Clever, I wouldn't have thought you'd figure out a proper counter-curse!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're simple!\"  the good sister rang out, looking over the colossal, and disgusting blob.  \"Just had to collect up the cursed cells and bring 'em out!\"  As she spoke, Pumbaa seemed to stir, blinking, looking around, and then at himself...he was back to normal again!...Mostly!  He was the polar opposite of his previous form, appearing quite emaciated.  \"Uh oh...\" he grunted as he collapsed again, the whole ordeal having taken a toll on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, YOUR turn tubbs!\" the evil witch glared at Timon and pitched a magical shock that hit Timon square in the gut sending him rolling backwards until he slowed to a stop on his back.  His heft rose in the air as he gurgled to breathe, knowing what to expect he opened his mouth, wanting this nightmare to end at last.  The witch, of course, had other plans for Timon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flesh gurgled and surged, the Golem inside forming and pushing around for an exit...and it found one.  Timon's eyes again squeezed from behind fatty sockets as his rear opening began to stretch as if he was having the largest bowel movement of his life.  SHHHHHLORP...FLARP...SPLECH...FRRRRAP.  In the end, Timon was as mortified as he was twig-looking, his anal opening gave way to the birth of his own fat-celled twin, and somehow, the jiggling Timon-Golem was just as unimpressed, and looking just as annoyed at the situation.  </span></div></div>",

Did his gluttony really know no bounds at all?! Meanwhile the fat golems who now controlled his body were scheming, trying to think of what fun they could do now. They were having trouble thinking of anything when a large vibration rumbled through Timon's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....Soooooooo-rrrrryyyyy...\" Timon and the golems heard Pumbaa call from deep within Timon's mighty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Pumbaa was still alive and well not only made Timon incredibly relieved, but also gave the golems a new idea. As Pumbaa rested in the folds of Timon's digestive organs, he began to see something oozing out of the stomach walls. The blobby substance began to crawl toward him, slowly. Had he had the strength or space to run away, he would have, but as he was he was powerless to stop the stuff as it crawled up his face and into his wide mouth and then down his throat. As the Pumbaa-golem slowly went from Timon to Pumbaa, Timon's mountain of a body began to shrink. Timon was elated by this. That is until he began to feel a fullness in his massive stomach. As Pumbaa regained one-ton status, he began to fill up the majority of Timon's stomach. Pumbaa-golem, however, continued his transfer into the his porcine victim. As Pumbaa continued to grow, Timon began to feel his stomach stretching outward more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooohhhhh......owwwww....it hurts! What's...going on down there?\" Timos said, rubbing his huge belly. Thanks to Pumbaa-golem leaving his body, Timon was slowly regaining control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transfer continued, Timon's body slowly going from evenly distributed fat to a belly that was incredibly bloated and distended. Eventually, Timon was back down to his original single-planetary size, except for his belly which rested in from of his, now of equal size to the rest of his blob of a body. Pumbaa, having stretched Timon's stomach to the max, was cramped inside his fat friend's organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh.h......I have such a stomach ache....\" Timon whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the golems were not finished with the two.</span></div></div>",

He let the all-but-empty bottle fall to the ground and smacked his lips, knowing he should get something to drink to help the pills do their work.  \"Gee, I wonder how long these things take to work?\"  He pondered aloud, but without so much as a tail swat, he was off waddling towards the water hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the lush watering spot he dipped his mouth into the cool water and gulped and gulped and gulped, letting the liquid swell his stomach and help dissolve the pills within.  Suddenly he felt an all-too familiar rumbling within his belly.  He moaned and looked around in embarrassment, letting his tail go high into the air and waited for the expulsion....his stomach gurgled and rumbled again...and still no flatulence.  Pumbaa's eyes went wide with happiness.  \"They work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa jumped, looking back at Timon, standing with a surprisingly large net full of squirming bugs.   \"Uhhhhh....nothing Timon...nothing at all!\" he felt ingenious for that cover.  \"Well c'mon y'mook, *I* did all the work catching us somethin' to eat tonight, least you can do is help carry it!\"  Pumbaa looked overjoyed and gladly wormed his snout under the net and heaved the bugs onto his back, this was a heavy catch all right, and Pumbaa knew he'd be able to enjoy every last bug without gassy concerns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nSeveral hours had passed and the duo lay under the evening sky, on their backs and swollen to perfection, bug net emptied of it's contents to the side.  Timon rubbed and massaged his rounded middle, his cheeks bulged and a booming belch forced it's way from his open mouth.  \"Phew, that...was excellent...  Hey Pumbaa, I haven't heard a thing outta you all day!  And I don't just mean your mouth...\" he prodded his porcine friend in his ripe gut.  Pumbaa moaned as he adjusted his belly, attempting to speak but finding it difficult.  He'd eaten so much, he'd hardly noticed the lack of gas blowing from his rear...or his front.  Pumbaa's gut gurgled and rumbled though, Timon could even hear that.  \"Are you okay Pumbaa??\"  Timon sloshed his belly to the side, scratching along it's rounded length.  \"Uhh...mmph...I'm fine Timon...m...maybe I'm just ...better...now...\"  Pumbaa's words were filled with almost pained uncomfortableness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?  What are ya sick'r'somethin'?\"  He followed his question up with a sickly wet belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa didn't want to talk.  He grumbled, though he'd excused the feelings while he ate, now that he sat there digesting he could feel the pressures inside of him building up, he wanted to explode.  More than anything, he wanted to fart.  He rolled on his back, hooves rubbing at his tight gut, pressure against his tail opening, but nothing would come from it.  \"I...might be...ohhhhhhhhh...\" Pumbaa's body shook and in two sudden surges his belly grew in size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh Pumbaa???\"  Timon managed to stand, grasping his full gut and stared at his bulging friend.  \"I'm ffff...ffff...fine...Tim...on...\" and again his belly grew, and soon his body appearing slightly puffier all around.  Pumbaa knew it had to've been the pills...he'd stopped his gas, too well.  </span></div></div>",

He grunted as a high pitched fart poofed from under his tail. The wart hog's chin rested on his chest, his legs up in the air, and all the space between them was as stable as a water balloon on a truck racing down a bumpy highway. He looked over his form down to the meerkat. \"And from the looks of things, I think I out chilled you!\"<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Timon coughed, slapping his belly as it shook like jello and making his innards grow sea sick. He then pushed a finger deep into his belly, twisting the flesh like spaghetti on a form, and grinned as a low, juicy fart was released. \"Not this Monday!\"<br>\r\n\"It's Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n\"Like I said, this Monday,\" Timon replied. He burped, sending a ripple down his overly bloated flesh. His belly threatened to swallow the base of his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Pumbaa grumbled, realized that there was no point in arguing. \"Then I'll out after chili you!\" The wart hog rolled onto his side as his belly took a few minutes to catch, rumbling and trembling, shaking his tail and thighs. He grunted and wiggled, and finally a long, gaseous release made his tail flap and his thighs sting.<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Timon waved a hand in front of his nose, coughing repeatedly. \"If you're gonna play dirty, then you're on!\" He wiggled as though running in place from his back. The arms went up and down, the legs squirmed form side to side, and the rest of his body was a disturbed mound of jello. PHFFRAAAPT!\" \"Hah! Take that one Puhmba!\"<br>\r\n\"Whew! Do you feel a draft?\" Timon asked. Several patches of fur had blow off his lower regioons from that, leaving bare, stinging flesh.<br>\r\n\"Oooh! I'd plug you up if I knew what was good for you!\" Pumbaa said, his brow narrowing. He rocked from side to side, unable to do much else, no matter how much his legs kicked. \"You're luck I can't get over th-\" -PHFRIBBITT.<br>\r\n\"And you're lucky I can't get over THERE!\" Timon snapped.<br>\r\nThe meerkat rolled onto his belly, his tail in the air, and his sides pressing out several inches. As he wagged his tail, he farted again, and did his best to aim at Pumbaa. \"I don't play to lose!\" he taunted, feeling a burning build up in his guts.  Pumbaa did the same, his body shaking as he breathed heavily. His innards were like a chemistry project, boiling and percolating, waiting for someone to stop it before there was an explosion. Phft PHFT PTITITITRAP SQUEALPPPHFTT! \"Take that!\" he snapped, his voice cracking from being so worked up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa's stinging anus was like a disturbed drum head as a second round of assaults flew forth, now exploding so quickly that he had trouble catching his breath.  <br>\r\nTimon looked green in the face, even with all his fur. He clasped a paw over his muzzle and returned the volley, although this was more from how sick he felt than from an attempt to fight back. His body bounced in place, still very much like a water balloon, for several seconds afterward. When he tried to talk his voice went up and down, like a child bouncing on his father's knee.  He then rolled closer to Pumbaa as the wide stripes on his back stretched and squished from the movements. He grabbed a nearby rock, grunting and straining as he hefted it into the air, and then placing it on his belly. The weight sent the gasses out at a rapid pace. \"Haha!\" he called. \"I haven't lost yet. Take that! And that! And THAT!\" PHHRAAABITTYPHFT.  It was soon difficult to tell what was a back stripe and what was a stain. \"Have you had enough?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More gas blew from the small opening than should have been possible, Pumbaa actually rocketed backward a few inches from the force.  Meanwhile, the disturbance inside Timon began to cause more gasses to build. He could feel his all ready swollen belly tightening, and as he looked down he saw the stone rise up, his belly taking on the appearance of an air filled balloon. \"Urgh,\" he moaned, holding it. Suddenly the rock sprung off and he managed to squeeze out a few more expulsions.  He could feel the gasses building at a frantic pace. \"You're in for it now!\" Timon called, though he was indeed growing a bit worried. His body ballooned further, and even after several more ass stinging farts, it seemed to do no good. His body was tight and round, and only swelling further, he could feel his flesh creaking and straining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa quickly developed the same problem. He watched in horror as his hooves rose into the air above his expanding belly. Only moments later, he could see nothing in front of him but the brown further gut. He tightly squeezed his knees into it again, hoping for a release. PPHFAPT! PPHHFT! PT PT PT PT PT PTIPIPIPIPPHFRAAAPHT!!!  The two moaned in unison as their bodies became spheres. Although they were nervous, there were still in a contest.<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got!!\" Timon snarled, throwing a clump of dirt at Pumbaa. \"Here's some right back at ya!\" It was as if an earthquake had shook the area from the force of the blast. Most of his backside was barren of fur, and the round meerkat sat in a sizable sink hole he had caused. The gases were so thick that they could be seen. Green and brown mist covered the area, and from behind he could hear nonstop gagging. \"You can give up anytime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give up when lions learn to fly!!!\" Spittle flew from Pumbaa's mouth. He was so enraged at the challenge that his eyes were growing veined and bloodshot. He did his best to angle at the meerkat, lifting his tail and squeezing.  His left leg kicked up as he farted again. It was more of an explosion than a simple toot. Then his right leg went up. They alternated, Pumbaa releasing in a rapid to and fro motion with his body.  But as fast as he went, the building gasses were faster. His body was a brown beach ball, and only getting larger and tighter. The warthog worried his body would rip if he could not outdo it.  PHHFAPT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon was not faring much better. His shoulders and thighs were disappearing into his body, four indentations forming along it. The semi-bare tail had all ready been sucked in halfway, and he could feel the gasses even rising up to his head, bloating out the cheeks.  He flipped on to his belly, giving Pumbaa a view of the rounded, stretched out stripes down his back.  Pumbaa suddenly felt something odd under his tail. It was though any breeze that had been there was vanishing by the moment. His thighs ballooned, as did the base of his tail, quickly covering up his anus. His belly swelled further as well, and it would have done the job had it not all ready been covered. \"Uh....Timon, I don't have a good feeling about this.\"<br>\r\n\"Then give up!\" he said. His voice seemed a bit hallow, as though speaking through a pool toy. \"I knew you couldn't take it.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I can't get it out anymore!\" The wart hog began to sweat, his body ballooning frantically, his belly began to swallow up his full thighs, covering up the knees. His arms were sinking in deeper and deeper, up to the elbows. His tail swishing slowed up as the limb was engulfed.  His jowls were like an inflated pelican beak and his cheeks began to puff.<br>\r\n\"You sure look like a big wind bag!\" Timon said, laughing as he made to smack his knee, but his arms were held firmly into his swelling form. He gulped, trying to fart again, when suddenly he realized that he too was unable to release.  Before long his body was well over a foot wide, stretching and expanding like it was something to strive for.  Timon's short legs were engulfed until just the long feet stuck out of the ball.  Deep indentation lines surrounded the foot like a lion's mane.  His tail was just a stub, and quickly the arms began to be pulled in further. Timon panicked, but was unable to save himself. He squirmed in vain, his cheeks bumping into his ballooned torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes shut tightly and he could feel his face beginning to take air along with his jaw.  Timon's cheeks began to expand. His nose took air, rounding out and closing up the nostrils. He gasped for air, but it did no good. His ears too began to tighten and puff.  He could feel his head swelling, the eyes trying to bulge out to gain freedom as veins stretched across the balls.  Pumbaa was over three feet wide when his head began to sink inside the ball. The gasses churned and bubbled, looking for any possible outlet and empty space to stretch too. His remaining tail stub quivered like a bobble head as he tried to pass the gas, but it could do more than cause said disturbance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he did not stop there. Soon he was four feet, five, six, nearly seven feet in diameter as his body creaked and moaned from within.  Timon was catching up, a four foot blimp that hardly resembled what he had been moments earlier, even when so bloated with chili.  His tail stretched out and spasmed, rolling back inside, and then back out like a party whistle.  His eyes continued to balloon, stretching out of the sockets, as did Pumbaa's, the veins covering them like a network of red spaghetti.  The eyes began to tremble as they swelled rapidly. More and more they shook, and Pumbaa was worried they might-SPLAT. Too late.  Blood oozed form the empty sockets, but even the new opening was not enough to let the gas free. The wart hog's head sunk even deep into the body until he was no more than a giant brown ball.  Timon looked like goofy insect from his bulging eyes. His tail stuck out again, but did not roll up. It went taught and trembled. Moments later it began to elongate, filling out in the middle, more and more until it was as round as the rest of his body. Darkness surrounded him as his head sunk deeper and deeper  Had his face not been so swollen, he would have asked Pumbaa if he had given up yet. Before the thought could cross his mind, he heard a loud creaking, like someone rubbing a wet finger over a large balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grew louder and more intense, and then suddenly there was a deafening bang that uprooted all of the grass and trees. Timon was blown over twenty feet away and was covered in dirt from where he had just been.  He thought he knew what had happened, but there was nothing he could do but panic.  His own body stretched out to over six feet, the back stripes were so thing they were almost invisible by then. The tail caught up, appearing about two thirds of his torso.  He felt like his flesh was beginning to tear. He bit his lip and squeezed, doing his best to blow out anything he could. The ears kept expanding until they were huge blimps sticking out of the ball. He felt a sudden tightness, a surge of gas, and then BANG!. The ears were no more.  His body groaned and protested. His flesh felt so thin that it may as well have been see through.  BAM!! He could not see, but his tail too was no more.  Moments later what remained of his body looked like an over heated molecule, bouncing and trembling around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hakuna Matata? Did I win?\"  PopopopoPOBAM!!!!!! Anything that had remained of the landscape was no more than disturbed dirt as the meerkat blew.  Bits of blood and strips of undescernable flesh coated the ground for over one hundred feet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is it!  This is everything I...uh...we, could've wanted!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Timon pulled a large white pill from the bottle, and quickly stuffed it in his mouth.  A large bulge was sticking from his throat as he made the attempt to swallow it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulk..gak...\" Timon skittered towards the watering hole and dunked his head in the cool liquid, gulping a good mouthful down so as to take the pill to it's rightful place in his belly.  \"Ahh, dat's better...\" Timon sputtered once he came up for air.  Pumbaa merely looked him over curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work Timon?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited a moment before Timon looked himself over and showed signs of intense disappointment, a scowl appearing on his face.  \"Naah, Pumbaa, what mook woulda thought a little pill like that would do anything?\" He threw his hands in the air before crossing them as he pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa felt his friend's pain and looked downtrodden, nudging the little meerkat's elbow with his wet snout to try and comfort him.  Timon merely turned away, his only response was a hiccup.  And then another...and another!  Suddenly Timon's tail began to vibrate as if someone had flicked it, the vibration worked it's way up the meerkat's striped back, making Timon bounce around as if he'd been bitten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timon??  Timon are you okay?\"  an alarmed Pumbaa shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...P...Puuumbaaaa...\" Timon stuttered and began hiccupping violently, he finally stopped shaking long enough to cover his mouth.  All seemed calm for a moment...and then another loud hiccup, and another...this time, however, Timon's body was reacting!  Each hiccup seemed to pump the stringbean meerkat up!  After the fourth hiccup Timon's arms had shown clear signs of bubbling, growing in various ways, his chest had began sticking out further than before like he'd taken in a large breath of air.  Timon could do nothing, looking himself over in complete shock!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pum-HIC-ba!  Look-HYUP-me!\" and both Timon and Pumbaa watched as the meerkat's lithe body took on much more bulk in his upper body and legs, his hiccups appearing to bulge each muscle, almost appearing as balloons inflating under his fur.  After several minutes of the shocking event, there stood Timon, he was double his size, both in mass and in height.  His head sat atop a thickened and toned neck, arms at the very peak of \"strong\", his biceps bulged when he flexed THIS time, even pushing a couple snaking veins against the skin!  He had a brilliant barrel chest, he had pecs for once!  His stomach was tight and lined with bumpy abs, a stark contrast to it's normally full and rounded shape.  His thighs had grown thick and meaty, his calves were flexing even as he stood there admiring himself. Timon's striped back was now wider than before, rippling his brown markings across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumbaa, I'm...I'm buff!\"  Timon smiled ear to ear, stretching and flexing his body, spinning around to take himself in and show off to Pumbaa, working any large bulging part of his body that he could. \"What mook woulda thought a little pill like that would do anything?\" Timon beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa merely sat in disbelief, Timon was just an inch taller than Pumbaa when standing on all fours, and it was quite a surreal sight.  </span></div></div>",

They both waited for a short time, but after half a minute, nothing has changed. \"Pumbaa, you feel anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa glanced away as he thought to himself, \"Hmm...

Huh?\" Timon was looking at Pumbaa's stomach, which was starting to bubble and make gurgling noises. \"... Hey...Hey Pumbaa! I think it's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa suddenly sat up, \"I'm right here y'know. You don't have to yell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Timon to flinch, \"Yaugh! Pumbaa! You're not aching in pain anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I guess it was only for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon pointed down to Pumbaa's legs, \"'Gasp!' Look Pumbaa!\" They both were astonished to see Pumbaa's leg muscles grow right in front of them! Now, Pumbaa's legs were pretty strong to start out with, the pill caused all the muscles in his calves and thighs to really stick out a lot more. Pumbaa's calves didn't really show much at first, but they soon bulged right out of his legs, becoming a fairly large pair of double-diamond calves. Pumbaa's quads and hamstrings were the next, tensing and flexing out on their own. More than enough to make each leg be pushed away from each other. \"Pumbaa, your legs! They've become mammoth-sized!\" Timon began giving Pumbaa's still-bulging thighs a good feel, \"Now it looks like you'll be able to run down that mountain along with me. And more so!\" Pumbaa suddenly moved his upper body forward as his back muscles were starting to push out and ripple, as well as cause his lats to spread out more too. \"Wow! Look at your back! And your lats! They're really starting to clump together. No'll look at your backside funny anymore.\" Once the muscles on Pumbaa's back slowed, Pumbaa laid his upper body back as he held himself up with both his arms. Pumbaa's rounded stomach was starting to grow less flabby and began to form abdominal muscles that were popping out one-by-one until he had a well-defined, pot-bellied 8-pack that was tensing and flexing on their own. Pumbaa's chest was also be affected, as two large bumps started to form, becoming large pectoral muscles that Pumbaa could almost feel with his chin. But then Pumbaa's neck muscles were starting to bulge out, causing his chin to be lifted further away from his chest. \"My friend, you whole upper body frame is nearly built to perfection!\", Timon said as he continued watching. The last were Pumbaa's arms, which he lifted up and began flexing them. The surge of energy first entered Pumbaa's shoulders, as they swelled up greatly, pushing his arms further away from his body. Pumbaa's biceps and triceps were the main parts being flexed, so they showed no hesitation as they throbbed and pumped right out of his once skinny arms to form two bowling ball-shaped biceps that peaked a little higher and higher every few seconds. Finally were Pumbaa's forearms, which both bulged out to finish up his arms at once, causing Pumbaa to clench his fists even harder. After about a minute, Pumbaa's growth was finally over. Timon stood up, \"So Pumbaa, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa also followed as he now was able to stand up on only two legs. Pumbaa looked down to see he was not standing 6 feet tall, and was two feet taller than Timon. Pumbaa looked at his muscular arms, and then said, \"I feel...I feel like...like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, go ahead Pumbaa. Express yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like...\" Pumbaa quickly did a pose where he was leaning on his left leg while stretching his right leg out, and flexing his left arm while stretching his right arm out towards the sky, \"...I can take on any brick wall only using my tusks!\" Pumbaa did a different pose, his body turned to his right side while flexing his right arm upwards and flexing his left arm downwards against his side, \"Like I can make it through any storm, or hurricane, or tsunami!\" Pumbaa did another pose, flexing both arms downward as he gripped both his hands and began flexing his pecs one-by-one, \"Like I can take on any foe, no matter what size level they happen to be!\" Pumbaa relaxed all his muscles, \"But most of all, I feel great! I've never felt as powerful as this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More powerful than after training with that wolverine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much more powerful than that.\" Pumbaa began doing a couple more bodybuilding poses, \"Oh boy! I feel like just ramming my tusks into a full-fledged mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon thought to himself for a moment, \"Hmm... That does sound nice, but I think I've got somethin' else in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa asks while wagging his tail, \"Really? What do you suggest we do?\"</span></div></div>",

Let me see your arm.\" Pumbaa does just that, simply bringing his sinewy arm over for his best pal to feel, mainly rummaging a hand over Pumbaa's meaty bicep. \"Pumbaa...! You feel incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog blushes a bit, hearing that from his friend. \"Ya think so?\" He even gives his pumped arm a gentle flex, letting Timon's hand feel the entire thing as his bicep peaks up to fruition. \"Well how does that feel then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impeccable!\", Timon responds excitedly. \"I knew you were strong, but this is the first time I've felt such sheer power inside of ya! Plus, you clearly show the size and strength of a bodybuilder now!\", Timon adds, making his best pal feel even more happy. \"Say, let me take a look at those legs.\" Timon kneels down as Pumbaa stands up on his hind legs. The warthog then gives those astounding thighs of his a good-natured flex, showing off some shriveling, meaty quads and hamstrings. \"Woah! Those look great!\" Timon even rubs a hand gently along Pumbaa's flexed thigh. \"I bet you can run the entire forest and not feel tired at the least.\", Timon winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa was happy to hear that. He then runs a hoof along Timon's pecs, catching the meerkat by surprise. \"Well I think you've got enough feeling from me. How's about I get a good feela you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon didn't mind that at all. Even tenses a pec as Pumbaa runs his hoof along each one-by-one. \"Sounds fine to me.\", Timon winks. He then holds out an arm and flexes it upward to show off that thick peak of his. \"How's this bicep feel Pumbaa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog responds by running both hoofs along his pal's arm, feeling how much Timon has really grown after taking that one pill. \"That feels GREAT Timon! You can definitely take on some bodybuilders yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon grins in response, \"Thanks Pumbaa. You really are the bestest of friends.\" Timon then turns around and shows of his wide back. \"How's my backside?\", Timon grins back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa runs a hoof along his pal's rippling, getting some great results in response. \"Not bad Timon. Not bad at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon actually liked the feeling he was receiving on his back, gently sitting up on the grass. \"Hey, that feels nice. I am feeling pretty tired after all this growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa happily sits up right behind him. \"Allow me Timon! I'd be happy to give you a back rub.\" Without hesitation, the warthog rubs his arms along Timon's rippling traps and broad shoulders. He moves down to feel his thick arms a bit, primarily feeling his biceps triceps. Afterwards Pumbaa moves back to Timon's upper back muscles, giving them a good feel and massage. The last he did was move down Timon's lower back, even stroking the meerkat's tail a few times. \"How does that feel Timon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumbaa...you're really good at this!\", Timon responds just as happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's only because I wanted to get a good feel of you all over.\", Pumbaa smiles. \"Your muscles feel really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, Thanks Pumbaa.\", Timon smiles in return. He then notices Pumbaa's rippling, shredded calf, as well as his throbbing thigh off the corner of his eye. \"Um, hey Pumbaa, ya mind stretching your legs out real quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure!\" Pumbaa does what he's asked. Timon then skooches back so he was sitting himself against the warthog's stomach. \"Oh, T-Timon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heh, sorry pal. Guess it does feel kinda weird laying against your stomach when it's nothing but muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Timon could sit back to where he was, Pumbaa quickly closes his strapping, plump legs. \"Oh, I don't mind. Really.\", Pumbaa blushes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHimm... Could this be the start of something more?</span></div></div>",

I really need to find some food, and quick\"! Eventually, the duo find a nice hollow, chock-full of bugs. \"Now, this is our lucky day Pumba, all of this, just to ourselves\". Timon eyed the food greedily, and soon, they dug in. After about half an hour of eating, Pumba quits. Strangely, Timon feels weirdly starving, considering the feast he's consuming. Despite his concern, he stops only after another hour of scarfing down any food within sight. Finally, they drift off, staring at the stars, unaware of the event soon to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about midnight, the stringbean-like meerkat starts to gain a little bit of a gut, which soons starts to grow to the size of a softball and behind, his muscle start to inflate. Soon, his biceps enlarge to the point that they're larger than his head, unflexed. His pectorals eventually grow to match his stomach, easily rivaling baseballs in size. If you could see them, you would see not 6, but 8 well-defined abdominal muscles. Not wanting to be left behind, his thighs and calfs quickly inflate to match the size of his entire torso. Eventually, he is left with the appearance of an extreme body bulder with a gut as large as his torso. In order to accomodate for all of the extra mass, he quickly grows to Pumba's size, and beyond, quickly reaching a full 5 feet tall. By now, his gut is easily the size of a semi-inflated beach ball, with barrel sized thighs, soccor ball sized calfs, basketball biceps ready to pop and pecs that extended by a foot, easy. Miraculously, he nor Pumba awoke during his insane transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's now morning, and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zazu never minded it much at first but now it starts bringing down little by little the more someone speaks ill of his size as he soars through the desert on his own for minutes on end. He would speak to Rafiki about it every so often but even the old baboon couldn't help but mess with the poor bird and make fun of his stature. After seeing someone such as Simba grow into a strong, powerful lion, he was starting to wish he could grow big someday. If only there was a way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the hornbill was starting to tire himself out, not realizing how long he had be adrift in the sky. \"Oh dear... How long have I been flying for?\", he pants. He immediately dives and lands safely underneath a marula tree. The poor bird needed to quench his thirst quick before he passes out. He hops around on his talons a bit scouring for a small pond of any kind. No such thing came to be until... \"What in heaven's...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he notices was a miniature pond, but there was something really off with it. He decides to leap down and land closer in front of it. Not only was it smaller than any pond he came across, it was looking rather...purplish. And no this is not because it was nearly sundown. \"What is with water?\" He takes a quick look around. \"Should I even drink from this?\" Zazu's mind kept telling him 'no' but his dehydrated body kept telling him 'yes'. \"Hm... Maybe one sip couldn't hurt. I am really thirsty you know.\", he remarks, as if he were speaking to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hornbill bird gently dips his beak into the pond and takes a quick sip, worried it might have tasted horrible. But to his surprise... \"My word...! That was really good!\" Zazu dips his beak in again, even using his feather palms to help slurp more down until he felt full. The quenched avian sits down firmly on his bottom, thinking about the wonderful agua he guzzled down in his bouncy belly. \"That was quite tasty. If I do say so myself.\", he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, completely out of nowhere, he starts to feel his body shaking. His belly balloon seemed to have disappeared in an instant, lengthening out at least two feet! He looks at his shaking feathers, which elongate the same amount as well. His tiny legs soon sprouted outwards and gained two-and-a-half feet more in length just like the rest of his body. \"Oh my!\", the hornbill squawks, unable to fathom what the heck just happened to his body. He took at his arms and legs, which had no muscle tone, but made him look like a bird mixed with human attributes. \"Did...that pond have something to do with this...?\", he muttered, glancing down at the purplish pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inches closer to see his reflection in the water. What he sees next surprises him even more! His next muscles started clench, forming out some chiseled features as his traps splay out on his shoulders. \"M-my neck!\", Zazu screams, completely oblivious to the fact his voice had just grown deep and more masculine. Suddenly his shoulders were beginning to twinge. As his neck widens, his shoulders broaden, turning into some nice boulders that could compete well against any rhino he'd stumble across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt a short pain in his arms, holding out firmly as he watches his biceps and triceps beef themselves outward, almost as big as bowling balls if flexed hard enough. His forearms crunch themselves out as well, along with gaining some big, meaty palms. \"My... My arms...\", Zazu utters, a small grin appearing on his beak. Things only got better as he felt his chest start to bulge up as two meaty slabs of pecs protrude underneath the birds beak. \"I... I have pecs now!\", the bird exclaims excitedly. \"<i><b>Oooh...!!</b></i>\", he grunts, covering his stomach as if he were suffering from a stomach ache. Thankfully, it was anything but. His abdomen started out flat, but he could feel a set of abs form one by one as if his belly was being pumped with hot air. In seconds. he proudly displays an exquisite 8-pack that would even make Simba jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZazu soon bends his body forward, feeling his back muscles start to stuff themselves up as his upper body frame widens, promptly gaining a sinewy, rippling back with a V-shape form with his proud muscles. His feathery tail whips upwards as his glutes inflated out and then tightened as if he were flexing them for the crowd like anyone in a bodybuilding competition. Oh... He could just see himself out there now! Flexing for his fellow brethren, displaying his newly formed physique to the animal kingdom to gaze and gawk over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn to pressing matters. His leg muscles develop the most, turning his skinny pipes into an intimidating set of thighs and hamstrings. So powerful he could vision himself just running through the Savannah, rather than flying over it. And last but not least, his calves bulge up beneath his hamstrings, a double-diamond pair getting full attention in return. His talons then grow thicker, much like his palms, looking powerful and strapping feet that could emit waves on the ground if he smashed them hard enough. And with that, his painful and pleasureful episode muscle and mass came to an end as his body muscles were left heaving in and out all around. A few impressive veins were spread out across the most noticeable of the hornbill's massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZazu slowly manages to get back up on his burly feet. He couldn't even utter a word at what he just experienced. It's even more unbelievable that he'd stumble across a pond that if ingested help increase one's muscles to that of pro bodybuilder! The ecstatic bird takes a look around his whole, muscular frame, starting with his arms. He even had hands now, who'd of thought? After a minute of gawking he gives his arm a much-needed good flex, feeling up his marvelous bicep with his other palm. \"This is... This is absolutely wonderful!\", the bird screams, finally noticing his changed voice. \"Whoa my...! Is that my voice?!\", he blasts, feeling nothing but satisfied with his new, deeper tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to the pond once again, kneeling down on both knees to get a closer view of his bulky frame. He locks his fingers with each other while raising gently against beneath his chest as he bouncing those mighty pecs a couple times. \"Incredible... I wonder how I would sound if I were to squawk really loud.\" For that, he decided to save in his memory for another time. He then continues by showing off many of the other muscles with his reflection in the pond: flexing his rippling arms against his chest, crunching that sick set of abs every so often while patted them boastfully with one fist. \"I never even imagined gaining my own set of stomach muscles. What a proud moment this is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZazu gladly stands up to show off his enormous legs, flexing out those quads and calves for him and his reflection to see. \"My legs are stupendous! I barter I can outrun any mountain lion if I had the mind to!\", he boasts. After spending a good chuck of time idolizing his new body, a quick theory had run through his mind as he stare intently at the pond. \"Hmm... I wonder...\" Zazu uses both his sturdy palms to gather a pretty good amount of water, which he manages to slurp all down in one gulp. <i>Gulp</i> \"Hmm... <i><b>Eeh...! Ooh...!\"</b></i>\" Is body responds almost immediately, his muscles soon absorbing the water like vitamins. His entire body throbs, the feeling the bird was getting becoming nothing more than euphoric his muscles beef up in size a little bit more. He even gaining a good inch or two in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! It's just as I suspected!\", the avian roars, giving his body a quick most muscular flex. \"This pond is nothing more than a magic pond that grants anyone who drinks it much more muscle mass! It's odd I came across it, but I wonder if anyone else has... Wait a minute...!\" The titan of a bird takes a quick look around at his surroundings. \"Where in the world am I even?!\" The area he resided in contained nothing more than patches of African grass, the lone marula tree, and the pond containing purple water. \"Hm... Well, guess I had better be returning. Oh ho, wait until the crowd takes a notice of this muscular, hornbill bird. I'll show them what real power really is!\", he cries out fondly, flexing up both of his beefy arms. \"I'll even keep this pond a secret.\", he winks to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans in promptly before the magic water. \"Alright dear friend, we shall meet again soon. Just in case I come across any folks who still tower me by a good amount.\" Instead of flying though, he takes up the challenge and decides to run right through the Savannah. Just to see how long his vigorous thighs can outlast. With a lift of one over the other, \"And away we go!\", Zazu sprints off in a heartbeat. What adventures could he come across next...</span></div></div>",

His face was comically enlarged, his nose looking as if it had taken an entire beehive's worth of stings, bulbous, nostrils flaring and hiding nothing.  Air was taken in each tunnel with loud gasps to power this silly act.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes had blown up so large and perfectly round that they almost rivaled his head itself, practically fighting to stay in his skull at all.  Timon's ears had swollen and become a mockery of a particular famous mouse, swelling up tight and preventing much more air loss.  His body, dwarfed and shadowed by what was attatched to it, rose skyward, appearing only the least bit puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPHSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHFFMMMM....FFFSHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Thundering stomps sent trembles into the ground, every step of Timon's feet left a foot-shaped crater behind.  Timon couldn't believe how quickly traveling was now that he was so big.  \"I shoulda thought of this ages ago!\" he said, pumping his ego up, and sticking out his chest.  Suddenly, Timon stopped, grinding a trench into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah great, an elephant herd!\" he groaned, putting his hands on his hips and glaring down in disgust.  The herd seemed not too bothered with the monsterous meerkat that loomed overhead.  Clearly, they were too busy to take note. \"These guys take FOREVER to get outta here...I'm inna hurry and...I...heh...\" Timon's grin spread across his face, remembering his current situation.  Soon he had lifted his foot, wriggling his toes and then dropped it like an anvil.  *SPLORCH*  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no more than a sickening second, half the herd had been flattened by the gigantic foot, and by now, the rest took GREAT notice and began panicking, stomping off in every direction from the disaster.  \"THAT'S how you get out of afternoon traffic!\" he joked to himself, again puffing out his chest with pride, Timon started to realize what this meant.  He just took out elephants, the biggest creatures on the land!  But no longer, not with Timon: King of the Meerkats around!  \"Yeah...\" he gazed off into space as delusion set in.  \"I like the sound of that!  And...and the only rightful place for a TRUE king...\" he stared off into the distance at Pride Rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, mustn't keep my loyal subjects waiting!  It's not everyday they get to meet their truuue king!\" his heart thumped at the thought.  \"But first...a little refreshment...\" he looked to the East, seeing a glistening watering hole, just perfect, he thought.  A few monsterous stomps later and he found himself towering over the wonderful drinking water...a few gazelles had launched themselves away from the meerkat, and still other animals stared up in complete shock, frozen in fear around the hole.  \"Fear not subjects, your king merely wishes to partake in a drink with the common folk.\" Timon said, with an air of snobbery.  Within seconds he landed on his knees, trapping a cheetah underneath one, grinding him into the ground.  Timon dunked his mouth into the water and began gulping away.  A few more slurps, a hiccup, and the watering hole was no more.  Timon crudely belched, blowing several animals off into the grasses.  \"That's better...\" any remaining animals that had survived had since run off into the distance.  \"It's hard being amonst a celebrity, I understand!\" he gloated to himself, more than anything.  As he sat there, patting his water-filled lump of a belly, he looked off in the direction of Pride Rock.  \"This may take longer than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Timon stuck his thumb in his mouth.</span></div></div>",

A grin that was miles wide spread across the meerkat's face, \"Yeah, I could make this work!\" the idea caused more drool to begin pooling from his mouth, his tongue slipped across his face, Timon leaned forward, sniffing the ground with his bulbous nose, city remains flying into his nostrils like dust particles.  Large black meerkat fingers dug into the ground, scooping out concrete, dirt, pipework, anything and everything.

Pumbaa's stomach, which rested nicely on the bed-sized meerkat belly, bubbled ominously until a massive belch erupted into Timon's mouth.  The warthog's eyes were wide with surprise, and Timon's tail went rigid, his spectacle of a belly surged in sheer size, lifting his legs far from the ground.  His limbs flailed and faught with Pumbaa's face, pushing against the snout, his hands slipping into Pumbaa's slick nasal passages.  Another bubble and another thundering belch rattled Timon's skull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blluuruuuuuurrrrrrrrrp-phuhhhh...phew\" Pumbaa's mouth released it's hold on Timon's face, viscous drool strings the only thing linking the two friends now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Timon!\" the hog said cheerily, attempting to stand, only to collapse on the blimped belly underfoot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon squirmed, his relatively small frame attatched to such a gargantuan ball of hog breath only rocked gently against the ground, flesh creaking as it still attempted to find space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coulda popped me you mook!\" Timon scolded, thumping his stretched side with a fist.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both were lying on their backs, but the meerkat was on top of the red wild pig's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig named Pumbaa was in deep sleep, snoring louder than a lion's roar. Timon the meerkat could barely sleep at all because of this. He just star gazed the whole time, hoping the snoring would subside soon. It wasn't long until he saw something in the sky. It was a shiny blueish white dot that gradually got closer and bigger. No, it was shooting star! Heading straight towards him and his companion! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meerkat was shaking in fear while trying to wake the pig in deep sleep. He feared the worst, but realized that the object was breaking apart in some places. Luckily, the space object happened to pass over them by 20ft and struck the ground about the same distance north away from them. A small quake rattled the ground after impact, that made Timon lose his balance and fell off his still snoozing friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got up from his short fall, he decided to see what that thing was, not bothering with waking the warthog. As he got to the crash site, he discovered a small crater that looked to be about 12ft wide yet only about 5ft deep. In that crater he saw a rock that was about 1/3 of his size. It was amazing how something so small could cause this much damage. He touch the ground which was cool, making it safe to approach it. As he got near, he discovered that the rock was glowing with a blue light. He was about to touch it until the light emulating from the rock pulsated and blinded him in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was a confined square space where the walls were made out of a combination of sturdy bark, branches, and mostly grass which held the tropical debris The floor was pretty much just smoothed out grass and dirt. Everything about the place screamed that some kind of giant lives here. In his left corner, there was a huge mound of soft leaves, shaped in 6ft rectangular fashion and about a 1.5ft in height. There were three huge rocks in the opposite corner. One was the biggest with a flat smooth surface and the two other rocks at its right and left side that had flat surfaces too, but were smaller and not as wide. There was a small square opening or window above it, letting the sunlight in. They seem to be used as a table and two chairs. A round mirror was hung over another small similar stone like the ones near the table. Next to it was some kind of makeshift box made out of sticks and tree bark that was used to storage things. In front of him was the entry way, but block by some kind of wooden plank, leading to outside or to another part of the grass container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anyone here? Pumbaa?\" the meerkat broke the silence, still wondering where he is and how he got there. Then, he remembered about the space rock. Where did that thing went to? He looked more at his surroundings, hoping that it would take him back to the savanna, his home and away from whatever the heck this place was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he find it?</span></div></div>",

As the sun baked the land, the tree provided a minute amount of relief from the burning orb.  A few grasses around the massive base of the gnarled tree provided cover for the reddish brown plump warthog that stared upward with a worried look on his bumpy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr, Timon?  You don't think he'll notice we've been here, do you?\" the warthog humbly asked as several trinkets tumbled from the high branches and landed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what...\" the meerkat hollered tossing a few bowls and branches down \"...you're talking about Pumbaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just that...er...you seem to be making quite a mess...\" Pumbaa looked at the increasingly large pile of the mandrill's possessions at his hoofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Pumbaa's attention was quickly drawn upward once more as the slender meerkat lept from the branches above and seemed to bounce off the trunk until he landed onto Pumbaa's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got what?\" Pumbaa attempted to turn his head to see Timon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" the meerkat held out a large, clearly halved coconut, he removed the top and within was a pile of glittering red powder.  \"That old mook was holding out somethin' great!  Let me tell ya Pumbaa, you and me are gonna eat like KINGS!\" the meerkat practically danced on Pumbaa's back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're <i>sure</i> Rafiki wont mind us using it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what does that old monkey know?  He'll never miss it!  You should've seen all the things he had up there, quite a pig really...\"  Pumbaa looked disgruntled at the remark, kicking some of the 'things' that littered the base of the tree \"I think I've seen it.\" he said in a grumble.  Timon capped the coconut once more and held it tight to his skinny body, the look of excitement clearly in his eyes.  He kicked his heels against Pumbaa's chubby sides and yelled \"Let's go get us some grub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the duo were kicking up dust, putting more and more distance between them and Rafiki's home tree.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa then did what they did best, gathering all manner of insects to gorge on, grabbing fat grubs, large beetles, digging in logs, in the trees, under rocks for any bounty they might provide.  Pumbaa wanted nothing more than to slurp down the goods right away, but Timon was adamant they wait...an odd thing for the meerkat to say, of this the warthog was sure.  Over the course of an hour the two had amassed a large pile of writhing, squirming insects, a beautiful sight for either of the healthy eaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy Timon, NOW can we eat them?\" Pumbaa licked his lips, leaving a few strands of drool to spill to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not JUST yet my portly pal!  Just watch and learn!\" Timon said, rubbing his grubby paws together.  He pulled the coconut they'd looted close, turning the top and pulling it free, revealing the pile of powder once more.  Pumbaa couldn't help but stare at it with wonder, though his eyes darted back at the pile of food he had to work so hard for as well.  Timon patted his furry knees as he sat up and stepped over to the pile, grabbing a red beetle free and held it between his thumb and forefinger.  \"This, Pumbaa, is why it was worth the wait!\"  And with that, Timon took a pinch of the powder and sprinkled it liberally on the bug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's grin began to stretch across his face as the bug squirmed in his grasp, Pumbaa moved in close and stared the morsel down, wanting nothing more than to just EAT it than watch anything else right now.  Suddenly the bug surged in size, larger at first, then a second spurt and the bug appeared to be getting FATTER as well.  Timon's finger grasp turned into a cupped palm, and after two more surges the meerkat had both his hands holding on to the grotesquely swollen beetle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Timon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee heeee, just watch Pumbaa!\" Timon's arms shook as the bug inflated before their eyes, the red carapace seemed unable to spread with the body, it's entire body spreading apart at the seams allowing it to take on the appearance of a swollen, pulsating milky colored mass.  Finally Timon was forced to drop the once small insect, it bounced on the ground and quivered into place.  Timon shivered and hugged the him-sized ball of insect.  Tiny legs faught against the air as Timon's face sunk into the milky mass.  The meerkat licked it over, smacking his lips and then showing Pumbaa up with a \"Ta da!\"</span></div></div>",
