The Archwizard then addressed one of the high servants.  \"Galgion,  take her to Sapphire. Iris, you travel on dragon back to the city of  Krix. There will you be given something to aid you in your quest.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Iris was about to ask what it could be that was so important then held her tongue. Galgion the high servant led her to a high and broad tower top.  You are over whelmed by the sight before you. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n   \"Haven't you ever seen a dragon before?\"said Galgion. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   \"Yes, but never close. She's so beautiful and majestic, \" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks Iris. You're an exceptional young human yourself.\"  The voice that spoke was a like the sound of  a lovely horn.  It was gentle but it still had the presence of power. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"Thank you.  I was told that you were to take me to  Krix to obtain  an object, \"you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"The talisman we seek is called the Heart of Nethaal.  It is a jewel that was forged through magic by the best human and dragon magic users of the time a thousand years ago.   Nethaal was the name of the dragon and the human was Grifith.   It is said that Nethaal drained all of his magic into an old emerald, \" said Sapphire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"How will we find it? Krix is so vast,\" you say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          \"What we seek are looking for is not in Krix. We are merely being sent to get information concerning its' whereabouts.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Who are we looking for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n            \"A monk named Nephelius.  He is the oldest dragon partner in the known land. He is quite lonely and bitter because his dragon was slain by Draven before he was  sealed away by the last chosen one, \"said Sapphire <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"That was three hundred years ago.  How could he still be alive?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Nethaal and Grifith took magic to it's boundaries.   They created a spell to give them long life for a thousand years. They might have just been the greatest there was. That's why we are seeing him. His knowledge of magic and time given wisdom is uncanny, \" Sapphire said.  \"Enough talk.  I would first start with learning to channel magic, but finding Grifith is of more importance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Sapphire let down her left wing so you could climb on her back. Somehow you are totally trusting of the creature and you comfortably mount your dragon partner. You burst into the air at full speed as your blond hair is  blown back. Then  as you continue to soar in the sky you notice a large village on fire. In the flame and smoke you are able to make out a great multitude of men on horseback  coming down to the valley where the village is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"We have to help them!\" you cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"There are thousands of them. I can't kill them all.  We have to keep going, \" Sapphire says.         <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

I can just try to scare them away. Hold on I'm going down,\"Sapphire says to you. She makes a step dive over the bands of men and roars as she spews out flames.  About twenty of  them were incinerated while others start to retreat out of the valley from where the village is. Sapphire  swooped back up to make another pass at the bandits. The men tried to attack your dragon with spears and arrows, but her strong scales repelled the flying weapons.  After the men saw their partners burned to death and realized they couldn't kill her, the rest of the men joined the others who had fled.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"There on the run Sapphire! You did it!\" you say with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"it's a good thing this didn't take to long. I was getting tired,\" Sapphire says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You look down at the villagers who are waving at you with smiles.  Then you continue on your quest. You fly over beautiful land below. The tops of trees make  picturesque  forest canopies as you see birds flying above them.  Soon you find yourself soaring above majestic mountains together with deep canyons. You make out rivers that run through them that pour into shimmering waterfalls. Ahead of you a city outskirt comes into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That is the city of Bain,  where many travelers pass through every day. Nethaal lives in one of the forest temples in the Western highlands. Most of them are very remote. There are a collection of people called The Order of The Twilight. They have more knowledge of the secret places of Krix.  You'll find them in the Central Cathedral in the city square. I'll stay out of sight in the border of Bain while you go to the Cathedral. It is along way to the square, so you'll need to rent a horse, \" Sapphire says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your dragon lands just outside the city border.  \"I'll be back as soon as I can,\" you say. You make your way through the city entrance into a crowd of people bustling about. You immediately see a horse stall  and pay an overweight stout man with  a white beard.   \"You can have five hours with her. She's a top the line breed.  None faster or smoother riding, \" the man says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Just as you are about to mount the horse, you see a man with  malevolent eyes staring at you from about seven  yards away. The look on his face was cold and austere.  After a few moments he started walk away slowly as if he  were waiting for you to follow. </span></div></div>",

W-what's going on!\" she says as she jerks her head around. She then looks down and sees you, \"Oh, it's you.

She sighs and you jump off her belly as she stands and yawns, showing her cavernous maw and razor sharp teeth. \"Ugh, your breath stinks!\" you say, she mearly rolls her eyes and stretches. You run over to your dresser and pull out clothes that you need for the trip and set them on your bed. You then grab Saphire's saddle of the wall and pack your things in the pouches. \"There, all done.\" you say as you attach your sword to the saddle as well. \"Alright lets get this on you.\" you say<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Give me a second.\" Sapphire says as she finishes stretching. The morning sunlight filtering through the window reflects off her scales and casts blue lights all over the room. You quickly throw the saddle over her back and slide under her belly to attach the straps together. \"We're leaving so soon?\" Saphire says as you connect the saddle straps,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, saving the world is like a priority or something, now hold still.\" you say as you finish and climb out from under her, \"Lets go grab some food for the trip.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought you'd never ask.\" Saphire says. The two of you jog back outside and head over to the cafeteria where a few other dragons and magic users are heading as well. The two of you rush inside and head to the kitchen, \"Hey we're here to collect our provisions for our journey.\" you tell the chef, Sapphire then clears her throat and looks at you. \"Oh, and we also need breakfast.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Getting a rather early start now aren't ya?\" the chef says \"Alight, there's some meat over there in the corner for you Sapphire and I'll see what I canget for you Iris.\" the chef says as he walks off. Sapphire immediatly pounces on the pile of meat and begins to devour it,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You act like you haven't eaten in days.\" you say<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rule 38; never go flying on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You made that up.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So?\" she responds, the chef then walks out with a plate of eggs and bacon for you, <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The provisions you need are out back when your done.\" he says. You quickly scarf down your meal and head outside,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on Sapphire!\" you say as she finishes eating. She follows you out back and the two of you look at the supplies which consisted of mainly food and a few bottled drinks. All of the things are in packaged crates and sealed with magic so no amunt of rocking or twisting would smash the food \"Great, everything we need is here. Sapphire if you would.\" you say, Sapphire then walks over and begins swallowing the supllies whole and sending them down to her storrage stomach. \"It's real handy that dragons have stomachs with the specific purpose of storing items and keeping them fresh.\" you say. Once she finishes the two of you walk over to the well, \"Sapphire?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah yeah I got it.\" she says as she begins guzzling water. The water then flows down her throat into her water stomach that has the purpose of storing and purifying water for trips. \"Alright, I think that's everything.\" she says as she finishes,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, lets head out.\" you say<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

See you later!\" you say to the Archwizard as Sapphire walks off with you on her back. You exit the courtyard and come to the edge of a massive cliff and the sun is high above you. Down below you can see clouds that don't reach the top of the mountain and hide the ground from sight. You take a deep breath as Sapphire spreads her wings and leaps off the cliff. You're glad that you're attached to the saddle because Sapphire is in a massive nose dive and is headed straight for the clouds. You utter a quick water resistant spell before you go through the clouds covering an hold on tightly to Sapphire's neck as she passes through the clouds. You can't see a thing through the thick clouds and hope they break soon lest Sapphire falls too close to the ground. The clouds thin out and you can see the ground below and realize the clouds are releasing rain and covering everything with water. Your water resisting spell keeps you nice and dry though and Sapphire starts off towards the first city, Seafare. Meanwhile down below on the ground a man in a black cloak watches the two of you head off in the direction of your destiny.</span></div></div>",

Iris this is my brother; Blaze.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Charmed.\" you say<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's good to finally meet you.\" she responds<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then, where to first?\" you ask<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, you're coming?\" Sapphire asks<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, I would never let my little sister face something like this without me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know I hate it when you talk to me like that, I'm only a little younger than you.\" she says, you laugh and respond,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just like old times.\"</span></div></div>",

Seafare!\" Iris shouts out, sure enough a small city on the edge of the sea is now in sight. You begin to slowly decend from the sky and land in a nearby forest. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well lets go.\" you say as the three of you start walking. Iris jumps off of Sapphire's back and walks between you and Sapphire. You near the city gates and the guard who is posted there begins to pale at the sight of two dragons.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A-A-Ah... what's y-y-your business here?\" he asks<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're here to stay the night and head out in the morning.\" Sapphire says<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" you can clearly see the relief on the man's face \"We don't get dragons here very often, well come on in. There's a nice inn called The Dragon's Nest down by the ocean front with dragon sized rooms if you're lookin to stay the night.\" the man suggests as he opens the gate. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks.\" Sapphire replies as you step in. Inside the city is rather large consisting of many shops and homes varying from two to one story high. The town streets are mostly empty on account of how late it is and only a few people walk around the area. The crashing of waves can be heard in the distance and the stars are now beginning to appear in the sky. \"It's late, we should head for the inn Iris is very tired.\" Sapphire says<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I need to get to the-\" Iris is interupted by a yawn and quickly covers her mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sapphire is right Iris, we don't know where the spring is and we need to rest. We can go find out where it is first thing in the morning.\" you state, Iris finally agrees and the three of you continue onwards. \"Hey do you know where we can find The Dragon's Nest inn?\" you call out to a man passing by. He looks at you slightly surprised and says, \"Head down this street, take a left, then take the very next left after that, you can't miss it.\" he says and quickly continues on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks.\" you shout out, you follow the man's directions and sure enough the inn is right where he said it would be. Some music can be heard from the inside and laughter echoes outward. Iris enters through the massive dragon sized doors with surprising ease and you and Sapphire follow. Inside there are men and women chattin, dancing, and all enjoying themselves. A huge bar sits in the middle of the room and a man is tending to his guests with a large green dragon asleep behind him. The three of you walk up to the counter and Iris asks,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me, but do you have any rooms available\" the man turns and looks at the three of you and smiles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, we have the best rooms suited for dragons and their companions.\" he says, Iris throws some money on the table and says,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll take one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great Drake here will show you the way.\" he turns around and faces the dragon and yells, \"Drake! Come on get up we've got guests.\" Drake lazily raises his head,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh great! Come on follow me!\" he says, instantly perking up. Drake jumps over the counter, somehow avoiding all the tables and steps over guests as he walks over to you. \"This way, and watch your step.\" he says as he continues stepping over the guests who seem used to this. You follow him and he opens a door revealing a huge room with a human bed and huge blanket nests for dragons. \"Enjoy!\" he says as he exits the room, you dash over to one of the nests in a blur of red scales,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Called it!\" you yell, Iris walks over and flops in bed, Sapphire walks camly over to her bed and lays down. After a while all three of you are asleep and you are snoring rather loudly. Out in the lounge a man dressed in black with his hood up watches as you enter your room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They're making good progress, I still must make sure that Xard doesn't interfere here. They'll be safe here though for tonight.\" he says to himself, Drake then spots the man, runs over to him, and lays down next to him,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Drax!\" he says<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Drake, it's been a while, you watching out for my friend over there?\" Drax says, motioning to the man at the bar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeeeaaah...\" he says <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You haven't been pranking him, have you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What me?

You and Iris began to approach the fountain and so you slow to a halt. The smell of the sea is in the air and you can feel the sun beating down on your scales. The waves crash in the distance and seagulls cry over head. Sapphire finally catches up to you two, \"We shouldn't be dashing around everywhere, I don't want us to get separated.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you're just so slow.\" you smart-off to her.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Welcome warrior. You have come to a very dire time in the land of Calbrix. The four kingdoms here live separate of each other in the four dominions: Krix, the largest and most populated kingdom in the mountains to the north. Coran, the mining city in the southern mountains. Seafare, the western kingdom located by the sea. And Dram, the rural kingdom located in the eastern forest. In the middle of the four kingdoms is a tall mountain surrounded by woodlands. On top of the mountain is a temple of the best magic users in the country. Humans alone cannot use magic however, they need a dragon to be with them in order to use magic. Dragons populate all over the country and are at peace with humans. Dragons are intelligent creatures and can speak as well, although they don't often interact directly with humans other than those at the temple. Dragons are not the only magical creatures, but they are the only ones who's magic humans can use. Humans can only channel magic, not generate it, dragons generate magic but they cannot channel it into use. So dragons and humans in the temple train together and practice using their magic. Dragons can allow humans to tap into their magic and humans then can channel that magic into spells. Humans and dragons don't bond, but a human and a dragon often pick someone who they like and stay with each other. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our story begins in the southern kingdom of Coran where something sinister has been released. The greed of the king was too great and he forced his men to dig too deep. Within the ground they unleashed the Demon King, Draven. The Demon King brought forth his army and laid waste to the southern kingdom and attempted to do the same to the rest of the land. However, the Demon was sealed away by a child at the age of 13 and a dragon forever... or so it was thought. The Demon is rising again and only a teen with the same blood of the past hero can stop him for good. While the country itself isn't aware of this crisis, the magic users are. One girl at the age of 15 has been chosen to save the world. Now enter the story and decide on the following roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris- The chosen one. She can be a little naive from time to time, but she never backs down from a fight and is extremely loyal to those she loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire- The blue she-dragon chosen to help Iris. Saphire is rather light most of the time but has a serious side as well. She is not to trusting of strangers and can be a little up-tight. Like Iris she is brave and loyal and is always willing to help. Saphire and Iris have known each other since they were little and always have each other's backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnius- A man at the age of 24. He is a brave and strong warrior but his dark and mysterious behavior puts Saphire on edge. He carries a massive two handed sword and the weight of a past that he refuses to talk about on his back. He doesn't say much and has no obvious care for humor and the only person who can ever get through to him is Iris. He doesn't talk much to anyone else unless he has to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze- Saphire's older brother. He is colored red and can be a bit of a comedian sometimes. He is brave, noble, and believes in always doing what's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows a basic plot, so please stick to it. The chosen one (Iris) must travel to the springs in the four different cities and drink from each of them to gain the power to defeat Draven. She starts from the temple in the center with Saphire, then meets the other characters along the way. Feel free to travel to the cities in any order you'd like just as long as you go to Coran last. Coran has also been abandoned ever since Draven broke out and was sealed away. Now for some rules;<br>\r\n#1- No killing my characters<br>\r\n#2- You MAY add your own characters, in fact I encourage you to<br>\r\n#3- No sexual content at all!<br>\r\n#4- No evil dragons, other dragon characters can be introduced, but none may be evil<br>\r\n#5- Dragons are intelligent and can speak so keep it that way<br>\r\n#6- Follow the basic plot I have set up (see above) but feel free to add your own twists<br>\r\n#7- No foul language, any chapters containing F-bombs or S-bombs will be deleted, I reserve the right to edit out any foul language if I feel it nessasary<br>\r\n#8- Keep in the right tense and keep good spelling, I will edit chapters that break this rule, not delete them<br>\r\n#9- Have fun and be creative<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow go and save the world from darkness!</td>",
