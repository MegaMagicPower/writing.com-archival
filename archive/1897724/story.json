Having gotten her hands on a brand new action puzzle platformer for the PS3. Its title was Seidai Futotteiru Bouken. Being of the Z rating by the CERO Rating Systems for explicit sexual content and nudity, Konata hadn't really heard much about in her usual viewings of magazines and articles on the internet. Given the info on the back of the box, she was surprised she hadn't heard of it, so far it seemed like a very different take on the usual plaforming genre, and would've garnered immediate attention. Descriptions on the back said, \"Use Futaba's weight abilities to get out of the perilous dungeon and save her allies within!\" \"Use your hardened personal wepaon to beat down your enemies and unlock hidden secrets!\" Looking close at the pictures, the bluenette could see that the game was focused around changing between the main character's figure to get past obstacles, and by the looks of it could get rather big. {Weapon?} Konata thought in question at the odd sentence before her. {There's no weapon in any of these pictures.} Thinking it just must've been an oversight by the people who took the pictures, Konata took the disc and started up the game. Going past all the company names and such, skipping past an animated opening. Konata brought herself to the title screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get started then.\" Clicking the X button she was then thrown into a scene of a girl clad in majestic robes being thrown into a dungeon by two powerful looking demons. The girl was bound and gagged with thick rope. Squirming around a bit, she waited for the guards to leave. At this point a button prompt came up telling Konata that to activate the first level gaining spell, hold down the R1 button. Doing so, Futaba then relaxed and started to focus, a slight magical glow appeared around her body. Soon enough, the robes around Futaba's body began to stretch, ripping to shreds alongside the very ropes containing her. Amazed by the details on the process, Konata was unaware of changes somehow happening to her own body, already having put on 10lbs. Now that Futaba was free, she looked around to find a way to get out, thinking to herself that she could get out easily if she hadn't been caught earlier trying to save her friends and all but her most basic of powers were stripped from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking Futaba around, Konata saw some kind on hole of sorts on the wall was glowing, meaning it had relevance to the situation, going over to it, a text box on screen came up saying To activate press and hold R2. Upon doing such, Futaba put a hand underneath her gut and then her chubby belly began to rise up, something was coming up from underneath! \"No way...\" Konata murmured as she looked on in surprise at what came up. From below Futaba's belly was a rock hard 6 inch dick, of all things.<br>\r\n\"Gaaah!\" Konata then felt something... growing in between her legs. Dropping her pants, Konata took sight of a penis on her crotch, sitting right above her shaven natural genitalia. She could say nothing, what was going on? Was it the game, was she just delusional?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing a hand to it, she gripped the organ firmly, feeling the foreskin, its plump head, the veins pumping blood throughout its form, it was without a doubt a dick. Wanting to confirm if this is actually was the game, Konata played pressed R2 again, making Futaba's dick even longer, oddly enough despite it being stated she had lost a lot of powers, Futaba's dick was already over 10 inches it seemed, and even more surprising Konata new dickbegan to grow as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This..is...amazing!\" Konata exclaimed, shocked by what was happening, not really wondering how it was happening so much that it WAS happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending a few more minutes playing the game, Konata had finally realized her gain in weight, having gained a total of 30lbs now she could see her belly poking out from her shirt. At first she had merely attributed it to overeating, she then knew this was not from such a mundane act. \"This...game...is changing me?\" she said as she began to come to terms with this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to play, not really minding her growing form, as well...she had boobs now and she wanted to see just how far this went. Plus the game was too good to stop playing and she seemed fine. As Futaba entered a room, she fond herself face to face with a large, scantily clad succubus. \"Morrigan's been putting on the pounds lately\" Konata chuckled, referencing the Darkstalkers character. Seeing as this was the first boss, she figured that she could probably toy with it a bit. Having regained a bit of her energy on the way here the character Futaba was able to grow to a maximum of 600lbs. Seeing that the succubus swiped at Futaba with sharp claws, Konata positioned Futaba directly in front of the female demon, getting it's hand and arm stuck in Futaba's deep belly button, seeing a couple of button prompts, Konata decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Konata recently found out about a new type of drug that was being developed for the benefit of gamers. She didn't know why, but all she cared about was if it worked. Apparently it is supposed to be injected an hour before a play session, and your reflexes and hand movements will be far quicker until it wears off. It is unknown how long it will be before it wears off, or what side effects it will have aside from most likely making the user more susceptible to headaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata went to website advertising the new drug and signed up to test it for the company developing it. It oddly didn't ask for her age, instead saying the company would deliver the experimental drug in a few days. Konata rushed home from high school on the day that it was supposed to arrive and saw the package laying in front of the door. Konata took notice of everything that came in the package: one half-liter bottle containing the drug, several 3 ml syringes in case one gets lost or infected, and a paper stating how to properly use the drug. It stated that Konata should fill the entire syringe with 3 ml of the drug and inject it into one of her arms. It would last four hours, making her gaming abilities far better than what they already were during that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter injecting herself with the syringe, Konata sat in front of her computer and started playing her usual MMORPG while waiting for the drug to kick in so she'll notice the difference. Once an hour passed, Konata noticed that she was suddenly doing better than usual. Her reaction time was quicker and she was able to input commands at a faster rate. It was just as promised, this drug made Konata better at gaming! However, once the drug wore off four hours later, Konata felt like she was about to pass out from exhaustion despite it only being 7:30 PM, so she turned off the computer and laid down in bed. Seemed like Konata had discovered one of the drug's side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly five minutes later, Konata had managed to fall fast asleep. She slept for longer than she usually did; getting a whole ten and a half hours, but the most shocking thing was something that Konata didn't notice. During her sleep, Konata had gained 25 lbs. At school, Kagami brings up this sudden weight gain, but Konata says she that is the exact same that she has always been. These are the second and third side effects; weight gain of 2.4 lbs. per hour while sleeping and obliviousness towards all weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Konata took another shot of the drug so she could continue playing as well as she did yesterday. Konata was dominating everything in her character's path as she had the skill to avoid everything that was thrown in her direction and immediately strike back. Even with all the enthusiasm Konata put into her play session though, the drug caused her to completely crash when it wore off. Once again, Konata laid in bed and took a look at the clock which read 9:00 PM before immediately falling asleep. It turns out that with each usage, the drug slightly increases the user's weight gain rate, so Konata had gained 22.5 lbs. during her 9 hour sleep, meaning she had gained 2.5 lbs. per hour of sleep. All of this brought Konata up to 140 lbs., or 63.5 kg.</span></div></div>",
