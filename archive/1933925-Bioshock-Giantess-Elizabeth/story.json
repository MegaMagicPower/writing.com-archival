She watched as exploding fireworks and drifting balloons danced colorfully above the distant skyline, signifying the beginning of yet another celebration that she could not attend. After a few seconds of observing the activities of the outside world, Elizabeth sighed and turned away from the window, noticing her lone shadow cast upon the wooden floor by the warm rays of the sun. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        <i> All I want is to get away</i>, Elizabeth thought, <i>but it\u2019s like there\u2019s no way out of this place.</i> Elizabeth turned toward a nearby table and picked up her prized photograph of the Eiffel Tower, staring into it as though it was a window to another world. <i>I know the exact location of every major city in the world, but I can\u2019t go to any of them.</i> She set the picture down, turning back toward her window and wearily observing the unreachable 4th of July festivities thundering in the distance. \u201cI wonder how much fun they\u2019re having,\u201d she said to herself. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n         Before Elizabeth could sulk further, she was startled by a sudden whooshing sound behind herself, which shook the entire library for a brief moment. Quickly regaining her composure, she turned to see if something had damaged the room, but everything appeared to be normal. Elizabeth then realized that the sound and feeling of the event felt familiar. <i>That felt like a tear,</i> she smiled,<i> it must have opened downstairs.</i> She hurried down the stairs to the lower level of the library. She saw a thin bottle lying on the center of the floor. It was adorned with ornate, Greco-Roman swirls and contained a dull, green liquid. Elizabeth walked over to the bottle, seeing that it had a symbol that resembled a red fist imprinted on its side, along with a label that denoted the classification of the liquid contained within. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n         Elizabeth picked up the bottle and read the label closely. \u201cTower of Babel,\u201d she muttered,\u201d feel the power the gods of old have kept hidden\u2026 Until now?\u201d Puzzled, Elizabeth carried the strange liquid back up the stairs to her window to get a better look at the stuff with the help of sunlight. She set it down upon her table and saw that the dark green liquid appeared to be stable, and that all it would take to sample some of it would be removing the cap from atop the bottle. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n         <i> It must be a vigor</i>, she assumed,<i> but I\u2019ve never seen \u201cTower of Babel\u201d in any of those Fink pamphlets I received. I wonder what it does? Is it even safe? And if it came through a tear, was it a tear that I opened?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElizabeth grabbed the bottle, pondering the nature of the vigor and what she would do with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       Elizabeth\u2019s concentration on the \u201cTower of Babel\u201d Vigor was suddenly disrupted by a loud, metallic crashing that came from the ceiling. She looked up to see that the chained part of Songbird\u2019s entrance had come loose, which allowed a man to fall into the room. He tried to grab the railing of the upper level of the library, but his fingers slipped and he found himself lying flat on the lower floor. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n       Elizabeth started down the stairs, clutching the Vigor closely as she watched the man rise from his nasty fall. He wore a dark gray vest with a slightly torn red ascot, which flowed nicely with his black, white-lined pants. His face was quite grizzled, with numerous small cuts and scars. Elizabeth was halfway down the stairs when the man rose up, dusted himself off, and locked eyes with her. \u201cUh, hello,\u201d he began,\u201d my name\u2019s Dewitt, and I\u2019m here to-\u201c\u201dStay back!\u201d Elizabeth shrieked, slowly stepping back up the stairs.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cLook, I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d Dewitt said as he hurried over to the stairs and began ascending them. In response, Elizabeth held up the Vigor, causing Booker to pause. \u201cStay away from me,\u201d she insisted,\u201d I know how to use this!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cThat\u2019s a Vigor, miss,\u201d Booker said,\u201d you sure you know what you've got there?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer.\u201d Elizabeth said. Predictably, Booker made the mistake of continuing his attempts at calming the frightened woman while continuing to move toward her. Elizabeth, however, was true to her word, and in one swift motion, she removed the cap off the bottle and took a long, deep gulp of the liquid.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Elizabeth staggered backward, reaching the landing atop the staircase as she fell to her knees. She had anticipated this, as the Fink pamphlets she had received from Songbird had warned of debilitating side effects of Vigor usage that often affected first-time users. However, the effects that Elizabeth felt subsided rather quickly, and she didn't even witnessed any of the hallucinations that supposedly followed the ingestion of a Vigor.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Booker stood near the top of the stairway kept his distance, not knowing what sort of ability the Vigor would give the girl. Despite her petite frame, she had managed to drain the whole bottle, so there wasn't any chance of him getting to figure it out himself. Before Booker\u2019s imagination could get the better of him, he noticed something off about Elizabeth. <i>Huh</i>, he thought,<i> I thought she was shorter just a second ago\u2026</i><br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Elizabeth got back onto her feet, but noticed that the room seemed to be smaller than it had been before. Turning toward Dewitt, she held her hand out toward him, hoping to be able to activate whatever ability she had acquired to at least threaten him. But when she tried flexing her muscles in the way that was meant to activate most Vigors, her body suddenly expanded, causing her head to bump against the ceiling. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWhat the-\u201d Elizabeth stammered,\u201d What kind of Vigor is this?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Booker couldn't believe it, but Elizabeth was growing at a rapid rate right before his very eyes. He hurried back down the stairs as she began to curl into a crouching position in the upper level, the floor cracking and groaning under her increasing mass. As Elizabeth felt her body pressured against the ceiling and floor, she panicked and kicked outward, shattering the upstairs window and a great portion of the wall. By doing this, Elizabeth\u2019s legs and lengthy skirt spilled out the front of the angel-shaped tower. The weight from Elizabeth\u2019s protruding lower half caused her to slip out of the library entirely.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Elizabeth slid down the Columbian angel\u2019s metallic gown, eventually reaching its base with less pain than she had expected. She quickly realized that this was because she was still growing. She kept growing until, eventually, she was tall enough that her head Monument Tower\u2019s waistline. <br>\r\nWithout much intermediate thought, Elizabeth continued to focus on Dewitt, the man who had so rudely broken into her home. She reached her arm above her head and pried her hand into the hole she had made in the tower as if she were checking a high shelf for a nearly unreachable item. Elizabeth blindly swept her open palm through the library, unknowingly causing great damage to its contents, until she swiped the struggling body of the now minuscule home invader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Elizabeth held Dewitt up to her scowling face. Disoriented, Dewitt could only weakly look toward her face and see her massive, godlike eyes staring into him. \u201cWell,\u201d Elizabeth began, the volume of her voice almost too much for him to handle,\u201d I guess the Vigor worked fine after all. SO, little man, what do you have to say for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \u201cI was just trying to help you,\u201d Booker shouted, knowing the volume difference that would come with the new size difference,\u201d honest. I was going to help you escape, from that tower and this city. You\u2019ve gotta believe me, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Elizabeth weighed the options in her mind. Did she believe him or not?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just look at how big she is! This stranger posed no threat to her anymore. Elizabeth decided to give him a chance. \"Ok! I'll believe you, but I'll crush you if I need to!\" She warns. Booker is a bit relieved that she actually decided to believe him. It was a bit surprising too. Booker expected her to just crush him for breaking into her tower home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Booker shouts up to her. \"I promise you won't need to crush me! I'm here to help!\" Elizabeth couldn't help but giggle a bit. \"You? Help me? That's funny. At this size I imagine it's you who would need help from me.\" She made a good point. Booker wasn't too happy with the position of helplessness he was forced into here. \"So who are you, little man? Er, Dewitt, right?\" The giantess asks. \"Yeah. It's Booker Dewitt, and I don't need help from you.\" Booker responds. Elizabeth gets a smug look. \"Oh? Let's see you get back onto the ground from here.\" Booker looks around. It looks a little too dangerous to get down on his own. \"I'd rather not risk it.\" He says. Elizabeth laughs a bit, the sound of her voice booming. \"I guess your sticking with me for a bit then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly did you come to help me with, Mr. Dewitt?\" Elizabeth questions. \"I came to break you out, but you did a fine job of that yourself.\" Dewitt answered. \"So come on. Let's get out of this place.\" He adds, trying to keep his focus on the job. Elizabeth just smirks. \"I don't think your in much of a position to tell me where to go, Mr. Dewitt. I think the first place I'll visit at this size is Paris. It can't be too hard like this, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she looks around and realizes the citizens of Columbia staring up at her. \"Wow, everyone is just so tiny to me. It's like they're all just a bunch of ants.\" Elizabeth says as she smiles and waves down to the growing crowd. They stare in awe, not sure if this giant posed a friend or foe. \"Well Mr. Dewitt I appreciate your... efforts to free me. It was very kind of you, but I think I can take care of myself from here.\" \"Wait!\" Booker screams out. He could let her get away. Maybe he could convince her... \"Can you at least take me with you? I know there is absolutely no reason to keep me along, but I would like it if you kept me around.\" Booker hopes she would listen until the chance came to have her come along. Elizabeth once again looks at Booker, thinking about what to do.</span></div></div>",

Well, it\u2019s settled then, Mister Dewitt. You can come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cYeah,\u201d Booker replied,\u201d glad we\u2019re on the same page here. So, I know you mentioned Paris, but what if we went to-\u201c\u201dOh, of course!\u201d Elizabeth exclaimed in excitement. The sheer volume of her voice almost shattered Booker\u2019s eardrums, along with causing the curious Columbian spectators to wince. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cOf course\u2026 What?\u201d Booker asked, his hands resting on his ringing ears. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cMaybe at this size, I\u2019ll have more power,\u201d Elizabeth said, her voice dampening,\u201d So, if I focused hard enough\u2026\u201d After stating this, she set Booker on top of a nearby building, telling him to wait a moment. Elizabeth breathed deeply, spread her arms out horizontally, and shut her eyes, her face holding a look of almost Zen-like concentration. The citizens of Columbia watched in anticipation from various floating platforms, not knowing what this giant girl was about to do.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWhat the hell is she doing\u2026?\u201d Booker muttered to himself as he, too, watched Elizabeth\u2019s strange performance.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        After a few seconds of silence, an uneasy rumbling that emanated from Elizabeth hummed through the area, causing moderate vibrations on nearby structures. Suddenly, a massive vertical line of distortion appeared front of her monolithic frame, near the edge of the floating island. Elizabeth set her arms in front of herself and deepened her focus. She then grunted and slowly spread her arms back apart. She strained against some invisible force, as if she was attempting to rip a piece of solid steel in half with her bare hands. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Eventually, the hole in time and space opened, leaving the people of Columbia (and Booker) staring in astonishment. Elizabeth had opened an apartment building-sized tear into the lush French countryside, only a couple miles outside Paris. Elizabeth opened her eyes and saw that she had been successful, and was so excited that she couldn\u2019t say a word.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cUh, Miss,\u201d Booker questioned, yelling as loudly as possible from his rooftop,\u201d why is France in front of you?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Without warning, Elizabeth snatched up Booker, giddy with excitement. \u201cCome on, Mister Dewitt,\u201d she said, barely restraining her urge to scream in happiness,\u201d It\u2019s a tear! It\u2019s a way to Paris!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cParis\u2026?\u201d Booker asked, dazed from the motion of being grabbed so strongly,\u201d But I have to get you back to New York\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cNew York?\u201d Elizabeth said, looking at Booker in confusion,\u201d Uh, sure, maybe later. But for now\u2026\u201d Elizabeth refocused her eyes on the tear. Without hesitation, she almost skipped through the tear and ended up on a grassy, brightly lit plain in midsummer France.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        After stepping through the tear, Elizabeth had to take a moment to recompose herself in her new environment. Her natural adaptations to the low air pressure of Columbia took a moment to adjust to the more abundant air supply of the surface, which resulted in some stifled breathing and slight dizziness. Elizabeth held her hands to her chest as she transitioned to the feeling of being on solid ground, firmly pressing Booker against her left breast.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Squirming his way up from his pillowy entrapment, Booker heard and felt Elizabeth\u2019s struggles with the greater air pressure of the surface. Since he didn\u2019t have the time to fully adjust to Columbia\u2019s atmosphere, Booker\u2019s body readily accepted being back on solid ground (or at least close to it,) so he was confused as to what was wrong. Nevertheless, he was still confused. \u201cIs everything alright, Elizabeth?\u201d Booker asked. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        As if on cue, Elizabeth\u2019s breathing began to balance out and her sense of balance became regulated. \u201cI feel fine now, Mister Dewitt,\u201d she replied, looking down at the tiny man that she cradled almost like a small child,\" but thank you for your concern.\" However, it was then that the reality of the situation hit Elizabeth head-on.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said,\u201d I\u2019m out! And I\u2019m near <i>Paris</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Booker said, slouching back into the softness of Elizabeth\u2019s chest. This didn\u2019t last long, as Elizabeth brought her hands back out in front of her face, holding Booker in the cup between them. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to see and do,\u201d she said,\u201d but what should we do first? We could go and see the Lourve, or the Triomphe, or we could just go straight to the Tower, or- there\u2019s just too much!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201c\u2026New York might also be pretty neat,\u201d Booker weakly suggested.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cBut what <i>should </i>we do first?

And call me Booker.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cOh, alright, <i>Booker</i>.\u201d Elizabeth mockingly replied, turning her attention toward the city of Paris in the distance. Or what would have been \u201cthe distance\u201d to a normal-sized person; at Elizabeth\u2019s height, it looked like it would only take a leisurely stroll to reach the city. Judging by the position of the rising line of urban real estate, she guessed that she was south of the city. \u201cWell,\u201d Elizabeth said, holding Booker near her stomach,\u201d off we go.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Elizabeth stayed close the footpaths adjacent to the nearby farmlands, hoping to not attract too much attention. She inevitably did, however; within minutes of her arrival, hundreds of country-dwelling French men and women were alerted to her presence and rushing to alert their neighbors, friends, and family, barely able to believe what they were witnessing. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Most of the people who observed Elizabeth didn\u2019t dare go anywhere near her as she stomped her way toward Paris. One of the few who did- a teenage farm boy who was entranced by the giant woman\u2019s almost mythical size and beauty- stood beneath a tree situated near the footpath hoping to get a closer look at her as she passed by. As she did, however, the shockwaves sent out by her girth-filled footsteps threw the young farmhand off his feet and into Elizabeth\u2019s path. Noticing this, Booker yelled at Elizabeth to stop- just as the underside of her boot was a mere inches from the boy.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Booker?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cJust take a step back,\u201d Booker said. Elizabeth complied, and as she looked down to see what had been nearly crushed beneath her foot, she spotted the teenager face-down on the ground, quivering in fear. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said, almost losing control of her volume,\u201d I could\u2019ve killed him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cYou should probably be a bit more careful from now on,\u201d Booker suggested.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cI agree,\u201d Elizabeth said before turning her attention toward the still frightened boy on the ground, bending down to get a better look at him.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cJe suis desole,\u201d she said, prodding lightly at his back with her free finger. The boy cautiously got up, dusted himself off, and looked upward toward Elizabeth. \u201cM-merci, mademoiselle,\u201d he weakly said before running off.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cOkay,\u201d Elizabeth said, sighing in relief,\u201d let\u2019s continue.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        As Elizabeth and Booker traversed the warm, blue-skied French farmlands, conversation inevitably continued between the two. Booker was the first to speak after a minute of silent travel.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cI\u2019m still a bit confused on how we\u2019re\u2026 Here.\u201d Booker said as he reclined in Elizabeth\u2019s cupped hand.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cOh, do you mean the tear that I opened?\u201d Elizabeth asked as she kept her eyes trained on the ground for more pedestrians.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cIs that what you call that thing that led us here?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re referred to as in the books I\u2019ve read. Tears are points in spacetime that connect two different universes to each other. It\u2019s sort of like a window into another world. Or a door, in this case.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cSo, you can\u2019t normally just go through them?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cActually, I used to pass through tears all the time when I was younger. But after I grew into a teenager, I lost the ability to travel freely between them.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cUntil today.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWell, sort of. I\u2019ve never been entirely sure what gives me the ability to create tears, but since I began losing the ability to move through them, I\u2019ve began to hypothesize that my power to create them come from a finite source. So, when I became larger from the effects of that Vigor, I assumed that the output of my power would scale up as well. Since I was apparently right, I managed to open a large tear that was freely traversable.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201c\u2026Alright, you\u2019ll have to get back to me on that later,\u201d Booker said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, speaking of your size,\u201d Booker resumed,\u201d just how tall are you, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cBig enough to hold you like a miniature figurine,\u201d Elizabeth said, smiling and running her free hand\u2019s pointer finger over Booker\u2019s torso,\u201d but I think the Vigor bottle said something about two-hundred feet.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cSo, that\u2019s how tall you are right now?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cMaybe a little less than that,\u201d Elizabeth said, stopping briefly to give herself a quick once-over before continuing her march,\u201d If I were that big, you\u2019d be like an insect to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cFunnily enough, I already feel that way,\u201d Booker chuckled.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        After a few more minutes of traveling, Booker and Elizabeth arrived at the exterior suburbs of Paris. The rows of ornate apartment complexes and storefronts, most around five stories in height, ran for hundreds of meters before breaking off into side streets and alleyways. The buildings seemed to come just barely up to Elizabeth\u2019s hips, giving Booker a wide view of the streets and rooftops. The streets themselves were notably vacant, save for a few wandering civilians. \u201cHuh, looks like we\u2019re already within the city limits,\u201d Booker said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWe are,\u201d Elizabeth said, her smile growing,\u201d I\u2019m so excited to see everything! I still can hardly believe I\u2019m out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Booker said, gazing down the road to see a large mass of figures gathered a great distance from himself and his giant companion. The unimpeded rays of the sun prevented him from discerning exactly who they were. \u201c\u2026What the hell\u2019s their problem?\u201d Booker muttered as he positioned his right hand above his eyes as a visor, Elizabeth\u2019s pace grinding to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \u201cI can tell from here, Booker,\u201d Elizabeth said,\u201d they look like\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were enjoying the game, though you were enjoying Elizabeth a little more. You were using the scopes and sights of weapons to try to get a better first person view at her... assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile admiring Elizabeth, you notice something unusual in your room. Some sort of energy of some sort, which turns into a portal of some sort, and on the other side is a fancy room of some sort, and Elizabeth inside it! \"I finally found you! It's about time you stop looking don't you think?\" She says seductively, winking as she grabs her breasts. \"Come on handsome, I'll show you a much better time than sitting here looking and touching yourself...\" She chuckles. Of course you are practically drooling over Elizabeth, and run through the tear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when you run through the tear, The room and Elizabeth were huge! The tear was still your size but closes right behind you. You look up to see Elizabeth smirking at you. \"I finally go to Paris, and everything was wonderful until I find out some perv from another world was just staring at me in a video game! I don't know what that business is about, but right now you need to be taught a lesson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you begin to run immediately, but you are grabbed by the far larger girl. \"You seem quite fond of my behind...\" She says, bringing you up to her face. \"I think I'll give you some time with it.\" You struggle in her grasp, not liking the tone of that sentence. She drops you onto the nearest seat, and even though you were given freedom from her grasp you were now stuck on a chair. Elizabeth turns around, bending and slowly lowering her ass onto you, which was being shown off surprisingly nice in the dress. You had no time to admire because it crashed down onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shifts around, getting comfortable on you. Her large soft cheeks were surprisingly painful as they rub against you. Her shifting ended with you between her cheeks. \"What's wrong? My ass more than you can handle?\" She laughs, bouncing and pummeling you with her big butt. \"I thought this was what you wanted?\" She wiggles around. Her butt was so much bigger and more powerful than you, it was rather humiliating really. \"Look at you, so weak compared to my butt. Aren't you loving this now you little pervert? Aren't you glad to be so close to my body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do nothing but lay there, smothered by her giant ass grinding you against the chair. \"Enough of this, I have to make it worse for you.\" She says before getting up, your sore and pulverized body laying there and the pain too great for your will to run. Elizabeth takes off her dress, letting you see the beautiful sight of her body only in her underwear. She picks you up again, giggling. \"I hope you're enjoying this, because you won't for much longer...\" She brings you around to the back of her panties and extends her waistband, revealing her ass crack which was like the grand canyon at this side. She drops you right down into the abyss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets the waistband snap back into place, pinning you tightly against her bare cheeks. The smell was much more noticeable on this inside. It had a certain musk in her crack, as well as sweat. \"I got done with a walk earlier, it's a little hot outside, hope you don't mind...\" She wiggles her rear, shaking you around. You could feel her working you slowly into her crack, but you were too small and weak to fight against her massive flesh. You can hear her clearly laughing at you, and your situation was laughable. Just a pervert being completely and utterly dominated by this characters ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear a noise from deep within her bowels. This terrified you, knowing exactly what this could be. Elizabeth pushes you deep in with her finger, smearing you against her anus. This elicits a moan from her. \"That feels great, but not as good as this is going to feel...\" She says as the noise grows louder, and her anus erupts with a blast of hot air. The smell became so much stronger. Your senses were completely overwhelmed by a single fart. The hot air heating her crack uncomfortably, and you felt like your nose was going to fall of from the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down painfully, squishing you under her buns. Her cheeks are clenched onto you tightly. \"Oh I see my dinner is kicking in. All that food was so good, but the gas is so disgusting. You'll take it all though, so I don't have to smell it.\" Her asshole begins pulsing violently, and before you notice it... you are being sucked in! Her anus was too strong for you. You can not fight against her giant anus. The fact you were battered by her giant cheeks didn't help. She lets loose another fart right onto you face, stunning you. Her anus then clenched on your head, and starts to pull you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck halfway, her anal muscles keeping you stuck tightly halfway. You were stuck smelling and feeling the stink and slime of her rectum, and the other side left to squirm and wiggle outside. Elizabeth moans on the outside. \"That feels so good... You can keep doing that while I fart on you, you dirty pervert!\" She farts on you again, you taking the whole force of it. You were a human butt plug now. You couldn't help but cry, your fantasy corrupted terribly. You were now probably going to be like this forever, or die like this. It was utterly humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Elizabeth gets an idea...</span></div></div>",

Realizing this, she looks above. Coming towards her was Songbird, but he was small! About the size of an actual bird. \"What? W-what happened?\" She asks, dumbfounded. She never got her answer, but she did start to smile. \"I suppose this means you won't be keeping me locked up anywhere now huh?\" She walks away, ignoring the tiny machine bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth kept walking to the exit, unfazed by the shrunken bird's attempts to stop her. She picks the lock easily. After gaining access to the door, she turns to deal with her little nuisance. \"Your really annoying me. You won't be coming with me I'm afraid.\" With that she slaps the robot down and pins it down with her boot. This breaks it slightly. \"Now you stay there while I go finally see the outside!\" Songbird laid there broken and Elizabeth had finally left her tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the long descent down her prison, Elizabeth was quite disappointed to see things so empty.

Just a moment ago, he had been on the run from the Columbian militia on his way to Monument Island, blasting his way through hordes of soldiers and leaping from skyline to skyline. Now he was the size of a chess piece, standing next to the massive leg of a Caf\u00e9 chair near a sidewalk. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n          Judging by the lack of giant people, it seemed that Booker wasn\u2019t alone in getting shrunken. How or why it happened didn\u2019t matter; to him, it was just another obstacle. Booker looked down at his hip. \u201cAt least my guns shrunk with me,\u201d he said, drawing his pistol from its holster. \u201cThat probably means <i>they\u2019ll</i> still be armed, too. I just need to keep moving. Get the girl, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Booker raised his left hand in front of his face and inspected it. \u201cHuh\u2026 I wonder if my Vigors still work.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Booker\u2019s pondering was stopped by the deep sounds of distant footsteps. \u201cI guess not everyone was shrunken after all,\u201d he mused. The booming steps seemed to be coming from the sidewalk, so Booker took cover behind the metal chair leg on the side facing the Caf\u00e9. He peered out to see the face of the giant that he was hiding from, and it was none other than the face that was on the picture given to him by the people who had sent him on this crazy mission in the first place.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Elizabeth stomped by, scanning the street and its rows of buildings for any signs of life. \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d No response came. \u201cThis is so strange\u2026 Where is everyone? Huh\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why no one ever comes to see me. There\u2019s no one here in the first place!\u201d Elizabeth giggled a bit on her last comment, but then sighed. \u201cStill\u2026 I was kind of hoping to meet some people.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n         As the blue-skirted giantess crossed Booker\u2019s field of vision, he realized that he needed to seize this opportunity. \u201cShe\u2019d probably be better at piloting an airship than me at this point, anyway,\u201d Booker said as he slid over the foot of the chair leg and ran after Elizabeth, who was still casually strolling along. While chasing after her, he jumped and shouted, \u201cHey! Miss! Do you see me down here?\u201d Elizabeth didn\u2019t even glance back at him. \u201cDamn it, she can\u2019t hear me,\u201d Booker said, still running along,\u201d I need to get her attention, but how?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could probably climb her dress by grabbing hold of the threads.\u201d Despite years of alcoholism, Booker\u2019s military training gave him a nearly unquenchable supply of stamina. As Elizabeth\u2019s left foot hit the ground and her right foot careened forward, the lower rim of her dress caught against the end of her boot. Taking advantage of this, Booker leapt forth and grabbed onto of the rim with both his hands.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Booker grasped the blue threads firmly as Elizabeth\u2019s left foot swung forward. The dress drooped back into hanging loosely over the ground, so the tiny man began clawing his way up the wall of fabric. Booker\u2019s climb was somewhat sluggish, as Elizabeth\u2019s skirt swayed and crinkled with every step the girl took. Higher and higher he ascended, wedging his hands and feet between the threads before lifting himself up another level. Eventually, he noticed that the curtain-like dress became less wavy and more consistent, with a smooth, curved bulge pushing out from behind the fabric. He then realized that this must be Elizabeth\u2019s bouncy, rounded rear.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n         Though being on Elizabeth\u2019s butt allowed Booker to climb faster, it also presented a few problems. She might feel his tiny hands poking against her soft skin, which would lead to him getting discovered by an angry, accusatory young woman. Or maybe something even worse could happen. Still, Booker had to keep going, or else he might loose his grip and never have a chance of making contact with the girl at all. But how did it go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, his caution will prove to be rather detrimental to his progress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth continued to stroll through the micro populated city of Columbia, her wandering bringing her into a park. \"Oh a park! A close look at nature, without a tear!\" She runs over to the park merrily, excited to nature from outside the tower. Booker's climb was made even more difficult with the rapid movement. He was able to cling tight enough, but he had to keep going like this as Elizabeth would just not stop moving. \"Oh look at these flowers! and that butterfly looks so beautiful!\" She moves around constantly, bending over and crouching to observe the outside world and it's inhabitants. Although all the human inhabitants were either hiding, or ended up meeting a terrible fate under her boots...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this is so exciting!

She closed her eyes and breathed deeply, taking in the aromas of the trees and flowers as she processed the world around her. \u201cThis is so wonderful,\u201d she softly spoke, \u201cthere\u2019s just so much to see and do out here\u2026 But I think I\u2019ll stay here just a little longer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Unbeknownst to her, a shrunken man known as Booker Dewitt was currently fighting to remain conscious underneath her shapely rear. Being between the cheeks of Elizabeth\u2019s buttocks had resulted in him getting smacked around and smothered as the girl shifted around to reach a more comfortable sitting position. Now she had found that position, however. For Elizabeth, this was just a passing moment of relief. For Booker, it was extremely dangerous as the girl\u2019s gigantic pelvic area now descended toward him, the soft flesh of her ass filling the seat and slowly becoming still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Booker did what anyone would do in his situation; he panicked, squirming and kicking against the cloth-covered mound of flesh that threatened to envelop and suffocate him. Unfortunately, Elizabeth was so relaxed that she didn\u2019t pay the strange feeling beneath her rear any mind. The shrunken former soldier intensified his struggles, punching and grasping uselessly at the amorphous mass that seemed to have engulfed him completely. This definitely was not how Booker Dewitt intended to die, so he resolved to fight until he was drained of energy, hoping for a stroke of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The luck that Booker desired appeared when he left a particularly sharp kick against the giant girl\u2019s pelvic bone. Elizabeth finally began to notice the tiny man\u2019s struggles, wincing a little as she felt something poke against her bottom. Sighing, she muttered to herself, \u201cWhat <i>is</i> that? It feels\u2026 Odd.\u201d The young lady stood up from her seat and turned around to examine the bench. Very quickly, she saw something unusual on the flattened wood- the tiny form of what looked like a human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Booker weakly sat up in relief as the pressure of Elizabeth\u2019s butt suddenly vanished. As his eyes readjusted to sunlight, however, he saw that the giant girl now loomed over the bench, peering down at him. Booker realized that now was a good a time as any, so he waved his arms and called out Elizabeth\u2019s name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cIs that a\u2026 Person?\u201d Elizabeth asked, her mouth curled in confusion. She bent over for a closer look at the petite being, and saw that it was not only moving, but definitely resembled a human. Elizabeth then got down on her knees to observe the being even closer, allowing her to hear out what sounded like speech. The sudden approach of her face also seemed to startle him; the tiny man backed away from her imminent visage, shouting, \u201cHey, hey! That\u2019s close enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cWhat are you?\u201d Elizabeth immediately questioned, her warm breath blowing Booker\u2019s hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cI\u2019m the man who\u2019s gonna help you to leave this crazy city. Now, if you give your-\u201c\u201dNo,\u201d Elizabeth interrupted, \u201cI mean, are you human?\u2019<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n         \u201c\u2026The hell kind of question is that? I\u2019m as human as anyone else who\u2019s been shrunken, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cWait,\u201d Elizabeth said, her confused expression turning into a frown,\u201d were you the thing that was\u2026 Under me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cWhat? Well, yeah, I guess I was.\u201d Without warning, Elizabeth\u2019s hand swooped under Booker and snatched him up. Elizabeth stood back to her full height and held the little man in an open palm in front of her scowling face. \u201cHey, hey, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cWere you trying to take advantage of my inattentiveness, little man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cHuh? No, I was just trying to reach you by climbing your dress. That was it, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Elizabeth paused for a moment. How did she react to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
