And as much trouble as her daughter is having fitting in on a soccer team that she hates, Carrie is having just as much trouble making friends with the other moms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she comes across the coolest moms of Milton High; Shelby Sullivan, Flo Folly, and Dillon Duncan. They're the most popular ladies on the PTA, and Carrie wants a slice of what they have. Soccer momming, day-drinking, art galleries... it all sounds like so much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's a little more than Southern Hospitality at play behind these moms paying for her food, pouring her drinks, and inviting her into their charmed lives. After all, Shelby and her friends need someone to make them look good by comparison...<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Caleb, Cat, &amp; Cutie Pie's\u2014</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Caleb is a nerdy guy. Even though he's not all that popular with the ladies, he's still friendly and sociable. He goes to the comic book shop every Wednesday and plays his video games\u2014what's not to love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this all changes once he meets Cat, an absolute babe who works at the Cutie Pie's Confectionary just a few doors down from the comic shop! He's smitten with her at first sight, and so is she! It's a match made in heaven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, being Cat's boyfriend carries a heavy weight with it. Mostly around Caleb's gut!<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stacy's Mom\u2014</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Stacy Stanford, like most of us, has a mother. It was just the two of them for a while, but then she went and got re-married to a guy named Stewart. All pretty normal so far, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, around the time that Stacy graduates high school, her mother Stella and her step-father Stewart sit her down and warn her that when she sees her mother next, she's going to look a little <i>different</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause they both have a weight gain fetish, and Stella Stanford-Sterns is going to <i>intentionally</i> gain as much weight as possible. Stacy is, somewhat understandably, perturbed.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Life of Haley\u2014</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Haley West tried to live on her own. After high school, she moved away from home and did her level best at being a grown-up. But unfortunately, she couldn't quite crack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to her mom with her tail between her legs, Haley is welcomed back with open arms as Mrs. West shakes off the empty nest syndrome and spoils Haley rotten! She doesn't have to get a job, her back-to-college clothes are paid for, and (most importantly) there's a big meal waiting for her on the table at every opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley is at the center of a cast of characters as she begins to chub up under her mother's roof, with her old friends Courtney, Dani, and Mackenzie to potentially chunk up with her along the ride...</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie hated soccer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a child she\u2019d hated it. Her mother had forced her onto the team last-minute, none of the other kids really liked her, and she thought that the uniform was the ugliest shade of puke green. Her team had never won in the four years she\u2019d played, and she\u2019d just never really shaken all of the negative feelings attached to the sport. It always made her think of how much she always hated her mom for making her do stuff \u201cfor her own good\u201d. Stuff that she\u2019d \u201cthank her for later\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, here she was on the bleachers, doing her best to cheer as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuality parenting, right? As much resentment as she felt towards her mother and this stupid European excuse for football, she\u2019d gone and enrolled her own daughter on the team only to be met with just as much enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie hadn\u2019t been taking the move well. Divorce was always hardest on the kids, or so she\u2019d heard, but Carrie couldn\u2019t help but worry about her daughter. Starting a new school had especially rough\u2014the new job meant that she had to move poor Katie to an entirely new school district, and during the middle of middle school no less. She\u2019d more or less spent all of eighth grade in her room, talking on her phone or playing her games. She hadn\u2019t made any friends the previous year, and she\u2019d spent practically all Summer stuck inside being a slug. Sure, her grades had improved, but for how long? It wasn\u2019t healthy to stay cooped up all the time playing Overwatch, and Carrie sure didn\u2019t want her bright, bubbly daughter to find herself ostracized during high school. The last thing Carrie wanted to deal with was a full-on teenaged rebellion, complete with Satan stars and black lipstick, in the middle of her already gripping with a nasty case of becoming suddenly single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without much idea as to what else to do, Carrie decided that Katie was going to play Soccer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for her own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(ugh)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she hated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs alone as Katie must have felt down there, she felt even more alone up in the stands. She knew nobody. It was so much easier when Katie went to the same school district she had growing up. All the moms and dads were just people she went to high school with. She didn\u2019t even have a husband to barnacle herself to anymore\u2014she might have even taken him over the crowd of strangers, if just for the length of these stupid soccer matches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she thought to herself, that from the stands she could enjoy a good chili dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe, in another life, that would have been the highlight of her daughter\u2019s soccer matches. The sewer pipe that was her life might have a little crack that led to the sunshine that was \u201cwow my daughter might hate this as much as I do, but boy how about them chili dogs?\u201d and life would have just been grand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, right after the kickoff of the second quarter, that was when she saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she not have seen them before? The three of them had been talking throughout the entire game; laughing, taking pictures, having such a good time. They were all dressed in the same golden number 9 jersey\u2014SULLIVAN written across all their backs in solidarity. They seemed so\u2026 together. Like they knew what they were doing with their lives. Even with the whistle blowing down on the field and the stands clamoring around them, Carrie\u2019s attention was drawn intrinsically towards the conversation that she couldn\u2019t really hear but so desperately wanted to be a part of. The three of them just seemed so\u2026 so cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow, in some way, Carrie knew that that was what she needed in her shambled life. A group of friends, just like that. Ones who would come to soccer matches and make it fun for her. Friends that she could talk to and who could show her around the town. Friends who she could bitch about her cheating ex-husband to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d spent so much time worrying about Katie being moved clear across the state, having no friends and nothing to do, that she\u2019d totally missed that she was in the exact same situation as her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so obvious; how could she have not seen it before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi!\u201d Carrie said with a small wave as the name on the back of their jerseys evaporated from her mind, \u201cAre you, uh\u2026 players\u2019 moms? Moms of players?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d The redheaded one in the middle said with a little laugh and a dismissive wave, her pretty voice lilting in the Autumn heat, \u201cI\u2019m Summer\u2019s mom\u2014you know, the co-captain? Its only her second year and she\u2019s already pretty much in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Carrie was practically starstruck by these women, fuck the kid, \u201cSo, are you all\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, we\u2019re just here to watch the game\u2014we go to Shelby\u2019s girl\u2019s games, she comes to our girls\u2019 things.\u201d The blonde on the end furthest to Carrie laughed, \u201c\u2019Are we all\u2019! Us, all together like that, can you imagine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them tittered at the insinuation, Carrie laughing along dumbly and for a little too long. The other mothers stared at her for the briefest of moments before carrying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre your girls on the team, darlin\u2019?\u201d the tall brunette asked with a piqued eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls? No, just girl. One girl. Number, uh\u2026\u201d crap crap crap what was her daughter\u2019s number? \u201cKatie. Her name\u2019s Katie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh so you\u2019re\u2026\u201d the same one winced slightly, \u201cKatie\u2019s mom\u2026 riiiight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNumber 5!\u201d Carrie blurted out, \u201cKatie\u2019s number 5.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, all at once, the other mothers peered down into the soccer field for what had to have been the first time since the game started. They scrutinized each of the golden little specks before one of them\u2014the one furthest from Carrie\u2014pointed her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh!\u201d the one in the middle said, \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s definitely\u2026 a player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little\u2026 slow, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 a kind of big for her age, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s blood ran cold. What was the protocol here? It wasn\u2019t like she really cared how good her daughter was at soccer. It wasn\u2019t like Katie even cared about how good she was at soccer. Was this something to get offended about? If she got offended, did that mean she couldn\u2019t hang out with these cool moms who totally had their lives together? This was the kind of thing that someone really needed to explain to newly single parents\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s still learning.\u201d Carrie laughed it off, \u201cNot really into Soccer yet\u2026 but she will be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my name\u2019s Shelby.\u201d The redheaded one continued in an almost bored sort of voice, \u201cShelby Sullivan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlorence Folly.\u201d The blonde one smiled piteously, \u201cCall me Flo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDillon Duncan, charmed.\u201d The taller brunette said in a curt sort of voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, C-Carrie.\u201d the only woman not in a jersey said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you too, hun.\u201d Shelby broached dismissively, \u201cWell we\u2019re here at every soccer game\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr Football game.\u201d Dillon interjected, \u201cGo Cougars!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArt Club events too.\u201d Flo wriggled her fingers, \u201cIt was so nice to meet you, sweetie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to stop by and say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the three of them turned inward, back unto themselves. Carrie stood there for just a few seconds, trying to think of some clever sign off, before eventually just doing that awkward bleacher shuffle back to her seat. It wasn\u2019t until she was seated that she realized she\u2019d been talking with all those other women with a giant chili stain on her flannel shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat went well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie groaned, sinking her head deep into her hands. Moments like this called for another chili dog.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie had been waiting in the car when Katie tumbled into the backseat. Sweating like a mule, she threw her gym bag at the driver side rear door from the inside and slowly wriggled her way into the back seat of their trusty sedan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit up front?\u201d her mother asked, looking into the back seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Wanna lay down.\u201d The poor girl panted, brown hair matted to her forehead as she flattened herself across the back seats, \u201cJust for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know if I hit the brakes hard, you\u2019ll go rolling off, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t brake so hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Carrie had many things in common. She was hardly her father\u2019s child at all\u2014Carrie and her daughter had the same dark brown hair, the same big green eyes and fair skin. She was awfully freckled, though, that much she did get from her ex-husband. More recently his heritage was beginning to become more apparent as puberty set in. Katie was already developing a chest that had to come from somewhere other than her side of the family tree. It seemed like they went shopping for bras every other month. But more importantly, and a little worryingly, Katie had started to put on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely normal and understandable\u2014Carrie\u2019s seat sat a little wider herself now that she had found herself newly and suddenly single\u2014and no one blamed her daughter for it. Her parents splitting up must have been difficult to deal with, and her way of doing so had been moving from Silver to Platinum as a D.Va main. Compounded with her changing body and Carrie\u2019s admittedly lackluster grocery shopping habits, it was only natural that her daughter was starting to put away a little chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been the initial reasoning behind her joining the soccer team. A physical activity and a goal-oriented mentality would not only keep her from falling too hard into rebellion, but it would also keep her in shape. Carrie figured that it would have been a win-win, if it felt like anybody won. She didn\u2019t like going to these games, and Katie definitely didn\u2019t like playing in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even still, moments like this called for encouragement\u2014one of those Mom Answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get easier.\u201d Carrie offered a smile from the front seat, cranking the ignition, \u201cYou know, keep going to practice, a few more games\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe utter distaste that Katie had for the prospect of more games looming ominously in her future was made evident by the widening of her eyes. Her formerly flush face seemed to whiten a bit as the words \u2018a few more games\u2019 hit her like a ton of bricks. It made Carrie feel like crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want McDonalds.\u201d Katie grunted, working her way into a seated position before her mother backed out of the parking space, \u201cIf you\u2019re not gonna let me quit and give me Mom Answers, I deserve McDonalds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Carrie laughed as she put the car into reverse, \u201cI think you\u2019ve earned some fast food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI deserve all the fast food.\u201d Katie grumbled, whipping out her phone, \u201cSo you met Summer\u2019s mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie winced as she recalled her painful first encounter with the other moms. God, it had been so painful. She\u2019d spent the rest of the game alternating between looking longingly at them and trying desperately not to make eye contact. She must have come across like a total mental patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeees?\u201d Carrie\u2019s smile turned into a grimace, \u201cI, uh\u2026 was she the uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally cool mom with two other really cool friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 yeah, I\u2026 may have met her. In the stands. For a minute.\u201d Was that a proper way of saying that she\u2019d totally embarrassed herself, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Summer just texted me about it.\u201d Katie pointed to her phone, \u201cShe said you had chili on your shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does not say that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d Katie flipped the phone around to show her mother, who felt about an inch tall right about now, \u201cSays you didn\u2019t even remember my number. Wow, thanks Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez\u2026\u201d Carrie grimaced, finding it particularly hard to focus on getting out of this stupid over-packed parking lot while her daughter read her her rights, \u201cDoes it say anything else about me? Maybe something that doesn\u2019t make me look like the world\u2019s shittiest, slobbiest mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean Mrs. Sullivan is throwing a party for the team at her house, and she wanted to know if we could come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d Carrie\u2019s face lit up, butterflies in her stomach as she pressed that precious little w-word, \u201cLike, if you and me could come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but like\u2026\u201d Katie\u2019s eyes got wide again as the prospect of further socialization truly dawned on her, \u201cYou don\u2019t really\u2026 want to go to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, honey, it\u2019s important to make friends with your teammates!\u201d Carrie\u2019s smile was a mile wide as she pulled out onto the main road outside of the school, \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame if we didn\u2019t go support the Cougars\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014It\u2019s for your own good, Katie. Doing things you don\u2019t like builds character!\u201d Carrie said in her best Mom voice, \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019re in a new town, with people we don\u2019t know\u2026 it might be fun to make some friends that don\u2019t require a very expensive internet bill! Support the team, put in some face time with Summer and the captain, maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Katie harrumphed, \u201cBut this is going in the book I\u2019m writing when I grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd people will buy it because you\u2019ll have friends to advertise to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>\u201cMom.\u201d<br>\r\n</b></u></span></div></div>",

And for all of the fun she tried to be and as much of the negativity from her old life as she tried to leave behind her, it was pretty hard to be much fun at these kinds of things when you were a recently divorced single mother of a teenaged girl in a new city where you knew absolutely no one. What was she going to talk about? If someone was stupid enough to ask her to \u201ctell (me) about yourself!\u201d Carrie wouldn\u2019t just break the ice, she\u2019d melt the whole damn glacier with how awkward it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, it was another chance at talking to them again; the coolest moms that Carrie had ever met. Shelby Sullivan, Dillon Duncan and Flo\u2014not Florence\u2014Folly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just something about them that Carrie felt like she needed in her life. They were magnetic and trendy\u2014three close friends with three daughters who were all involved with the school and did things like throw parties for the soccer team, all while looking incredible and seeming so confident. Carrie had been taken with them since the first time she\u2019d laid eyes on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that time hadn\u2019t ended up so well. But this time, hopefully, would go better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sullivans lived in an old plantation-style house\u2014the kind that Carrie would look at longingly in the ads knowing that she could have never afforded it even when she and her ex-husband were still together. The house had been painted a pastel, but not obnoxious, pink color that really made the white trim pop against the autumn-brown shutters. It was a little off the beaten path, but that had only made it that much more rewarding when she\u2019d found it\u2014the house seemed so much bigger when there were so few neighbors around. All the telltale signs of a southern party were there\u2014balloons on the mailbox, plenty of cars in the driveway, and teenagers in bathing suits chatting by the above-ground pool off the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Carrie actually said aloud, aghast, as she purposefully parked so as not to block anyone in, \u201cThis is\u2026 nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Summer\u2019s family\u2019s rich.\u201d Katie said in a nonplussed sort of way, reaching around to get her bag, \u201cHer dad does something, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stepped out of their 2001 Honda Accord\u2014careful not to hit the BMW parked next to them\u2014and followed the paved walkway up to the front porch. Katie had hardly made it up the steps when her mother had excitedly rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s Kitty!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo had come to the door, wine glass in hand\u2014she was the one whose daughter was in Art Club. Carrie had done some superb Facebook stalking on these ladies, not only in preparation for the party, but out of just a sheer fascination with them. The more she knew ahead of time about them, the less likely she was to get caught off-guard and say something stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s Ka\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, we\u2019re here!\u201d Carrie took a step inside, her daughter trudging behind, \u201cHere to, uh\u2026 here to party!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful\u2014Kitty, sweetheart, the girls are all out in the back if you want to put on your swimsuit.\u201d The blonde uncurled two fingers from the bulb and pointed deeper into the house, \u201cCarrie, sweetie, some of the moms are upstairs, do you want to say hi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn\u2019t have started up the stairs sooner, leaving her daughter to discover where \u201cthe back\u201d was all by herself. The butterflies in her stomach were practically rabid now, tying knots in her small intestine. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything in anticipation of the party\u2014didn\u2019t want to be to full just in case their host offered them something to eat. As the anxiety mixed with the hunger, she was beginning to regret that decision. It would have been even more embarrassing for her stomach to growl in the middle of this all-too-important second chance with the Cool Moms\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight through here.\u201d Flo opened the door, \u201cHey girls, Kitty\u2019s mom wanted to pop by and say hello!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other women had been in a sitting room\u2014a sort of needless room that just served space for a place to gossip. Three couches, a fireplace, and some kitschy Southern decoration. A Live, Laugh, Love vinyl was stuck to the east wall, while Eat, Drink, &amp; be Merry was on the wall behind them. The furniture was all antique, and the fragrance (not to mention the wall decals) made it look more like a dentist\u2019s waiting room than a place that someone actually lived. But the magnificence of its occupants more than made up for the more generic decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby\u2014the redheaded mom of the soccer team\u2019s co-captain\u2014had been lounging on the loveseat directly within Carrie\u2019s line of sight. When Carrie came through the door, she lazily extended her wine arm in a half-hearted toast. Her long red hair was down, rolling over her shoulders in perfectly done amber waves. She had on a gray flowy top that left her shoulders exposed and tight high-waisted jeans; her flats had been kicked off next to the loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon\u2014the taller brunette and the mother of head cheerleader D.W. Duncan\u2014had been sitting on the seat across from Shelby, dressed in a flowery sundress. Her tanned arm had been thrown over the back of the lounge with one of her long legs kicked comfortably over the other. She looked back towards the door with a smile, took a sip, and then turned back towards her hostess. Apparently, they had come back in the middle of a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey darlin\u2019\u2014it\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d Dillon said with raised eyebrows as she took another sip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, always great seeing you.\u201d Shelby whispered a mean little laugh into her glass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways, uh\u2026 great to be seen!\u201d Carrie said brightly, \u201cKatie\u2019s, uh, really been looking forward to this party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kitty and my Summer are friends, of course she can come over any time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriends! Her daughter had friends! Her daughter and Shelby Sullivan\u2019s daughter were friends!  Her daughter was friends with this cool girl! Who had a cool mom! Who had a friend group of cool moms that she could insert herself into, and therefore have friends herself\u2014Cool friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re planning on wrapping things up around seven.\u201d Shelby said, carefully peeling herself back to a sitting position, then a stand, as she walked slowly over to the fashionable end table that served no other purpose than holding the small collection of alcohol that they\u2019d brought out for the event, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you get here a little late, but call ahead if it\u2019s going to be like nine or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Carrie\u2019s tone dropped a bit, \u201cI thought, uh\u2026 I thought I\u2019d just hang out with you guys.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was met with blank stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, moms hanging out with other moms, doing the whole\u2026\u201d Carrie gulped, \u201cDay drinking thing, apparently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo, Shelby, and Dillon all glanced at one another. The pit of Carrie\u2019s stomach fell out from the bottom, letting all the butterflies out. There was a minute of palpable silence between the four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dillon finally said with a raise of her glass and earning the quiet ire of her hostess \u201cThe pizza should be here in a minute anyway\u2014stay for lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can hang out with us for just a little while, hun.\u201d Shelby purred, handing Carrie her refilled wine glass, \u201cDillon, honey, would you mind going downstairs and bringing up the vodka? And try not to trip and fall down the stairs on your way back up. You might hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn\u2019t help but feel a little invasive. She didn\u2019t want to put them off, and she didn\u2019t want to seem needy. But at the same time, Eee it was happening! She was going to get to sit and do Mom stuff for the first time in what felt like forever. She was going to have friends and drink and bitch about their daughters and other moms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou come sit next to me, sweetie.\u201d Flo said with a pat of Carrie\u2019s shoulder, leading her towards the unoccupied loveseat directly across the fireplace, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the hard stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coming to this party having not eaten anything was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d skipped lunch in hopes of being seen as a good guest. Just in case someone offered her food, Carrie wouldn\u2019t have wanted to turn it down. What Shelby, Flo, and Dillon had offered her instead was copious amounts of alcohol. And pizza, eventually, but that hadn\u2019t come until about forty-five minutes and a glass and a half of merlot had passed. Carrie was already tipsy by the time one of the girls had brought up two boxes of pizza\u2014Cheese and Pepperoni\u2014for the already toasty moms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t afraid to eat just anything.\u201d Shelby said wistfully as she took a dainty bite of her slice of cheese pizza, \u201cCarrie, you\u2019re living the dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?\u201d Carrie managed to say through her third slice of pepperoni, \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just seem so\u2026 comfortable!\u201d Flo added helpfully, tipping her wine glass back and downing another swallow, \u201cI mean that\u2019s, what, your third slice of pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s stomach reknotted at the thought of these women judging her for eating so much. She almost wished that she could go back and take back having picked up that third slice, right then and there. She\u2019d just been so hungry, and she needed some carbs to soak up all this wine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d Carrie stammered, her face flush with red wine and embarrassment, \u201cI, um\u2026 I skipped breakfast this morning\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, hun, don\u2019t apologize.\u201d Shelby said with a bit of a slur after she\u2019d swallowed, \u201cOne of the upsides of not having a husband is that there\u2019s nobody around to tell you you\u2019ve been getting fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie felt her guts pour out onto the sofa. Was Shelby calling her fat? Sure, she wasn\u2019t exactly the skinniest mom on the bleachers at their daughters\u2019 soccer matches, but she wasn\u2019t fat by any means! The wine in her blood boiled as a heat began to rise behind her eyes at the insult\u2014something that everyone else seemed to notice. Sensing a potential commotion, and perhaps having dealt with such an issue in the past, both Dillon and Flo seemed to quietly swoop into recovery mode at their hostess\u2019s faux pas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Troy still pickin\u2019 on you about that, honey?\u201d Dillon drawled from the other sofa, having kicked her shoes off to stretch over the armrests, \u201cYou tell him right where to shove that kind of talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shelby and Dillon discussed their opinions of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s couth, Flo leaned over and quietly (as quietly as a buzzed Mom could) informed Carrie of the source of Shelby\u2019s sourness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t about you, honey, honest.\u201d The shorter woman purred with pizza and merlot on her breath, \u201cShelby\u2019s just a little upset about some comfort weight she\u2019s gone and put on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not comfort weight if I\u2019m not comfortable with it!\u201d Shelby griped from her sofa having overheard Flo\u2019s low talking as she poured herself another shot of vodka, \u201cM\u2019damn husband keeps buggin\u2019 me about hittin\u2019 the gym \u2018cause a fifteen\u2014no, <i>ten </i>lousy pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God your accent.\u201d Dillon giggled, \u201cIf Troy wants to pick on you about anything getting thicker, you should just get drunk around him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie reclined back into her spot on the couch as her temper cooled and a wave of relief washed over her, taking another bite of pizza and a gulp of wine with her. Her anger slowly melted at the small display that Shelby was giving, her face as red as her hair as she drawled on thickly about her husband with Dillon and Flo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that she was looking at her, Carrie did notice that Shelby was a little thicker than the other moms. Dillon was stick-thin and long, but even Flo, who was about half a foot shorter than Carrie, was a bit trimmer around the waist than the redheaded soccer mom. She still probably weighed a little less than Carrie, not that Carrie was a cow or anything, but she could understand how a couple of extra pounds could rile a girl up like that. Having to throw out her jeans on top of her husband hadn\u2019t exactly been the most pleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not that big, you know.\u201d Carrie offered helpfully, \u201cI mean, you\u2019re about my size, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that big. Pssh.\u201d Shelby slammed another shot, \u201cHoney, to my husband, any woman over one thirty is a cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Dillon hush, you\u2019re a giant.\u201d Shelby grumbled, \u201cHave some more pizza, Carrie honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was a little too drunk to say no to more pizza. Even if all this commotion had started over extra slices, Carrie had been enjoying herself. The other moms seemed to like her a little more, even if it was just the alcohol talking. Besides\u2014Shelby said it herself, she was living the dream. What\u2019s more, she hadn\u2019t once mentioned her cheating ex-husband or made things awkward. Even if these women kept getting her daughter\u2019s name wrong, and even if they were a little catty, Carrie felt like she\u2019d made some real progress here\u2014why not celebrate with a few extra slices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Carrie grunted a little leaning forward, taking her fourth slice from the box, \u201cI mean, since I\u2019m living the dream and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, four was pushing it a little. Her usual limit was three\u2014and that was only once in a while. Three pieces of pizza had left her stomach feeling full, pressing tight against her jeans. If she\u2019d been at home, she would have simply unbuttoned them, but not here. Not in front of these ladies who she had just gotten to like her. The last thing she wanted to do was be known as \u201cthe fat friend\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a fourth slice wouldn\u2019t kill anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither would a fifth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez\u2026\u201d Carrie burped into the back of her hand, \u201cI ate too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of a box of pizza had gone into Carrie before she realized just what she had done. The wine had left her head foggy and her inhibitions hazy. It wasn\u2019t until she was choking down the crust of her sixth piece, her belly rounded out beneath her shirt, that she started to feel sick. All the wine, all that pizza, all the grease\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all ate a little too much.\u201d Flo, who had stopped at two pieces, said with a dismissive swat of the hand, \u201cDon\u2019t feel too bad\u2014you said you skipped breakfast, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rookie mistake.\u201d Dillon\u2014a little more toasted than anyone else\u2014said with a little snort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d Carrie nodded sleepily, \u201cHey Shelby\u2014next time you want to show your husband a cow, tell him about your friend who managed to pack away six pieces of pizza, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby\u2014who had dried up a bit after having put back four slices of pizza\u2014shifted her gaze to the stuffed brunette sitting across from her. Next to Flo, leaned back in the couch, and helplessly tipsy and full. Eat Drink &amp; be Merry scrawled over her head in black vinyl cursive on the wall as she cradled her food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had eaten six pieces of pizza. Compared to her four, well that was just a plain lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that, hun.\u201d Shelby purred, fumbling with the bottle of mineral water she\u2019d kept nearby, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to tell him all about you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It would take more time, but Carrie had made a decent first step in butting in that fateful day of the Pool Party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and the other mothers had exchanged numbers after everyone had sobered up. The three of them had even added her on Facebook\u2014Carrie was now privy to all of the memes they stole, the posts they shared, and she could get more than just a glimpse of what appeared to be their idyllic lives through their daughters\u2019 various headshots, exterior shots of their home, and perfectly choreographed \u201chappy mistakes\u201d in the kitchen that always seemed to work out in their favor. Carrie was getting closer and closer to everything that she wanted, and this was a great first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore promisingly on their part, they invited her to just about every school event\u2014and boy did these women spend a lot of time together. Between the three of them, they seemed to have all the free time in the world. Shelby didn\u2019t work, freeing up her schedule to post memes from WifeMom&amp;WineLife on Facebook, while Flo worked part-time at an Art Gallery and Dillon made her own hours at a screen-printing shop. Carrie couldn\u2019t go to everything that they wanted her to go to, but she made sure to catch everything that happened after five \u2018o\u2019 clock where she could. Whether it was because they were taking pity on her because they knew she didn\u2019t know the town very well, or if it was because they genuinely liked her, Carrie couldn\u2019t tell. And honestly, she couldn\u2019t care less\u2014she just wished that she had more time to really integrate herself with her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t soccer games, cheer meets, or art club showings, most of their time was spent at Shelby\u2019s impressive plantation house. It was on one of these nights, when Shelby had invited Carrie and Katie over for dinner, that they got to meet Mr. Sullivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Kitty\u2019s mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Carrie had not gone into the meeting with high expectations. Her first impression of the man was a wine-stained recollection that he had some kind of problem with Shelby\u2019s weight. Having had more than her fair share of husband problems, she walked into the front door with an unconsciously less-than-enthusiastic point of view. The fact that her sweater didn\u2019t quite fit as loose as it used to, and her jeans were a little tight only made her that much more conscious of his issue with women keeping their waists trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a tall man with red hair, like his daughter and his wife, and he was a bit paunchy. His belly bunched against the white button-up tucked into his jeans, and he could have used a shave. But despite Carrie\u2019s lingering opinions of him as a chauvinist, she was a little taken. She could certainly see how he managed to attract a woman like Shelby Sullivan, that much was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie\u2019s mom, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and head on inside\u2014Summer\u2019s getting the table all set.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had gone inside, said hello to their respective counterparts, and took their seats at the table. An already uncorked bottle of red wine was there, with Shelby waiting for her friend glass in hand, as the two of them became said their hellos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd honestly, it was really nice\u2014something that Carrie had never thought she\u2019d have again. Seeing her daughter make friends with an older girl (Summer was such a nice girl!) and having wine over dinner\u2026 just that sort of normalcy that she hadn\u2019t realized she was missing since the divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Carrie was preoccupied getting to know her daughter\u2019s new friend, Shelby had excused herself deeper into the kitchen to begin serving dinner. She\u2019d finished her glass of wine, set it aside, and put both hands on the mashed potatoes she\u2019d slaved over making the \u201cright\u201d way. No butter, no salt, no cheese. Boring as all get out\u2014but that was just one of the ways she could keep Troy off nagging about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend\u2019s nice.\u201d Troy said as an aside, finishing his bottle of beer and tossing it into the trashcan by the door, \u201cReal handsome woman, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm.\u201d Shelby pursed her lips as she lifted the boring potatoes, her expression as flat and loveless as their sex life, \u201cEats like a cow though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she puts it in the right places, at least.\u201d Troy said loosely with a little chuckle, \u201cWouldn\u2019t kick her out of bed for eating biscuits.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d never taken it kindly when Troy complimented other women, like Dillon or Flo. Him getting drunk, leaning over (or coming home drunk, barging in at random) and brazenly mentioning that he wasn\u2019t asking for a threesome, but if he were asking for a threesome, it\u2019d be with her and her \u201cpretty friends\u201d had become less of a source of stress and more of a party favor. It still hurt, but she\u2019d become numb enough to it to find some humor in it. But for him to compliment Carrie, her recently-divorced, working-class friend who ate six slices of pizza the other day after a whole bottle of wine\u2014Carrie, who was the same size as her, over how pretty she was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that stung a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep it up hun, I\u2019ll be sure to tell her you think so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby said coolly and calmly as she handed him the potatoes, the ones he\u2019d asked her to make as bland and as boring as possible \u2018for her own good\u2019 and smiled venomously into his beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two can bond over what it\u2019s like to be divorced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had no idea that her friend was so unhappy in her marriage. You would have never known that the two of them detested each other so much with the way that Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan carried themselves at the dinner table! They were always pleasant and courteous, even to one another, in the face of company. And with two new faces\u2014not like Flo and Dillon, who were well aware of their marital turmoil\u2014they had all the reason to be on their best behavior and play the parts of perfect hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey accomplished the act by directing any and all focus on two things\u2014their daughter, and wine. But Shelby hadn\u2019t been blind to the looks that her husband had been giving her friend. Lucky for her, Carrie had been far too focused on keeping the conversation about her friend and her daughter. But Shelby was glad that her husband was watching\u2014she knew exactly what would happen if she kept filling Carrie up with wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d Shelby said, a bottle tipping over the brim of Carrie\u2019s glass, \u201cMore wine, hun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Carrie said, swimmy headed as she tucked back into her plate, \u201cI\u2019ve got to drive home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ll stay a little later!\u201d Shelby said dismissively, plopping another helping of potatoes onto her friend\u2019s plate, \u201cHere, these will help soak that right up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Carrie said again in a shallow breath, \u201cI\u2019m so full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Shelby gasped, \u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s recipe\u2014minus the butter, cheese, and, well, anything fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded hostess tucked into a frown and grabbed at the sides of the dish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose I could always thro\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie leaned forward a bit too much, too fast. She felt nauseous with all the food weighing on her stomach, and the wine sloshing in her belly. The last thing she wanted to do was to disappoint her new friend, especially when she had gone to all this trouble, and her family had been so kind as to invite the two of them over. And when she was making genuine progress in working her way into their inner circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, um\u2026\u201d Carrie said in the awkward silence that followed her outburst, \u201cI-I\u2019d love some more! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby smiled wickedly as she filled her plate with the potatoes\u2014as well as the green beans and even an extra piece of cornbread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby knew Carrie\u2019s type\u2014she\u2019d been dealing with them since high school, when she\u2019d lead the cheer team. Desperate, needy, looking to get with the \u201ccool\u201d friends\u2014it was so sad. She\u2019d decided that it couldn\u2019t hurt to have her around for just a little while, just to spice things up a bit. But she couldn\u2019t have her husband looking at her up and down like she was anything other than the recently divorced, working-class mother that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the quickest way to do that was to take advantage of Carrie\u2019s enthusiasm and show Troy what she meant when she said that Carrie \u201cate like a cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the dinner, Shelby had practically poured two bottles of wine down Carrie\u2019s throat. The two of them and Troy had stayed at the dinner table while Summer and Katie had gone upstairs\u2014Shelby making sure to give her husband a good look at the woman he\u2019d made the mistake of calling \u201chandsome\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Carrie was stuffed, her belly rounding out underneath her sweater. She tried to say no, but every time she got out the first syllable, Shelby looked so upset! And in her drunken haze, growing thicker and thicker as the night went on, it made more and more sense to just keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she\u2019d hate to be a bad guest to her new friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh God\u2026\u201d Carrie groaned as she unrolled her sweater, \u201cShelby, I\u2026 I really hate to be rude\u2026 but I think I\u2019m gonna pop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was like a beached whale, rolled up to the kitchen table. You could see the curve of her stomach as it pressed against her top, her legs spread in an unconscious attempt at giving her gut a little breathing room. She pushed herself against the wall, away from the table, and as far away from food as she could get. Her drunken, swimmy-headed pants filled the dining room as all conversation had come to a halt\u2014Shelby and Troy having nothing to say to one another except for the former\u2019s cock-browed sneer and the latter\u2019s revulsion at his hoggish dinner guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hun, I know.\u201d Shelby said sweetly, \u201cWe all made little piggies of ourselves tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting herself, desperate for release, Carrie fumbled with the button on her jeans in a way which she thought was deft and dubious. It was not. Shelby\u2019s smile widened and Troy\u2019s disgust deepened at the sight of her belly sinking that much lower, and the look of utter contentment on her face as she finally felt the pressure lighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of us a little more than others.\u201d Shelby winked, \u201cYou okay to drive home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Katie drive.\u201d Carrie slurred, \u201cHer mama\u2019s waaaay to toasty to get us home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piglet tried to rock herself to a standing position, grunting as she battled her fullness and her lack of balance. The poor thing had stuffed herself so full of food in hopes of not offending her new friend, and she\u2019d gone and drank so much that she hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d really overdone it until it was far too late. She may as well have been pinned to that old country dinner table now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to go upstairs and get her?\u201d Shelby purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could only nod and whimper in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Shelby said in a satisfied sort of way, \u201cTotal cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what y\u2019mean.\u201d Troy said as he kicked off the covers, \u201cThat woman can eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had adjourned themselves to their bedroom late that night. By the time they\u2019d practically rolled that woman out of their kitchen and into her car and their daughters had said goodbye, it was about ten \u2018o\u2019 clock. Shelby had made sure that her husband had had plenty of opportunity to see the woman that he\u2019d thought was so pretty and so handsome stuff herself like a Thanksgiving turkey\u2014plenty of time to see his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d barely even minded giving him a post-dinner party old-fashioned. Call it a reward, with the extra bottle of beer he\u2019d had after the goodbyes, for not saying anything mean-spirited about his wife. He\u2019d even given her a little peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost makes me look kinda skinny, huh?\u201d the redhead added sardonically from over the shoulder, a pointedly heated glare at the back of her husband\u2019s head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe keeps that up, she\u2019s gonna make every woman look skinny.\u201d Her husband non-answered, staring at his phone, \u201cShe looks good now, but if she keeps on eatin\u2019\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby paused, the sobering mind slowly whirring behind her bright green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, not to be mean or anything but\u2026\u201d she asked finally, idea-lets falling into place as she slowly wriggled her way underneath the covers, \u201cYou think that she\u2019s gonna get fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, hun, pretty damn big I\u2019d say if tonight was anything to go by.\u201d Troy said in a post-ejaculate exasperation, \u201cNext thing you know we\u2019re gonna have to roll that cow in through the front door every time you and your friends wanna get drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the night fell into place\u2014once Shelby started keeping Carrie stuffed\u2014Troy hadn\u2019t said a thing to her about her portions. She\u2019d managed to sneak in two extra biscuits and another plop of potatoes without her husband noticing. He\u2019d been so focused on how much their guest for the evening had been eating, he hadn\u2019t said anything mean or derogatory about her all night. Even during the hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this Carrie woman would serve a purpose after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d Shelby purred, clicking off the lamp on her bedside table, \u201cBut with the divorce, being a single mother and all\u2026 she needs all the help she can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour fat friend needs to find her a man that\u2019ll keep her in shape.\u201d Troy grunted, already nodding off, \u201cLike you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, of course dear.\u201d Shelby smiled venomously to herself, \u201cBut at least my fat friend makes me look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmen to that.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After that night, Carrie was sure that she had undone all the progress she\u2019d made with her cool new friends. Getting drunk and stuffing herself like a pig in front of Shelby and her husband had been mortifying\u2014even if she had just been trying to be a good guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, it only seemed to encourage nights over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the invitations that had come beforehand were during working hours. No matter how much she wanted to attach herself to her new friends, she couldn\u2019t exactly call out every time she received a Facebook invitation about something or other going on around town or at the school. What would she tell her boss? That three really cool, really together, really interesting women wanted her to go check out the new Spice Trade store that opened downtown? She would have been fired the first time she tried that mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after her first dinner over with the Sullivans, Carrie was so surprised\u2014touched, honestly\u2014that her friends started to frequent more events that all of them could go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry we didn\u2019t make you feel welcome darlin\u2019!\u201d Dillon poured Carrie\u2019s Lush Lagoon neatly into her glass as the cicadas chirped off Dillon\u2019s deck, \u201cWe all got to talking and figured that it\u2019d be a real shame if we didn\u2019t start hanging out when we could all make it. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so thoughtful.\u201d Carrie said, lightheaded, \u201cAnd so, so sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not as sweet as this tea.\u201d Flo poured her friend a non-alcoholic glass, \u201cHere honey, have another biscuit while we wait on dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are the best.\u201d Carrie bit heartily into another piece of flaky, buttery bread, \u201cMmm and you\u2019re all such good cooks. I\u2019m so jealous. Poor Katie lives on cereal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on and their friendship deepened, Carrie suddenly found herself with most evenings booked. Where she would have normally spent her time after work at home, curled up on the couch and watching Netflix or talking to Katie (usually about Overwatch or how much she hated soccer), now the formerly unoccupied single mother\u2019s nights were filled with fruity cocktails, gossiping in sitting rooms, around kitchen tables, or in rocking chairs on porches, and all of the southern cooking that these women could offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept on Fridays\u2014Fridays were pizza nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending two out of five, then three out of five, to three out of five and one of the days of the weekend with her friends so quickly and so suddenly had come as a shock to the somewhat reclusive Carrie. Her divorce and loss of a social circle had almost made her forget how much fun she could have with other moms\u2014especially moms that were so rich and had all the stories that came with a rich, lavish lifestyle to tell. They were so welcoming and really made her feel like part of a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly noticed that she\u2019d started to put on a little weight\u2014at least, not until it was too late. Looking at herself in the mirror now, she realized why her friends had insisted on going clothes shopping. She was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you should do, Mom?\u201d Katie commented from her mother\u2019s bed, kicking a soccer ball up in the air just shy of the ceiling, \u201cYou know what you should do if you think you\u2019re too fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, I swear to God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should join the Soccer Team, mom.\u201d Katie barbed with equal parts good humor and ventilation of her genuine frustration, \u201cIt\u2019ll be for your own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make new friends, Mom.\u201d Her daughter raspberried, \u201cYou can\u2019t stay inside all day playing Overwatch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her daughter was having a little fun at her expense, Carrie knew that. But in all honesty, a little exercise (or a lot of exercise) would have done the poor woman a lot of good. She looked like a blimp\u2014thirty pounds in three months. How does that even happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waist had taken the brunt of the damage. She\u2019d gone from a little soft to downright chunky in such a short amount of time her wardrobe couldn\u2019t keep up. She muffin-topped over any pairs of jeans that fit (right side of her room) and her belly bulged right past the zippers of the ones that didn\u2019t, if she could work them up her legs (left side). In one case, she\u2019d actually ripped a pair just trying to wrestle them up her flabby thighs. How embarrassing was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her own fault; eating so much. She\u2019d gotten swept up in having friends, in all the drinking and the gossiping, that she\u2019d hardly noticed the eating. Much less what it had done to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side, Carrie winced in revulsion as her belly did the thing. It drooped, like a pouch. Her tits sagged a little lower, hung a little heavier, and sloped slightly to either side of her high belly. She just seemed to jiggle almost everywhere. Her thighs, her arms, her ass. God, she was big. And it was getting to be expensive\u2014all these new clothes weren\u2019t exactly in her single-parent budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to Goodwill.\u201d Carrie sighed, \u201cOr maybe the Salvation Army that just opened off Number 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Goodwill.\u201d Katie wiggled her fingers spookily, \u201cI won\u2019t tell your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, too far.\u201d Carrie corrected her daughter with a sharp, sudden point. One that rippled in her saggy belly, \u201cYou might be able to outrun me, but I\u2019ll still kick your little butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the hint of what almost looked like a double chin in the mirror was enough for Carrie to skip the takeout that came customary with her and her daughter\u2019s trips to Goodwill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time that she hung out with her friends, Carrie told herself that she would be good. She only really ate a lot when she was with them anyway. Having so much fun with Shelby, Flo and Dillon made it easy for her to indulge a little bit. Not to mention all the wine\u2014God she\u2019d been drinking a lot lately. The fact that she rarely had to pay for anything while they were around made it even more rational for her, in the heat of the moment, to take just about everything that was given to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise I\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d She\u2019d say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it, honey!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I mean it more!\u201d her friends would snip, \u201cNow you sit yourself down and enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Carrie would do it\u2014the last thing she wanted to do was find herself offending any of her new friends. But looking at herself in the mirror, side-belly and all, it was becoming obvious that something had to change. She\u2019d just found herself with a new group of friends\u2014and the last thing she wanted to do was be known as \u201cthe Fat Friend\u201d of that group.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The moms were far more concerned with their own topics of various conversation, getting the best shot in of Summer (and \u201cKitty\u201d, as something of an afterthought) and generally trying to have fun despite the rather dull game. The season was almost over and, rather than share in her daughter\u2019s joy at having been spared coming to these stupid bleachers and watching this stupid game for another year, Carrie found herself quietly terrified of having this\u2014her one \u201clink\u201d to the school, and therefore the strongest connection to her new friends\u2014taken away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite her vow to \u201cbe good\u201d, Carrie found herself about a foot deep into a feel-better chili dog splurge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hun, you really do like those dogs.\u201d Dillon laughed from behind her sunglasses, \u201cWant me to get you another one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026 no thank you.\u201d Carrie mumbled, chili dotting the corners of her mouth, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on\u2014you can\u2019t come to a soccer match and not support the school!\u201d Shelby crooned, picking out her clutch, \u201cFlo, honey, go buy us all a round of chili dogs. My pin number is 84422.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could only watch as the shortest of their quartet stood and climbed up the bleachers, heading towards the concession stand. She wanted to say no so badly, but Flo was out of earshot by the time she worked up the courage to make the word out. Even then, it\u2019s not like Dillon or Shelby seemed to hear her. Dillon was nose-deep into her social media while Shelby was rummaging through her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I know it\u2019s a little late on account of it being the end of the season and all\u2026\u201d Shelby said, pushing the bag behind her back, \u201cBut me and the girls chipped in and got you a little something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you did?\u201d Carrie swallowed, \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but we did!\u201d Dillon smiled, wrapping one long tanned arm around the shorter brunette, \u201cWe know it\u2019s been real hard on you, moving into town, getting to know everyone. Not having any friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurtful, but true. Shelby shot her friend a dirty look at the last addition to her rap sheet of Carrie\u2019s problems, but the poor woman couldn\u2019t argue. Other than her three friends and her daughter, Carrie didn\u2019t have much in the way of a social life. All the more reason that she kept letting little comments like that slide more and more as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we wanted to show y\u2019all that you\u2019re one of us.\u201d Shelby continued where her taller friend had left off, \u201cAnd we got you\u2026 this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhipping her arms out in front of her, Carrie was blinded by a flash of gold. In her hands, pinched between her perfectly manicured fingers, was a sports jersey that matched the uniforms of the soccer players down on the field below. And on the back was Number 5\u2014Wright printed in white collegiate letters across the nape and breadth of the shoulders. Aside from the number, it was just like the one they all wore to every game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Carrie gasped, taking it in her hands like the jersey was made of glass, \u201cYou guys\u2026 did this for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had it done in my shop.\u201d Dillon said with a smile, seeing her handiwork on display, \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that Kittyhawk gets to see her number up in the stands too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and try it on!\u201d Shelby said with a wicked smile, \u201cSee how it fits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wasted no time in downing what remained of her chili dog in order to free up her hands. Her cheeks bulging with pork and sauce, the plumping mom of one threw the jersey over her head. She was so excited, so touched by the sentiment, that she hardly noticed how hard it was to pull the damn thing over her head. Her chest caught it and distorted the 05 hard enough, but then it met her belly. Rolling it down like a condom over her fattened gut flesh, Carrie grunted at the effort it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh noooo\u2026\u201d Dillon winced, \u201cBless your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 it fits!\u201d Carrie lied, her smile wide and hopeful that it didn\u2019t look as bad as it felt, \u201cRight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 not really, hun.\u201d Shelby clicked her tongue, \u201cDillon must have ordered it a little too small\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie felt her heart drop. Here she was, sitting with the best friends that a single mother could ask for, and they\u2019d done something really nice for her, and she\u2019d gone and gotten too fat to wear it right. This was so embarrassing! Her belly was too big to wear the jersey that they had special ordered for her to support her daughter. God, this was the worst. A wakeup call if there ever had been one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this\u2014you wear it today, and I\u2019ll swap it out for a larger size tomorrow. First thing.\u201d Dillon said with a tender touch of Carrie\u2019s arm as it bulged from the hole, \u201cI\u2019ll have it to you by Thursday at the latest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh no, I don\u2019t want you to go to any more trouble.\u201d Carrie smiled, already working on uncurling the poor thing stuck beneath her belly, \u201cThis was really sweet. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll just wear it to sleep in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shush, hun, it\u2019s no trouble at all.\u201d Shelby said with a sip of her Pepsi, \u201cCan we at least get a picture? Dillon, honey, take our picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Shelby\u2019s phone with a devious little grin, the tall brunette mother let Shelby lean in close to Carrie. Their waists side by side, decent angle, downward shot. Compared to Shelby, Carrie looked like a total cow\u2014her hips and thighs were wide, and her belly was round. With the tightness of her shirt, you could even see where her tummy rolled up to the waistband of her jeans! Oh, Shelby would like this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDillon, you want one?\u201d Shelby asked, \u201cCarrie, take a picture with Dillon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Dillon, Carrie looked so short and chubby. Being so tall, even a little lanky, Dillon would make anyone look a bit round. What with her pronounced and prominent features. But Carrie looked like a hobbit among men next to her\u2014as in, particularly short and plump by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, did y\u2019all give her the thing? We hope you like it sweetie!\u201d Flo crooned, coming back and dispensing the chili dogs to her friends, \u201cHere, lemme get a photo too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though Flo\u2019s round pixie features helped set her apart from the domestic Shelby and the Roman Dillon, even she looked picturesque next to poor Carrie. The woman was practically busting out of her jeans. The addition of the chili dog, a playful shot of both of them opening wide for their first bite, did little to stunt the image of Carrie being a woman somewhat obsessed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow one with us all together!\u201d Shelby smirked, handing the phone to another bored (but decidedly less cool) mother in the stands, \u201cSay cheese!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew what they were doing, the three of them. And putting all of them together, in one photo like that, it was hard to argue with the results. Despite the fact that they were all in their late thirties, getting older, their metabolisms slower. Despite the fact that they might have put on some comfort weight, and despite the unflattering fit of the jerseys\u2026 there was no denying that Carrie made the three of them look thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery group has a fat friend\u2014one that makes everyone look better by comparison, even accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby, Flo, and Dillon had managed to find theirs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were the cool moms that everyone wanted to be and/or lay. The kinds of women that other women\u2019s husbands fantasized about in private. Public faces in their daughters\u2019 school, at every event and the top of the list in every who\u2019s-who of high school parents. While Shelby had the added benefit of a particularly insensitive and chauvinistic husband, the allure of having someone around to distract the at-a-glance from Flo and Dillon\u2019s less-than-ideal features\u2014slight crow\u2019s feet with matching laugh lines and a nose that sat a bit too long and wide on her face respectively\u2014wouldn\u2019t have been entirely wasted on them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an added benefit, it was simply something to do. A little game that the three of them could play. Something else that they could talk about amongst themselves and only amongst themselves. It was like another addition to the private world that they\u2019d created for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie, honey, do you want some more pizza?\u201d one of them would ask on Friday nights<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Carrie would belch into her fist, \u201cI\u2019m trying to lose weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Carrie, we should probably call it a night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, no, I\u2019m not ready to go!\u201d Carrie would always get squirrely, \u201cI\u2019ll, um\u2026 I will have another slice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes they would get together just the three of them, their power trio, and discuss the progress of their little project. Never in so many words, mind you. Just about how much Carrie was letting herself go, or how much she would eat at their previous meeting. How she\u2019d put on some \u201cwinter weight\u201d to coincide with the holidays, or some mean-spirited jabs about their friend\u2019s increasingly ill-fitting sweaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had become an odd little hobby for her friends had become a waistline nightmare for Carrie, who was at odds with herself for letting go too fast and too far\u2014having spent most of the holidays getting stuffed like a tick by her friends and relatives, poor Carrie entered the new year weighing more than two hundred and twenty pounds of pure chub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all of her antipathy for getting fat, Carrie sure was good at it. A failing metabolism as she crested past thirty-six combined with a thankless desk job that kept her on her ass all day, and very little talent in the kitchen had left her with quite round. With her friends keeping her nice and full at every opportunity, poor Carrie had little choice but to keep growing and growing and growing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a cow. None of her clothes from last Winter fit her by a longshot. She couldn\u2019t even roll up her leggings from last year! Her legs were too meaty, and her thighs too doughy. Her sweaters and even her jackets couldn\u2019t meet across the chest\u2014let alone that big belly she\u2019d been growing. It had only expanded outwards in the past few months, rolling over her waist and forming two fleshy lovehandles that porked out at the sides; ugh, she was a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst part\u2014her poor face! It wasn\u2019t enough that she was getting fat, but Carrie looked like a totally different woman with all this chub in her cheeks. She had a double chin if she looked down or smiled or\u2026 well, at even the slightest provocation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had totally let herself go\u2014and that was why her New Year\u2019s Resolution was to finally drop some of this weight. Carrie had been thinking about joining a gym long before all this. She\u2019d driven past it every day since the move on her way to work, telling herself that one day she\u2019d go in and sign up. But as the pounds crept on and she became more enthused about hanging out with her friends than her personal fitness, the thought slowly worked its way further and further into the back of her mind. The New Year\u2019s special that they had going on, added with the fact that she now had officially porked up past two hundred pounds, had finally helped her pull into the parking lot and sign up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn\u2019t exactly go at this alone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gym membership?\u201d the pit of Shelby\u2019s stomach had dropped another inch as soon as she\u2019d heard her designated fat friend say those three dreadful words, \u201cWell\u2026 I mean\u2026 well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for you, hun.\u201d Dillon had been the one to raise her mimosa in a nonplussed sort of way \u201cNew year, new you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Carrie said with a miles-wide smile that made her rounded cheeks bunch, \u201cI figured it\u2019d be something we could all do together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTogether.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you girls get to do things during the day that I don\u2019t get to because of my job.\u201d Carrie gestured vaguely to the three of them, \u201cAnd I feel like now that soccer season is over, I don\u2019t get to see you guys a lot. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby winced, stress-popping a bonbon into her mouth and chasing it with a swig of champagne. The thought of losing her special project\u2014of Carrie having a comeback story, getting her figure back\u2014flashed before her eyes. All of the food and wine she\u2019d poured into this pig wouldn\u2019t be worth anything if she managed to sweat it off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, that\u2019s so cute.\u201d Flo tittered, already a little soused after a hard day at the Art Gallery, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry sweetie, I\u2019ll be your gym buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d Carrie cooed hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d Shelby groused in equal parts confusion and derision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I will.\u201d Flo preened, taking a chocolate for herself, \u201cOnce a week won\u2019t kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s hope crested a bit at that. Going once a week wasn\u2019t going to do much to work off all of the unsightly pounds and inches she\u2019d accrued in the past year. She\u2019d only asked her friends because she was self-conscious about going, what with being so big and all. Having someone else there was supposed to motivate her to keep going! But once a week\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what days\u2019 work best for you?\u201d Flo continued, another sip of wine and bonbon, \u201cI\u2019m free Tuesdays and Thursdays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pick Katie up from Soccer on Thursdays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTuesdays it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a week would have to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With Caramel Apple Spice and Salted Caramel Mochas in hand, Carrie and Flo spent two hours in their local department store wriggling in and out of tight spandex, lycra, and leggings\u2014a less than stellar time for Carrie, who had ballooned up so much that she had to shop in an entirely different section than her petite blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what she tried on, Carrie looked like a balloon. Her stomach swelled over every waistband, pushed into every zipper, and swelled underneath every top. It looked like she\u2019d stuffed a pillow down her shirt! Looking at herself in the changing room mirrors, all chubby and popping out of clothes she\u2019d picked the wrong size of\u2026 it was less motivating and more humiliating. Especially because Flo insisted on a fashion show with every outfit. While her tiny friend sat on the bench outside the plus-sized section\u2019s fitting rooms sipping coffee and munching on scones, Carrie was feeling about two inches tall and two miles wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn\u2019t bought anything that second week because Flo couldn\u2019t decide on what to wear. So, the second week had been spent ordering their workout clothes online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had driven over to Flo\u2019s impressive condo\u2014an old mill converted into trendy apartments that only the well-off could afford to even think about owning\u2014and the two of them spent hours getting in-depth looks at items from the view of Flo\u2019s smart TV. They had ordered some pizza, and made some progress, and actually managed to get to the checkout screen before they wound up getting distracted. Flo\u2019s daughter Myr\u2014Myr, not Myrtle\u2014came home from their studio with new pieces to exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, her belly sloshing with spirits and cheap greasy pizza, went waddling through the doorway after she\u2019d sobered up enough to drive home; Flo assuring her on the way out the door that she\u2019d saved all of the items they\u2019d looked at in her cart, and she\u2019d order them before she went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third week, Flo confessed that she hadn\u2019t ordered them\u2014but what was one more week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, by mid-February, Carrie\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolution finally began in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving put on almost twenty more pounds since Flo had agreed to be her Gym Buddy, Carrie took her first step through the doors of her local gym in a month. Tired from a long day of sitting on her butt, clacking away at keys, and suddenly very aware that she weighed almost two hundred and fifty pounds, Carrie was seriously second-guessing this whole \u201cexercise\u201d thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes would be on the big, fat, recently divorced, single mother with all of her ass crammed into a gigantic pair of stupid leggings that didn\u2019t even fit right. She\u2019d gone and put them on before coming and that had been such a mistake\u2014even on the car-ride over, they\u2019d shimmied down her blubbery cheeks as they\u2019d risen like rising dough over the back of the waistband. The only reason her belly wasn\u2019t showing is because she\u2019d thrown a big white t-shirt from Wal Mart over the somewhat less than conservative athletic top that Flo had ordered for her. She wasn\u2019t about to go at this with all of her belly hanging out like some kind of pole-dancing parade float\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready, hun?\u201d Flo asked, sipping on her Caramel Apple Spice from the neighboring Starbucks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the woman next to her, Flo looked like the picture-perfect health. Short, blonde, and dressed in bright colors\u2014all eyes would be on her, either out of appreciation, jealousy, or a desire to undress. Flo had made sure to order \u201cmatching\u201d outfits for the two of them; Carrie\u2019s a big, drab gray while hers was a cute and preppy chartreuse . The small amount of weight she\u2019d managed to put on over the holidays was nothing compared to Carrie\u2019s sheer corpulence. Her cute little butt filled out her bright green bottoms well\u2014milfy flesh bulging out of the legs with pure sex appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Carrie gulped, belly bouncing as she took her first brave steps towards the elliptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Flo said chipperly, readying her phone, \u201cI\u2019ll spot you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think you have to spot me.\u201d Carrie said with a nervous little laugh, \u201cThere\u2019s another machine open though, do you want to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, honey please, who is the expert here?\u201d Flo took another sip, swapping out the forward-facing camera after an obligatory gym selfie, and focusing the rear-facing camera on her friend\u2019s fat jiggly ass, \u201cNow let\u2019s make this quick\u2014thirty minutes, and then I\u2019ve got to go pick up Myr from the studio.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, already less than enthused with the abysmal beginnings of her career as a gym rat, wasn\u2019t exactly happy with the new limitation that Flo\u2019s flippancy had added to their workout. But at the same time, thirty minutes was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also, after more than two years of sabbatical from a gym, the longest time imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 pff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was a huffing, puffing wreck five minutes into the workout. Her muscles squealed at the exercise not even as far into the commercial break on the TVs that hung overhead. By the time they came back on, her lungs were on fire as her pace slowed down to a crawl on the machine. With every step her shirt would ride up a bit on her belly, making her awkwardly stop her pace and pick at the waistband of her ridiculously tight leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do it, honey!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo cheered, video focusing on Carrie\u2019s gelatinous booty wobbling with every step<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only worse when it rode up in the back\u2014Carrie flashed Flo with her striped pink panties more than once. Her nails\u2014manicured and sharpened last week at Flo\u2019s behest\u2014pierced the drum-tight fabric when she tried to hike it back up her ass. Two quarter-sized holes of pale butt blubber shone in the awkward fluorescent lighting of the gym, the rest of her wobbling pathetically on the elliptical as she struggled to keep a momentum going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got this, sweetie!\u201d Flo downed her sugary drink and took a bite of her granola bar from her gym bag, \u201cWitness the fitness!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHn\u2026hhffnnn\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes in, and Carrie was spent. But she hung out for another five minutes, an action that she came to regret. Her leg muscles\u2014atrophied by her desk job and sedentary habits\u2014were wobbly and weak as soon as they hit the ground. She was red-faced, her brown hair matted and slick with sweat. The poor thing looked like a freshly misted tomato from the neck-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, honey?\u201d Flo crooned after having shared the highlights of the last fifteen minutes to their private chat concerning Carrie, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna call it quits already are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Carrie puffed, wiping the slick sweat from her forehead with one thick arm, \u201cIt\u2019s too hard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo clicked her tongue sympathetically, patting Carrie on the moist shoulder. God this woman was a real heifer. She couldn\u2019t do fifteen minutes on the elliptical\u2014how mortifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright honey, first steps are always the hardest.\u201d Flo clucked vapidly, \u201cYou tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I did.\u201d Carrie puffed, her second wind wouldn\u2019t return for some time, \u201cAnd\u2026 and there\u2019s always next week, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.\u201d Flo crumpled up the wrapper to her granola bar and tossed it idly near the trash can, \u201cNext week you\u2019ll get the whole thirty in. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 phew\u2026 you\u2019re the best.\u201d Carrie wheezed, \u201cSorry to\u2026 drag you out here for\u2026 ugh\u2026 fifteen minutes of my fat ass on an elliptical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for nothin\u2019, honey. We\u2019re friends~\u201d Flo gave her fleshy friend a tight squeeze around the waist, palming a handful of backfat on her way down, \u201cNow, what do you say we do another Starbucks run, huh? I think you\u2019ve earned a treat after all that hard work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Carrie\u2019s brow furrowed, the thought of working off whatever she had only to add on twice that didn\u2019t sound very efficient\u2014even to her, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Flo. Don\u2019t you have to go pick up Myr?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she just texted me\u2014her daddy\u2019s gonna get her.\u201d Flo lied, knowing full and well Myr was at her boyfriend\u2019s house, \u201cOoh, here\u2019s an idea; we\u2019ll go get Starbucks, cool off for a little bit, and then we\u2019ll have a nice little cheat day and get something really nice for ourselves. Doesn\u2019t that sound fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeahhh\u2026\u201d Carrie puffed, grunting as she bent over to grab her gym bag, \u201cI mean, we\u2019re gonna come back next week, right? What\u2019s the harm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, honey.\u201d Flo opened the door for her friend to lumber through, \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shouldn\u2019t she be helping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat poor girl\u2019s much better at eatin\u2019 cookies than she is at baking them.\u201d Dillon grunted a bit as she struggled with the surprisingly pretty pink apron, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve worked too hard slimmin\u2019 her down just so she could fall off the wagon and go back to bein\u2019 Double Wide Duncan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Carrie nervously chewed on a chocolate peanut butter cookie, \u201cI mean, I know I\u2019ve started going to the gym and everything buuut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I figured I\u2019d ask for your help\u2014give y\u2019all a little cheat day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026but Flo\u2019s not here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, darlin\u2019, if you don\u2019t want to help me that\u2019s fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon huffed in a practiced, portioned sort of way. She\u2019d been thinking up this little scheme for about as long as Flo had been cooking up hers. D.W. had gone and signed up for the Bake Club, and there really was a drive going on at school. But the fact of the matter was that this was just another excuse to have a nice night in with some sweets. A little treat for Dillon\u2014who hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy herself thanks to her daughter\u2019s rigorous diet keeping the house more or less free of anything fun to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a week for a month, maybe two, wasn\u2019t going to kill anyone. What\u2019s more, it was entirely guilt free. With Carrie around to soak up the brunt of all that sugar and cream, Dillon basically had a free pass to live a little with no regrets! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, D.W. could always have the runoff for her Bake Club, whatever Dillon and Carrie couldn\u2019t finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no!\u201d Carrie panicked, taking Dillon\u2019s bait like she knew that she would, \u201cI\u2019m just, uh\u2026 sorry she\u2019s gonna miss out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grimaced at about ten thousand calories of desserts on the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks so good!\u201d Carrie\u2019s smile was pained as she thought of all the trips to the gym this was going to take to burn off, \u201cYaay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell y\u2019all how much I appreciate this.\u201d Dillon felt her chest flutter in excitement as she pulled another pie out of the fridge, \u201cIt means so much to me to have this chance\u2026 to, um, help my daughter.\u201d Dillon cut two (big, big) slices and placed them on surprisingly dainty-looking plates, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, and everything\u2019s gotta be perfect\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that sitting on her butt all day at her job wasn\u2019t exactly cohesive to a healthy lifestyle, she\u2019d been going to the gym for almost a month now and had seen no results. Thirty minutes (more or less) a week wasn\u2019t a lot, but certainly she should have seen some results by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she crested past two-fifty and eeked her way up to two-sixty, she had even roped her friends in on helping her slim down. At her behest, Shelby had started buying \u201clo-cal\u201d wines to stock their little nights in, and she\u2019d done her best to cut out all of the butters and cheeses from her home cooked meals, replaced them with margarine. They\u2019d even switched to Diet Coke instead of sweet tea at mealtimes. Everyone had been so helpful in trying to trim Carrie back down to a manageable size, but the poor thing just kept getting fatter and fatter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s better for you to snack on these than nothing at all.\u201d Dillon had said, handing her friend what she had claimed to be off-brand (actually repackaged) double-stuf\u2019d Oreos, \u201cWe\u2019re going to snack\u2014I mean, it\u2019s only normal. But this way you don\u2019t have to starve yourself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure, she still had her cheat days. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to amputate the fun from their little get-togethers just because Carrie was afraid of turning into a parade float. So, they still had pizza on Fridays. Lots of it. And Flo had talked her into switching to soy milk instead of almond at their Starbucks runs, so it\u2019s not like her coffee even counted as a \u201ccheat\u201d anymore! It was probably healthier than whatever they had at the office, so getting it on her lunch breaks wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, I can\u2019t make it to the gym today. Myr needs her mama tonight.\u201d Flo\u2019s little orange message bubble said on Carrie\u2019s touchscreen, \u201cWe\u2019ll go extra hard next week though! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she didn\u2019t go to the gym every week, but Carrie couldn\u2019t go without her Gym Buddy. She tried it once and Flo pitched such a bitch about it. It had made her feel so bad, and Shelby and Dillon acted so weird around her for the next week after\u2026 she just wished that Flo would take going to the gym as she did her little \u201ccheats\u201d after their workout. Carrie had only finished a thirty-minute set exactly once before Spring rolled around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, all Carrie seemed to be doing was getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she had her friends to lean on when she needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBless your heart\u2014I always start to feel a little down on myself when I put on a little weight.\u201d Dillon clicked her tongue meanly as she helped herself to another piece of sweet cornbread, \u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re going through, darlin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the vintage lounge in Shelby\u2019s sitting room, Carrie looked every inch of the \u201cFat Mom\u201d that she felt. Her other friends could no longer sit beside her\u2014the carefully crafted balance of Shelby on the left, Dillon on the right, with Flo and Carrie in the center had shifted as Carrie continued to get bigger. Now, it was Dillon and Flo on the right, Shelby stuck on the left (she liked to lay out) and then big fat Carrie Cooleyfinger clogging up the couch right in front of the fireplace. Eat Drink &amp; be Merry scribbled over her head as the old piece of furniture whined at every one of her heavy shifting motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere honey, have a drink.\u201d Shelby said as she shuffled past the coffee table, serving platter in hand, \u201cYou sound like you\u2019ve had a hard day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting a bit as she sat up, Carrie grabbed at the stem of Shelby\u2019s low-calorie wine. She gulped it down like it was nothing and helped herself to a few of the grapes that sat on the vine for decoration. They sat heavy on the especially buttery (sorry, margarine-y\u2014\"it\u2019s healthier!\u201d) dinner and what had to have been at least half a dozen pieces of cornbread. God, when had she turned into such a stress eater? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just fighting your natural shape?\u201d Flo bit into a cupcake and took a glass of wine from the tray, \u201cMy husband\u2019s sister is a big girl too, and she just can\u2019t seem to lose any weight bless her heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big girl. Carrie was officially a big girl. God, this was humiliating. It was all she could do to not just down the whole wine cabinet right then and there. Every time she moved this stupid couch creaked. Creak, creak, creak, right under her big fat ass. She tried her best to sit perfectly still\u2014to scrunch herself up as small as she could get. To stay as quiet as possible and just get the night over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh, Carrie\u2019s in a mood.\u201d Shelby snorted into her drink, kicking her thick ivory legs up on the couch, \u201cNobody talk to Carrie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a mood.\u201d The biggest, roundest woman in the world snipped, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve never been a\u2026 a big girl before. No one in my family is\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, please, it\u2019s normal for some women to put on a little weight as they get older.\u201d Flo touched Carrie\u2019s big fat knee with one hand, \u201cSo you\u2019re a little fluffy, who cares? We for sure don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean look at Shelby.\u201d Dillon snorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore cake Dillon?\u201d Shelby hissed, pushing the platter of pastries (made by the school\u2019s bake club) towards her friend, \u201cPut your mouth to some use other than sucking off pool boys and general bitchery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Dillon purred, leaning forward to pluck a profiterole, \u201cMm, these are good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie should have some.\u201d Flo rocked herself up one and leaned over, one gooey treat between her forefinger and thumb, \u201cGo on, hun, they\u2019re delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had spent the better part of last year (and all of this year) making such a pig out of herself that her first instinct was to grab the doughy little snack that bulged between Flo\u2019s fingers. A little voice in the back of her head nagged at her constantly, bitching to her about her weight. With the whimpering couch beneath her acting as a backup singer, Carrie had a full chorus of concerns telling her that the last thing she needed was a profiterole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, her mouth moistened. She had had such a shitty day\u2014such a shitty week really, and getting wine drunk with her friends was the only solace that she\u2019d had lately. She was already so big, what was one more little, teeny cake going to do that she hadn\u2019t done to herself this whole past year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d Carrie panted, smacking her lips a little, \u201cHere, lemme just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had sat too far back in the couch. She had to scoot up to reach past her belly, and that meant dragging her especially ample ass across the old creaking couch. Struggling to reach forward, a fat girl grunt of exertion falling out of her gaping mouth, a final and definitive CRACK filled the sitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God.\u201d Carrie said a flat terror, \u201cGuys\u2026 what was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 think that was the couch.\u201d Dillon scrunched her face in concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat did not sound good.\u201d Shelby commented, refilling her glass of red wine, \u201cCarrie, honey, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just\u2026 let me\u2026\u201d Profiterole between her fingers, Carrie slowly, very slowly leaned back into place on the couch, \u201cLean in here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all at once, the old sofa came tumbling to the ground. The bottom fell out as the legs buckled at the joists. Carrie was sent tumbling down to the hardwood, screaming in confusion and surprise. Carrie had fallen through the bottom of the lounge, busted the support at the legs, and landed butt-down on the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my Lord.\u201d Shelby could barely contain herself\u2014a mean-spirited guffaw broke through the charade of friendship, watching the spectacle, \u201cCarrie, you broke the couch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s big green eyes began to water as the reality of the situation dawned on her. She\u2026 she was really fat. Couch-breakingly enormous. She knew that she\u2019d been putting on weight. She knew that she\u2019d been cutting corners and her diet wasn\u2019t the best. Sure, working out once a week for thirty-ish minutes wasn\u2019t going to turn her into a supermodel but she shouldn\u2019t\u2026 she couldn\u2019t\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this happening to her? Among everything else that was wrong in her life, with the divorce and the crappy job and the moving and the single parenting, why was she blowing up like a parade float on top of it all?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh honey.\u201d Flo clicked her tongue, in a passing moment of sympathy, \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. These\u2014these are old couches, right Shelby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnrt! Right.\u201d Shelby said through barely-restrained laughter, \u201cIt\u2019s the couches. They\u2019re\u2014ha!\u2014super old and\u2026 flimsy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d Carrie sniffled, a hot tear rolling down her chubby cheek \u201cI\u2026 I think I\u2019m gonna call it early tonight ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere darlin\u2019, lemme help you up.\u201d Dillon said with a hint of remorse face, struggling to straighten herself up, \u201cLemme just\u2026 just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a moment that didn\u2019t negate, but certainly helped ease the pain and embarrassment of what she had just gone through, a now-familiar sound pierced through the sitting room and cracked over Carrie\u2019s whimpering. Whether it was because she sat up too fast, maybe spread her legs too wide, or just a combination of age and added weight between the other couch\u2019s two occupants, another loud CRACK filled the room, and both Dillon and Flo found themselves on the floor with Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d Shelby smirked to herself in a satisfied sort of way as she watched her friends wriggle around on the floor, popping a double stuf\u2019d Oreo in her mouth, \u201cI told you Carrie\u2014flimsy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was what the therapist had said would fix their marriage the fastest. So, he\u2019d been doing his best to at least pretend to be interested in whatever his wife had to say. But it was more than a little difficult to care about what she was saying when he was no longer attracted to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the maid\u2014she was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should see her when she really gets going\u2014I\u2019ve seen her eat an entire pizza in just one sitting. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Shelby reached across the table for another potato wedge, \u201cHonestly, you had to have been there honey\u2014it was hilarious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid that they\u2019d hired after the holidays. It had been a present to his wife, so she could focus on herself. Troy had hoped that that had meant she was going to start going to the gym with her friends. The short one and the fat one. Then maybe she could have whipped herself back into shape. But as it stood now, that didn\u2019t seem to be happening any time soon. Not so long as she was content to lay around the house, ordering food and drinking wine. If anything, the maid had just made her lazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s how a Christmas present for Shelby became a Valentine\u2019s Day present for Troy. There wasn\u2019t an inch of fat on that woman\u2014at least, not where it didn\u2019t need to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and poor Dillon and Flo\u2014you know, I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but they\u2019re starting to get a little fat.\u201d Shelby\u2019s belly no longer bunched into rolls as she hunkered over her plate, preferring instead to spread out over her thighs, \u201cI mean, I know those couches were antiques, but they weren\u2019t that old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy had been scrolling through his newsfeed throughout most of the story\u2014he didn\u2019t share his wife\u2019s passion about formerly hot women fattening up. Certainly not when he had to sleep next to one of those hogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Maria, that was a woman. Firm, tight and toned\u2014she had a two-year-old and looked like she\u2019d never so much as heard the phrase \u2018baby weight\u2019. She made his wife look like the Michelin Man. With her pot belly rolling out, her gross fat arms wobbling, that disgusting double chin\u2026 honestly, he\u2019d have probably preferred it if his wife was the Michelin Man. At least then she\u2019d be able to talk about tires. Something other than that stupid school or her stupid hog friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr why she was justifying a humongous credit card bill to Wayfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you understand, right hun?\u201d Shelby turned up the charm, looking ahead and pressing her floppy tits together with her jiggly arms, \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot\u2014between the therapy and the maid and now this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I ever thank you for this?\u201d Shelby slurred confidently, arching her back and pressing her heavy chest (and the upper half of her gut) onto the dinner table, \u201cMaybe\u2026 a special thank you from that old French Maid outfit you used to like me in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy winced at the thought\u2014his chubbing member receding as the image of his chubbing wife replaced the tight, toned maid he\u2019d been screwing around with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about dinner instead.\u201d He said flatly, dismissively, as he kissed his drunk wife on the cheek, \u201cWhatever you want\u2014you know what I like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doooo\u2026\u201d the robust redhead purred, giving a clumsy wink, \u201cAnd I think tonight you\u2019ll get plenty of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy\u2019s lips tugged at both sides as his lips pursed.

At a very rapid pace, yes, but it wasn\u2019t a real threat. There were no corporeal consequences to her size, only emotional. She was fat, she felt like crap about it, but the worst thing that had come from it all was having to buy new clothes and some less-than-stellar workout routines at the gym. The emotional toll was heavy, yes, but it all paled in comparison to the realization that she was so heavy that she\u2019d gone and busted the couch. Even if Flo and Dillon had done the same not long after she had\u2014even if the couches were old\u2014it still took two skinnier women to do what one Big Fat Carrie could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d done her best to stay in a good humor about it, but the fact was that the bottom of Carrie\u2019s guts had fallen out along with that couch. She was a wreck about it\u2014and everyone could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom?\u201d Katie rapped politely on her mother\u2019s bedroom door, \u201cI\u2019m, um\u2026 I\u2019m headed out. You need anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Carrie grouched, a giant lump underneath the covers, \u201cJust lock up before you leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Katie shut the door to just a crack, \u201cLove you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Carrie\u2019s desire to go out and have fun with her friends had been replaced with nothing other than a desire to clog up the hole farthest away from society and die in it. Her nights, once spent with drinking and dinners and going out on the town, were quickly and quietly replaced with nights in on the couch. Or in bed. Almost always with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as much as she hated being big enough to bust furniture, the only thing that seemed to make her feel better was food. Lots of it. From every angle of the Takeout Food Pyramid. McDonalds, Bojangles, Hardee\u2019s, Taco Bell, Little Caesar\u2019s\u2026 anything and everything on the way home. She\u2019d squeeze herself into the car, roll up to the drive-thru window, and prattle off one course before grabbing another at yet another hut, house, or takeout option otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, this only served to hasten her weight gain. Carrie seemed to be good at that. Her girth only grew once she got even less exercise than what she\u2019d managed to stuff into her routine when she would hang out with her friends. And not having something to drink all the time only served to make her hungrier. In shying away from her friends out of shame, she was only making her problem that much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd believe it or not, Katie wasn\u2019t the only person who was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about Carrie.\u201d Flo said one Friday night over pizza, \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since I\u2019ve talked to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been a month since she crushed that couch.\u201d Dillon pursed, \u201cYou think she\u2019s okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Shelby rolled her eyes, \u201cMore pizza for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood had slowly become a staple in their little get-togethers. Every time they met, sat, or drank there was always something to nibble on. It was, at first, meant entirely for Carrie in hopes of leading her down the road into further Fat Friend territory. The woman was always snacking on something, and it was hard to remember a time when there wasn\u2019t something to eat and drink nearby whenever they came over to Shelby\u2019s. Even now, three weeks since the roly-poly brunette had set foot through the door, the habit was hard to break. Just as much food, one less mouth to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby laid out on the bigger, more modern looking chaise. It didn\u2019t go as well with the ambiance of the room, but it was a much more hip and angular style. White, dark blue, and lime green pleather all around the matching quartet of couches, each with a thin red stripe going along the back that wrapped along the armrests. They even had footrests built into the bottoms (a feature Shelby was most pleased with) and boasted a capacity weight of over one thousand pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby snickered at the thought of Carrie somehow managing to bust through one of these babies, her belly blubber bobbing in bemusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShelby, hun, aren\u2019t you even a little worried about her?\u201d Flo winced, dipping her breadstick in garlic butter, \u201cI mean\u2026 it\u2019s kinda our fault she got so big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe never made her eat nothin\u2019.\u201d Shelby sniffed derisively, \u201cThat heifer ballooned up all by her lonesome\u2014and cost me a perfectly good couch, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hostess took a celebratory swig of her mimosa and downed another profiterole. Ever since the Incident, she\u2019d been pleased as punch with herself\u2014watching \u201cColossal\u201d Carrie Cooleyfinger go tumbling down like Humpty Dumpty and landing ass-end on the hardwood floor had sent her self-esteem soaring. She had set a whole new standard for what Shelby considered \u201cfat\u201d and entered a class all her own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was why she\u2019d been eating so much more since then. Knowing that, even if she\u2019d put on a little comfort weight, she could never match Carrie in size. After all, she was her Fat Friend. What was an extra slice of pizza, a couple of cupcakes, some biscuits, or butter in the mashed potatoes going to mean when Carrie was standing next to her? Not a whole lot, that much was for sure. But as Shelby had slacked on her dietary regime (whatever existed in the first place) the adjustments she had made for her \u201cfat friend\u201d were more than felt by Flo and Dillon, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstantly coming over, being bombarded with food was bad enough. Keeping Carrie surrounded with high-calorie snacks and drinks and cookies and cakes and southern dinners had been enough to put a couple of pounds on anybody. But once Shelby\u2019s confidence started to soar, confident that she\u2019d never ever be as fat as the poor cow who broke the couch, it seemed like even they were eating non-stop. Coming over to Shelby\u2019s was becoming dangerous\u2014the woman served more food than drinks these days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just think we should invite her over.\u201d Dillon reaffirmed her stance, grunting as she leaned up to bring her elbows to her knees, \u201cI feel\u2026 kinda bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Flo frowned, popping a bonbon into her mouth, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible Gym Buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 fine.\u201d Shelby sputtered as she rocked herself to a seated position, \u201cIf it\u2019ll stop you two hens from clucking\u2026 hff\u2026 I\u2019ll invite her over this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not right now?\u201d Dillon cocked an eyebrow suspiciously at her redheaded friend, beached on her throne, \u201cIt\u2019s not even seven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Shelby clicked her tongue contemplatively, looking around, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough food for the four of us. I mean, we want to make her feel welcome, don\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been Katie who talked her mother into accepting the invitation to go hang out with the other moms. She\u2019d been doing her best to be a supportive daughter throughout the whole ordeal\u2014from the beginnings of the divorce to her mother\u2019s worrying weight gain and her sudden crash. Seeing her mom change so much, so soon, had really worried her. It was the least she could do to try and talk her into putting on something other than sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what you told me before you made me join the soccer team?\u201d Katie had put her hands on her hips, \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around all day, like a big couch potato?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, or I\u2019ll grow eyes.\u201d Carrie exhaled, her cheeks inflating even further as a jetstream of petulant air escaped her, \u201cDon\u2019t use my Mom Answers against me, you turd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, that was what brought Carrie Cooleyfinger to the front door of Shelby Sullivan\u2019s impressive plantation house for the first time in a month. All of the initial trepidation that she\u2019d felt that first time, the day of the Pool Party last year, had returned to her threefold. The last time she\u2019d seen these women, she\u2019d made a complete clown out of herself. It had been so embarrassing, and she was just so\u2026 so tired of being fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Katie was right\u2014she couldn\u2019t just sit around and eat her troubles away. The extra twenty pounds she\u2019d put on attested enough to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was huge. A great big ball of a woman. Her stomach hung over her crotch, sinking low as it divided into two distinct tiers of top and bottom. The top half was larger\u2014she looked like she was wearing a tire as a sports bra. Her arms rested neatly on a cushion of fat and hung at an angle, her pillowy chest rolling with the spherical shape she\u2019d accrued. Her neck and chin had more or less become one entity; she had a swaddling deposit of fat that creased into two chins to make up for the merger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulging out from underneath the hem of her biggest floral top, about an inch of belly blubber made itself shown in the form of a milky white smile of chub that shimmied as she hefted herself up the stairs. She\u2019d squeezed herself into an industrial pair of stretchy jeans that she hadn\u2019t outgrown yet but could no longer button over her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sugar!\u201d Flo wiggled her fingers playfully, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller blonde wrapped herself around Carrie\u2019s corpulence as best she could manage. This might have been the first time that Flo had hugged Carrie first. Her friend pressing herself against her was just about what Carrie needed at the moment. She wrapped her meaty arms around the chubby blonde woman and pressed her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Flo.\u201d Carrie said sweetly, \u201cI missed you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we missed you too, hun.\u201d Flo gave an appreciative peck on Carrie\u2019s chubby cheek, \u201cWe\u2019ve got everything ready in the sitting room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything ready\u201d had been something of an understatement, Carrie would find as she braved the climb up the stairs for the first time in a month. The walk had left her winded as usual, her flabby legs already aching with having to heave her heft up all those steps. But at the sight of what was waiting for her in the waiting room, she could hardly wait to brave a few more if it meant getting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her favorites\u2014all of the staples of their little get-togethers\u2014had been spread out about the room. Boxes of pizza, Krispy Kreme donuts, gallons of sweet tea, bottles of wine, a couple of biscuits from Bojangles. Her friends had really gone all out for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby had been laid out on her new chaise when Carrie came through the front door, two bites into a boberry biscuit. While she hadn\u2019t exactly been all warm and fuzzy about getting Carrie back in their good graces, she wasn\u2019t about to pass up the chance to play hostess, or to see how fat that cow had gotten on her own. Seeing her a good twenty pounds heavier only reassured Shelby that she hadn\u2019t done a thing wrong and assuaged her concerns about the extra inches of cuddle-fluff hiking up her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d Dillon greeted her standing, wrapping her long arms over Carrie\u2019s shoulders as she battled against her boulder-sized belly, \u201cWe were so worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were not.\u201d Carrie preened as she drank in the hug, \u201cYou were not worried about li\u2019l ol\u2019 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were!\u201d Shelby managed a smile as she rolled onto her feet, \u201cThe party just isn\u2019t the same without our Care Bear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her first glass from the hostess and waddling over to what was to be her couch for the evening (\u201cit\u2019s new, and they\u2019re so comfortable!\u201d) Carrie found herself feeling much more at home this time around. No creaking couches, no snarky comments\u2026 her friends seemed so happy to see her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of this food, just waiting for her to tuck into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was more than a little distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie, honey, we wanted to talk to you.\u201d Flo started, her fingers pressed together over a fat belly, \u201cWe\u2026 haven\u2019t exactly been the best friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed pretty upset about what happened with the, uh\u2026\u201d Dillon clicked her tongue soberly, \u201cThe couches. And we didn\u2019t really make more of an effort to reach out to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that your life is a little harder than ours\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the divorce and the single parenting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we just wanted to let you know that we care about you. And we\u2019re going to do our best to make you feel like you\u2019re part of our little group again.\u201d Flo chirped, her hands unfolding laterally, \u201cWhich is why we got to talking about something we could all do together, all the time, every week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter five \u2018o\u2019 clock, naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why we decided\u2026\u201d Flo did a dramatic little drumroll that reverberated in her chubby chest, \u201cDiet Buddies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, this had been a Come to Jesus moment behind the scenes. Flo and Dillon had basically had to talk Shelby into actually trying to lose weight instead of relying on Carrie to make her look thinner by comparison. They\u2019d wrestled with it all week, feeling miserable about how they\u2019d treated Carrie up until that fateful Couch Incident. And since they\u2019d all agreed that they\u2019d gotten a little pudgy lately, this seemed like the best solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey explained a version of that to Carrie, who sat in her seat taking it all in. They couldn\u2019t come clean about the whole \u201cFat Friend\u201d thing, but they could at least share that they\u2019d really come to like her. Nothing was said about intentionally bailing on the gym or making sure that there was always food to snack on, but \u201cI wasn\u2019t the best Gym Buddy\u201d and \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t make it easy for you to stick to a diet\u201d were close substitutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody wins! Carrie gets to have friends, Flo and Dillon didn\u2019t have to feel like shit, and everyone got to lose weight after one last hurrah before getting their bodies back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d Flo smiled hopefully, \u201cOne last pig-out before we start dieting for real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Carrie smiled, her cheeks dimpling twice over, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that to yourselves for me\u2014I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re worried about me, but\u2026 I\u2019m okay with who I am.\u201d Carrie smiled serenely, taking a piece of pizza from the box closest to her, \u201cI think, as long as I have friends like you guys to support me\u2026 I\u2019ll be okay no matter what size I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Shelby piqued an amber eyebrow, piping up for the first time during this stupid little love-fest, \u201cYou hear that, guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean\u2026\u201d Flo faltered, her speech having fallen flat, \u201cBut the last time we saw you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, but\u2026 maybe you\u2019re right! This is just my natural shape.\u201d Carrie pat her belly depreciatively, \u201cI\u2019m never gonna be a size two anymore. And y\u2019all look great, I don\u2019t know why you want to diet! But\u2026 I think I\u2019m done torturing myself over what I eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon and Flo looked at each other in confusion, and then at Shelby, who was smiling like the cat who ate the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell you what\u2014you promise to keep inviting me over and being my friend, and I promise to keep making y\u2019all look skinny by comparison.\u201d Carrie snorted, \u201cNow pass me the ranch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, really fat. And there was no going back now\u2014she was more than two hundred and seventy (seventy-five, ninety) pounds of pure chub. She was never going to get back her bikini body. Fat lot of good it was going to do to have her squeeze into a bathing suit. They might try to unbeach her and roll her back into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Dillon, we should get this.\u201d Carrie pulled her friend over to the bake club\u2019s stand at the school fair, \u201cBring it over for our little wine-o nights, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez, Carrie I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Dillon winced at the tightness of her jeans, \u201cThat looks like a whole lotta sugar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhole lotta sugar.\u201d Carrie snorted derisively, her low-tier second chin bunching at the neck, \u201cTake one look at my ass and tell me that I care about how much sugar is in that cake. Come on, it\u2019ll be so good\u2014and all proceeds go to the cheer squad! Come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so freeing, to give up like this. Flo had been right that night\u2014Carrie just felt like round was her natural shape. She was enjoying her little \u201cbreak\u201d from dieting. Eating whatever she wanted, guilt-free. To finally let go and stop torturing herself about her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know hun, that\u2019s a lot of sugar, Sugar.\u201d Flo grimaced at the Starbucks menu, a Venti S\u2019mores Frappuccino staring down at her from the signs overhead, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t finish it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo give it to me\u2014I love that crap.\u201d Carrie\u2019s mouth was watering at the thought of her second coffee run today, \u201cWhatever you don\u2019t finish, I\u2019ll suck down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess that\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Flo said after a long look at Carrie\u2019s already inflated figure, \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever talk of diets and exercise that had lingered in the first few days of their reunion with Carrie was swiftly swept under the rug as things fell back into a sort of routine. Shelby, Flo, and Dillon had grown far too used to having every opportunity to snack and pick and pluck from various delicious dishes at their easiest disposal. To go without now, after they\u2019d all grown so accustomed to being able to indulge so freely with their Fat Friend around, it was almost unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mere Troy, gimme some sugar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie loved watching Shelby\u2019s husband flinch at the thought of showing his wife\u2019s cow of a friend with anything but the door. That pig had been giving her dirty looks ever since she started getting fat, and it was so great to watch him get so uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, hun, don\u2019t be rude.\u201d Shelby chuckled, leaned against the archway, \u201cGive her a little kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby had been especially vindictive ever since she\u2019d caught her husband fooling around with her maid. Watching him gag at the thought of his lips touching Carrie\u2019s chubby chipmunk cheeks on a night where he was already forced to endure her hoggish company and appetite was almost too good to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was priceless, hun!\u201d Shelby took her friend by the back and rested one hand on Carrie\u2019s billowing belly as she showed her into the kitchen, \u201cHere, lemme break out the good stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all intents and purposes, Carrie had officially passed the point of no return. She was a fat girl now, through and through, and she was going to live like one. That meant eating what she wanted, when she wanted, and not feeling a pound of shame for doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next time he wants to call you fat, just tell him to look me up on Facebook.\u201d Carrie slurred later that night, patting her belly derisively, \u201cIf you\u2019re a cow, I\u2019m some kind of whale!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Shelby loved every minute of it. Finally, she had someone to keep around that would willingly make her look good. This was what she needed all along\u2014someone who knew her place on the totem pole. First there was Shelby, then Dillon, then Flo\u2026 and then big fat Carrie Cooleyfinger, holding them all up with her gigantic ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gratefully\u2014happily, even\u2014accepted everything that was passed her way, whether it be food or beverage. She was just as ready to build the three of them up as she was to tear herself down. She had accepted that she was fat, and she would very emphatically disagree with even the most half-hearted attempts at self-deprecating remarks about their weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, honey, you can afford another slice of pizza.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think anyone\u2019s going to notice five pounds if I\u2019m standing next to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exactly what Shelby had always needed in her life\u2014someone who could make her look good by comparison. Someone who could distract everybody from the little imperfections like a chubby waist or too-thick thighs. Someone who would provide any prying eyes with a real example of a woman who had \u201clet herself go\u201d looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a result of having such a bad influence around\u2014one of their own design, no less!\u2014the three southern moms found their whittled wills outmatched.  Predictably, Shelby, Dillon, and Flo began to grow and grow, and grow\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The climb up the stairs to Shelby\u2019s sitting room had become more and more treacherous the longer that this went on, and even the thinnest of their little bunch was beginning to see the futility in climbing up and down, up and down only to get more and more exhausted with what seemed to be each passing meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo soon came toddling up the steps after a fashion, completely out of breath. The poor thing was so short, and she was getting so chubby having Carrie around to enable all of her worst behaviors.

Everything just tasted so good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta\u2026 hff\u2026 reign that horse in\u2026\u201d Flo gasped, wiping the sweat from her brow, \u201cSomehow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like they didn\u2019t deserve it. After having spent the past year porking their friend up into a bonafide big girl, teaching her how to stuff herself silly and providing her every opportunity to break her diet until all that was left was a spoiled stomach and a desire to consume just about everything in sight, even the least guilty of them probably should have gotten off much worse than they did. Somehow, they\u2019d wound up with a supportive friend who helped build their confidence and whittle down their self-control until it seemed silly not to take an extra scoop of ice cream, or to stop by for burgers on the way to pick their daughters up from their various activities, or to sit and stuff themselves to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is.\u201d Shelby slurred, taking a nibble off of her mozzarella stick before dipping it knuckle-deep into some marinara sauce, \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to think we\u2019re anywhere close to fat as long as she\u2019s around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah until they put on some damn glasses!\u201d Dillon drawled, stomping her pillowy pillar of thigh on the hardwood floor, \u201cShelby I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been smoking but just because Carrie\u2019s a whole lotta woman doesn\u2019t mean you ain\u2019t any less of a handful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, having someone around who could directly act as a worse influence while also providing an example of just what a woman who had let herself go even further than she had agreed with Shelby very well. Now that Carrie was content with her lot in life\u2014being the DUFF to a bunch of bored southern housewives\u2014that meant that Shelby could let go herself. Carrie seemed to enjoy herself, why not her? Just so long as she made sure that she remained skinnier than her big fat friend, the rotund redhead saw no reason not to enjoy herself to her heart\u2019s content\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, as she laid on the fully outstretched chaise lounge, her chubby feet kicked high up in the air as her belly domed up beneath her sundress, Shelby looked the picturesque primadonna of Porky Housewives Monthly. The decanters and bottles having slowly been replaced with containers, boxes, and plates, Shelby couldn\u2019t have looked any more at home than a pig in a sty as she idly stroked her billowing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby was getting fat faster than the other two, that much was for certain. She leaned hard into Carrie\u2019s devil-may-care lifestyle, telling herself that it didn\u2019t matter how fat she got so long as she wasn\u2019t as fat as their designated calorie sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat still didn\u2019t mean she was any less of a cow herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould y\u2019all relax?\u201d Shelby corrected, grunting as she kicked the mechanism back into place, \u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna notice we\u2019ve gone and gotten a little chubby so long as we keep Carrie around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked again. No avail. Her atrophied muscles weren\u2019t nearly strong enough to push the kickstand back into place. The ocean of adipose propped atop her tree-trunk thighs rose and fell like a tide of creamy belly blubber as she struggled to get the recliner back in its upright position. The exertion had left her face as round as it was red\u2014pink cheeks shining in the fluorescent light. For as tired as Dillon and Flo were from climbing up the stairs, just getting herself to a sitting stance was enough to have Shelby in the same sorry state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShelby, hun, you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Flo puffed as she came belly-first into the room, her gait an awkward waddle on short legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just as bad as she is\u2014keepin\u2019 all this food around!\u201d Dillon interjected, her arms crossed under her sagging meaty tits, \u201cIf y\u2019all keep this up, you\u2019re gonna be the size of a house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Shelby snorted, huffing and puffing until she reached a standing position, \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to hear anything about this when Carrie comes over\u2014you know how that woman feels about diets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know how you feel about diets.\u201d Dillon snarked under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Shelby raised her amber eyebrows, turning her bulk back towards the offending party<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothin\u2019, not a thing\u2026\u201d Dillon sniffed as she lowered her bulk into a couch that she found herself occupying more and more space of each week, \u201cJust\u2026 makin\u2019 an observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell make it to yourself.\u201d Shelby burped into the back of her hand as she headed towards the doorway, \u201cGet it all out of your system so you can enjoy having someone around who\u2014oof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we can enjoy having someone around who\u2026\u201d Flo\u2019s fat face scrunched in confusion, \u201cOof?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 y\u2019all?\u201d Shelby\u2019s voice came from the outside of the hall, her big round ass still planted firmly in the doorway, \u201cI think, um\u2026 I think I\u2019m stuck.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Since she\u2019d joined sometime last year, she\u2019d slowly made her way up the ranks in her team\u2019s dynamics. From a purely defensive player, Katie had proved her mettle in the offensive ranges, with a powerful forward kick that had managed to score some goals over the course of last season. With her best friend Summer Sullivan as the acting captain (following the previous captain\u2019s graduation) Katie had been a shoo-in for co-captain. And while that meant less time for her to work on her Sombra skills for DPS purposes (and falling back into fucking Gold), she\u2019d more or less come to grips with the fact that being co-captain of a sports team in high school made her cool as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think that at the start of two seasons ago, Katie had been a chubby little couch potato. She never would have thought in a million years that she would have been one of her high school\u2019s most eligible bachelorettes\u2014guys were sending her unsolicited dick pics so often she stopped opening messages on Facebook. It was gross as hell but flattering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitty!\u201d Summer\u2019s voice ripped Katie away from toe-touches, \u201cMy mom\u2019s here! You wanna ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks!\u201d Katie called back, \u201cMy mom\u2019s gonna come pick me up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Mom brought Chic-fil-A!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be up in a sec!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs close as their mothers were, and as close as she was with Summer, it would have been stupid for her not to say hi to Mrs. Sullivan while she was at the field. She saw her practically every weekend. Either she was spending the night in their plantation house or she was dropping her daughter off in their rinky-dink little mill-house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides\u2014Summer\u2019s mom always brought the best after-practice snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKittyhawk~\u201d the older Sullivan cooed as Katie bounded into sight, \u201cYou\u2019re looking good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame, Mrs. S.\u201d Katie fibbed, \u201cSo\u2026 I hear that there was a certain controversial, not Tumblr-friendly collection of chicken sandwiches in the back of your car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand your humor, hun.\u201d Her friend\u2019s mother put her hands on her wide (wide wide) hips, \u201cDo you want a sandwich or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Sullivan grunted as she leaned over the car seat, reaching as far as her backfat would let her until she managed to grab one of the red and white bags of everyone\u2019s favorite southern chicken sandwich brand. Her white arms wobbled at the strain of having to exert herself, but finally she managed to grab the bag she\u2019d picked up for her daughter\u2019s best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, hun.\u201d Shelby puffed, her belly oozing over the seatbelt, \u201cLord knows you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had been particularly impressed with Katie\u2019s growth as a soccer player\u2014but honestly, Katie had been far more impressed with Summer\u2019s mom\u2019s growth. How much weight could a woman gain in two years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could remember when Mrs. S was a regular knockout\u2014some kind of trophy wife. But looking at her now, you would never have known it. She was a real whale, spilling over the car seat with a seatbelt extender and everything. It was an open secret that she and her husband were getting a divorce, but her own mother hadn\u2019t started getting fat until well after she and her dad split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Katie was judging or anything, but\u2026 damn Summer\u2019s mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay hi to your mama for me.\u201d The older redhead said with a friendly little wave, \u201cSummer, honey, get in the car\u2014I\u2019ve gotta get you to your dad\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-kay.\u201d Summer sighed, giving her friend a quick hug, \u201cBye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie waved the two women off from the parking lot for a moment before resuming her drills. As much as she hated this stupid game, it was a good enough way to keep in shape. For all the good it would do her, if the way her mom kept talking about \u201cnatural shapes\u201d and \u201cbody types\u201d. If you asked her mom, Katie was practically predestined to be a round little blobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while that round little blobby might have been more fun, it certainly wouldn\u2019t have gotten Hunter Stevenson\u2019s number and Carter Blake asking her out to Prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she\u2019d enjoy her time as a skinny little soccer star for as long as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitty-cat!\u201d she heard her mother\u2019s voice from clear across the parking lot, \u201cYou want a ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing!\u201d the co-captain said, kicking the ball towards her mother\u2019s minivan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes\u2014two years ago, she never would have thought that things would be the way that they are now\u2026</span></div></div>",

They were the talk of just about every event that they lumbered their way into. With both daughters leading the (steadily improving) soccer team, another in cheer, and the other in Art Club, there were plenty of events for them to thunder through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, hun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne side, y\u2019all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had never been so much motion between so few people. Watching them wade and waddle up the stands, sweating in the Autumn heat like a herd of heifers was like a car accident\u2014that much gold and white ought to have been a crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrammed into matching jerseys were the Mega Moms of Milton High\u2014as they\u2019d come to be known as within certain circles. All that jiggling gold on display, shimmering in the orangey brown sun, it would have been so much harder not to see them.  Yes, Frumpy Flo\u2014not Florence\u2014Folly, Dumpy Dillon Duncan, Super-Sized Shelby Sullivan, and Colossal Carrie Cooleyfinger had still been the talk of various parental social circles, but for very different reasons than they had been less than a graduating class ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them were huge\u2014easily the fattest mothers in the school district. Probably in the county. And it had happened so quickly too; all before the oldest of their kids even graduated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, a heifer shy of a total ton of milfy meat between them, the bleacher started to buckle underneath their overwhelming weight. Bellies brushed against the lip of cold steel as they hung towards the concrete flooring, rolling towards the ground as each queen-sized keister slowly lowered down to the metal with grumbling grunts of exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shortest and roundest of the bunch, Flo, had become famous for a faux pas at an Art Club showing where she\u2019d ripped her sundress. Ever since, she\u2019d stuck to supporting behind the scenes where her dignity was intact. Her pixie features buried underneath inches of chub, Flo was far more well known for her belly-heavy physique than she was for her work in leading her local gallery\u2019s nonprofits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon, the tallest and \u201cskinniest\u201d out of the four, had had it the roughest. Her daughter was the cheerleading captain and looking up at her meaty mama in the stands you never would have known it. The woman was shaped like a bowling pin with brown hair, her ass spreading wide over bleachers as she sweltered in the sun at this event or that. Under her volunteering and chaperoning, the Bake Club had never been more profitable\u2014or more delicious. With all her insulation, Dillon was undoubtedly the heaviest of the bunch, and if it weren\u2019t for her height, she might have looked it. But as it was, lowering herself to the far right of her other three fatty friends, she\u2019d have to be content being the skinny one out of the bunch for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby Sullivan certainly couldn\u2019t contend\u2014not with that saggy pear physique of hers. With how quickly she\u2019d blown up, no one really blamed her husband for the divorce. She managed to get a settlement almost as sizable as her ass\u2014one that had ensured that a simple desk job would be enough to afford a modicum of comfort even as she continued to swell out and out. Once upon a time one of the most sought-after mothers around, she\u2019d gone and let herself go big, wide, and hard. She couldn\u2019t walk fifty feet without stopping to catch her breath, lugging around more than a hundred and fifty pounds of ass behind her. Her hips catching at the sides of her jersey, a loud RIP sounded through the stands as she settled her acre of ass down on the bending bleachers beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoop.\u201d Carrie said huskily as she patted herself down, almost eager to take the credit for that one, \u201cMusta been me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie Cooleyfinger\u2014easily the fattest mother out of the bunch\u2014send her shape shimmying as she slowly sat down. The whole bench seemed to groan at what had to have been the final straw in a lifetime of abuse. The woman was huge\u2014a blob with brown hair. Her stomach sagged low to the ground and threatened to brush against the bald head of the dad unlucky enough to sit in front of her. She\u2019d blown up so much, so fast, she\u2019d practically become the talk of the town! Her fat face beset in a puddle of chins and cheeks, it was all she could do most days to keep herself upright and moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust have been.\u201d Shelby agreed as she pat her friend on the crest of her stomach, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to size you up soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoon enough.\u201d Carrie agreed with a huff, her fat face blotchy and red, \u201cHey Dillon, how many X\u2019s can you manage in that shop of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot enough to carry you through the season, I can tell you that much.\u201d The tall cheer mom\u2019s double chins bunch as she talked, belly wobbling as she wriggled into place, \u201cUnless you want me to just start printing on you instead of jerseys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019d get kicked out.\u201d Carrie chortled, grabbing a handful of her gut and giving it a good shake, \u201cNo one wants to see all this on display.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you give them much of a choice.\u201d Shelby smacked Carrie\u2019s gut from the top<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet \u2018em look.\u201d Carrie huffed, her immense legs spreading a wide berth to allow her gut to pour over, \u201cWho have I got to impress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes anyone want snacks?\u201d Flo asked helpfully, \u201cI\u2019m starting to get a little hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, snacks, yas.\u201d Dillon smacked her lips appreciatively, \u201cI could go for a chili dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake that two chili dogs.\u201d Shelby held up an arm as thick as most women\u2019s thighs, \u201cI skipped lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a light lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did not!\u201d Dillon leaned over to smack her friend\u2019s quivering fat thigh, \u201cI was there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie leaned back on the bleachers, her hands resting comfortably on her shelf of a stomach as it billowed out in front of her. As her doughy white physique eeked further and further out from underneath the tent-sized jersey that her friend had custom-ordered for her, she couldn\u2019t\u2019 help but think that a chili-dog sounded pretty good right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour chili dogs for me, please.\u201d Carrie flashed a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve got a figure to keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a reputation to maintain\u2014these women were going to give her a run as the Fat Friend of their social circle one way or the other!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An already uncorked bottle of red wine was there, with Shelby waiting for her friend glass in hand, as the two of them became said their hellos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Carrie was preoccupied getting to know her daughter\u2019s new friend, Shelby had excused herself deeper into the kitchen to begin serving dinner. She\u2019d finished her glass of wine, set it aside, and put both hands on the mashed potatoes she\u2019d slaved over making the \u201cright\u201d way. No butter, no salt, no cheese. Boring as all get out\u2014but that was just one of the ways she could keep Troy off nagging about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend\u2019s nice.\u201d Troy said as an aside, finishing his bottle of beer and tossing it into the trashcan by the door, \u201cReal handsome woman, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm.\u201d Shelby pursed her lips as she lifted the boring potatoes, her expression as flat and loveless as their sex life, \u201cEats like a cow though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe might eat like a cow, but at least she puts it in the right places.\u201d Troy said the words loosely with a little chuckle, \u201cNothin\u2019 compared to yer gal Flo though\u2014I wouldn\u2019t kick her out of bed for eatin\u2019 biscuits, that much is for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe synapses between Shelby\u2019s gray matter seemed to tickle at yet another mention of one of her oldest, and apparently prettiest friends. Troy had made plenty of comments in the past before about Flo Folly\u2014Artsy Mom of their little power trio\u2014but to bring her up when she wasn\u2019t even around? When she wasn\u2019t even part of the conversation? That rubbed her through the callus and right into the raw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow is that any way to talk about our guest\u2014that she\u2019s not as pretty as little ol\u2019 Flo?\u201d Shelby managed as fireworks flew behind her eyes, \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful you might hurt somebody\u2019s feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then don\u2019t tell her that I think Dillon\u2019s prettier\u2019n both of y\u2019all put together.\u201d Troy winked and held a finger over his lips, a little buzzed and especially loose lipped after one too many beers, \u201cIt\u2019ll make dinner conversation real awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry growl escaped the stoic Southern mom as her husband slunk into the next room to play nice with Carrie. How could he be such a pig? Talking about her friends that way when all he had to say about his own wife of almost eighteen years was that she was getting fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if he was so worried about his wife\u2019s waistline\u2014maybe she\u2019d give him a better perspective. Show him what some real cows looked like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and eat up, y\u2019all!\u201d Shelby said with a practiced friendliness and a subdued southern spite, worthy of any hostess on the Food Network, \u201cI made plenty\u2014no reason to be shy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than had the words left her lips that her guests of the evening started to dig in. And who could blame them? Shelby was easily the best cook out of the four of them, and she didn\u2019t break out the kitchenware near often enough for their liking. Nobody quite knew what the bug up her butt was, but she\u2019d gotten a real kick to play Hostess lately. She\u2019d been inviting the girls over just about every other day for dinner, making a spread fit for a queen (or four queens, in this case) and keeping everyone\u2019s glasses filled with sweet tea and marmalade wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you guys again for working around my schedule.\u201d Carrie addressed the group as she helped herself to a heap of green beans from the dish, \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s no problem at all, Carrie honey.\u201d Shelby pat her friend on the cheek with one long ivory hand, \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hear either of them girls over there complaining about comin\u2019 over to Shelby\u2019s for supper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deck of the Sullivan\u2019s plantation home was alive and well, even in the early Autumn darkness. The mason jar lights were lit, and the new patio table was fit to bust at the sizable spread of southern cooking Shelby\u2019d loaded up. Pot roast with mashed potatoes, green beans, and a macaroni pie recipe she\u2019d stolen from Pinterest. Still chilling in the fridge were two pies (lemon and key lime), while another basketful of biscuits cooled on the countertop in the kitchen\u2014the whole nine yards, as far as southern get-togethers went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s more, Shelby knew all of their favorites. She made plenty of them just about every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019all are gonna need a forklift to get me outta here.\u201d Dillon said with a little laugh as she helped herself to a mighty plop of pot roast, \u201cShelby\u2019s gonna need to take out part of the fence before she\u2019s done with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis macaroni pie is to die for, sugar~\u201d Flo crooned after her first bite, \u201cCarrie, honey, you want some of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I.\u201d Carrie said greedily, fumbling with the plate as the wine started to hit, \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything this good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded hostess could only smile to herself, besetting a certain terrible triumph in the dimpling of her cheeks. Moving their little get-togethers to the porch had been the best idea she\u2019d ever had. Instead of climbing up and down the stairs, keeping herself on her feet (or worse yet, her friends!), the kitchen was just a hop and a jump away. The living room was right there through the back door, too! So, when everyone was done, their bellies full of Shelby\u2019s rich southern cooking and sloshing with wine, they could just go lay out on the long couches until their heads cleared up enough to make the drive home. And while they were there, Shelby could always count on passing out cornbread to soak up the alcohol\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow ain\u2019t this so much better than that dumb ol\u2019 sitting room?\u201d Shelby goaded her friends, passing out biscuits in rotation, \u201cFresh air, lots of room to wiggle, and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat food.\u201d Dillon said again, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you ain\u2019t been cookin\u2019 for us like this the whole time, darlin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Shelby clicked her tongue as her smile spread across her face, \u201c\u2026Lots of time to make up for, then.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After all, they were friends, right? And good friends like them did everything together\u2014it just wasn\u2019t fair that Carrie couldn\u2019t come because she lived in a one-income household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant that just about every time they saw one another, it was dinnertime. And since Shelby was so keen on inviting everyone over, what had once been a myriad of events around town and at the school soon became just three or four blocks a week in everyone\u2019s schedule called \u201cSupper at Shelby\u2019s\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wouldn\u2019t be much meeting up outside of that time, either\u2014Shelby saw to it! Sure, she and Flo would go for a coffee now and then. Anything to get her out of that dull gallery. And maybe, if she was in the area, she\u2019d drop by Dillon\u2019s screen-printing shop with donuts. Her friend sure appreciated the opportunity to get out of her dinky little office. Even Carrie got in a lunch at least once a week! Somewhere quick though, since she barely got an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other time that Shelby didn\u2019t approve, she could always whip out the now tried-and-true excuse of \u201cWell, I was gonna get ready for dinner tonight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd slowly, Dillon and Flo got the message. Their days of running around the county or showing up at the school, checking out new shops or this and that in downtown were very slowly replaced with the humdrum life that they so desperately wanted to avoid\u2014exactly why they used to spend so much time away! Being stuck in their respective workspaces all day with nothing better to do was boring. And that only served to make Supper at Shelby\u2019s all the more important to them. It might have been a little dull but there was always so much to look forward to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking maybe we could go to that football game in Mauldin.\u201d Dillon grunted as she rolled her weight onto the armrest of the couch downstairs, her round belly nestled between her thick thighs, \u201cI know it\u2019s a long drive, but our boys deserve the support. They\u2019re real good this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, hun, that sounds like a lot.\u201d Shelby clicked, heading into the living room with a freshly cooled sheet of cookies, \u201cAnd besides, Carrie\u2019d probably have to work the next day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I mean, I could ask of\u2014\u201d Carrie\u2019s intrusion was cut short by a cookie being popped past her lips, \u201cMmph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we could try that new restaurant that opened up?\u201d Flo added helpfully, setting her glass down and rubbing the taut dome of her belly appreciatively as it bubbled and churned, \u201cThat\u2019s something we could all do in one night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an idea!\u201d Shelby congratulated her porky blonde friend with a cookie, \u201cSee, that\u2019s something we can manage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Dillon shifted in her seat, the tightness of her (now buttonless) jeans wearing angry red lines on her supple shape, \u201cI\u2019m just bored y\u2019all. It just feels like we used to do a lot more, y\u2019know? Now it\u2019s just\u2026 I dunno, here and home games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby cut her eyes menacingly at the oblivious Dillon. She\u2019d been talking a bit too much about getting out and about for Shelby\u2019s taste. Ever since she\u2019d started this whole \u201cfatten up her friends\u201d thing, she hadn\u2019t heard hide nor hair about how hot they were from her husband\u2014she wasn\u2019t about to let them get adventurous and slip out of her fingers. Not when she had them right where she wanted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you need, hun?\u201d Shelby said sweetly, \u201cA spa day\u2014we\u2019ll all have one. Carrie can come too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Carrie huffing as she rolled into a sitting position, her turgid stomach bunching awkwardly, \u201cThis weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext weekend.\u201d Shelby corrected, \u201cY\u2019all are still coming over for drinks on Saturday, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course they were. Shelby\u2019s house was the place to be. And when they wobbled through the door, there would be plenty of cookies, cakes, and pies to whet their whistle with. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a job that made her spend so much time on her ass, you would have thought that they would have put the door closer to the goddamn parking lot. But instead, it only seemed like it got longer every week! Carrie knew that she was getting out of shape, but it was the days like this\u2014where the commute from her Honda Civic to the front door left her winded\u2014that she really told herself that she was getting too fat for her own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was the harm? Her friends were fat\u2014God that was such a mean thing to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, though! How could anyone expect a Southern single mother to keep her figure in a state where there were almost literally no gyms or sidewalks? It was a miracle she\u2019d kept ahold of her figure for this long\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, getting dressed for work was getting harder. Not just in finding clothes her size, but in actually dressing herself. Carrie hadn\u2019t seen her toes in months and bending over to pull up her slacks was becoming a herculean task\u2014even when she wasn\u2019t still buzzed or full from the night before. All of her nights over at Shelby\u2019s were taking their toll alright, but she was having so much with her new friends! Maybe she was getting a little round, but it wasn\u2019t like things were out of control yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d join a gym\u2014next month, after she\u2019d paid the bills, of course\u2014and maybe start skipping lunch at work. Surely that would help her shed the extra couple of\u2026 dozen pounds she\u2019d picked up this past year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, clear across town, the only huffing and puffing in the HVAC Art Gallery came from the locomotive exhibit upstairs. Flo Folly had spent all morning on her butt, propped up at the front desk with nothing better to do but scroll through Facebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays like this made her miss when she and her friends did stuff! It had been months since she\u2019d had to \u201crearrange\u201d her schedule last minute because Shelby found something fun for them to do. For months now, it felt like she\u2019d been staring at the art\u2014not even the art, the white walls behind it\u2014with nothing else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept eat, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo\u2019s fleshy folds bunched and rolled as she shifted awkwardly on her stool. Her ass was too big on either side to really sit comfortably on it anymore\u2014how had it ever, with how small this damn thing was? Picking at the waistband of her leggings from the back, Flo reduced the half-foot of whale tail rolling out the back to a mere inch or two. She made a little grumble, her round face creasing in consternation, as she failed yet again to sit easily on the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roly-poly blonde was getting awfully round these days\u2014she could see it just as plain as everyone else. With so little time spent on her feet, what had started as a milfy muffin top had exploded in what felt like overnight! Her belly hung over her nethers, wobbling all the while as her walk slowly became a waddle. With her thick, short legs and her wide hips, Flo toddled more than anything these days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she should be cutting back, but she felt like she almost never got to see her friends anymore unless it was Shelby playing hostess\u2014and everything just tasted sooo good\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a few more hours, and then I\u2019m done.\u201d Flo told herself aloud, ripping into the first of two Hardee\u2019s biscuits she\u2019d snagged for herself before work, \u201cAt least Shelby\u2019s will be fun tonight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then somewhere in between was Dillon Duncan, mulling over about how the best part about being the boss\u2014and running what was essentially an under-the-table business\u2014was that she could pretty much do what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that included wearing sweatpants to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had popped through her last pair of leggings last week\u2014big creamy butt cheeks for all of Shelby\u2019s neighbors to see when she made the fatal mistake of bending over. She\u2019d been getting so big lately that she barely had anything to wear\u2014jeans, slacks, leggings\u2026 she\u2019d have even taken jeggings. But instead, all she was left with were the biggest pair of sweatpants that Target had to offer. And in an unflattering insulated gray that only served to make her hips look that much wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s safe to say I won\u2019t be leaving my office today.\u201d She remarked to herself in a resigned sort of way, grunting as she hefted her stomach out from underneath the waistband of her pants, \u201cPerks of being the boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon pat her pliable flesh derisively\u2014her bombshell figure was long gone, and now so was the fashion. The irony of working in a screen-printing shop and not being able to find clothes that fit her (and fit her well) was not lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I won\u2019t have to hold back at Shelby\u2019s tonight.\u201d Dillon grunted to herself, shifting on a creaking chair as she turned to her computer, \u201cSince I\u2019m already wearing my Fat Pants.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shelby almost missed the days when she and her friends would galavant around town. The old sitting room had been empty for so long it\u2019d been dusty\u2014and that was just the last time Shelby had set foot through the door. If you would have told her she\u2019d be playing Southern Comfort around the time this whole thing started, she never would have believed it. But there was plenty of joy to be found in playing homemaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially when you had friends to make you look skinny by comparison. What was a little comfort weight when you had friends like hers rolling up to the dinner table almost every night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey\u2014come on inside, I\u2019ve got everything ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby wrapped her arms around Carrie Cooleyfinger as best she could manage\u2014the woman was getting so big around the belly that she just sort of bumped into her. She couldn\u2019t make her arms meet around unless she hugged that cow around the shoulder anymore, and even that was getting hard with her fat arms and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d come up to Shelby red-faced, winded from the slight incline in the Sullivan\u2019s yard that ran up the driveway and to the porch. Her puddle cheeks red and blotchy, Carrie sputtered out a response before heading inside. For such a hard-working woman, Carrie was so eager to kick her feet up and relax in the lap of luxury that only her rich friends could provide. The poor thing never saw it coming\u2014Shelby might have felt a little bad for her being blind sighted like this, if the circumstances had been different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with things as they were, Carrie was plenty happy to keep coming back\u2014she\u2019d never do anything to upset her friends. Least not the hand that fed her. And that meant Shelby was more than happy to keep on feeding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Carrie had come, Flo\u2019s vintage Volkswagen puttered up the side of the road\u2014a four-seater that couldn\u2019t hold anything more than Flo and her daughter as she continued to puff up and up and up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sugar\u2026\u201d she gasped, wiping the sweat from underneath her bright blonde bangs, \u201cGood to see you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, honey.\u201d Shelby cooed, watching the little ball of blubber waddle up the sidewalk. \u201cOh, you look so cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabby Flo gasped a half-hearted thank you, loathe to admit that she\u2019d had to special order the tent-sized dress that she\u2019d squeezed herself into. The flower pattern distorted along the severe curvature of her gut as it swung between her meaty legs, the only piece of pattern spared was that spread across her bust. Along her mile-wide hips, Flo\u2019s flowers were unrecognizable blobs of lycra spread thin along pasty white flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so bottom heavy, Flo barely even waddled. Shelby could hear her thighs chafing from the front porch\u2014how much longer until she was bigger around than she was tall? Watching her kick her legs out at an angle just to get a momentum going, her fat arms swinging stupidly at her side as her belly bobbed and weaved beneath that too-tight lycra dress, Shelby couldn\u2019t help but think that the day was coming sooner rather than later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 Hey\u2026 pff\u2026 Darlin\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon was the last to arrive\u2014her husband\u2019s truck failing to dip as low as her shiny BMW did. Such a tall girl would have had hardly any trouble getting in and out of that monster, if she didn\u2019t have the belly weighing her down. Dillon could hardly pick her knees up high enough to see what socks she had on, let alone heft her heifer self in and out of a Dodge without losing balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt if she was a shorter woman, Dillon would be having a much harder time getting around than she already was. As big as could be in every sense of the word, Dillon was hit the hardest by Shelby\u2019s scheming. Her plan to turn her friends into fatties so her husband wouldn\u2019t look their way meant that Dillon wasn\u2019t just Tall, she was also getting Big. Well, Bigger. And bigger and bigger and bigger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby hugged her friend tight, pressing herself into the hanging apron of Dillon\u2019s double-tiered gut. She came up to her friend\u2019s chest, but there was no way she could have gotten that close to the gal anymore. Not without a few lifestyle changes and a very expensive surgery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby couldn\u2019t help but watch as her friend\u2014a woman \u201ctwice as hot as she and Carrie put together\u201d (as her husband had put it once) now more than enough for three women all by her lonesome. Maybe even four!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty girls, let\u2019s dig in\u2014\u201d Shelby said once all of her pawns were at the table, \u201c\u2014I made plenty!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore pie, y\u2019all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy simply grunted in response, entirely too focused on his macaroni pie to have paid clear attention to what his wife had been rambling on about. Not long ago the mention of Dillon, Flo, and Carrie would have gotten his member throbbing. But now, what with how big they\u2019d all gotten, there wasn\u2019t any hope of that. Not like he could do much good by himself anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stay so skinny, Mom.\u201d Summer frowned, her round cheeks creasing as her double chin sank to touch her chest, \u201cI wish I got your metabolism instead of Dad\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush up, it\u2019s just puppy fat.\u201d Shelby crooned as she smacked her daughter\u2019s rippling freckled face playfully, \u201cNow eat up\u2014I made plenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sullivans were a big family. With the most important woman in their life so devoted to cooking seemingly twenty-four seven, it was no surprise! With nothing more than a desk job to keep him thin, Troy Sullivan\u2019s former football star figure began to bloat underneath the sheer onslaught of calories his wife kept at an arm\u2019s reach. Even their daughter\u2014former soccer co-captain\u2014was no match! Sluggish on the field as she was in the metabolism department, both Sullivans found themselves just as much at home at the dinner table as their frequent dinner guests\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.\u201d Troy grunted, his voice thick and heavy\u2014he was far too fat to get drunk from the two or three Bud\u2019s he\u2019d chugged\u2014\u201cAfter dinner, what\u2019s say we cuddle up on the couch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Shelby winked, buttering her husband a biscuit, \u201cIf you\u2019re good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her husband\u2019s dick throbbed somewhere underneath that belly of his, Shelby\u2019s heart soared in victory. Her husband was too fat to cheat. Her friends were so fat that they\u2019d make anyone look skinny next to them. Everyone was eating out of the palm of her hand\u2014literally at least part of the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was <i>good</i>. Life was <i>great</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it could be <i>better</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the past two weeks, Haley had slept like a baby and awoken contentedly in her fluffy pink comforter and her washed cotton sheets. She hadn't slept as well in the two years that she'd been away than she had in the two weeks since she'd moved back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley!\" Came a familiar cry from downstairs, \"Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe would never get tired of hearing those words. Living on her own had been hell. Exciting at times, but mostly hell. She hadn't eaten an honest, solid breakfast in years. Mostly because she was always waking up early to go to her crappy job. Most days, she wouldn't eat until noon. And it wasn't like she had the money to go out and eat all the time\u2014rent was expensive! <br>\r\nEven if she would have much rather slept her day away, Haley couldn't resist the siren song of a home-cooked meal.

She smacked her lips appreciatively and lumbered down the hallway as if in a trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley West had changed since she last lived at home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had left she was a high school graduate, eager to live life by her own rules. Stay out as late as she wanted, hang out with her friends, and just be what she perceived as an adult. But that kind of lifestyle was expensive, and couldn't be sustained for long! Especially not without a college degree. So, she partied her way through the first few months before her roommate flaked out on her. Then she had to get another job. Then her other roommate had bailed. Her boyfriend broke up with her, so there went his $100 contribution. Then she found some new roommates on Reddit, but they were creepy. Then another one, but they didn't get along with the creepy one so they moved out... honestly, it hadn't been an easy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was older, taller. A little taller, anyway. Her hair was its natural color again and she had started dressing like an adult. No more expensive band t-shirts, but she was still stylish. Usually. Not now, of course. Haley's cute little bob was curly and uncontrollable from all the deep snuggling she'd done into her pillow. Her eyes still had sleep in them, and she hadn't done her makeup yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, it wasn't like her mom cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is\u2014my little college student!\" Haley's mom practically cooed like a dove as her daughter dragged herself through the kitchen, \"How'd you sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good.\" Haley smacked her lips, \"What time is it\u2014eight, nine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like ten thirty.\" The older woman said with a pat of her precious daughter's cheek, \"I figured you needed to get your rest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I told you I was going to try to get a job today.\" Haley exhaled nasally, \"I asked you to wake me up super early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you I don't even want to hear the word \"job\" until you're sure you can handle the pressures of being in college.\" Mrs. West said with a stern, but gentle tone, \"Now sit. I made your favorites.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further hesitation, Haley sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her laid the same spread that had greeted her every morning since she had told her mother that she wanted to move back in. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, sausage, and biscuits straight from the tube. There used to be muffins, but there were only so many to a box. After two years of living off of ramen noodles, sandwiches, and dollar menu items, Haley wasn't exactly one to complain. Even after two weeks, she hadn't said so much as a word against the prodigal daughter treatment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her fork and starting to saw into her pancakes, Haley was happy to oblige her mother's newfound appreciation for having her around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some syrup?\" Her mom asked, touching the table slightly, \"Let me get you some syrup. You want the blueberry kind, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck yeah.\" Haley chuckled, \"Lay it on me, mama.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley watched the sticky blue sweetener flow from the bottle like water from a pitcher and onto her fluffy flapjacks. Her mom had started her off with a stack of two every morning ever since she had gotten back, but today's plate was a little taller than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's with the extra story on my pancake platter?\" Haley asked, picking up where she left off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you kept asking for seconds.\" Her mother placed the bottle of syrup back in the cabinet, \"I figured that it'd save time to just give you another pancake\u2014I'm a mother, I notice things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley bit into her first forkful of pancake\u2014three layers of fluffy flapjack coated in blue sticky goo. She gnashed and chewed her mouthful, before noticing something warm between each layer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you put butter between all my pancakes?\" Haley asked with a wry smile and half a mouth full of dough <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how you like them.\" Mrs. West winked, \"I figured you deserved a special treat since you start your first day of college tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that big a deal.\" The bobbed brunette rolled her eyes dismissively, \"I'm just going for a business degree. Tara's already got hers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she would have gotten hers faster if she was here instead of living on campus.\" Mrs. West sniffed, \"Living off ramen noodles and the cafeteria. I'm a mother, Haley. And all I want to do is take care of my girls\u2014as long as you live with me, I'll make sure you have everything you need to live a happy, comfortable life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, do you think you could slide me some more pancakes?\" Haley pointed over to the oven eye with her fork, \"I don't know what you did different this time, but these are great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra love.\" Mrs. West said matter-of-factly, \"Or... extra butter. I'm not sure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely the butter.\" Haley said, cheeks bulging. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haley had heard that going from high school to college was a rough transition. But as it turned out, having a two-year gap between one education to the next had made things even more rocky for her. In the span of two years, she'd forgotten most of the stuff that was covered in her Gen. Ed. courses in favor of things like how to calculate sales tax, how much her employee discount covered at her old job, and exactly how many times they could eat out on the dollar menu without going broke. Haley was spending most of her time at the USC Upstate campus relearning her introductory math skills, and realizing that the piddly papers she'd written in high school couldn't hold a candle to the ten-page monsters that her professors expected from her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she wasn't entirely alone in her endeavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're still good for our study sesh after Bio, right?\" A smaller shape bounded up towards her as she exited the Humanities building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney Caldwell was a familiar face, at least. They'd gone to school together back at Boiling Springs High (go Bulldogs!). She was in the grade below Haley, and they'd hung around the same group of friends. It was only by luck that Courtney had decided to take a year off herself, or she'd have been long done with the basic courses that Haley really needed her help with. She was shorter, with a fuller figure than Haley's. She had sandy brown hair in a boyish cut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Haley shifted her backpack, \"Wanna do Big Daddy's again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll pay this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been coming to Big Daddy's since they were old enough to drive. After-Church dinners and impromptu lunches after classes were all held at Inman's one and only diner; a mishmash of eighties, nineties, and early naughties' sci-fi and NASCAR memorabilia that belied the best chili cheeseburger that you could find in the tri-county area. Haley hadn't been in since she'd been home until Courtney suggested it a few weeks back, but after a heaping helping of bacon cheese fries she'd begun remembering why she'd loved this place... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there. Hold up. Two patties? On one burger?\" Courtney speared a stack of fries with her fork, \"Madness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really good.\" Haley took a wide-open bite from her burger. Chili oozed from beneath the bun and onto the wax paper it'd been served on, \"Hey, can I steal some fries?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just order your own.\" Courtney made a face behind her glasses, \"I think I can spare another five bucks if it keeps you from taking all the good ones. Again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally.\" Courtney held a hand up, \"Hey, can we get another order of bacon cheese fries here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like lately, all Haley had been doing was eating. The big breakfasts at home hadn't stopped, and she'd been coming into Big Daddy's every Monday Wednesday and Friday after classes. Mom was going cooking crazy now that Haley was back home, making all of her favorites for dinner almost every. it probably didn't help that she'd been grabbing lunch at the CLC every day either. That commuter money was good eatin', and it was one less meal she had to pay for... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time everything was said and done, Haley felt no better about the fit of her jeans than she did about her Math 102 course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for paying!\" Haley waved goodbye in the parking lot, trying to suck in her swollen stomach, \"I'll get you next time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got in her car, tapped on her phone until Courtney had left, and then leaned back in her seat. Finally relaxing, her belly surged forward into a round turgid lump that curved against her t-shirt. God, she was full. The drive home was almost unbearable\u2014five minutes down the road felt like twenty as she fought back the fullness of her own gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta start cutting back.\" Haley puffed her way up the walkway, \"Or I'm literally gonna explode.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her keys in the bowl by the door and tossing her half-done homework to the side, Haley collapsed on the living room couch. She laid one arm over her eyes to block out the sun as she rubbed her belly with her free hand. She felt like a garbage disposal\u2014maybe she'd been eating too much of that greasy diner food after all. Her belly was just so round and soft. It hadn't always been like that, had it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last clear thought before drifting off to sleep was that she needed to cut back... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley~!\" Came the voice of her mother, hours later, \"Dinner's almost ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her first clear thought upon waking up was wondering what was gonna be for dinner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, it was hard for Haley to go back to living under her mom's roof. She'd spent the past two years learning to fend for herself. Whether it was balancing her budget, saving up for new clothes, or even something as simple as what she was going to eat that night, Haley had learned how to do all of that for herself. When she was living with her roommates, she was the de facto adult. And now that she'd moved back in with her mom, she wasn't given much opportunity to flex those muscles anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you go from earning a living wage and paying for your own things right back to asking Mom for money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Haley, don't you worry about that.\" Mrs. West would always say, \"You moved back in with me so I'd take care of you, and there's no shame in asking your Mom for a little spending money while you're going back to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was hard. But Haley took to living by the purse straps of her mother quite well after a few weeks into the semester. She'd spent so long scrimping and saving, barely getting by on her own meager paycheck, she'd almost forgotten what it was like to not have to worry about money. It was like she was a teenager again! If she ever needed anything\u2014money, food, you name it\u2014all she had to do was ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I borrow a couple of bucks for some new jeans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Courtney and I are gonna go grab a bite, and it's my turn to pay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do you think you could grab me a couple Pop Tarts if you go by the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Haley took quite well to domesticated life. With no job and no other responsibilities besides keeping her grades up, the prodigal daughter fell into quite the sluggish lifestyle. Wake up, eat a big breakfast, go to classes, eat lunch, go to more classes, and swing by Big Daddy's with Courtney to study three times a week. Then she'd go home, take a nap, and eat dinner. It didn't take long before our formerly self-reliant protagonist to get more than a little lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Tuesday, almost halfway through her first semester back at college, and Haley West couldn't have been more of a sight. With her only class canceled for the day (something about a flu outbreak) Haley had been living like a queen. She'd rolled out of bed at ten, eaten her biggest breakfast yet, and bundled up on the couch. Parked in front of the TV, wrapped up in a cozy comforter and pajamas, with her brown hair all frizzed, Haley couldn't have looked more spoiled if she'd tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley, sweetheart?\" Mrs. West called from the kitchen, \"Since you're home, do you want me to make you some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  called back, \"No, I'm okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've got to eat, Hun.\" Her mother peeked her head around the archway, \"Besides, you're never home in time for lunch. You've got to be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, not really...\" Haley made a face, her cheeks catching against their newly acquired girth, \"I mean, you just made me breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could order a pizza?\" Mrs. West suggested with a zealous smile, \"So you don't feel like you're working your poor old mother to death. (Even though you're really not.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley thought long and hard about it\u2014she hadn't had a pizza since she'd moved out. She could barely afford dollar menu, let alone pizza. At least pizza that was any good. And where would Mom order from? There was a Pizza Hut down the road, and Dominos was all the way in Boiling Springs. Pizza Hut had that stuffed crust, and their sauce was so much better than Dominos. Plus, they could order pasta, those breadsticks that she liked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, and you would have never known that Haley had eaten a stack of pancakes, half a dozen eggs, and half a container of bacon by herself. Mrs. West had ordered her daughter a whole pie, and it would barely last the hour. Bundled up in her lazy girl fortress of blankets and propped up with all kinds of comfy pillows, Haley snacked her whole day away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her felt guilty acting like this. The part of her that had learned the hard way that she couldn't just lay around all day. That there was work to be done and bills to pay. But as long as her mother kept insisting, Haley was going to oblige. And that felt bad shriveled up smaller and smaller was perhaps the only thing about Haley West that wasn't growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look comfy.\" Her mother said, waking her daughter up from an afternoon nap, \"Aren't you going to meet with Courtney or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, it's Tuesday. I'll see her tomorrow.\" Haley smacked her lips sleepily, her double chin catching slightly, \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about half past four.\" Mrs. West brushed a clipped brown lock from being stuck on Haley's cheek, \"Why don't you head up to your room, and I'll bring you your dinner when it's done? Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Haley grunted sleepily, \"Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as much trouble as one might expect from someone who'd eaten an entire pizza pie and its accompanying breadsticks, Haley rocked herself to a hunched position on the couch before rolling to her feet. Still cloaked in her comforter, Haley shuffled off down the hallway and into her room, where she collapsed face-first into her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRAP!\" Haley belched as the contents of her stomach churned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with having one little lazy day?\" Haley thought to herself drearily as she drifted back to sleep, \"I deserve it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d been hunched over her phone, scrolling through Facebook when Courtney had dropped the bomb. The shock was enough to rip her out of her headspace and back into the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But I like coming here!\u201d Haley gasped, \u201cThese study sessions are the only thing that keeps me above water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, we can still study, just in a less\u2026\u201d Courtney winced, \u201c\u2026dangerous environment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDangerous?\u201d Haley made a face, \u201cWhat kind of danger could we possibly get into at a Diner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by the great gods of timing, their waitress for the evening emerged from the kitchen, turned corner, and approached the collegiate cuties with their dinner for the evening. Two burgers, double stacked, with so much chili that it spread against the sides of the wax paper. A refill of bacon cheese fries, and two baked potatoes. It wasn\u2019t often that their waitress\u2014Dina, or whatever her name was\u2014smiled at them, but Haley couldn\u2019t help but think that she looked much more pleasant than normal as she carried out the heaping helping of caloric content and hauled it all onto their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrder up!\u201d their black-clad waitress said with a smile as she started doling out food, \u201cWhich one of you had the extra cheese, extra chili\u2014 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, me!\u201d Haley raised her hand like a kid in a classroom as her burger was placed in front of her. A heavy slap against the table sounded at the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, this is what I\u2019m talking about. Haley, that\u2019s like, your third chili cheeseburger this week.\u201d Courtney cut her eyes at her gorging classmate, \u201cAll that can\u2019t be good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d their waitress sounded as she doled out Courtney\u2019s equally unhealthy helping, \u201cYour food\u2019s not good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Courtney blinked, \u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2014 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme talk to Petro about getting you some milkshakes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Danielle, don\u2019t\u2014 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late! The goth girl skulked off, back around the corner to speak with the manager. Courtney rolled her eyes and let her head fall into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Danielle?\u201d Haley asked, her lips smacking loudly as she masticated her burger into mush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised with how often we\u2019re in here, you still don\u2019t know our waitress\u2019s name. We went to high school together.\u201d Courtney sighed, \u201cSeriously Haley, I\u2019m starting to get burnt out on Big Daddy\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hey, that\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Haley slurped her sweet tea out of the Styrofoam cup, \u201cWe can always start hanging out at Waffle House or something. That\u2019s close to campus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to escape greasy spoons, Haleykins.\u201d Courtney said with a stab of her pile of fries, \u201cWaffle House is probably worse than here. At least here we won\u2019t get mugged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 we could always eat on campus?\u201d Haley searched her thoughts, \u201cOh! Or my Mom\u2019s house\u2014we\u2019d save money at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last time we studied at your mom\u2019s house, I popped the button off my jeans.\u201d Courtney grimaced, \u201cI\u2019m not going back there until I lose the twenty pounds I\u2019ve put on since school started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Haley wasn\u2019t listening. You never seem to realize how hooked you can get on a certain high throughout the day. And on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays\u2014barring a couple Tuesdays where she was hankering a grilled cheese and couldn\u2019t be bothered to go to class\u2014Haley had certainly gotten used to having fatty, greasy food in her system. While Courtney blah, blah, blah\u2019d her way through dinner about healthy choices, Haley was relishing in the flavors afforded to her by her staples. Chili. Cheese. And Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about your food, guys.\u201d Danielle reemerged from around the corner carrying two more white cups, \u201cThese are on the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was practically drooling\u2014she hadn\u2019t had Big Daddy\u2019s milkshakes since before she moved out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Courtney curled her nose, \u201cI\u2019m not feeling it tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take hers.\u201d Haley added greedily as she leaned across the table, her soft stomach cut against the edge, and palmed the side of Courtney\u2019s shake. \u201cThank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Their waitress smiled before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar be it from Courtney to bring up anyone\u2019s weight, but she was beginning to get worried about her friend. They\u2019d known each other for years, and Haley had always been a little slip of a girl. But ever since they\u2019d enrolled in college, she couldn\u2019t think of a time when Haley wasn\u2019t eating. On campus, here at Big Daddy\u2019s, the random takeout they\u2019d get when they hung out\u2026 and if her mother was anything to go by, Haley must live like a queen at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley, are you okay?\u201d Courtney asked after a long pause, \u201cYou\u2019ve been eating a lot lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCollege is stressful\u2014it\u2019s called a coping mechanism.\u201d Haley snorted as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet it\u2019s not.\u201d Courtney furrowed her brow slightly, \u201cBut it\u2019s gonna be a great big deal if you keep eating like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the lamest comeback I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Haley answered dismissively, \u201cYou\u2019re worrying over nothing, okay? I\u2019m totally in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley slurped on her straw as creamy, sugary shake tickled her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotal control.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was also Danielle from Hell, /Chan/ielle, Hot Topic Girl, and (honestly, her personal favorite) Dani Daughter of Darkness. But \"Doughy Dani\" was the worst thing that could have ever happened to her at Boiling Springs High School. It was short, it was catchy, and more importantly, she fit the part. Whether Danielle Gosset liked to admit it or not, she looked like a hot mess in high school. She was poor, she was chunky, and she was in that weird transition between Emo Kid and Scene, all while on the budget of an upper-lower-class teenager with no job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that much had changed since she'd graduated\u2014now she was just goth af. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking as a waitress at one of the greasiest spoons in Inman didn't give her a lot of opportunities (or money!) to afford a better life. She was still stuck in her Podunk home town living next to everyone who'd picked on her all throughout school. But what it did provide was excellent glimpses into just how hard everyone peaked in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many people were pregnant. Like, so many. Autumn Conners, Kelsey Brannon, and Amanda Dunham all came in holding their snot-nosed brats by their grubby little hands or in a stroller. All of them screamed and cried, none of them left a tip (figures!). Justin and Hannah broke up, and now he was working some shit job making stadium seats or whatever while she was apparently getting tossed round the neighborhood like a party favor. But the best one\u2014the best one\u2014had to be that that skinny little poser Haley West was getting fat. She came in like every other day with... god, her girlfriend or something, who cares. And every time she'd order burgers or cheese fries or milkshakes. Revenge was so sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still hear that little bitch back at BSHS, talking to all the boys. Ian Krueger, Ethan Haynes, Jesse Sacks... all of them had ditched her for some flat little wannabe punk rock girl. Like, Danielle was right there, and had way bigger titties than Haley ever had. And everyone was just so stuck up her ass. It was unbearable. Plus, her bitchy older sister with that big ass nose? Why did anyone think those women were hot? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Danielle got to watch by the week as Haley stuffed her face with greasy chili burgers and cheese fries, choking down so many calories that she was blowing up like a balloon. God, it was so great\u2014she'd never felt more satisfied in someone else's suffering! To think that she'd ever been jealous of her. At least her pudge went to all the right places\u2014not just to some great big gut!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking one of the stray fries from her customer's tray, her black lips cracking into a wicked smile, she almost couldn't wait to see that little slut again. Hopefully she'd be able to talk her into ordering seconds this time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coming home had its ups and downs for Haley. The ups were no rent, she didn\u2019t have to have a job, and just about everything that her little heart could want was taken care of. The downsides were that she had to go to college, her classes were stressful, and she didn\u2019t exactly have a lot of spending money. Her mom mostly took care of that kind of stuff, but still, she felt bad for asking. However, one of the unforeseen plus sides was the fact that she was given a great opportunity to reconnect with some old friends\u2014at least, the ones that hadn\u2019t gone on and done something with their lives yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had known Mackenzie since they were in grade school, and while they were never \u201cclose\u201d, they had been well enough acquainted that when Haley had met her at the beauty parlor it wasn\u2019t weird that either should mention that they get together and catch up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were around the same age, but it was apparent that their lives had taken drastically different turns. Whereas Haley had moved out, had roommates, and eventually came back home to take a swing at college, Mackenzie hadn\u2019t left their little home town for longer than a family vacation. She\u2019d already settled down, had a baby\u2026 when were her friends old enough to start having babies?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I don\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d Mackenzie speared the fluffy egg portion of her All-Star Breakfast platter, \u201cGo to college and actually finish, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had remembered Mackenzie as this toned, stringy Christian Athlete that had gone to the same Youth Group as her on Wednesday nights. Instead of sitting across from the fit sixteen-year-old athlete that she liked to remember, Haley was instead sitting across from a doughy mother of one who couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself from wolfing down pancakes. She never would have guessed that she\u2019d ever get fit, active Mackenzie Hollifield in a place like the Waffle House off of I-26, but wonders never ceased to amaze her. Then again, she\u2019d never been able to picture Mackenzie as anything other than a size 0, and that had clearly changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d Haley said with a little pride in her tone, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s only my first semester and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna get at least A\u2019s and B\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was honestly sort\u2019ve fading in and out of the conversation. It was pretty late, and she wasn\u2019t used to staying up this long past dinner. She had class in about twelve hours\u2014she needed to get home soon so she could get a full eight hours! That way she could wake up, get ready, and eat a big breakfast before her Bio exam tomorrow. Not that she wasn\u2019t exactly interested in catching up with good ol\u2019 Mack, it was just\u2026 well, past her bedtime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing she hadn\u2019t regretted about this meeting was the food. She and Courtney got Big Daddy\u2019s every other day or so, and she peppered her weeks with takeout here and there. Mom cooked for her at home too, but it had been so long since she\u2019d been to the Awful Waffle! She\u2019d ordered an All-Star Breakfast with extra bacon and toast, plus an extra pancake or two\u2014she\u2019d better not tell Courtney about eating so much after dinner; she\u2019d probably wet blanket all over the fact that she got to catch up with an old friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, no, the first semester\u2019s easy.\u201d Mackenzie said dismissively, the way she spoke made her double chin catch ever so slightly, which is something that Haley couldn\u2019t help but notice as it struck her as particularly odd, \u201cThe second semester, that\u2019s what got me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t\u2026 having a kid what got you?\u201d Haley joked as she took a sip of her milky coffee, \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t imagine. It must have been really hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took an equally big bite of her own late-night breakfast\u2014two biscuits covered in gravy and ham with a side of eggs. Haley hadn\u2019t thought much of her own, much bigger order. But to see skinny little Mackenzie Hollifield eating like this was so scandalous! It helped distract her from her own portion sizes\u2014practically double the size of the mother of one\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t have Tiffany until after I dropped out.\u201d Mackenzie said as if it were the plainest thing in the world, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t deal with it all, you know? I just wanted it to be over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can relate to that.\u201d Haley said. Bite bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally.\u201d Mackenzie snorted, \u201cAnd it all just gets harder from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Chomp chew, \u201cHow\u2026 how so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re in Gen Ed classes now, right?\u201d Mackenzie continued, unfettered, \u201cBy the second semester, you\u2019re going to be taking specialty classes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d gnash gnash, \u201c\u2026huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and they\u2019re super hard.\u201d The meaty mom laughed obliviously, \u201cI had like, super good grades, and I only just barely managed to pass any of my classes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Haley let her friend\u2019s words sink in, she felt the weight of her academic life fall heavily on her shoulders. How could it get harder? She was barely managing to keep her Life scholarship now! If she got low enough grades, she\u2019d lose her ticket in! And then she\u2019d have to start paying her way in, or take out loans! She was going to have to get a job, and\u2026 and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Hay?\u201d Mackenzie leaned in, \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah! Totally okay!\u201d Haley answered curtly, \u201cHey, do you think I could get another order of hash browns here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s cheeks swelled with potato, grease, and gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did she ever think that she could do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh... make 'em country...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a three-bedroom, two bath, and was one of the many additions during the degentrification of the Boiling Springs area. Courtney had never actually driven there, and picking it out from the many other cookie-cutter homes proved to be somewhat challenging. She stood there, in the doorway, rang the bell, and pulled the hem of her shirt down over her bulging belly. It must have rolled up on the drive over\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Courtney, are you looking for Haley?\u201d Mrs. West cooed as she stuck her head through the doorway, \u201cShe told me you might be coming by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her daughter, Mrs. West wasn\u2019t the tallest woman. She had brown hair, though it was a bit more faded than her Haley\u2019s, and held that same sense of benevolence about her. She was dressed very casually, in a loose Clemson sweatshirt and a pair of dark mom jeans. Her long brown hair was pulled up in a messy pony. Like Haley, she wore her weight well. She was a rather full-figured woman, but unlike Haley, she developed a full motherly set of breasts and wide birthing hips as opposed to her daughter\u2019s spoiled gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mrs. West!\u201d the bespectacled chubster said with an awkward smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got some homework for her from the past few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time Courtney had walked through the threshold of the West family home, she\u2019d left with a packed paunch and one less button on her pants. She\u2019d wisely worn sweats to this little outing, and definitely not because they were the only things in her closet that fit her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure, she\u2019s up in her room.\u201d Haley\u2019s mom stepped aside and allowed the curvaceous cutie room to get inside, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s told you, but she\u2019s not exactly feeling well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney could smell the kitchen from the living room, and she could tell by the myriad aromas and scents that Mrs. West wasn\u2019t taking her daughter laying down\u2026 laying down. She\u2019d obviously taken a step up with her treatment of her doughy daughter\u2014something that Courtney was admittedly a little concerned about. It had been a week since Courtney had last seen her friend, and she could only imagine the treatment that she\u2019d been getting since she\u2019d come down with the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer room is right up the hall, the last door on the right.\u201d Mrs. West said sweetly, \u201cMake sure you knock, just in case she\u2019s asleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall and to the right later, Courtney Caldwell tapped lightly on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama?\u201d Haley\u2019s voice came from inside, sounding no worse for wear, \u201cIs that the pancakes? Are my pancakes done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s Courtney.\u201d The plump brunette furrowed her brow, \u201cCan I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as Haley\u2019s tone corrected itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Come in\u2026\u201d she said weakly from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Courtney opened the door, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was amiss. Plates, cups, and silverware were piled high next to Haley\u2019s bed. Beneath the cocoon of her soft gray blanket, Courtney could see a mountainous gut rolling high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Courtney\u2026\u201d Haley managed in her most pathetic voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much.\u201d Her friend answered flatly, \u201cJust\u2026 wondering why you haven\u2019t been to class for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s bright blue eyes widened in what was surely an attempt to look even more pitiful. She coughed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sick.\u201d She whimpered, \u201cStomach bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Courtney folded her plush arms, \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve got your mom cooking you chocolate chip pancakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026are they ready?\u201d Haley arched her neck ever so slightly to look past her friend in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley!\u201d Courtney stomped her foot, \u201cYou\u2019re not sick at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d Haley whispered, disrobing her blanket and exposing a big round gut, full of food and sloshing with fat, \u201cKeep it down, Court! You don\u2019t want my mom to find out, do you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Haley!\u201d Courtney said in an intentionally loud tone, \u201cWould that mean she\u2019d stop feeding your fever and you\u2019d have to come back to school so you could take your finals?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHHH!\u201d Haley toddled to a standing position, \u201cAlright, alright, just\u2026 just keep it down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Haley explained her recent string of absences. It wasn\u2019t just her MWF classes that she had missed either, she\u2019d missed both of her TR classes! Haley told Courtney about meeting up with Mackenzie and her recently recapitalized fears of not being good enough for college. And then a side note about how her mother had really enjoyed having her home, so it made the guilt a bit more bearable to see her so happy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo lemme get this straight\u2014you decided that you were going to play hooky for a week so you could lay around and get waited on hand and foot by your mom?\u201d Courtney raised one of her thick brown eyebrows, \u201cHaley, come on. You could have seriously hurt your chances of passing all your classes\u2014what are you gonna do if you fail your finals and lose your scholarships because you decided to take a week off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know\u2026\u201d Haley whimpered, her double chin creasing, \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019m worried, okay? Mackenzie was way smarter than I was and she dropped out around this time, and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Mackenzie get pregnant?\u201d Courtney cut in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen she obviously wasn\u2019t that smart.\u201d Courtney put her hand on Haley\u2019s shoulder, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re worried, I get it. But you can\u2019t just\u2026 run away from your problems, okay? Let me help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 no more hooky.\u201d Haley smiled gently, \u201cDo you\u2026 want to stay for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Courtney grimaced, suddenly green around the gills, \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGirls!\u201d came a familiar voice from deeper inside the house,\u201d I hope you\u2019ve still got your appetites!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it became clear as Mrs. West entered the bedroom with enough food to feed four girls, that the decision had been taken entirely out of Courtney\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had already run out of chicken breasts, but there were plenty of sides still left sitting on the counter. Haley must have emptied a whole coop by now, but there was no stopping our greedy undergrad by now. She was on a roll, and all of her mama\u2019s home cooking was just too good to pass up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll your frettin\u2019 over whether or not you were gonna pass your exams.\u201d Mrs. West purred with a bemused little laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel silly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess it was pretty dumb.\u201d Haley\u2019s cheeks bunched, her smile widening as she leaned over to grab the gravy boat, \u201cHey, do you think I could get some more corn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had been eating for what felt like hours. Once she\u2019d gotten her grades back from her finals she\u2019d wasted no time in telling her mother. Her sneaky suspicion that she\u2019d be rewarded for her good\u2014not great, but good! \u2014grades were right on the money. As soon as Mrs. West saw that her baby girl had made straight B\u2019s, she got right to work on planning quite the celebration. All of Haley\u2019s favorite homemade dishes, all on one table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s stomach domed out in front of her. She was thickset now, with a wide set of hips and a heavy chest. When it was empty (which wasn\u2019t often) Haley\u2019s pudgy paunch rolled out in all directions as a squishy mass of meat. But after partaking in such a gastronomic feat, Haley\u2019s gut had hardened and distended drastically. It sat heavily atop her pillowy thighs, emitting a heat not unlike a machine in use. It churned and squelched dutifully as Haley eagerly popped bite after bite into her awaiting maw, tongue lolled and her mind clouded with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sweetheart.\u201d Mrs. West said with a pinch of Haley\u2019s softening cheek, \u201cYou can have as much as you want\u2014after all that studying you\u2019ve done, I\u2019d say you deserve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her mother sauntered over with the bowl of home-made creamed corn, Haley dolloped two heavy serving spoons of the stuff. She couldn\u2019t get enough of this\u2014now that she didn\u2019t have to worry about classes, Haley just felt so free! No more Mr. Casper ragging her about her word usage, no more of Mrs. Waddell\u2019s boring lectures, but lots lots more of laying around at home and plenty plenty more extra helpings\u2014it\u2019s like her mama said, she deserved it after everything that she\u2019d been through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two West women had cleared the table, Haley had never felt fuller. Pounds of poultry, fields of corn, and more potatoes than Ireland could have handled had been pushed into the awaiting mouth of Haley West, who was officially almost halfway not a freshman anymore. With the help of her always doting mother, Haley hoisted herself to a standing position as her stomach swelled out in front of her. Arching her back and cradling the dome of her gut with her free hand, Haley toddled as far as her sluggish self could make it\u2014the living room couch. Once there, she plopped herself down belly up and began to groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m crashing here tonight.\u201d Haley chuckled dimly as she smacked her stuffed stomach, \u201cOof\u2026 pass me the remote? I think I\u2019ve earned that too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Mrs. West grunted as she bent over to fetch the remote from its place on the coffee table, \u201cThink you\u2019ve also earned some dessert? Maybe some ice cream\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026\u201d Haley pressed on her stomach with five outstretched fingers, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u2026 I\u2019m already gonna explode\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome ooooon.\u201d Mrs. West cooed, \u201cLive a little\u2014you\u2019re in college!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Haley caved, \u201cJust one bowl though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. West returned with an entire carton of Mint Chocolate Chip and a serving spoon in hand, and passed it to her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust put back what you don\u2019t eat.\u201d Mrs. West said, fetching a blanket for her poor overfed daughter, \u201cWouldn\u2019t want it to melt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be getting up any time soon\u2026\u201d Haley burped, already working on her first spoonful, \u201cSeriously, dinner was great\u2014thanks again for cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Mrs. West replied with a little peck on her daughter\u2019s forehead, \u201cNow you just rest up and take it easy now that you\u2019re out of classes\u2014call me if you need anything, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything, I mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Haley snorted, \u201cAnything, got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Mrs. West trailed down the hallway, \u201cBecause your sister\u2019s going to be here in a couple of days and I wanted to make sure we got to celebrate you getting through your finals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Haley blinked sleepily\u2026 \u201cWait, what?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Haley could have died right then and there\u2014she\u2019d known that she\u2019d been putting on weight like crazy ever since she\u2019d moved back home, but did Tara really have to look so happy about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it though?\u201d Mrs. West crooned, petting Haley\u2019s rounding cheek in the way that only a mother could, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of her\u2014you know, she\u2019s making all B\u2019s so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tara\u2019s eyebrow fish hooked inquisitively, \u201cBecause they look more like C\u2019s from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the West girls, the oven timer went off\u2014enough of a distraction for Mrs. West to completely miss Tara\u2019s jab at her younger sister\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019d be lunch.\u201d The older woman said with a smile, \u201cYou two get comfy\u2014I\u2019ve got to put it back in for another few minutes and then we\u2019ll eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the two West women alone, it wasn\u2019t hard to tell that they were sisters. They were about the same height, and aside from the ample amount of weight that Haley had packed on, they didn\u2019t look dissimilar. Where Haley kept her hair short and brown, Tara wore hers about shoulder length and box-dye blonde. They had the same eyes, the same ears, high cheekbones. If it weren\u2019t for Tara\u2019s big nose and Haley\u2019s big\u2026 well, everything\u2026 it\u2019d be pretty easy to think that they were twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.\u201d Haley attempted, \u201cHow\u2019s life? Charleston, being out of school\u2026 your cat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good, all good.\u201d Tara nodded, \u201cHow\u2019s\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Tara\u2019s smile turned devilish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiving with mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, shut up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah there, those are big girl words there\u2014I\u2019m not sure someone who can\u2019t live on their own, pay rent or\u2026 you know, make all A\u2019s should really use that type of language!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s cheeks grew flush as her brown brow furrowed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re plenty big, buuuut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m impossible, try\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it just sort\u2019ve went on like that. Things were never quiet with the two West girls in the house, for one reason or another. Screeching at each other was almost as common as them screeching about each other, and it had been like this ever since they hit puberty. However, all it took for them to settle down was for their dear mother to come back into the room, whereupon their snarling faces became happy grins that couldn\u2019t have looked more forced if they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for them, the West matriarch wasn\u2019t nearly as apt to notice their infighting as she was when they were younger. Perhaps it was having Tara out of the house, perhaps she just wasn\u2019t as observant as she was when they were teenagers, or perhaps she was simply overlooking their squabbling in lieu of the holiday season. But for whatever reason, she wasn\u2019t about to start a ruckus to calm one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ve got another half hour or so before the turkey\u2019s done.\u201d Mrs. West announced proudly as her daughters\u2019 facial muscles strained to maintain their smiles, \u201cCome come, sit sit. Tell us all about Charleston.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Mom, stop.\u201d Tara was dripping with fake modesty, \u201cYou\u2019ve been to Charleston before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah mom, stop.\u201d Haley huffed as she sat down, her tummy coming to rest between the spread of her thighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have a great view of the city.\u201d Tara began with vigor, \u201cAnd I make so much money at my job that I can finally afford to not have a roommate\u2014Haley, you had roommates when you lived on your own, didn\u2019t you just hate them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, blah blah blah\u2026 blah blah blah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the longest three days ever, Haley thought to herself as she reclined into the sofa. What she wouldn\u2019t give to be back in Mr. Casper\u2019s class right about now. Or at Big Daddy\u2019s with Courtney. Or Waffle House\u2026 maybe Denny\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft stomach began to gurgle at the thought of her favorite greasy spoons. Lunch could not come quick enough for Haley\u2019s tastes. At least then she didn\u2019t have to listen to Tara\u2019s bragging about how awesome her life is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, did you say something?\u201d Tara interrupted herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, uh\u2026 no.\u201d Haley stuttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so as I was saying, my cat loves my new place\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst.

That didn\u2019t leave much time for getting to know one another, but it certainly left enough time for plenty of family meals. At least, if Mrs. West had anything to say about it. With two girls to feed, the already overworked woman couldn\u2019t help but kick herself into overdrive. Breakfasts led into lunches, which led to dinners. Sometimes there was only handful of hours that her daughters may lay at rest before she whipped up another caloric onslaught for her baby girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had grown accustomed to it, but Tara had been left far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, like, I don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful, okay?\u201d Tara belched softly into the breadth of her palm, \u201cBut if Mom makes me eat anything else today I think I\u2019m gonna barf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Haley answered, nonplussed by the excess mass occupying her stomach, \u201cHey\u2014you be the one to tell her to stop. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lanky blonde was already bottomed out, but her greedy guts of a sister was merely picking her teeth, already looking forward to the treat that was going to be dinner. She knew that her mama was sure to go all out now that Tara was here. The only question is, what could it be? She\u2019d been talking about turkey lately. But she saw her mom wrestling with a honking heft of ham the other day when she came home from the grocery store\u2026 had she already eaten that? Had they already had ham? All this food, it was getting so hard to remember\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoooood\u2026 I\u2019m gonna spew\u2026\u201d Tara cupped her stomach on either side, poking quietly into a cute little rock-solid pot belly, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me poke you in the belly button.\u201d Haley cut her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo don\u2019t, for real\u2026 the thought alone makes me wanna\u2026\u201d Tara wretched, \u201cGawd\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had managed to survive one of their mother\u2019s many meals together, yes, and it had leant Tara an understanding as to why her little sister was looking like such a porker these days. Just imagine if Tara herself had to deal with such vicious stuffing day in and day out\u2014she\u2019d be a whale by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Tara continued to whine, \u201cShe never used to cook like this when we were kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmpty nest syndrome? Who the heck knows.\u201d Haley snorted dismissively as her hands came to rest on the chubby belly that splayed out in front of her, \u201cAll I know is, her cooking\u2019s a lot better than when we were kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked at her little sister, with those round cheeks and that double chin. Those gross love-handles and that supple stomach that flopped out over her pants\u2014something had to be done about this. She had enough trouble getting dates now, but with her luck and metabolism, she\u2019d put on ten pounds before she got back to her apartment in just a few days! The food was good, and it really was nice to see Mom again, but there were somethings that she just wouldn\u2019t sacrifice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to look her best for that New Year\u2019s party, and binging on southern home cooking was definitely not the best way to get into her little black dress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, sis\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me sis. It\u2019s expositional and clunky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, Haley, do me a solid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for you, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you\u2026 maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 cover for me?\u201d Tara winced, \u201cI love mom and\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re kinda cool sometimes. But if I sit down at the table, she\u2019s going to want me to eat and\u2026 this is just too much, y\u2019know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally. I\u2019ll lie and tell Mom you\u2019re sick.\u201d Haley rubbed her jelly belly contemplatively, \u201cLike\u2026 stomach bug or something. You\u2019re violently, horribly wretching in the bathroom, and food is the last thing that you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d Tara said with a quick awkward hug as she hobbled to her feet, \u201cOh, here she comes, I\u2019d better\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, one West woman left and another one entered. Mrs. West came bounding into the room looking pleased as punch until she saw that only one of her daughters had remained. A confused, disheartened look spread across her face as she put her hands on her wide birthing hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley, where\u2019d Tara go?\u201d she asked, glancing side to side, \u201cI could have sworn that I heard her voice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s in her room. Puking up buckets.\u201d Haley answered nonchalantly as she watched TV, \u201cSaid she\u2019s not up for dinner, blah blah blah, \u201cy\u2019know, right?\u201d and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. West blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and that she\u2019s sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the thought of having her visiting daughter out of culinary commission bothered her, she only showed it for a moment. She was perturbed momentarily, an annoyed noise escaping from somewhere low in her throat, before she sighed dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well.\u201d She hummed, \u201cI made so much to eat though, I hope she feels up to some leftovers a little later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry about that, Ma.\u201d Haley licked her lips as she rocked herself to a standing position, cradling her distended gut, \u201cI think that between the two of us, we can knock it out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it turns out, a little tiny slice of Conservative Christian pie out in the middle of Nowhere, SC meant that there wasn\u2019t a lot to do at Big Daddy\u2019s. They still kept her on for the full amount of hours\u2014they even gave her some extra ones since Christy got too pregnant to stay on her feet all day, and the tips were great. Nothing like a good ol\u2019 seasonal reminder to these Jesus freaks that the chick in black clothing bringing your food needs to eat too, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wednesday, your regular\u2019s at the corner table.\u201d came a voice from the kitchen, \u201cYou wanna get her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d The girthy goth rolled her brown eyes and hoisted herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall me fucking Wednesday one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani\u2019s coal black lips formed a tight scowl as she tugged at the bottom of her Big Daddy\u2019s t-shirt, pulling it back over the porcelain plumpness that had managed to escape during her dinner. It wasn\u2019t enough that she was known around here as \u201cthe goth waitress\u201d, but on top of everything, she was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatter as her ex-boyfriend\u2019s voice reminded her in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone put on weight during the holidays, not just her. And had he seen the rest of her family? She was fighting against genetics, boredom and comfort food, for Christ\u2019s sake. Twenty pounds in two months wasn\u2019t that much\u2014and it wasn\u2019t like he minded her fat ass when they first hooked up. She was better off without him anyway. The decent fucking wasn\u2019t worth all the redneckery that came with dating someone with a truck that big and a dick that small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, when had she started jiggling when she walked? Was that recent? Like, was it the big lunches she\u2019d started having here that did that, or all the chips. Or the sitting around all day playing Xbox. Or\u2026 maybe it was being on her phone all day looking at makeup tutorials.

Since even before the girls left home. The girls had never had more than one or two friends over at a time, but to think that all these people could fit in their modest three-room cracker box was almost unheard of! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was quite sure why the waitress from Big Daddy\u2019s had decided to join, even if she was just going to act like a pill the entire time. Haley blamed Courtney. Tara didn\u2019t know Courtney\u2019s name, so she just blamed the busty chick with the glasses. But the plump, pitch-black pouter was the least of Haley\u2019s concerns\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s also not usually this\u2026 uncomfortable\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley hadn\u2019t had to share the couch in forever! And never with more than one other person. Her sister, her mom, Courtney sometimes\u2026 but how was she supposed to get comfy with Tara, Courtney, and that fat waitress from Big Daddy\u2019s all squeezed onto one couch?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s wide hips pressed tightly against Courtney\u2019s flaring thighs, leg meat chafing uncomfortably against leg meat as the chunky freshman tried to wriggle her way into a more comfortable position. All of her ample flesh didn\u2019t exactly make such a feat easy\u2014but neither did Courtney\u2019s or Dani\u2019s! Even Tara\u2019s skinny butt felt like too much\u2026 someone had to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus could you not?\u201d Danielle\u2019s stomach wobbled from side to side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley, knock it off!\u201d Courtney whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2019s gonna be so mad if you get salsa on her couch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God everyone just shut uuuup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, is everything okay in there?\u201d Mrs. West called from her ever-present place in the kitchen, sounding as if she were scolding a bunch of children rather than the (overly) grown women that she was speaking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah Mom!\u201d Haley lied, \u201cWe\u2019re fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley leaned back into her seat. Her stupid, uncomfortable seat. This was why they needed an armchair. Not just so it would tie the room together (instead of just having a stupid TV against one wall and the couch against the other!) but so other people could sit! Gawd, it wasn\u2019t that hard! All this stress was making her grumpy\u2026 and hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, look, someone sit on the floor.\u201d The chunky brunette insisted in a hushed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna sit on the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m a guest here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour ass is the only one with enough padding to not be bothered by it.\u201d Tara cut in, \u201cI say you sit on the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you always picking on me\u2014you\u2019ve got two other chicks just as chubby as I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish we were as fat as you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, who invited Wednesday Addams?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the debate sort of escalated like that. They may have been whispering in hushed tones so as not to anger the queen of the kitchen just a few feet away, but their whispers were just as hairy and equally as counterproductive! Our three fat friends and Tara couldn\u2019t have been less egalitarian if they tried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it got worse\u2014all of their arguing meant that they were getting quite worked up! Bodies started moving, arms waving, cheeks shimmying and fingers pointing. And with four girls at once, three of them hardly as light as they liked to think that they were, that meant that the poor couch beneath them was taking quite a bit of strain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls?\u201d Mrs. West asked again, this time with a much firmer tone of voice, \u201cDon\u2019t make me come in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine, Mom, just\u2014unf!\u201d Haley grunted, \u201cHaving a little trouble figuring out seating arrangements!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconvinced, the older West woman rolled her eyes and put the utensils down. Dinner would be fine for a moment, certainly long enough to qualm whatever was going on in there. So she took a few steps forward, poking her head into the living room, with the intention of giving a stern \u201cMom\u201d look and quieting everything down. All she needed was another half hour and supper would be ready!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, her eyes widened in terror as she saw one of the legs on her couch begin to bend, and bend\u2026 until it snapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheap wood shattered, knocking the already off-kilter couch unbalanced. The uneven distribution meant that all four legs practically exploded in splinters, and unfortunately all four girls were knocked out of their seats by the couch\u2019s bucking! Three pudgy bodies (and Tara) came tumbling down without a clue as to what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job fatass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain\u2014two other asses, just as fat as mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so sorry Mrs. West.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ass had nothing to do with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though they were now on the floor, their bickering continued. At least until Mrs. West let out a strong, sturdy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was sufficiently frightening enough that it scared each and every girl (even the ones that didn\u2019t live there) straight enough to settle down. Everyone moved to the kitchen table where they did their best to keep things civil until dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, this is part \u2018Goodbye Tara\u2019, part \u2018We Have Guests\u2019, so I made plenty for everyone.\u201d Mrs. West said with a proud smile, her hands planted firmly on her wide hips as everyone looked on in awe of the spread that she\u2019d whipped up for them, \u201cSo that means don\u2019t be shy\u2014eat up, everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t need to tell anyone twice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d tried for two years to make it on her own in Charleston like her sister, only to find out the hard way that living with your best friends out of high school wasn\u2019t as easy as everyone on those old sitcoms made it out to be. With no college degree and no real way of getting anything better than an entry-level job in retail, Haley had been forced to move back home with her mom. A Communications major at USCU, Haley had spent three long years trying to make the college experience work for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow well that had worked out for her was debatable, but at least she was on-track to graduate on time! Just one step closer to getting a good job, moving back out into her own place, and getting back to the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenior year was going to be her year\u2014she could practically taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley, breakfast is ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had been in the middle of the most important part of her morning routine; working up the energy to get out of bed. She had to spend at least thirty minutes in a half-asleep daze, scrolling through her social media feed and checking various websites before she even thought about getting up. Even the promise of her mother\u2019s special chocolate-chip pancakes wasn\u2019t enough for her not to curse under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were definitely enough to get her chubby buns into gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting one leg over the side of her bed and sliding to the edge, Haley grumbled and cursed as she dragged herself to a standing position. Her low center of gravity and big bottom half meant forced her to rock ever so slightly, grunting as she exerted the immodest amount of effort meant to get her moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley, honey, you up?\u201d her mother called from downstairs, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna get cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2019up!\u201d Haley shouted, \u201cGimme a minute, goddamn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt twenty-four and weighing two hundred and sixty pounds, Haley wasn\u2019t exactly in the best shape of her life. Ever since she\u2019d moved home, she\u2019d been steadily expanding\u2014she\u2019d put on more than a hundred and fifty pounds since she started college, and it somehow felt like all of it had been stuffed into her massive ass and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 shit\u2026\u201d Haley hissed, struggling to wriggle her way into leggings that she could have sworn were new (at least too new to be this tight!), \u201cStop calling my phone, mama!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a loud SSSHHHRRIP sounded and she felt her thigh flesh bulge through the new rip in her bottoms, Haley slouched in defeat. Another fucking pair of leggings\u2014they were money well spent. Hadn\u2019t she just bought these a few weeks ago? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThick thighs save lives my ass.\u201d Haley pouted, wriggling and jiggling her way out of the now unwearable pants as the rip tore further down her inner thigh, \u201cThicker than a bowl of fucking oatmeal and what the fuck do I have to show for it besides some fucking\u2026 goddamn...piece of shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was panting by the time she\u2019d squeezed herself into something decent\u2014a pair of loose pajama bottoms that still managed to hug her ass and thighs so tight she could hear the threads stretch. Maybe if she untucked her tummy\u2026<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like her mom was gonna care as long as she changed before she left for class\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoop.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley grunted as she worked her hands underneath her stomach, working it out of the taut waistband of her bottoms. Billowing over the drawstring on all sides, Haley\u2019s soft belly fat fell neatly onto her lap, even while standing. Haley gave a final petulant scowl as the audacity of this morning came to pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d she said finally, patting her belly contentedly as a smile spread on her face, \u201cMuch better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach offered another suggestion as to how she could improve her morning with a greedy grumble. The smell of her mother\u2019s breakfast wafted heavily throughout the house, making her morning grumpiness fade ever further. Taking her first steps out of her bedroom, Haley waddled out into the hallway to start her senior year right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning my Soon-to-Be Senior~\u201d Mrs. West cooed and fawned as she saw her daughter\u2019s distinctive shape grace the doorway, \u201cI got everything ready for you\u2014just how you like it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily her biggest champion (and enabler) Haley\u2019s mom had done everything in her power to make sure that Haley had as easy a time in college as possible. She didn\u2019t have to worry about paying rent, she didn\u2019t have to get a job, and she could live worry-free as her mom kept her flush with a little spending money and plenty of free meals, on the house. For three years, Mrs. West had been able to spoil her baby girl and support her through college\u2014she only had one year left! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley toddled into the kitchen hungrily, her massive legs rubbing against each other all the way down to her knees as her belly bounced eagerly towards the table. She pulled a chair out and plopped down with a mighty ripple that went up and out throughout her entire portly shape. Grabbing her knife and fork, Haley dove head first into her favorites: chocolate-chip pancakes with blueberry syrup, and butter between every layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks mom.\u201d Haley said huskily, being handed a coffee mug and a little kitschy container of half and half, \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\nHaley had been privy to these big breakfasts of her mom\u2019s for so long now, the thought of going without them was honestly more than a little depressing. She\u2019d gotten spoiled by having her mother\u2019s cooking at her literal beck and call\u2014even if she wasn\u2019t always as appreciative as she ought to have been, Haley had really come to rely on her mom for a lot. Mealtimes especially\u2026<br>\r\nSo much was going to change after she graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down, hun, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d Mrs. West sipped her coffee as Haley\u2019s flabby chest bounced with a cough, \u201cWhat time do you gotta leave before class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2019hour.\u201d Haley huffed, \u201cCould you pass me the\u2014bacon, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s thick fingers plucked a few strips from the pile and added them onto her already stacked breakfast platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I told Courtney that we\u2019d meet up.\u201d Haley took a big swig of her coffee (mostly sugar and cream), \u201cSo I\u2019ve gotta hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you didn\u2019t stay up so late, buying clothes with my credit card again without asking me\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the breakfast, mama~!\u201d Haley corrected as she blew a kiss placating to her mother with one chunky arm still shoveling food into her mouth, \u201cGottahurrybyyyyyeeee~!!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took about seven dollars to get in, and they provided a wide berth of entrees to choose from complete with sides and desserts. There was nothing but ethics and the lingering sensation of guilt stopping her from loading up her tray, stuffing her face, and then getting back in line to grab seconds. They couldn\u2019t make her pay again\u2014and it was much cheaper than eating into the spending money that her mom gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started her off with a paltry fifty bucks at the beginning of every semester, and combined with what her mom pitched in (\u201cbecause I know sometimes you get hungry on campus!\u201d) Haley had started every semester with one hundred big ones to play around with.

Where Haley was bottom heavy with wide thighs and humongous hips, Courtney stored most her chub in her face, arms, and chest with a detour route to the doughy belly that rolled over her leggings.

Did going back for the bacon and eggs count if she hadn\u2019t sat down?) and it hadn\u2019t gotten any easier since she\u2019d put so much food away. By the time she reached the start of the line, wedged between Courtney\u2019s meaty back and a freshman who went bug-eyed at the sight of how big her butt was, Haley was a little winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna try again tomorrow morning?\u201d Courtney nudged her in the exposed fluffy side, \u201cMrs. Rodrick cancelled lecture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Haley offered weakly, watching the hypnotic display of biscuits and gravy being plopped onto her tray, \u201cI might have\u2026 stuff to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could get breakfast after?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley whimpered impotently as she waddled after Courtney, settling down with a fatty grunt as she settled back down into her seat\u2014still warm. Ever since Courtney had started jogging, she\u2019d picked up this annoying habit of walking fast. Well, fast to Haley. The truth of the matter was that Haley was just slower than ever. Her waddle grew more and more pronounced with every inch that padded her growing backside. Her thighs swaddled in layers of wobbling jelly, chafing with every step\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of running made her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Courtney put on her puppy-dog eyes, clasping her chubby hands over her tankard chest, \u201cI could really use a gym buddy.\u201d<br>\r\nHaley curdled at the thought of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe there was a way that they could both get what they wanted\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She said finally after a mouthful of white gravy and dough, \u201cBuf on foo condiffens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have breakfast at the Crepe Factory.\u201d Haley said after swallowing, but not before readying her fork for another bite, \u201cBut we have to go there first because they close early. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u2014I\u2019ll see if my mom will lend me some money.\u201d Haley took another big bite of biscuit before skewering a cloud of scrambled eggs, \u201cWe can get coffee after too\u2014you know to energize, or whatever\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Haley did manage to squeeze herself into a pair of leggings and a serviceable top. Her wobbling thighs spread wide in her best Galaxy leggings and her belly packed tight into a once-loose tank top, she and Courtney ate well and full for a good morning\u2019s run. They both waddled away from the table, full and ready, but sometime around their pre-run coffee Courtney got a call and they decided to reschedule\u2014leaving Haley one breakfast richer and exercise-free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with enough before class to stop at Krispy Kreme along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portion sizes at that place sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been quite a while since Haley had bothered to remember what Mackenzie Hollifield looked like when they were teenagers\u2014it would have been too much effort to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were enrolled in Boiling Springs High School together, Mackenzie had been a prominent member of the Federation of Christian Athletes. She\u2019d always been super religious, and it had rubbed Haley the wrong way during her years as a teenaged edge lord. They hadn\u2019t exactly been friends because Mackenzie was a grade above her, but Haley remembered her well enough to remember that she used to be pretty skinny. But then again, Haley often thought, who wasn\u2019t skinnier back then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor three years, ever since Haley had come back from Charleston, Mackenzie had flitted in and out of her loose social circle. She couldn\u2019t exactly blame her\u2014Mackenzie was a mom, and that meant she couldn\u2019t exactly go out to Waffle House every other night like Haley and everyone else their age with a social life. But when they did get to catch up, it was almost always over Waffle House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat or whenever there was a church bake sale going on\u2014girl was domestic af.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel bad for that\u2014you\u2019re in college.\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s thick second chin bunched against her buried jawline as she looked down to saw through a stack of pancakes three stories high, \u201cYou\u2019re too busy studyin\u2019 and whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, thank you.\u201d Haley took a long sip of her milky coffee, \u201cI love Courtney to death, but I just don\u2019t want to go running right before class, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley and Mackenzie had parked their respective hefts into either side of the booth after classes had let out. That was an All-Star Breakfast Platter apiece ago, with an extra waffle and plenty of butter apiece. Mackenzie had talked Haley into sticking around and offered to get her \u201cjust a little something extra\u201d\u2014currently being worked on at either end of the table now, as the sun started to set and the afternoon waned into night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI totally get it; you need that morning time.\u201d Mackenzie offered in that patented Southern sort of way, \u201cLife\u2019s too short to take time away from what matters just to make yourself feel good\u2014Y\u2019know that\u2019s what I tell Ryan when he gets onto me about goin\u2019 back to the gym\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d Haley tried to not look too disassociated from yet another passing rant about her baby daddy, \u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley tried not to judge Mackenzie too hard. A Mom at twenty, college drop-out, former athlete\u2026 heavy emphasis on the former. She\u2019d never left her home town either, so her conversations were pretty much limited to whatever her daughter was learning how to do, her family drama, or food. Haley was pretty down with that last part\u2014Mack had turned her on to a lot of places around town that she had wound up loving. And the first one wasn\u2019t so bad either, to an extent (Tiffany was such a cute baby!). But Haley had learned to stop paying attention when Mackenzie\u2019s story started veering away from the original point\u2014in this case, why she shouldn\u2019t feel bad about not exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, maybe if I looked like Courtney he\u2019d back off on that.\u201d Mackenzie chuckled thickly, \u201cTits for days, am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeks and months.\u201d Haley agreed after swallowing an especially big bite (a common diversion tactic with Mackenzie\u2019s one-sided conversations), \u201cCourtney looks great\u2014I don\u2019t know why she wants to lose weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little weight never hurt nobody.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie laid her fork to rest, a full half a stack ahead of Haley, and nestled her thick hands on top of her stuffed stomach as it barreled onto the table. She shifted in her seat, panting uncomfortably as she struggled with her own restricting size. Once she\u2019d finally wrangled her belly into a more comfortable position, she sighed contentedly. Her hammy arms dug into her purse as she searched for her wallet to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t mind havin\u2019 a body like yours either.\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s free hand grabbed a palmful of her ample belly blubber and gave it a good shake, \u201cYou\u2019re thicc\u2014I\u2019m just fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStoooop, you\u2019re cute though!\u201d Haley defended quickly, \u201cRyan\u2019s lucky as fuck to have a wife as hot as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m like those cats on Facebook.\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s whole body was still jiggling by the time she plopped her wallet on the table, \u201cHe\u2019s been calling me Chonkenzie for like a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an asshole.\u201d Haley griped, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Mack\u2014you\u2019re hot as fuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley wriggled herself out of the booth with all the deftness and poise of a slug, an effort at signaling the end of their time together. Her mile-wide behind caught on the edge of the table and scraped against her fluffy thigh. Her full belly pressed tight against the crotch of her leggings, bowing down and showing a sliver of pale white chub that ringed around her fleshy form. Her ass spreading wide and far behind her, Haley toddled towards the checkout counter in hopes of finally getting out of her\u2014she had so much homework to do for her Marketing course\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are too, hun.\u201d Mackenzie said with a herculean heft of her wide and mighty leg, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to lose a pound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mackenzie huffed and puffed as she worked her way to her flabby feet, her whole body surging forward and downwards as she put her weight down. Haley had to get on the other end of her and help hoist her fat ass up. By the time she was standing, Mackenzie was beet red, huffing and puffing as. Arching her back, belly rolling out and over her unbuttoned stretchy jeans, Mackenzie had clearly had her fill at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I might\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite the fact that she\u2019d just told her otherwise, Haley was inclined to agree. Mack was getting pretty big\u2014but it at least helped put her own gain in perspective. Haley wasn\u2019t exactly happy about how big her butt was, and she knew deep down, she probably could have benefited more from a treadmill than a trip to Waffle House\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it\u2019s not like she was that big\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the semester rolled on, Haley continued to wrestle with her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather, she continued to wrestle with her feelings about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what were unfortunately her best attempts at curbing her continuing expansion, Haley was simply too lazy to put forth the effort. She didn\u2019t want to diet. She loved food! The thought of going without all of her favorite foods just to shed some pounds and inches left her with this empty feeling in the pit of her gut\u2014one that she usually wound up filling with an extra helping or portion here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had only continued to balloon outwards as her Senior Year crawled along at a snail\u2019s pace. Her thighs swelled outwards into hammy saddlebags, making her doughy hands sit at an angle hanging down. Her ass was getting so wide that she was starting to catch the doorways on campus, her bulging butt flesh quivering and quaking behind her by a full foot as she waddled along on pillowy pillars of pudgy legs. Her stomach sunk lower, spread wider, and did everything in its power to prop up the comparatively teensy tits that had somehow managed to remain shoppably small. Her profile, arms and shoulders meant that she could pass on social media as just a little plump. A soft little double chin, and some cute chubby cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the reality of it was that, from the waist down, Haley was getting huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty pounds had crept on over the holidays, putting her at a seemingly impossible size of three hundred and ten. After New Year\u2019s, she was up to three fifteen. And by the middle of January, another hundred and fifty pounds had waltzed through the door to make Haley\u2019s life a living hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right\u2014her sister had come for her annual visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Tara had said at the first opportunity, \u201cHaley\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour butt is so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like one of those *scoff* rap guys\u2019 girlfriends.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear to Jesus Christ that I will sit on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkayokayokay what the fuck ever Tara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember when we used to sing that song on the way to school?\u201d Tara asked, grabbing a handful of her sister\u2019s belly blubber between her forefinger and thumb, \u201cDid you ever think that it would be the inspiration for your descent into being a total fatass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTara\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI blame Sir Mix-a-Lot of all of this junk in your trunk.\u201d Tara slapped Haley across the cheeks, squishing and shaking as they wobbled beneath the tightest pair of leggings known to man, \u201cJesus Christ, Haley\u2014what does mom feed you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had been teasing Haley for most of her life. It had stemmed, largely, from her being less popular than her baby sister. But ever since Haley started getting fat, her weight problem had been ripe for the picking. Years of frustration finally had an outlet; and every year that channel widened proportionately with the size of Haley\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour belly\u2019s so heavy!\u201d Tara hefted her sister\u2019s gut up with both hands, letting it fall back into place as a quivering mass of fat, \u201cHow long until we have to start buttering up the doorways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you done feeling me up?\u201d Haley crossed her doughy arms, \u201cBecause this for sure isn\u2019t my fetish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs your fetish butter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOOOM!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay jeez, chill out gawd.\u201d Tara shushed her sister in a low tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t be such a fucking baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding side by side in Tara\u2019s bedroom, there was no denying just how big Haley\u2019d gotten. The full-length mirror told her everything she needed to know about just how much wider she was than her sister. How much more of her there was. How fat she\u2019d gotten. Tara couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Haley\u2019s size\u2014even if she\u2019d always been a little flat. Her waist was as big around as one of Haley\u2019s thighs, for Christ\u2019s sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, she didn\u2019t like being so much fatter than she used to be. Getting up and down the stairs was a chore. She had this pronounced waddle that left her gasping for breath if she made the mistake of walking somewhere longer than a few yards away. Her massive fucking thighs had eaten holes through every decent pair of pants, sweats, and leggings known to man and shorts had become completely out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other, Haley only really started to regret taking all those extra portions and slacking off on her exercise whenever someone teased her about it. She didn\u2019t exactly hate how she looked, which was more than what most people could say about themselves\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m stressed.\u201d Haley finally said in a defiant huff, \u201cSenior year is kicking my butt, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenior Year must be tired then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you, Tara!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d Her older sister said with a smile, \u201cLook, I know how stressful college is, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou went to Wofford on a full ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was stressful as fuck\u2014 a 3.5 GPA at Wofford is a ridiculous an unmaintainable goal.\u201d Tara gripped Haley\u2019s meaty shoulders, \u201cBut I managed to get through it. And so will you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled softly in a rare moment of genuine affection between them. She gave her sister a good squeeze, forcing her slender body into Haley\u2019s heft, and parting towards the door. Their mom was cooking a big Welcome Back Tara meal (the same one that she cooked every year, filled to the brim with her older sister\u2019s favorites) and the scent of smorgasbord had been tantalizing Haley all morning. One of\u2026 but definitely not the only\u2026 benefit to having her sister stick around for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if that\u2019s the only thing you fit through by the time you\u2019re done, wide-load.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK, TARA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell mom to donate your share to someone who needs it.\u201d Tara said, slowly making a break for it, \u201cSpartanburg County has a homeless shelter right\u2014think of all the needy homeless people who could live off your leftovers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara scampered down the hallway, Haley waddling slowly behind her, it was almost like they were kids again. The sound of their bickering used to fill the house when they were young. It was only fitting that it continued well into their adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWE WERE HAVING A MOMENT, YOU ASSHOLE!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nothing chased the stress away like floating up to your eyeballs in greasy spoon cuisine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUughhhhhh\u2026\u201d Courtney threw her head back and groaned, \u201cYou are, without a doubt, the worst influence in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting across from the booth at Big Daddy\u2019s, Courtney\u2019s belly domed against the table as she struggled to digest the epic greasy meal that she\u2019d just indulged in. She starfished into the cheap red pleather, panting up a storm as her massive breasts sloped heavily to either side of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Courtney\u2014\u201d Haley made a face as she leaned into the table, belly spilling onto the edge, \u201cWe used to eat like this all the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Courtney had tapped out, leaving a few straggling bites on the wax paper, Haley was still going working hard on the large order of bacon cheese fries that they\u2019d ordered as a little post-meal top-off. Little greedy noises sounded from her throat as she popped bite after bite past her lips, throaty grunts as she leaned into the table to reach more and more. More and more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had visibly gotten fatter since their last semester in college began just three months ago. She spread across the booth now, starting narrow at the top and billowing out all the way down. From the waist-up, there was no denying that Haley was getting bigger\u2014her belly was now this heavy, sagging thing that folded into two sloshing rolls of gut. Her arms were doughy, and had started to roll over the elbow. Her jawline had faded into distant memory as the swell of her double chin continued to hang lower and lower. As Haley continued to expand, it was getting harder for anyone to remember the skinny girl from Charleston who had just wandered back into town one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was watching Haley wriggle her carnivorous ass into the booth after she hip-checked the Out door on their way inside had convinced Courtney that perhaps Haley\u2019s laissez-faire attitude towards her weight and exercise were going to bite her in the butt\u2014and get a mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she continued to outgrow everything in her closet, even as her gut started to brush against the table, Haley couldn\u2019t quell her appetite. Whenever she got around food, she just fell into autopilot. Three years of living with her mother, having her every need taken care of, had squashed her ability to say \u2018no\u2019 to her spoiled stomach\u2019s slightest demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when it came to cheese fries, no demand was too slight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the year\u2014you\u2019re allowed to have a little comfort food Court.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s gut jiggled and squished as she leaned her heft forwards, toward the plate. Her back breasts squished against the booth\u2019s cushioned seat as she reclined again, her full stomach nestled neatly in her double-wide lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to stop worrying about diets and exercise\u2026 all that kind of stuff.\u201d Haley said between vicious sloppy bites of cheese, bacon, and fry, and quickly added the audible asterisk of \u201cAt least until after I graduate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou worry about diet and exercise?\u201d Courtney\u2019s breasts sloshed in tune with her stomach as she succumbed to another piece of fried okra, \u201cMadness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley stuck out her little pink tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying Haley, I\u2019m a little worried about you.\u201d Courtney cupped a handful of her own belly fat, \u201cBut I\u2019m more worried about your ability to convince me to order three sides and a double chili cheese burger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small pause for Courtney to succumb to another bite\u2014this time of what remained of the cheese fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that this hasn\u2019t been fun.\u201d She added as an addendum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise.\u201d Haley smacked her greasy lips, \u201cI know I\u2019ve gone a little overboard lately, but I\u2019m just stressed. After school\u2019s over, I\u2019ll buckle down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll stop peer pressuring me into binging with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI make absolutely no promises about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley tucked back into the last bit of bacon cheese fries. As the end of the year rapidly approached, the truth of the matter was that her weight was the furthest thing from her mind. She had spent almost four years in college, and she suddenly felt like she had never learned a thing. Her priorities were much stacked towards graduation\u2014after all, she could always lose weight later. Maybe not too much, just to get her down to a more manageable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of fullness slowly welled inside Haley\u2019s belly as the meal grew on and her stomach edged its capacity. One fluffy hand rested on the crest of her middle-most belly roll, fingers pressing lightly into the soft white outline that her belly cut in her shirt. Still chewing, her chubby cheeks rolling, Haley lulled her head back and sighed contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides\u2026\u201d Haley purred thickly, fingering her belly roll, \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of nice not worrying about what I eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced you were ever worried about what you ate.\u201d Courtney tittered, \u201cBuuuut\u2026 this has been pretty fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore fun than jogging?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiterally everything in the world is more fun than jogging.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley laughed as she sunk deeper and deeper into the booth, the old wood groaning at the strain of having to support the size and weight of its occupant. To think that there had once been a time where she and Courtney could sit on the same side of the table. Thinking about that made her realize that maybe it was time to cut back a little\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince it\u2019s my cheat day and everything\u2026\u201d Courtney\u2019s eyes danced around the restaurant playfully, \u201cDo you think you\u2019d be up for a milkshake\u2014we can take my car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom Cook Out?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley drummed her belly thoughtfully as her mouth began to water. Her stomach groaned in protest, even as flashes of her favorite flavors sizzled through her synapses. Suddenly feeling that little extra room that she always seemed to make, Haley couldn\u2019t argue against a free ride and a free milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah.\u201d She said in a husky voice, heaving one of her legs out of the booth, \u201cYou wanna help me up?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the dismissing notion that she would start to curb her appetite after she got out of college, Haley\u2019s lacking enthusiasm for exercise and moderation made for an empty promise. By the time Summer had rolled around, Haley was at her absolute biggest\u2014without school to distract her and with no other obligations, all there was for her to do was sit at home and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had been as proud as she could be seeing her daughter waddle across the stage in her graduation robes, and that pride had been so overwhelming that she was happy to give Haley a little more leeway as far as finding a job went. In this economy, and as an English major, it was going to be tough for her to find a job that she was going to like\u2014why kick her out the door when she wasn\u2019t ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as May ran into June and then July, now they were into August, and Haley had still shown no sign of finding employment. After four years of laying around on her mother\u2019s dime, eating all she wanted and getting what she needed, Haley was more than happy to extend her time with her Mom for as long as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s thunderous footsteps seemed to shake the whole house, the d\u00e9cor trembling as Haley waddled gut-first into the living room and towards the kitchen. The great white apron of her stomach poured out from underneath her USCU tee, forming two neat little dollops of dough that sat creased into a large smile of fleshy fold. It hung low over her crotch, spreading wide over her thighs in a pear-shaped display of growing dominance in her figure and her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course\u2014her stomach was no match for the hips catching at the doorframe, or the wide behind that lagged two steps to Haley\u2019s awkward waddling gait. Haley\u2019s ass was getting bigger by the day it seemed like, and the huge meals that her mother spoiled her with, not to mention all of the \u201ccelebration\u201d treats that she\u2019d rewarded herself with over the course of those three months, had only served to spread it wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you just now getting up?\u201d Mrs. West clicked her tongue, \u201cHaley, it\u2019s half past noon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sleeping in\u2014it\u2019s not like I have class to go to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley lumbered into the kitchen, a hungry twinkle in her eye as customary greeting of her mother\u2019s cooking wafted into her nostrils. Scraping the old wooden chair against the linoleum flooring, Haley lowered herself carefully into her seat at the head of the table. A smorgasbord of food awaiting her like always\u2014nothing she didn\u2019t deserve, naturally! She was a college graduate now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me there I guess.\u201d Her mother dismissed, \u201cAre you\u2026 going out with Courtney today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley made a face. She hadn\u2019t found the proper way to tell her mom that she and Courtney had had a fight a few weeks ago over the fact that Courtney had gotten all of her fat back. Plus a little extra. Apparently Haley was the worst friend in the world because she couldn\u2019t manage to eat a little less. It was a lot easier to just never talk about it and stay at home. Even more. For the past few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 no, she\u2019s busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are you expecting any calls from any of the places that you\u2019ve applied to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley made yet another face, one deeper and more viscerally embarrassed. Her double chin creased deep as she drank her juice, hoping that her #1 Grad mug would hide her shame. It didn\u2019t, and her mother took note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Haley.\u201d Mrs. West piqued her eyebrows, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghhhh I knowwwwwww.\u201d The mondo-bootied moocher sunk into the back of her chair, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s latest excuse was cut short as the chair cracked beneath her, sending her tumbling to the floor! Landing butter side up, her belly bouncing and sloshing with the reverberation of her meteoric impact against the floor, Haley was left a startled mess as the realization of what had happened dawned on her. She panted, breathless from shock and the force of her full weight pinning her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she had been well-insulated for impact\u2026 </span></div></div>",

But now that she was in her mid-twenties and almost nothing had changed (besides the fact that they got rid of that bomb ass arcade for another stupid clothing store that didn\u2019t have anything that fit her!) Haley was far less enthused about the prospect of hanging out with her friends there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, friend. Courtney was still mad at her. But Mackenzie would do in a pinch! And she wouldn\u2019t bitch about how much she ordered at Chic-fil-A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026so the chair turned into a whole big thing about and, long story short\u2014\u201d Haley slurped on her straw before tossing the emptied sweet tea into the trash, \u201c\u2014now my mom\u2019s bitching at me about getting a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women waddled heavily along the wide berth that the mall\u2019s halls gave them, their awkward toddling gaits unable to keep their fleshy forms apart. Even as Haley managed to lumber in the lead, she would feel the occasional brush of Mackenzie\u2019s belly as it sloshed against her meaty backside. The tickle of Mack\u2019s gut bouncing against her ass packed tight into leggings wasn\u2019t as unpleasant as it was odd\u2014and perhaps a sign that maybe it was time for them to cut back on the waffle fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could always come work at the Fish Camp?\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s thick southern accent really shined every time she said fish camp, \u201cDemi\u2019s lookin\u2019 for new waitresses and the pay\u2019s pretty good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley turned up her nose at the thought of waitressing for a living. Who wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019d gone to college so that she wouldn\u2019t have to be a waitress for the rest of her life. Or a beautician. Or a housewife. Or whatever other southern stereotype that life could throw her way. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what she wanted to do, but she knew that it involved something with her degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was there to even do as an English major in South Carolina? Haley sure as hell hadn\u2019t found out in her three months of barely looking, and hadn\u2019t turned up anything new in the week or so that she\u2019d spent searching ever since she got in a fight with her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on finding me some new clothes first.\u201d Haley said with a pout, \u201cSomething job interview-y.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley knew that it was going to be a long shot finding anything that fit her and looked cute. At least, it would have been if they hadn\u2019t opened a Torrid a little while ago. Whatever they didn\u2019t have there, Haley could scrounge up at Lane Bryant. Thank God for Spartanburg\u2019s growing obesity epidemic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while it wasn\u2019t exactly likely that they\u2019d have any cool band t-shirts that Haley could squeeze into (at least on the rack) it was sort of a tradition that every time she came to Westgate Mall she\u2019d stop by Hot Topic. Haley\u2019s comparatively tiny tits and narrow shoulders meant that she could squeeze into some of the smaller \u201cextra large\u201d sizes without having to custom order with whoever was behind the counter. It was a decent way to stay stylish as her weight kept rising\u2026 somehow. Plus, it was fun to see good little Christian girl Mackenzie squirm at all the edgy shirts and collectibles\u2014watching her try not to touch anything while being big enough to brush against everything was a laugh riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley chuckled as she heard another utterance of confusion and awe mixed into one, staring up at the rack and looking at all of the shirts. She had assumed that it was her friend, marveling at the graphic tees with the pentagrams and Satan stars on them for about the billionth time. She hadn\u2019t even realized that the voice wasn\u2019t Mackenzie\u2019s until it kept talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not even gonna say hi to me?\u201d the deceptively high-pitched voice dripped with venom, \u201cFuck you, Haley!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler Alert: it's Dani Gosset! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's a reason that Haley didn't recognize her...</span></div></div>",

Wide white wings wobbled thickly as they drooped over her elbow, her face set deep in a ring of chins and cheeks\u2014eyes almost comically small as she squinted against the meat of her face.

Mostly because Dani thought that Haley thought that she was better than her. And if that wasn\u2019t the most high school thing that you\u2019ve heard today, the only reason that they stopped hanging out a few years ago was because that Dani thought that Haley thought that she thought that she was a cunt, and was talking smack behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo sitting across from one another back at Big Daddy\u2019s some time later, just the two of them, was\u2026 surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2014what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing Dani squeezed into a waitress\u2019 uniform, but rather plopped behind the other side of the booth after much shimmying and shaking, creaking wood and heavy breathing was almost as much of an adjustment for Haley as Dani\u2019s new figure. The idea that she had been the chubby little goth girl who had waited on her and Courtney back when they were Freshmen in college was just\u2026 wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani\u2019s sprawling acre of belly blubber poured onto the table\u2019s surface, easing in and out like a gentle tide with her breathing. She was mostly gut, setting her aside from just about everyone else in Haley\u2019s life. Where she was hippy, Courtney was top-heavy, and Mackenzie had been big all over, Dani was basically just a melted marshmallow of middle mass, white and chunky from every angle. Her chins formed a ring around her neck that quivered whenever she spoke\u2014her voice still high and whiny from her days as a nagging little edge lord despite being somewhat slower and just a smidge more thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had ordered off of the secret menu, and in abundance. Custom orders littered the table as she picked delicately from each and every tray like a queen holding court. Her chubby white fingers wrapped around this stick and that bun, stuffing each morsel into her mouth with the speed and dexterity that one would expect of a woman of her supreme size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Haley gaffed, \u201cNot\u2026 not much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Dani leaned forward, she sounded a pathetic little grunt as she battled against her speedbag belly pinning her down in the booth. Her white little arm wings would quiver ever so slightly as she reached past her own hugeness for another bite of this or that. Honestly, Haley wasn\u2019t quite sure how she\u2019d even gotten in there\u2026 and she\u2019d been present for the whole thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo no boyfriend?\u201d Dani\u2019s round little face barely changed with the inflection, \u201cCool, cool, living the single life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 is this a date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs two, together, eating out\u2026\u201d Haley immediately regretted her phrasing, \u201cIs this, like a date or whatever?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod no, why the fuck would I want to date you?\u201d Dani spat back, \u201cThis isn\u2019t high school Haley, God, not everyone wants to jump your fucking bones, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was, at the same time, relieved and disappointed. Like, one, okay yeah she didn\u2019t really like girls. But on the other hand, it\u2019s the New Twenties, and all girls are at least a little bisexual though. Why was Dani so opposed to the idea of hooking up? Rude. Hurtful. Maybe a little mean, considering the fact that Dani looked like someone left a marshmallow in the microwave too long trying to cook a s\u2019more, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here because\u2026 whatever, okay?\u201d Dani sniffed as she cut into her first of three Greek-style chicken breasts, \u201cMaybe I\u2026 maybe I fucking missed you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwwww~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u2014do you want your fucking cheeseburger or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had never really thought much about why she and Dani had been friends in the first place. Truth be told, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure that the pudgy goth could stand her. Seeing her as big as she as, it almost filled her with a sense of\u2026 it was hard to say. Pride? Maybe that she hadn\u2019t managed to be the only person to blow up so big? Or maybe in the sense that she was still smaller than someone else? Maybe it was happiness\u2014she and Dani had been friends for a while (apparently) and having Courtney constantly dip in and out of her life while her mom was starting to harp on her for getting a job\u2026 it was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Daddy\u2019s had a hard closing time of ten o clock in the evening, which meant that the two of them had a lot of eating to do if they wanted to get out of there in time for Petro and the girls to close up shop. Fortunately, neither of them were exactly familiar with the word restraint. Eating was second nature to the two southern sweethearts as they swelled over the table, happy to talk about old times. Haley caught Dani up on Courtney (and her stupid diet!) and did her best to avoid asking just what the fuck had happened to make Dani so goddamn fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been having a great time, truthfully\u2014a rarity for the two of them, together. Given Dani\u2019s general animosity towards Haley, it was almost surprising that the two of them could sit down together and have a cordial (if large) meal. Haley had been eased into a sense of security (though that may have been the food) and wasn\u2019t at all suspecting just what was going to come out of Dani\u2019s mouth next:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you down to smoke or something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nodded her chubby little head yes. It had been a while since she\u2019d partaken in the Devil\u2019s Lettuce\u2014it had never been her favorite party favor, always opting for the alcohol. But she\u2019d never turned it down before, even if it did mean some more awkward face-timing with Dani.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the time, it had seemed like an odd question for Dani to ask.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cAre you wearing that, or do you want to change?\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nWho asks that before you go smoke with someone? It\u2019s just not a thing that you think to ask when you\u2019re about to spark up a jay. Haley had just written it off as Dani being Dani. Once a gloomy goth girl, always a gloomy goth girl, despite tripling in size since she\u2019d seen her last. Extra weight wasn\u2019t the only thing that Dani had picked up though\u2014she now sported two roommates that had been sitting in the living room when she and Dani walked into the house just off of Heron Circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole house was pretty dank. It was obvious how they\u2019d intended to spend their night. Like Dani, Joni and Michelle had something of an alternative look to them. Where Dani was more dedicated to the Goth Girl Aesthetic \u2122, her roommates were more varied in style and in size. Joni had a more ambitiously neon coloration to her hair and clothing, was short and kind of big, where Michelle was just sort of\u2026 ordinary looking? (Was that the right way to say it?) Neither fat nor especially noteworthy, she was in an old holey band t-shirt and had been mid-rip of the bong when Dani managed to squeeze through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani had led her to the couch, made a half-assed introduction (\u201cthis is Haley, we went to school together, she\u2019s gonna smoke with us.\u201d) and plopped down with a foundation-shaking kaboom next to her. The furniture had to be reinforced. Haley hadn\u2019t put much thought into just how much she weighed until she\u2019d started snapping furniture, but Dani was way bigger than her, and that couch was holding the two of them up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for everyone involved, Haley wasn\u2019t going to be doing much thinking tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little circle that had gathered wasn\u2019t much more sophisticated than anything that Haley had experienced in high school\u2014four girls passing around a bong, plenty of snacks, TV blaring. The only thing that was different was that no one\u2019s parents were going to be home, and the alcohol was totally legal. And, just like back when she was in high school, Haley was a total lightweight\u2014she hadn\u2019t danced with the Devil\u2019s Lettuce in years, and it showed in her stupid red-faced giggling. With the added appeal of alcohol, the bottom on Haley quickly fell out as she lowered herself into the couch for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Haley ate a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already a self-admitted snack hog. Dani commanded the central flow of any and all things edible that were to be passed along the circle\u2019s track, which put Haley in a precariously piggish position of being right next to the greediest girl in the room. Even without being stoned off her big round ass or drunk enough to fail a breathalyzer two yards away, would have definitely pigged out on the primo snack stash that Dani and her roommates brought out for their reunion smoke special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani expertly worked her thigh-thick arms through the rotation of smoke, swig, snack while Haley struggled to keep up. She had the passion, but lacked the stamina. Engrossed in her vices, she barely contributed to the pitiful conversation of faux-deep philosophy that the other three managed. As time slowed down and Haley\u2019s attentions narrowed in on whatever was placed in front of her, Haley could practically feel herself puffing up, and up, and up with every bite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay Haley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2019feelingreattttt\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley pushed a heaping handful of Flaming Hot Cheetos into her mouth as she reclined against the back of the couch, her stomach surging outwards as it eeked out from underneath her shirt. Her fat cheeks full and flush, she turned to the source of the inquisition\u2014Dani, sitting next to her in all of her pale, mountainous glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was swimmy and stupid, filled with the nothingness that came with being high off her ass and drunk as a skunk at the same time. She was giggly and dumb, her chubby cheeks bouncing with laughter as she sunk slowly into Dani\u2019s larger form. Almost like a moon succumbing to orbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been paying particularly good attention when somebody said it, so she wasn\u2019t quite sure as to whether or not it was Joni or Michelle, but somebody said\u2014</span></div></div>",

She handled it on both ends with her chubby hands, giving the incredible girth a small jiggling motion with her chubby fingers. The smallest smile, a rarity for Dani even now, spread across her lips as she stared into Jodie\u2019s camera phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, not like\u2026 sex or anything, but maybe just like make out a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked at Dani, and then at Jodie and Michelle, and then back again at Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meannnnnnn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s head was still more than a little swimmy.

On top of the unfamiliar sensation that came with sleeping over at anyone\u2019s house, Haley had woken up to (in order) a pounding head, a bag of complementary breakfast burritos that were starting to get cold, and the distinct impression that she\u2019d done something a little gross the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dani had shown her the video, it all came back to Haley in a flash of dank, cookie-filled drama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to not everybody wants to jump your bones?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the video again, this time with sober eyes, and Haley was more than a little miffed at the implications of what she\u2019d done. And that the pizza had been cheap, and didn\u2019t sit right on her stomach. And that she had a headache from coughing too much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was just having a bad morning. And she was going to do everything within her power to make sure that Dani had a pretty shitty morning too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t jump your bones, Jesus.\u201d Dani\u2019s fat cheeks bounced slightly as she ate her breakfast burrito, \u201cWe made out a little bit for the camera\u2014don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve never kissed a girl at a party before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s face turned a deeper shade of red as she refused to dignify Dani\u2019s question with a response. Her anger made her sputter stupidly as the words just seemed to fail to come to her in this, the most confusing moment of her life. Waking up in a strange house with two girls who she\u2019d never seen before and a massive pile of goth that Haley could only just barely recognize as her old friend Dani. Add into the fact that she had just\u2026 showed her the video as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Haley pouted, \u201cIs that why you asked me over last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooooo\u2026\u201d Dani clicked her tongue, \u201cI mean\u2026 not like, just that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was your chance to lie about this, you big dumb bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani grumbled and rolled her eyes, set deep in her marshmallow cheeks as she reclined in her seat on the couch. The gothoppotamus seemed even bigger than she did last night, when Haley was all goofed up on the Devil\u2019s Lettuce. She looked like a pile of pillows, crammed into a t-shirt fit for a circus tent. Her fat legs splayed to either side, bean bag stomach settling nicely over the rim of the poor overtaxed sofa\u2019s cushion. Leaning forward to talk with Haley, and making her way through her breakfast, had left her with the slightest pant to her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into the bag that Michelle had brought her (it paired nicely with Haley\u2019s smaller one) and began to unwrap another burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, whatever, if you want to bitch about it okay, but I knew that you\u2019d be a hit.\u201d Dani\u2019s singular flap of neck rippled slightly as she spoke, \u201cSo you can thank me for making you Internet Famous or you can just cunt on out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was about to slap her across the speedbags that she called cheeks, but with some small struggle, Dani\u2019s hand plunged deep into her bra. She handed Haley a crinkled, damp pair of twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s how much money you made me from that video last night.\u201d Dani said in a stern voice, \u201cYou calling me fat and making out with me\u2014rubbing my belly and shit while I eat Oreos? My fans eat it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what the fuck, Dani?\u201d Haley asked, looking at the money <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were talking to me last night about how your mom was all pissed off at you and you needed to get a job, right?\u201d Dani\u2019s tone didn\u2019t soften, though she didn\u2019t seem as angry as she had been when Haley was priming herself to slap her, \u201cWell, in for like a two-minute video you probably made enough money to buy another stupid chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small, deescalating pause between the two of them as Haley began to put two and two together. Holding the damp boob money in her hands, Haley held it a little closer between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 do this?\u201d Haley asked, a hint of judgement in her voice, \u201cAnd you\u2026 get views? You get paid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is it really that hard to believe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley gave a cursory glance towards the mountain of woman piled onto the couch. Pale white, with her makeup still on from the night before, Dani wasn\u2019t without a certain\u2026 charm (was that the right word to describe whatever it was that Dani had going on?) but it was a little hard to believe that someone like her could make money in this line of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This line of work\"\u2014it sounded so seedy to think about it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of people like fat chicks, Haley\u201d Dani said with a little smirk, her hand snaking down to wobble a handful of ivory blubber overhang, \u201cThis is what pays for my share of the rent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to make a point, Dani bit deeply into her breakfast burrito. A soft belch sounded from her lips as she smacked them in satisfaction. Balling up the tinfoil, she reached into the bag and grabbed another. And then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re having money issues, I could help you set up your account.\u201d Dani offered between bites, \u201cYou know, get you started. Make a few guest appearances?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026This is real.\u201d Haley made a face, \u201cThis is a conversation that we\u2019re having, right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fuck off then.\u201d Dani snorted, \u201cBut don\u2019t come crying to me when you hate your lame-ass job\u2026 if you ever fucking find one in Spartanburg-fuckin\u2019-County.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sort of stood there, contemplating just what it was that Dani was saying. Offering. Basically telling her to do. It was true, Haley\u2019s (minimal, basically nonexistant) efforts at finding employment hadn\u2019t yielded anything so far. And her options were a lot more limited than she would have liked to admit. And\u2026 you know, as long as it wasn\u2019t anything gross\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the harm in a little easy money?</span></div></div>",
