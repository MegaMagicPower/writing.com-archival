            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>In the First Age...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as it was known, the world was home to two great races; Mankind and Demonkind. The Demon's were large and stronger than humans, and had monstrous appearances - seeming more like beasts than being. Man was small and weak and fearful of the creatures. In the before-time, Demon's ruled over man, due to their superiority. Mankind was kept as a lower-class of servants or even pets...perhaps even food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Mankind had one trump against the Demons; cleverness. The Demon's had access to the ancient arts of Magic. While Man served their overlords, they were able to learn Magics in secret. They soon found a means to turn the tables on the Demon's and overcome them. <b>The Demon Overlord</b> had kept two ancient artifacts hidden at the heart of his castle; they contained the power to destroy him, and defeat his armies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Goddess Bracelet</b> - a powerful jeweled band containing the powers of the<b> Unnamed Goddess</b>; the Mother of Man.<br>\r\nand...<br>\r\n<b>The Heart of Blaze</b> - a flame trapped in a lantern, containing the spirit of the <b>Red Blaze</b>; the Father of Demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to legend, the two beings were believed to have been enemies who wished their creations to rule the world. During their final battle, which gave-way to the Demon's rule, the Red Blaze destroyed both the Goddess and himself in a suicide attack. The King of the Demons took the two artifacts and hid them away, keeping them together so that their powers would never be used to harm the Demon's rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA band of cunning humans broke into the Tower and took the two artifacts. Mankind was able to use the Magic of the Bracelet to empower their mortal weapons to strike at the Demon's castle. Unfortunately, such a disturbance gave way to <b>The Destroyers</b>; the powerful stone monsters buried in the earth. They began a genocidal campaign to destroy both Mankind and Demonkind as a means of permanently ending the conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess Bracelet was the best defense against the Destroyers; but its power alone was not strong enough. The Demon King, in his last act, tried to steal back the Heart of Blaze. It was believed by the Human Resistance that the Blaze was a weapon used to defeat the Goddess Bracelet's powers. To prevent it from falling into the Demon's hands, the Lantern was smashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then in a surprising development, the flames from the lantern spread out setting everything ablaze, yet sparing both Man and Demon in its wave. The flames from the blaze spread out across the entire world and killed all the Destroyers in its path, setting an end to their genocide. It was the Red Blaze himself, still alive for the moment. The Blaze had saved the last remaining Humans and Demons and claimed that neither was meant to rule or interact with each other, before blazing out into a wisp of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of retaining peace, it was decided that the last of the Humans and Demons would separate, leaving each other to their devices. The world was divided; half going to the Humans and the other half going to the Demons. And so gave rise to the Human Realm and the Ghoul Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demons and Ghouls kept to themselves for many years; having adopted a rather civilized community from their human neighbors. The barbarism and cruelty that once defined them had phased away. Meanwhile, the humans that stole the Goddess Bracelet had formed a new Royal Family and ruled the Human Realm, keeping said bracelet as a family heirloom and symbol of Divine Rite. And over the course of several centuries, neither realm interacted and the knowledge of the others' existence, fell into obscurity. They became known simply as fairy tales or fables; cautionary tales for parents to tell their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time...there was Peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In the Second Age...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Peace came to an end with the rise of the <b>Demon Prince Astaroth.</b> His family rose to power during <b>The Civil War</b>, which brought an end to the First Age. With his force and influence, he began a campaign to invade the Human Realm and regain dominion over the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding by his side, was his trusted Lieutenant; <b>Firebrand, a Red Arremer Gargoyle</b> who became a great warrior during the First Age. Firebrand was one of the strongest Gargoyles in the Demon Realm and was always looking for a challenge to test his skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstaroth's plan would be to break the will of Man, by kidnapping <b>Princess Prin-Prin</b>, the heir of the Royal Family of the Human realm. He spirited her away to the Ghoul Realm, announcing to all Mankind that the Demons were still around, and they were here to stay. However, before Astaroth could begin his invasion plans for the Human Realm, a lone brave Knight rose up to appose him.<br>\r\n<b>Arthur</b> - the Princess' personal Guard. During his quest to rescue the Princess, Arthur was told to find <b>Excalibur</b> - a powerful Sword from the Human Rebellion of the First Age. Blessed with the Goddess' Magic, the Sword would cut-down every Demon and Ghoul who stood in Arthur's way. (Though Arthur admit, he preferred his trusted knife.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirebrand, the Red Arremer, became fascinated with Arthur; challenging him to duels at various points throughout his adventures. Firebrand seemed obsessed with defeating Arthur...but not for the sake of killing him. In fact, the Arremer spared Arthur's life during their latest confrontation, claiming he saw Arthur as a worthy opponent. The two took on a strange relationship; rather than enemies, they came to be more or less rivals in some way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur defeated Astaroth rescued the Princess, announcing his love for her. The two returned to the Human Realm. From that cursed day, Arthur kept a close watch on the Princess, as well as the dark clouds looming over the lands of the Ghoul Realm. The Second Age had only just begun, and this war was far from over...<br>\r\nAstaroth would make good on his promise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Powers of Belief...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conflict of the Second Age began, the two civilizations ran their course. Although knowledge of the other had long since fallen into Myth, traces of such conflict resounded throughout their belief structures. From these beliefs, two prophesies emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Human Realm Prophesy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There shall come a great darkness from the East that shall spread to the land of the West. The Flame will come, not knowing the force he disturbs. The one to challenge the Darkness shall emerge, and the Flame will note him as his equal. The Hero will be drawn to Excalibur - who shall prove his right to rule as Divine. With blade in hand, he shall emerge as the Rightful King, and shall purge the Evil from both lands, and finally achieve Peace.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prophesy refers to Arthur, having found Excalibur and proving himself the new King of the Human Realm. It was believed that Arthur will destroy the entire Ghoul Realm and that humans will finally rule in Peaceful Dominion over the entire planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Ghoul Realm Prophesy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Father of All, who sacrificed himself to save Both Man and Demon will return. When the Land of Ghouls falls under a Tyrant's Rule, he shall return in living flesh and stone. As a mortal warrior, he will have powers above his kin and shall liberate the Land from evil's grasp. He shall make the Ghoul Realm great once again, and shall challenge the power of those who oppress and destroy us. And when Evil spreads across the entire world, he shall join with his long lost love, and shall attain a lasting Peace.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was believed that the Red Blaze would one day reincarnate into a living form. He would rise to power by liberating the Ghoul Realm from a Tyranny. But then would seek to spread his evil influence upon the entire world. Together with the Demon he loved, the two would breed and bring on an age of complete darkness, reigning Peace for the Demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two factions of Man and Demon hold these two prophesies sacred. Yet neither side has been made aware of the others'. It is believed that the two prophesies would contradict; that the fulfilling of one, meant the destruction of the other. And so both sides fuel their desires to see their promised futures come to pass, and the war continues...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Makai was the Kingdom of the Ghoul Realm</b>; for the thousands of generations that came, the Kingdom was ruled by the Royal Family of Demons. Prince Astaroth was the current ruling regent for the longest time until he began his campaign to attack the Human Realm. Ever since he had been defeated by Arthur, seven years earlier, his remains had been sealed in the royal crypt of Roth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outlying lands of Makai, lay <b>the village of Etruria</b>. On the mountains overlooking the village, there was a statue of a Red Arremer, perched upon the edge of the cliff. Beneath the statue's clawed foot, lay a single candle. It was the <b>Eternal Candle</b>, a personal possession of an important Etrurian resident. Though it was believed the candle was meant to burn for Eternity, it was merely bound to it's previous owner's lifespan. And the tiny flame had just blown out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trails of smoke began to rise up to the statue's face. Suddenly the statue began trembling and breaking, until it suddenly shattered, revealing crimson skin underneath. With a loud roar, the creature underneath stood up and shook the layer of rock away. It was a Red Arremer Gargoyle, having awakened from his stone-laden slumbers. He stretched his arms and yawned. He looked down and saw the Candle, one of his most prized possessions, had burned out. But before he could contemplate it for long, he soon realized he was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firebrand,\" a voice called to him. He slowly turned around to meet the voice. He soon saw a black Cockatrice perched on a stone nearby. The Cockatrices were used as messengers for the Royal Family. Firebrand knew this had to be good. \"We have been looking for you, for some time now...Nearly four years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to lay low these days,\" Firebrand answered. \"There's nothing better to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We bring you bad tidings, I am afraid,\" the Cockatrice told him. \"Our ruler, <b>King Lucifer</b> has passed; four years dead. Murdered by the human...Sir Arthur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirebrand took pause. He slowly turned away and bowed his head in sorrow. Lucifer was one of his friends. They were once rivals from Etruria back before the Civil War. Etruria was lorded over by <b>Duke Morok</b>; but when the Civil War began, Morok was killed. Firebrand and Lucifer joined forces to fight back the power of the Dark Light. And when the war was ended, Lucifer became the new Lord of Etruria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was always so ambitious and power-hungry, that Firebrand often referred to him as \"<b>Leviathan - the Mouth of Hell</b>.\" But he was incredibly crafty and a powerful demon at that. When Astaroth made his bid for the Human Realm and failed, Lucifer appeared at the Makai capital and took over. He became the New King of the Ghoul Realm. Unfortunately for him, Firebrand was loyal to the true royal family and could not serve him; nor would he oppose him. He retreated into hibernation to avoid conflict with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that you and he were close friends, before,\" the Cockatrice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I knew him by his real name. I knew him as <b>Rushifell</b>; he took the name of the Devil from that silly religion of the Human Realm in order to scare small children,\" Firebrand said. He reached down and picked up the candle. \"He gave me this Candle - his treasure - as a gift...I'm surprised it's burned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also why we've come,\" the Cockatrice said. \"His wife, Queen Verona has just passed as well; her last request was that we go out and find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it...She as well as Rushifell poured their own magics into the candle...It's finally flamed out with her death,\" Firebrand said. \"So...tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucifer's rise to power predicated on his design to continue Astaroth's work,\" the messenger told him. \"He invaded the Human Realm; first by stealing all of the souls from the Human's Kingdom, including Princess Prin-Prin's. But Arthur came for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excalibur wouldn't stand a chance against Reshifell...he was a fool, but he was as cautious as he was power-mad,\" Firebrand said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something changed,\" the Cockatrice told him. \"The sword could not fell him as you said, but Arthur was able to draw on the dark powers of the realm and created an energy blast to kill Lucifer with his own madness; the Psycho Cannon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Powers,\" Firebrand scoffed. \"Arthur would never again allow something so foolish to corrupt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upon Lucifer's death, he vowed that one day he would reincarnate, and be back with a vengeance,\" the Messenger told him. \"It came to be well-known that Lucifer was the reincarnation of the Red Blaze; destined to bring the Ghoul Realm to its Glory. So it's only a matter of time until he returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P'feh,\" Firebrand scoffed again. \"Rushifell wasn't the Red Blaze...He and I have both known that to not be true...for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well regardless; ever since that day, Arthur has been gone from the Kingdom. He is trying to search the world and discover a magic powerful enough to put an end to all demons once and for all. Our intelligence inside the Human Realm have reported that he is on his way back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur...\" Firebrand said as he glared down over Etruria. He was quietly stroking his black goatee, contemplating. He lifted his head. \"Then the time has come.\" Firebrand turned to the messenger. \"Go out and find Phalanx and tell him to meet me at the Crypt of Roth. Tell him that our Master is due for a second-act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir,\" the Cockatrice said as it began flapping its wings. It flew off into the distance, leaving Firebrand alone. The Red Arremer then spread his own blue wings and leaped off the cliff, gliding down to Etruria. He flew to the Duke's Mansion where Morok and Rushifell had lived before. It was his house now; in Lucifer's absence, Firebrand was made the new Lord of Etruria. He entered his mansion thinking nothing for the vast luxury and possessions that belonged to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled to the throne at the center of the hall and stopped before the velvet seat. He reached up and grabbed the side of the back of the seat and pulled it away from the wall. He tossed the throne aside and found a metal door behind it. He lifted up his clawed hand and dragged his claws in the four groves on the door. This opened a magic lock, causing the door to open. When the door opened, there was a small box-groove behind it. In the center of the space was a small pedestal that held a glowing green sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirebrand reached inside and removed it from its perch and held it before his hand.<br>\r\n\"The time has come, my Prince,\" Firebrand said. \"The Roth Family will be whole, once again...One way or another.\"<br>\r\nAs Firebrand looked into the glowing green orb, a bearded demonic face appeared for a moment, whispering something before vanishing yet again. Firebrand grinned seeing it. He turned away and left the mansion, ready to enact his plan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>The Kingdom of Erianna</b> was the Kingdom of the Human Realm; ruled by <b>King Thaddeus</b>, the father of Princess Prin-Prin. For seven years past, his reign was an unsteady one, ever since the existence of the Ghoul Realm became known again. People were afraid to leave their houses. Some refused to have their lost ones buried in cemeteries, because, \"That's where the Ghouls live.\" And the Kingdom was under constant threat of being taken over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kingdom's best defense was their greatest knight, Sir Arthur. Ever since he'd found Excalibur as a young man, he had twice defended the Kingdom from the Demon Invasion. But King Thaddeus was wary of how the heroic young man favored his own daughter, the Princess. She was his only heir, and the sanctity of their blood was sacred. Needless to say, the joy Sir Arthur kept in his daughter's company made the King suspicious. And what's worse...Arthur was returning to Erianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Prin-Prin was standing at the balcony of her tower. She stood in her traditional white dress and jewels. She was a vision of beauty, and her long blue hair was drawn back with a royal, jeweled, tiara. She looked out upon the rolling green hills and trees that surrounded the city from her castle home. Erianna was a paradise under a bright yellow sun and blue skies. Not at all like the Ghoul Realm; gray skies and darkness, mud and swamp water...coldness and decay. In her time captured by Astaroth, she had seen and experienced all of these things there. And she was shocked to learn that the demons preferred it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrin-Prin suddenly spotted a group of horses appear on the dirt road over one of the hills on the horizon. The group of riders had stopped for a moment to look upon the castle in the distance. Suddenly a single white horse broke from the group and began galloping toward the castle. Seeing it come, Prin-Prin smiled, knowing its rider could be only one person. She turned and began running for the stairs, passing by her father, who had been standing behind her, also observing the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Thaddeus was a tall man of noble bearing. He had dark gray hair, and a trim white beard. He wore royal robes and a golden crown upon his head. He stood there, gripping his golden scepter. He too knew that the lone rider, so anxious to return to the Kingdom could only be one man...Sir Arthur. He'd only hoped that his return meant that he had found the means to destroying the Ghoul Realm once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white horse galloped into the town square. Seeing its rider pass by them, several of the townspeople cheered. The horse came to a stop just outside the drawbridge leading to the castle. The rider dismounted; he was a young man with a brown beard. He wore shiny, steel armor, and carried a sheathed long-sword on his belt. This was Arthur, and his sword was Excalibur. He took a deep breath, seeing the castle town for the first time in four years. \"It is good to be home,\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting another moment, he rushed across the bridge and into the castle square. The Guards, recognizing him, simply nodded their heads allowing him to pass. Arthur rushed up the stairs to the castle and immediately entered with no hesitation. As soon as he entered, he saw his beloved Princess Prin-Prin race around the corner. She was a sight for sore eyes. She spotted him as well, and smiled at him; she looked as if he'd taken her breath away. She was about to rush over to him, when she heard her father clearing his throat behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Arthur!\" King Thaddeus announced, entering the chamber and spotting the young knight. Seeing the King, Arthur's own enthusiasm died, and it was clear that Prin-Prin took on a more behaved demeanor to as not upset her father. \"It has been many years,\" the King said approaching him. \"It is good to see you again, my trusted friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I vowed I would return before my beard grew too long, your Majesty,\" Arthur said going down on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust that your mission was successful,\" the King said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur began to look a bit ashamed. However, another voice joined the conversation as someone else entered the room. \"There is an unfortunate news, regarding our quest, oh King,\" an older voice said. Arthur saw that his party had finally caught up with him, and his trusted companion, <b>Merlin</b> had spoken up. Merlin was a Wizard who kept the knowledge of the Ancient Magics of the world. It was he who originally prophesied that Excalibur would be found. He befriended Arthur on that day, and had advised him throughout each of Arthur's journeys. He entered the chamber with a company of three other knights. He wore a long green robe and hood, carried a brown wooden staff, and sported a white beard, so long, it nearly reached the floor. When Merlin approached Arthur, he gestured that Arthur hand over Excalibur. Without much goading, Arthur unstrapped his sword and passed it to the Wizard.<br>\r\n\"We searched the four corners of the Human Realm, but found no means to increase Excalibur's power to combat the forces of the Ghoul Realm,\" Merlin said. \"Our only hope, is to recover the sacred artifact from the War of the First Age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But alas, that artifact has long since been lost to us,\" Thaddeus said. \"We no longer know what this weapon was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing we know for certain, my King,\" Merlin continued. \"Is that the Artifact will glow in the presence of Evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, there hasn't been any Ghoul activity for the past four years,\" Thaddeus added. \"But the people are becoming more fearful every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the King monologued, Merlin noticed that Arthur and Prin-Prin were glancing at each other, and both had an air of impatience. Merlin rolled his eyes before clubbing the back of Arthur's head with his staff. Fortunately the King hadn't noticed. Merlin soon approached the King's side. \"My liege; allow us to continue this conversation in private. My companions are weary from their travels and require rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" the King said allowing Merlin to lead him to the next room. The other knights were soon led by the royal servants out of the hall so that they could get some refreshments. As they were lead out, Arthur fell behind. He spotted the Princess slipping out of the main chamber to an adjacent hall. Once he was sure the other Knights didn't notice his absence, he slipped away himself, following the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon met her standing by a decorative coat of arms in the adjacent hall. He rushed toward her, taking off his helmet and dropping it to the floor. The two then embraced and kissed each other passionately.<br>\r\n\"Oh Arthur,\" the Princess moaned as she broke from his lips and began to kiss his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Princess,\" he said back to her. \"I have missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feared that the Ghouls had overcame you while you were gone,\" Prin-Prin said between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright,\" he said pulling away from her and looking into her eyes. \"I thought about you, every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As did I,\" he said going in for another kiss. However, there was a sound from off down the hallway, which gave Prin-Prin alarm. She tried cowering against the wall, to hide, before realizing it was nothing. Meanwhile, Arthur tried to kiss her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No; that's enough,\" Prin-Prin said. \"Not here; we could be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need more,\" Arthur said. \"I don't care if they find out that we are together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, don't say that!\" Prin-Prin said with a worried tone. \"You know as well as I why we chose this. My father is paranoid with jealousy. Ever since the prophesy revealed that you will one day succeed the throne from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father merely does not want wish for his kingdom to be inherited by some common knight,\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still Arthur,\" Prin-Prin began. \"We're forbidden to be together. The preservation of the sanctity of the royal line predicated that I must marry a Nobleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Arthur asked. \"How long will we keep this secret? Will we just stay in the shadows until your father passes? We can't live like that. She can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh,\" Prin-Prin hushed him. \"We have to be patient. If the Prophesy is to be believed then the Goddess's will shall be done. The time will come.\" Arthur looked disappointed. Prin-Prin laid a hand on his cheek. \"Cheer up...You're home after all these years. And tonight, my father is honoring your return with a grand celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Arthur said. \"Until the celebration tonight...I will go and visit my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not always permitted to,\" Prin-Prin said. \"But I can sometimes find the time to go and visit myself. They take good care of -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" Arthur said. \"I can hardly wait.\" Arthur then picked up his helmet and turned to leave the castle.</span></div></div>",

I would not be surprised at all if he became a tyrant when he could come of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then there was Irenasa Tokval, the beautiful princess of Erede.  Irenasa had grey-black skin and bright red runes that covered most of her body. In contrast to Henry, her nose was celestial. Irenasa was an Itrax demon, so she had four eyes, two where a human's eyes would normally be and two above them. Each of her eyes were as white as freshly fallen snow, with a scarlet red ridge on her outer sclera. The demon princess was, like Henry, an excellent politician, but bigoted and self-righteous individual. Her philosophy was that she could do whatever she pleased, regardless of how it may harm others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two met, it must have seemed like a match made in Heaven. It was a diplomatic mission. The Monarchs of our two kingdoms came together with their families to end any problems or concerns made in our newly-created peace treaty. Henry and Irenasa sat directly apart from one another, bored out of their minds. That is, until, they saw each other. I can still remember Prince Henry blushing as he looked onto her stone-colored skin. Irenasa's runes glowed in response, her version of blushing. The two introduced themselves after the meeting and began to court each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I began to grow fond of the two, as I helped them sneak out of the palace whenever they wanted to disguise themselves as commoners and have some privacy. When they visited the commoners, they were shocked at the suffering of their problems. Sometimes, on moon-lite nights, the two bluebloods would talk of the changes they planned for their kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was overjoyed; the two brought out the best in each other. Moreover, they knew the problems of the people. There may have been hope for our kingdoms yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Until, it happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the war, the world is in chaos as the two kingdoms fight desperately for survival -- the human race and the demon race. The humans that are unable to fight fled and search for safety during the battle. The sunset looked like it had been stained by blood as splattered blood kept going as the two races fight to the death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human kingdom almost looked like a pool of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud screams echoed, loud laughs trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices of the human women were loud as they were dragged to different places and got raped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is too brutal. The Demon did not care for their main objective which to over rule. They all tried their best to show that they were powerful. The difference between the two races is too obvious. The demons were far more stronger possessing unknown powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Geez these guys are getting ahead of themselves.' a man with white hair said as he looked around him. He swung his sword to remove the excess blood on it. He is part of the demon race and one of the most powerful at that. He wore white sash from his right shoulder to his waist and a short black shorts, a belt like around his waist to hold his bastard sword. He seemed to be one of the few that kept his head high and didn't sway away from the objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon feeling that something had bumped to him turned around, he didn't saw anyone until he looked down; a small person which stood behind him was reflected through his green eyes; he followed the small thin arms of the child and realized that he had been stabbed him from the back with a small dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA child in ragged clothes with short raven messy hair and different colored eyes glares at the white haired demon without fear, the eyes that would kill if it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;'Blue and golden eyes'&lt;/i&gt; the demon thought as he stared at the child. He knew immediately that the child is of a scion of a human and demon which doesn't always happen, especially in the middle of the war of the two races. He knew immediately that the child grew in the care of the human race since he knows that no demon would attempt to stab him.<br>\r\nThe demon pushed away the child. He removed the dagger pierced inside his body that didn't seem to have injured him the least. He looked at the dagger and then analyzed it. <br>\r\nThe dagger is engraved with lots of stones. The dagger looked more like a decoration rather than a weapon. <br>\r\nHe immediately figured that the dagger is from a noble family of the demon race. He didn't shake the feeling that the child might have been someone that a noble demon conceived with a human that might have been abandoned, or so he wants to believe since it isn't natural that a child living with the human race would come to possess a dagger of a demon noble.<br>\r\nHe looked at the child, seated on the ground after he pushed the child ; the child reflected in his eyes without fear glaring back at him.</span></div></div>",
