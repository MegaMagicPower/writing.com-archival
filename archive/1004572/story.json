She shyly replied with a thanks. Ben was getting thirsty and wanted some water, the water cooler was in the room but for him it would be like crossing a city. Ben then started up his jet pack except something went wrong and his jet pack went spiraling out of control with him hanging on directly towards Hensley. She raised her hand up to block him but he was going to fast and smacked right into her luscious red lips. Smearing her lip stick across his body he had become painted in it. His jet pack compacted him deep in her lips almost like it was trying to get him in her mouth an then it suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slowly fell just as Hensley's hand came to grab him but it was going the wrong way and Ben fell right in between her exposed cleavage sinking deep into its confines with a blink of an eye falling towards its center. Jack merely laughed at the chaos he just made for poor little Ben but Jack was only jealous that should be him trapped in two giant tits.\"Oh no Ben. Where did he go is he on the floor?\" She then got on her hands and knees looking around on the floor giving Jack a nice view of her giant ass. After a couple minutes of searching the floor she stood up again and looked on the table and in doing so saw Ben's limp arm poking out from between her chest.\"That's where you went cheeky boy.\" She pulled him out and noticed he wasn't moving. She had suffocated little Ben with her tits and didn't even realize it. She started to panic while Jack made jokes and snarky comments. Using her titanic lips she pretty much enveloped Ben's entire head breathing life into him as well as using her pinky to pump his heart. Ben then woke up coughing and sputtering. \"I bet that was the best and worst motorboat you've ever had kid.\" Jack said in a horribly sarcastic tone while Hensley was soft and kind. \"I am so sorry Ben, I should have known that you feel down... there? Do you need anything?\" Ben just shook his head and stared at the boobs that almost ended him and deep down he wanted to do it again. Then they continued there brainstorming eventually deciding on a plan.          </span></div></div>",

A little time passes and you open your eyes again and look up and you see a fair amount of regret/intrigue played in those blue eyes. \"Apologies Agent Sterling. My name is Karl Anderson I'm a double agent posted to infiltrate this organisation from our liverpool branch. Once I realised they were going to infiltrait our london H.Q they assured me you'd be able to handle the situation and just to act as a normal double agent. Once you were shrunk however and needed up in the heads hand I had to take initiative into my own hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back relieved and exhausted as he continued to tell you both about the terror organisation known as The Crushing Fist. a group who ebtierly belive they should rule the world and select members from all walks of life but always value dominance and power above all else. The gigantic blondes features hardened at that. \"Without blowing my own horn to much. I'm a bit of a physical specimen. Tall, blonde muscled guy easily fits the bill so it wasn't that hard becoming a hired muscle of the fist and working my way up. Sadly you more than anything, complicate my mission Mr Sterling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused at that and Karl explains that originally you were given to Jahan and he was going to crush you under his feet in a display of domanince, appeasing the higher ups and possibly gaining rank for his ruthlessness. You shudder at the thought of that end, as he continues explaining that he is going to have to have sex with Hensley as it is what the higher up want to see as she was given to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over at Hensley and she has a sombre tone. \"Sadly it's the only way. We have to keep up the ruse and I have been promised to him as his once the show is done. Georgeson can get further up then closer to the leader and take them down, as well as extracting both of us to safety.\" You nod not happy about it but understand that it is the only way to ensure we all survive. With that your mind flashes. \"Agent Georgeson?\" you squeak up to him. \" Why do I complicate your mission the most?\" you ask slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Georgeson takes a deep breath and looks down at you with sympathy. \"As you recall Jahan wanted to crush you under his bare feet. Appeasing the higher ups and gaining rank through dominance. he murmurs. \"Jack it was the only way to save your life ... I challenged his claim and told them that I would dominate you more as a pet than he would out right killing you... they want to see you servicing me, whilst Hensley is as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words just hung in the air like a bad smell. you were completely shell shocked by Agent Georgeson's plan. you look up at him and Hensley. who you can believe is going along with this, but you must think long term and survival and if this new plan, however gross it maybe will work and he can get close to the leader and take the group out, then it's worth it in the long run right?. You ponder the decision. for a very long time and eventually both Hensley and Georgeson tell you that it's up to you, but the plan will fail without your co operation.</span></div></div>",

Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou walk around his desk, a mere six or seven steps only to stop again at what was always thought to be the closet door.  Control graciously opens the door to the majestic wonder that is but an ordinary closet!  A secret door inside perhaps, or possibly a hidden safe, even an invisible safe, but this plain, near empty rectangle in space cannot hold the secret to this mission!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tControl reaches in and takes out a deep blue tie, dull but not without charm, \"Wear this.\" You hesitate, skepticism knotting your throat and eyebrows, but eventually give in to curiosity, swapping ties.  Control motions for Miss Hensley to join you both.  As you slide the tie securely around your collar, Control grins, \"Good, good Mr. Sterling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It looks nice?\" you ask Control, exciting another quiet laugh from your feminine guest. \"So this is the device. A plain and ordinary tie. Simple and clean. How does it work? I have to say, this is even now the most bizarre mission you have ever assigned me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I never assigned any mission to you Sterling.\" Control mumbles with a smile, \"you took this upon yourself.\" You roll your eyes at his jest, then he explains more. \"Alright. You need to know this Sterling, and remember it! If you have one fault, it's that you always forget the little details at the worst moments!\" Enough lecturing, you press him to finish the briefing. \"As long as the tie is around your neck, two swift tugs on it will activate the device to shrink you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Two tugs to shrink,\" you repeat, then smiling, \"I still cannot believe I am doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And when you're that one inch tall agent, Agent Sterling, the same two tugs will restore you to normal. I hope you can remember that Sterling.\" Control takes his place of honor in his high-backed chair and concludes, \"Now you and Miss Hensley should be off to complete this phase of the mission. You will receive a package on your way out with other pertinent information you will need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou and Miss Hensley kindly lock elbows and elegantly leave Control's office.</span></div></div>",

You held on for dear life as your stomach flew to your throat. The capsule flew with breakneck speed out of her cavernous nostril, the lights on the outer hull illuminating the pink tunnel whipping pass. The light at the end of the tunnel grew brighter and brighter till the capsule was sailing out into the blinding sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed your eyes shut against the bright light as the capsule flew blindly out of Miss Hensley's nose. Opening your eyes, you tried to steer the capsule but your microscopic size made it impossible to control it in the gale force winds driving you forward. Miss Hensley's figure faded away in the background as her sneeze propelled you far away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shape loomed ahead of you, growing bigger and bigger till it completely encompassed your entire line of sight. Again, you tried to steer the capsule away but it was useless as you shot straight towards the looming mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule crashed into the mass with a wet <i>SPLAT</i>, skimming across the ground with breakneck speed. You held on tight as the capsule slowly lost its momentum and came to a grinding halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you carefully got out of the capsule wincing from the bump on your head. Stepping out, you nearly slipped on your ass from the wetness on the floor. Holding onto the capsule, you stood and surveyed the strange landscape around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite. That's the only way you could describe your surroundings. The landscape was completely white as far as your eye could see, dipping down at the edges and disappearing entirely in the distance. Not to mention the entire landscape was lined with red.....rivers and covered in a sticky slime that had almost made you slip earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire ground shook and something was coming straight for you over the horizon. You screamed as a pale wall came zooming over the white landscape and you twisted around to see another pale wall coming for behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped to the floor prone as the two walls slammed together with a deafening <i>BOOM</i> then left the same way they came and disappeared just a quickly as they arrived. Lifting your  head, you wondered how truly tiny you were and where the hell you landed to arrive at such a bizarre landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling back to the capsule, you pulled yourself inside and tried to radio Miss Hensley. \"Miss Hensley come in. Come in Miss Hensley. Can you hear me over?\" You listened for a response but all you got was static. You tried again, \"Miss Hensley, I was launched early. Repeat, I was launched early and am now in a unknown area. Can anyone hear me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic. You dropped the receiver and leaned back in defeat. \"Great,\" you muttered, \"just great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble shook the landscape and the two colossus walls slammed together again above you with a resounding boom. You were worried that the capsule would be smushed but you were too small and the walls slid harmlessly over the capsule. You heaved a sigh of relief then started up the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine started without a hitch, \"the only thing that works,\" you muttered then you twisted the control gyro and the entire capsule rolled into action. You rolled easily across the smooth, white landscape while the two walls slammed above you. Up ahead, you noticed the first trace of color since landing here in the distance and you pushed the capsule to go faster. As you drew closer, the color became clearer as a shade of deep blue and made you believe that you were heading for a deep lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to stop, you left the capsule and stood at the edge of the deep blue pool. It suddenly shifted, throwing you onto your ass as the blue pool rolled beneath you. You rolled with it till you ended up lying above a black, bottomless abyss. You recoiled as it shifted away from you. It suddenly hit you as to where you were right then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a eye. I'm on someone's EYE.\" This was far beyond being planted on a person as you were literally sitting on their line of sight. It was completely ridiculous that you were so close yet the person couldn't even see or feel you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what the hell am I suppose to do now. I have no backup, no communication, and no idea if I'm even on the right person. This mission is already a disaster, so what am I suppose to do?\" </span></div></div>",

Control couldn't be contacted and Miss Hensley would be will out of range by now so that left the only option to continue with the mission. You will have to improvise from now on and make the best of what you have on hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying back to the capsule with eyelids slamming together above you was nerve-racking, not to mention slipping and sliding on the milky sea beneath your feet. You sigh in relief now that your back in the cockpit but you need to check the situation with the capsule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuel tank was good for about a day, but that wasn't very much in long run as your microscopic size severely limited the amount of ground you can cover. That was the main issue, so continuing the mission without support from Miss Hensley or Control was going to be difficult. After checking the fuel tank, you wondered what other tricks this capsule had up its sleeve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see. Engine condition, Nominal. Life support, Nominal. Power supply, will last along with the fuel supply.\" You ran a check over the condition of the capsule and leaned back satisfied. \"Now, what else does this thing do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapons system was limited to a few lasers for micro precision cutting, so nothing of use to defend against your host. Next, the communication system which wasn't worth crap at this size, but the surveillance system drew your attention. The surveillance system operated using millions of micro-cameras on the outer hull that recorded, combined, and reconstructed each individual image into a single whole to give you the full picture of the outside world despite your size, similar to how a fly sees. Not to mention, the sound system translated each individual sound wave to make into coherent conversation instead of deafening shockwaves. This was how you were going to extract information from Gamell once planted on his daughter. There were also six, small spindly legs that unfolded from the capsule to improve stability and help the capsule cross rough terrain. Then there was the shocker that was supposed to be used to make Miss Hensley sneeze but it severely drained the power. Lastly, was the thin, almost microscopic, threads that the capsule produced though you didn't understand what there use was yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after going over the capsule's gimmicks you decided to get your bearing and find out who you were on. Grabbing the gyro, you had the capsule unfold one of its six legs then you waited. It didn't take long as the eyelid came flying over the eye like a flat, pink cliff. The eyelids slammed together above and when the eyelid was receding did you jab the spindly leg into the underside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held on as the eyelid dragged the capsule across the eye with incredible speed. Speeding over the iris, you passed over the pupil which appeared as a black, bottomless abyss that stared back at you. You heaved a sigh of relief when you crossed the pupil and were speeding across the deep blue iris again. The eyelid quickly dragged you over the remaining vast expanse of the eye in milliseconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed the leg when the eyelid settled back in its resting position and you rolled the capsule underneath the eyelid. It was slow going towards the back of the eye as the eye itself was in constant motion, disorienting you and making it difficult to keep your bearing and your lunch. The capsule's surveillance system helped keep the capsule on track as it trudged through the sticky tears filled with micro filth and the vertiginous movement of the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour destination was this person's brain and the only way to get there was through a small opening in the eye socket right behind the eye. You didn't know the name for it, but it was the only was to get inside with out pulling out the lasers. The capsule dutifully made it to the opening without a problem and headed right for the optic nerve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legs had another function other than just keeping you in place as they were able to directly receive and transmit electrical signals. So, by connecting to the optic nerve, you'll be able to see the outside world through this person's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosition the capsule right over the optic nerve, you jabbed two legs into it then the monitor began to change as the surveillance system collected and reconstructed the image. Static turned into a clear picture and you saw the world through another's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you see?</span></div></div>",

Your hostess was drop dead gorgeous with deep blue eyes, long hair that was almost as blue as her eyes and worked into two braids that reach down her back, a flawless face, and dressed in a... maid's outfit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, your hostess was wearing a traditional black and white French maid outfit with the front resembling a apron that covered her down to her relatively short skirt with thigh-length leggings hugging her plump legs. The thing that drew your attention the most was her enormous rack; despite the outfit showing almost no cleavage, her chest was the most prominent asset as your eyes rested on her enormous tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? What the hell do you have eat to get them that big?\" You stammered. It was indeed a good question as the woman reflected in the mirror was of shorter stature, almost five-foot nothing but her breasts were plump and huge almost ripping the fabric apart. You watch transfixed as every single motion had the twin peaks jiggling uncontrollably, and you ogled your hostess's awesome rack in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view suddenly changed as your hostess started moving. It was bizarre to watch as the maid's line of sight shifted, taking in the details of the pristine bathroom she was in before leaving and entering a extravagant hallway. You didn't know who this maid worked for, but they were really loaded all the way to the bone. You continued to observe through the maid's eyes as she did duties that you would expect. You watched this with boredom, only grinning when the maid was looking down and you ogled her enormous rack as she worked. This continued on for a couple of hours until her eyes suddenly jerked and she laid eyes on the one person you weren't expecting to see. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was Gamell. The man you were sent to observe and spy on was standing right before you... no, standing right in front of the maid you were residing in. His mouth moved, but you weren't able to lip-read and hadn't yet installed an audio probe. Still, you watched and recorded the interaction as Gamell gave instruction to the maid you were inhabiting until his stony face cracked a smile. You couldn't see your hostess's reaction but they obviously knew each other and had a good relationship as the maid closed her eyes and bowed. When she opened them, Gamell was gone and you missed a good opportunity to get some info. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, stupid, stupid.\" you berated yourself. This was why you were shrunk for in the first place and you missed your first chance already. Sure, it had been a surprise to see Gamell but you were trained to handle and react to surprises. You were a secret agent god-dammit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to disconnect from her optical nerve but the maid was heading right for a car outside. Your intuition was saying wait, even though you wanted to set up a probe in her ear, but you were trained to follow your instinct, so you waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid hopped into a fiery red mustang and roared out of the mansion's courtyard at breakneck speeds. You were hanging onto the edge of your seat, screaming as the maid took too sharp turns, barrelled her way through heavy traffic, and basically scared the living shit out of you at the reckless drive you were forced to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended as she finally slowed down and pulled into a school parking lot. You had to pry your fingers from the death-grip they had on the command chair before you could check the control console. \"That was fucking horrible.\" You muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time seeing such driving, not to mention seeing through the eyes of the one driving. The maid pulled up to the front of the high school just the last bell rang, you assume as hoards of teenagers come strolling out of the school. The maid's eyes quickly glanced over the horde till she zeroed in on a young woman heading straight for the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Stephanie Gamell,\" you muttered. That would be the most obviously conclusion as she had similar features to Gamell but must have inherited more of her looks from her mother's side. She smiled as she spotted you (the maid) and quickened her pace towards the car. A guy suddenly appeared out of nowhere and put his arms over Stephanie. If you weren't looking through the maid's eyes, even your trained eyes wouldn't have tracked the maid's lightning fast reflexes as she had pulled a Colt .45 from somewhere in the mustang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shook off the young man off and gave him a quick jab to the ribs. He backed off Stephanie quick, holding his injured side and was almost running away when he spotted the .45 in the maid's hand. Stephanie hopped in the car then started talking to the maid. She looked exasperated, so you could understand the general gist of the conversation as the maid reluctantly lowered the .45 and put it back in a compartment. Again, you wished that you had put an audio probe in the maid's ear but you didn't want to stop recording what the maid sees. The image suddenly shifted as the maid honed in on a approaching figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped as you caught your first glance of Miss Hensley since starting the mission. She was walking casually through the crowd like any other teacher but the maid's eyes tracked her like a hawk till she disappeared around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. This maid is more than what she seems as she had already made Miss Hensley out as an agent, whether by intel or intuition, it didn't matter as she sniffed an agent. If Miss Hensley had bumped into Stephanie like they planned in front of this maid, then it isn't a stretch to imagine the maid shooting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Stephanie said drew the maid's attention and both women laughed with the maid's head rocking and shaking you in the capsule. The two then left the school and the maid drove the same way she drove there, ridiculously fast and reckless. You closed your eyes. You peeked every now and again but the image you saw of her driving had you slamming them shut again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, they arrived back at the mansion through three security checkpoints and parked in the courtyard. Stephanie had the same death-grip on the door as you had and you felt symphony for the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth got out of the car and went into the mansion. What happened next was what you would expect of smart, rich girl to do in her spare time. The maid followed her around, helping her with homework, bringing her dinner, preparing her a bath, etc. Okay, that last part you turned off the screen as you still had some decency. Beside, the maid is more your type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both the maid and Stephanie prepared for bed. The maid wished her mistress goodnight then went into the room next door. Your eyes refused to leave the screen as the maid stripped out of her confining uniform and gave you a unique view of the process. You watched awestruck as the maid carefully stripped off her tight uniform, releasing her enormous breasts as they almost burst out. Her breasts shuddered and rippled with their newfound freedom but you ogling was interrupted when you saw all the weapons hidden underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnives, small guns, and even a grenade were strapped to the maid's body. You shuddered at the sight of the small arsenal she had strapped to her seductive body. This went beyond simple service as she looked ready to take on a whole swat team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour libido stunted for now at the sight, you watched as the maid slipped into a thin, knee length nightgown. She stripped off her bra then slipped into her canopy bed with all her weapons still in reach. The screen turned dark as she closed her eyes and slowly drifted to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had a mission to do now that you were in the vicinity of the target. The maid was apparently Stephanie's personal maid so the two spent of the time together and it was the perfect target to get information as Stephanie would surely confide secrets to her maid. So while the maid slept, you needed to get cracking to turn her into the best unaware spy for Control. \"Let's get started.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the maid slept peacefully, you were hard at work into turning her into the perfect spy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a bizarre experience bugging a living person to say the least as you unanchored the capsule's spindly legs from the optic nerve then had the capsule follow it deeper into her head. The outer hull lights illuminated the nerve you were traveling on with surprising clarity, giving you an image of a fleshy tendril that resembled a rolled-up bundle of suspension cables. You shuddered, this was far more surreal than you imagined as you were literally crawling around inside someone's head as a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't get any weirder than it already is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerve eventually brought you directly to her brain. You stared at the illuminated mass above you with mixture of awe and disgust. The disgust should be obvious but imagine your mental image of a brain, now manage that it was the size of an island and looking like a wadded-up ball of tofu in the shape of a brain. It was quite disgusting yet fascinating as the gray matter pulsed with thousands of electrical impulses spider webbing over millions of nerve and synapses simultaneously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Focus,\" you told yourself, \"You need to get her wired before she wakes up and you need to figure out a way to contact Control before another agent takes over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking your cheeks, you maneuver the capsule carefully over the overactive nerves to avoid any involuntary reaction from your hostess's body (you could already imagine the humiliation for her). Thankfully, the capsule also contained a basic diagram of the human body, including the brain, but that was the limit of capsule's database. You were now happy with the long hours your father had spent trying to turn you into brain surgeon like him, so you had in-depth knowledge on what you were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, the optic nerve split into smaller tendrils that branched off towards the visual cortex at the back of the brain. The first part of your plan was to set a receiver so that you were still able to see through her eyes without having to be continuously connected like earlier. One of the capsule's legs removed a thick ring from the hull. The one section of the ring separated, allowing the ring to wrapped around the optic nerve. The ring resealed itself around the nerve as the capsule receive a signal confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the visual feed, but all you saw was black as the maid was still asleep and her eyes were closed. \"Hmm,\" you suddenly had a thought \"despite being inside of her. I still don't know her name yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was again strange, but you'll find out her name in due time. \"Now, it's time for the second part.\" You turned the capsule to the left and scurried towards her ear. It had irked you earlier, almost to no end, when you were staring at Gamell yet unable to hear anything he was saying. The second part of the plan was setting up an audio probe in both her ears. This was the most important piece as you could hear what the greatest terrorist was planning from his own lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the auditory nerve into the spiral muscle that was the cochlea. It thrummed gently as you made your inside of it, careful not to disturb anything as it could wake the maid up. Carefully, you exited out the other side of the cochlea and entered the inner ear, right behind her eardrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a skyscraper-sized wall of vibrating leather. Despite the maid being fast asleep, her eardrum was still vibrating erratically and was going to make it difficult to plant the probe. \"Well it's not like I have anywhere else to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process to plant both audio probes took almost two hours as the eardrum kept bucking the capsule off of it. Every single little sound had the entire damn thing vibrating like a son of a bitch, making it impossible to plant the probe. But, your perseverance won out and both of her ears were wired, so you could eavesdrop on her anytime and take a peek at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent another hour familiarizing yourself with her brain till you knew where her senses, motor control, memory, and emotions were located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haah,\" you sighed, \"I seriously want to get some shuteye but there one last thing to do.\" That's right, reconnect with Control and inform them of your host's position within the Gamell empire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last part was going to be the most time-consuming because it involved searching and pinpointing a particular hobby or liking from you hostess that you could use as a means to meet up with Miss Hensley. So you inched your way back to her brain, looking for that one thing hidden deep inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. Just a little bit above you behind the spine and in front of the cerebellum was the hippocampus. Buried deep in the gray matter, it was the control center for memory and emotional connection, so it was the ideal place to search for you to find a way to contact Control. You sunk one of the capsule's legs into the mass and it lit up as millions of neurons fired and the computer mapped out the neuro network. You looked down at the screen, it would be almost impossible to read and organize all of her memories but what you were searching for was anything related to a pleasurable experience for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened when you found out what she enjoyed. \"My god. This woman is a certified sadist.\" Memories of torture porn, horror movies, and punishment played on the screen. You shuddered at a particular gruesome scene from Saw as she moaned loudly in the video. You couldn't get how anyone would be into that shit because it scared the living crap out of you. Switching the video off, you went back to searching for other, less gruesome hobbies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it,\" you muttered. The computer had managed to trace an experience of her having a wild time in the bar. You watched as she really let loss as the alcohol flowed like water and she had one hell of a time.  Her love of alcohol will be your way to contact the agency. \"First though,\" you smiled, \"Let's have a little bit of fun first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found out what the silk threads the capsule produce was for. They were a type of sticky gossamer thread that was able to conduct electricity, i.e. its literally able to rewire a person's brain. The thread connected two unrelated sections of the brain to create a new pathway between them, such as connecting an image with a particular emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sank a probe in with a virtual picture of you downloaded on it then connected the thread to the pleasure center of her brain. You smiled. That lone image of yourself will make her unconsciously release endorphins that will make her incredible horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the mission, you connected her memories of the bar to her sense of urgency. This will make it almost impossible for her to resist going out for a drink but you connected it to her sense of want just to be sure. Lastly, you implanted a sub-conscious suggestion to call a particular number.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams then.\" The capsule attached itself to her spine then you drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley's eyes fluttered open. She yawned as she glanced at her clock. It was early in the morning yet she was feeling incredible horny right now. Closing her eyes, she felt her loins grow warmer when she thought back to the dream she had last night. \"Haa, haa.\" Ashley breath started coming quicker as she dreamt of a mysteriously handsome man flirting with her in the bar and he was bringing her back to his place before waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over, her huge tits sloshed and wobbled seductively as they spilled out into the open from under the sheet. Her nipples were swollen as large as bottle caps and very sensitive as the cool air tickled the huge pink nubs. Ashley shivered. She didn't know why but every time she thought of the man in her dreams, she would get so horny that her hand crept unconsciously to her wet crotch. She stopped, knowing that she didn't have much time before Lady Stephanie got up and Ashley pulled herself out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her closet, she grabbed one of the clean maid outfits on the right side. She glanced at the scandalous dresses on the left side and felt an intense urge to go out drinking tonight but she restrained herself as she still had a duty to serve Lady Stephanie. Shaking her head, she laid out the outfit and grabbed some underwear from her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly dressing, Ashley felt the familiar tightness around her chest and the straps from all the weapons she wore underneath her uniform. \"Haa,\" she breath, \"I can't get use to this.\" She wish her employer would let her wear looser clothing but he was very strict on the matter, so she couldn't refuse. Ashley sighed again, then she straightened her back and went to wake up her mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the capsule shaking. Yawning and stretching, you shook yourself awake in the command chair as you noticed your hostess was on the move on the monitor. Rubbing your tired eyes, you turned on the sound system and listened. If this didn't work, then all of your hard work from last night would've been in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid approached a door and knocked. The speakers nearly blew out your eardrums from the noise. \"Damn\", you turned down the dial and rubbed your aching ears. \"Well, at least everything is working so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way into the room, the maid walked towards the canopy bed. She shook a lump hidden underneath the covers and muffled voice whined about the time. \"Mistress,\" you hostess scolded, \"It is time to get up and prepare for school.\" The lump muttered something about where school could stick itself but you hostess was unrelenting. Grabbing the covers, the maid yanked it off the lump and Stephanie was revealed, fully nude, beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASHLEY\" she screamed, pulling the covers back over her. Too late though, as you had burned her nude figure into the your mind and as a backup, rewind the video feed and sent a copy to your phone. While you did this the maid...ahem, Ashley had already laid out clothing for her charge and turned her back while Stephanie changed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ashley was waiting, you detached the capsule from the optic nerve and floated back towards the hippocampus. You still had video feed from the probes you planted, so you didn't worry about missing anything like before. You checked the fuel cell, <b>59% Charged</b> it read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" you pondered. The fuel cell was already almost halfway depleted from the activity you did last night and at this rate, it won't last another day unless you find another source of power. Checking the backup power, it ran on electricity rather than fuel and looking around outside gave you a brilliant idea. Floating towards the hippocampus, you looked for the line you had attached last night but you couldn't see the glistening strand any where amongst the firing neurons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the computer, but you were directly underneath where you had planted the first end of the line. Looking closer, you saw a thin, glimmering line hidden beneath the brain matter. \"Can't be,\" you muttered, \"There's no way that it had already been integrated.\" But the evidence was right before your eyes. You connected to the end of the line with one of the capsule's legs and hooked another one into a cluster of neurons. You went over the data while switching to auxiliary power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe data was the same as before; the line had left an image of you in the pleasure center of her brain while connecting to her need to go out to a bar. Though, the data for the phone number you left earlier hadn't been downloaded into her mind yet. You finished the number's download and sent it along the line connected to her sense of urgency...again. Checking the fuel cell, you smiled as the battery was charging from the natural bio-electricity your hostess was producing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your energy problem was solved and now you could take a....detour around your hostess's body, or not. You could always stay here and do some more meddling with her head for your own benefit.</span></div></div>",

It appeared her digestive tract was eager to absorb the water, and Jack was now riding a current of water into the intestines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce past a few turns in the small intestine, the noise settled enough for Jack to hear his host through the radio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Sterling? Are you there? Hold on!\" Suddenly another powerful flushing noise occurred from above Jack. Intense muscular contractions rocked his pod as Miss Hensley threw up what little contents were left on her stomach, but to no avail as Jack had already passed too far into her system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find you! Can you see anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I regret to inform you of this but I have been passed into your intestines. I have to say your insides cannot compare to your  gorgeous physique, but the view is quite interesting to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness\" she said in embarrassment. \"How do we get you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Miss Hensley, the only option I see now is to simply wait until your body passes  me all the way through and I can escape from your lower extraction point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower extraction point?  Wait, you mean I'll have to shit you out? Excuse my language but I can't do that! Surely there's another way?\" she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am I think this is our only option. It won't be ideal for either of us but we each signed up knowing the risks. I just never though I'd become a gorgeous woman's bowel movement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm am so sorry for this. This is all my fault,\" Miss Hensley said, on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Hensley, I know this is hard but I need you to hold it together. I have limited oxygen and I need to escape your body in the next few hours or I'm a goner, \"Jack explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Miss Hensley asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Report to headquarters and they can assist in my recovery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I don't know if I can do this..\" She says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley please, my life is at stake here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" she replies. \"This is going to be so embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I've seen a lot worse in my time. No matter what happens, my view of you will not change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hensley is slightly reassured by Jack's words, but is still extremely apprehensive at what is about to come. She calls Control and is quickly picked up by an agent in the area and taken back to a hidden medical facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly debriefs several other agents and the medical staff, and is administered a powerful laxative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Jack suddenly begins moving through the small intestines at an incredible speed. He heard the awful noises of Miss Hensley emptying her bowels into a special receptacle designed to screen her bowel movements contents. As Jack winds through the vast tunnel of the small intestine, he relieved to find that it was mostly empty except for himself and the water she had drank earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack suddenly rounded a bend to face a sphincter. He passed through and realized he was now in her colon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley, can you here me? I believe I have now entered your large intestine, the last part of your digestive tract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" she grunts. \"The doctors have confirmed this as well. They are tracking your radio signal inside me. Uggghh!\" She exclaims, presumably releasing another bowel movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to sob over the radio, \"why is this happening to me? I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley, you're doing great . This is almost over,\" Jack says in the most reassuring tone possible, given the circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continues through her large intestine, propelled along with the watery fluid he has traveled with since her stomach. Fortunately for Jack, all solid waste appears to have been already passed, giving him a clear shot to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded the last bend and entered her rectum. The rectum was a bit larger than the rest of the intestine, and appeared similar to the stomach. He saw her anus below, which looked very similar to what he expected it looked like from the outside. Miss Hensley still had control over her bowels, and her final sphincter remained locked tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley, please let the doctors know that I am ready to be passed. There is hardly any other waste in here so I recommend not using the special toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a reply, the muscles around Jack clamped down. Her anus opened slightly and he was greeted with an intense white light that nearly blinded him after hours of her dark insides lit only by the pod's spotlights. Unfortunately, the pods small size relative to her rectum made it rather difficult for her to push him out. He remained for several seconds in the rectum, and his eyes adjusted to the blinding light. Peering through her exit like a porthole, his view was blocked by her fleshy buttocks on each side . He spotted a small sponge-like substance on a metal tray below, presumably the alternate to the strainer toilet she had been using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jack began moving and fell right through her anus, barely slowing down as it closed behind him. He fell a short distance onto the sponge-like surface, which cushioned his fall. Looking up he saw Miss Hensley in a hospital gown, squatting over the tray and completely exposing her backside and privates. While slightly disgusted with the whole ordeal, Jack took a long look at her, admiring the view and thinking about the end to his rather less than fantastic voyage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley, the eagle has landed. And my goodness is it nice to finally see you again on the outside,\" he said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hensley quickly stood up and pulled the gown across the back to cover her buttocks, obviously embarrassed at the bodily functions she had performed in front of Jack, the doctors and several other secret agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack I'm so glad you're alive! I'm so sorry this had to happen to you. You probably think I'm the grossest woman in the world!\" She said, on the verge of crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hensley, you were great. I'm alive because you did the right thing and put the mission before your own embarrassment. I am so proud of you and I still see you as beautiful as ever. Now, we still have a mission to accomplish. Let's get to work shall we?\" </span></div></div>",

There it is again, this beautiful woman has you backed into a very tight corner. You've never, ever imagined in your wildest dreams that you'd be in such a position with a member of the opposite sex.

She pulls you back from her face and lets you take in the panoramic view of her glorious body, and the even more massive room beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she thunders, snapping your attention back to a mouth that could swallow you whole. \"Wouldn't you like to know your part in the grand scheme?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, if you don't mind, all I'd like to do right now is go for a quick swim in your sweat glands.

At this size, you are truly helpless in this young woman's power. You shudder at the thought of what she could have done to you if she had been a true villain; on the other hand, who says she couldn't still do it anyway? Agent 97 brings her dainty hand back down to face level, which is still too high for comfort (even for a trained stuntman like yourself), and the vibrations of her voice bring your attention back to the immediate matter. \"I'm actually here on a whim; freelance agent. Saved up my vacation time and chose to come spend it in this lovely little corner of the globe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, a fair bit of time had passed since you last heard her name, and you sure hope she doesn't have the impression you forgot about her, but with all the loves and losses in your life, it's hard sometimes to keep track. But that still doesn't explain one nagging question in the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you manage to disguise yourself so well?\" you ask in genuine puzzlement. \"I mean, I thought something seemed familiar. Your scent, your curves... it really felt like I knew you from somewhere, but something seemed off.\" Waves of realization begin to spring to mind, and you choke on your words as you begin to understand the consequences. \"You uhm... you seemed... well, a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taller?\" she finishes for you, the pitch in her voice rising with the excitement and a smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you kinda looked like it.\" She more than looked like it alright! Somehow a 5'1\" raven-haired gymnast managed to assume the figure of a 5'10\" buxom blonde supermodel. \"Must have been those high heels you wore,\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Agent 97 is giggling as she lowers you to the mattress, letting you step off onto the flexible surface. Before you can adjust to the new environs, you fall backwards as two dainty pedicured feet the size of buses come sliding towards you. As you regain your composure, you find yourself standing between the heels of her elegant sandals, two white columns as tall and thick as yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These little things? I know they must seem humongous to you, but believe me they only make a few inches of difference, not much compared to the rest.\" She stretches her feet out on either side, dwarfing you with their length as if to emphasize her point. \"You see, I'm looking for some friends, went missing around here over a year ago. They wouldn't give me exact details, but I know they were seeking specific info on Dr. Salisbury or one of his associates. Probably had something to do with what you just saw half an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So knowing that his men know who you are, and everyone else at MI6 thanks to that treacherous rogue Agent 54, you had to come up with a persona that even your mother wouldn't recognize,\" you continue, playing your favorite game of constructing the answer even as it's explained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so I grew,\" she finishes, putting special emphasis on the last word as she smiles at you like a giddy schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way I shrunk?\" Quite to the contrary of your erstwhile partner, you find it hard to complete your sentence, to finally acknowledge to her and to the world that you have become small and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. You got hit by the shrinking beam. I exposed myself to the other one, so for me there's mostly nowhere to go but up. I couldn't imagine someone carrying around a remote right now that could make me atomic size on a whim, but that's the difference not getting caught makes I guess.\" You gaze upon the sandaled feet still surrounding you, imagining them expand even further before your eyes to the tremendous proportions they would have assumed not so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can't you just keep growing and take this place over?\" Boy, this conversation is getting more and more awkward for you by the second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, if I could, I would have ground this whole place to dust in a microsecond.\" Agent 97 blushes, then corrects herself: \"Er, only after they kindly released my friends of course. I do have the remote to control my own size, but there's another miniscule problem. The process hasn't been perfected yet, and I've only made it up to about 10 ft. That's a great height to be and all, but it won't get us very far in a place like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess then you're going to need my help after all,\" you chirp up enthusiastically, hoping your embarassment will be over soon and you'll be back in action at a more familiar scale. Your hopes are quickly drowned however when she communicates the next phase of her plan. \"A ray of virtually unlimited size might be just around the corner, so if Harry gets it done, then I'm going to need to use your predicament to my advantage. I know, Jack, you'll be eager to help me out, do what little you can to save the world.\" Drat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, like some sort of rag doll, you are swept up in Agent 97's gargantuan fingers, which wrap around you like a warm, impenetrable coccoon and leave you to lie helplessly in her grasp. Bringing you before her monstrous yet graceful lips, she blows you a kiss and smiles at you as if she were a loving goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaving in, you decide to humor your partner/occasional lover, as it seems she's destined to have her way with you in the end regardless. \"So tell me, my dear 97, what's it like to be made so big and mighty, even as others dwindle before your very gaze?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starters, little Jack, why don't you call me Sherry?\"  </span></div></div>",

Do you really think you're safe if you co-operate?\" She threw back her head and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe and look around. There is a tiny mouse hole at the far end of the room. You reason that you could jump onto the bed, slide down the bedsheets to the floor, and make a run for it. The only problem is getting past Harry's white cat. It's been watching you with unnerving fascination ever since it slipped in with you and Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?!\" Daisy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize with horror that you failed to hear her first 'request'. Not exactly the best way to start off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Didn't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed with suspicion. \"You better do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to get into my glass aquarium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look with horror as she points to a glass aquarium filled with weird insects. There is also a huge padlock on the secured lid. \"What for,\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a silly question. You're my pet. All pets belong in aquariums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you keep ahead of them. Besides, as long as I feed them, they'll just be curious about you. Trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was going to be your partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partner? I never said that, you foolish boy. All I said is that if you obey my every command, you'll live.\"</span></div></div>",

This is as good a chance as you're going to get.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flick of the knife in your sleeve and it's in your hand, slicing into the thick fabric of the silk bedsheets and allowing you to rip your way down toward the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering how long I should keep Harold in his deluded state.  What do you think, snookums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she expecting an answer?  You sure hope not, but then the cat yowls and she laughs.  The floor is getting very close now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.  It'll be all the more satisfying if I shrink him right off his throne, taking his victory at the very moment of its culmination!  Picture him, looking up at me as I step past him to become queen - no, god of this world!  Then a little' sorry Harold' in that airhead voice before grinding him under my heel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh, that sounds like the end of her monologue.  You've still got to run past her immense foot - the one that she's even now fantasising about using to grind a shrunken man - before you're home clear.  You start running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!  What am I thinking!  Of course, you can have him!  The irony is too delicious!  And I imagine he'll taste better than those mice you've been chewing on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chats to the cat, the woman paces back a forth a little, idly moving her feet.  One impacts directly behind your three-inch form, and you stumble.  But no, she hasn't seen you, and that mouse hole is scant feet away.  Nearly there...  Once clear, you'll track down Salisbury, acquire the device, restore yourself, save the world, get the girl, quip wittily as the base explodes and be back home in time for elevenses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want more company in that insect pen, Sterling?  Sterling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frustrated roar is accompanied by the padded impact of the cat being dropped to the floor behind you.  It's bigger than an elephant right now, so you scramble to your feet and make one last dash for the hole.  It's faster though, it'll catch you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your pistol.  You could stop, turn and take a shot.  It won't kill the beast, but a hit to the eye - no problem to a marksman like you - should give it enough pause to let you get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could keep running.

Then follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho could refuse an offer from Dieter Halstead, one of the richest, most powerful men in the world?  Certainly not someone who had been assigned to investigate rumours of his involvement in smuggling weapons-grade uranium, as you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it is that you take your leave of the roulette table, following Halstead while being trailed yourself by his two minders, large men whose dinner jackets strain at the seams at their bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own clothes fit you perfectly, earning you many a glance from the ladies frequenting the casino as you make your way to the private rooms at the back.  Halstead opens the door and beckons you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the man, meeting his serpent gaze steadily as you walk past him into the room.  You're inviting a lot of danger here; the possibility that he's merely taking you to one side to have you killed has entered your mind more than once.  But you are confident of your ability to get out of this situation.  A lot more confident than you are in the cover identity cooked up for you by Control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised by the sparseness of the chamber that you find yourself in.  Compared to the decadent opulence of the Monte Carlo casino outside, it is a run-down dive.  A single table sits in the centre of the room, with but a single chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my place of business,\" Halstead chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour instincts were right - it's a trap!  You're already reaching your hand towards your hidden pistol when Halstead dismisses his guards, leaving the two of you alone in the room, door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is necessary to go undetected, of course, so my office and transportation facilities are one and the same,\" Halstead says, fiddling with a hidden catch on the table.  His words aren't making any sense, but you listen anyway, sure that the madman is about to explain his plan; they always do, in your experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is a click.  You reach for your gun, but too late.  A yellow glow envelops both you and Halstead, and to your embarassment you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to find Halstead taking you by the hand, helping you to your feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It always affects people like that the first time,\" he says, with a jovial familiarity that you don't care for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil was that?\" you enquire of him, and he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best way to hide the location of my enterprises is in plain sight,\" he says, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow his arm and finger, and see that a large, two-storey building lies just some distance away, across an expanse of strangely coloured grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the grass that really confuses you; it's red, almost the same shade as the carpet of the room you were in when you passed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it is exactly the same colour.  The grass is the carpet, but now it reaches almost to your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast your gaze upwards, and see that the shade in which you rest is caused by a monumental structure, one supported by four mighty pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you've been shrunk.  You turn to Halstead, but he merely smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingenious, isn't it?  Of course, we downsize a lot more in transit, so that the whole operation can be carried through customs with no problems, but in these circumstances I thought it best to start you off easy.\"</span></div></div>",

Ten times she makes you sit until she is certain you will obey the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stands up and walks about two metres away (or to you about forty metres).  \"Here, boy\" she calls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you try to resist but again she calmly and firmly repeats the command until - almost without realising it - you find yourself trotting over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeats the trick with \"stay\", \"jump\", \"roll over\", \"lie down\" and even \"fetch\" until eventually you find yourself broken and ready to obey any command she gives you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she picks you up and nuzzles you affectionately.  \"I can't believe how quickly you've become such a well-behaved obedient little man.  You're such a good little thing.\"  A part of you shudders as you realise how proud you feel about her praise and how keen you are to earn more of it.  You kiss her finger and she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you back in your cage and gazes in at you, beaming at you.  \"Now I've got to go and do big people things for a while.  But I'll be back later to give you a treat to reward you for how well behaved you've become.  Bye-bye for now\".  She waves at you and then you watch her disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she is gone you start to pine for her and desperately want to come back.  Like it or not, you truly are her pet now.</span></div></div>",

No way are you going to just submit and become  a pet to some young woman just because she's much bigger than you and treats you like one.  You decide that, when she comes back, you're going to stand up to Lena and demand your rights.  Even if she won't let you go, you're going to resist and stand up and fight to reclaim your identity.  You start to pace around the cage menacingly, building yourself up for the confrontation in store and absolutely determined to triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for her to come back.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And you start to wonder if she's coming back at all.  Maybe she's abandoned you all alone and you're going to starve to death.  You start to panic and all that resolve you've built up fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she opens the door and comes back to see you, you're so relieved you rush forward to greet her and push yourself up against the cage to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, did my little pet miss me?\" she asks, \"that's so sweet\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens your cage and puts in a bowl of dry muesli and clips a feeding bottle of water to the side of the cage.  You don't want to eat dry muesli and there's no way on Earth that you're going to drink from something designed for a hamster.  But then you are very hungry so you decide to eat the muesli.  But it's so dry you need a drink so you go and drink from the water bottle.  \"That's so adorable\" gushes Lena, snapping away and taking photos of you on her smartphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she reaches a hand in.  You want to shy away but instead find yourself rushing towards it and letting her pick you up and pet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does so, her father comes in.  You stare up at your old rival - now so much bigger than you that you're an absolute irrelevance that he could crush in a second should he choose to do so.  You feel scared but then Lena's warm caresses reassure you and make you feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's he behaving\" asks Halstead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's perfect.  Such a good little man, aren't you?  Aren't you?\" she says to you in a babying voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses her father on the cheek.  \"Thanks so much for letting me keep him.  I promise he's never going to give you any trouble again.  I'm going to keep him forever.  He's going to make the perfect pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her prediction is entirely right.  Whatever evil plans Halstead has are no longer something you can do anything about.  You're just a tiny little pet for your enemy's daughter and that's the way you stay for the rest of your life.</span></div></div>",

Jenna is one of the organization's newer recruits, but she proved to be a fast learner and quickly rose to the rank of field agent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the much larger girl's booming voice brings you back to the here and now. \"Get comfortable, cuties.

Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena happily leaves the room, leaving you with your voluptuous co-worker. She sighs and stretches her toned leg against the cage bars. \"Are you hurt?\" you ask. \"Just my pride. When infiltrating didn't seem to pan out for you, I decided to try sneaking in myself. Halstead had me shrunk within minutes, but I barely escaped into an air vent. I managed to avoid capture for a while until a run-in with his cat.

No!\" You hear Lena's enormous voice cry out across the room. \"Bad kitty! Out!\" The cat gives a growl of frustration but does what his mistress tells him. You realise that, had you done the same thing, you would not have got into this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps boom across the room an, rolling onto your back, you see Lena's endless legs come into view. You feel fingers scoop you up. The massive fist that holds you steches across to pick up Jenna too and the two of you are raised until you stare into Lena's beautiful angry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You have been in the field long enough to know these are purely superficial wounds. You twist in Lena's grip to look at Jenna and she nods too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", says Lena, \"but do you realise how lucky you were That's twice I have saved both of your lives now and, in your case young lady, both from the same creature. Now. Give me whatever it was you used to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna sheepishly hands over the grappling darts and the cutting laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", Lena says. \"Now, next time I tell you to stay in your cage are you going to do it?\" You nod. You glance at Jenna and she is nodding too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lena's  face breaks out into a smile and she giggles to herself happily. \"I can't stay mad. It's<br>\r\nThe cutest thing ever that two wittle bitty people thought they could manage without the help of big people. You might have been big, strong spies in your past lives but you're adorable little pets now who and you are far too tiny and cute and precious to survive on your own. The quicker you realise it, the happier you will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she gives you both a kiss and sets you back down in the cage. Then she disappears to her drawer and pulls out a sock which she uses to wedge the gap in the cage that Jenna<br>\r\ncreated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, .try and pull that out\" she tells you boti. The two of you try and try to yank the sock but it is too tightly edged in the cage. You are prisoners once mor. The effort from yanking on the sock makes you and Jenna both fall backswards and you land on top of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww. So adorable\", Lena gushes and misses your hair. Then she smiles. \"Back soon sweeties\", she says. Then she blows you a kiss and disappears out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she is gone, you turn to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna puts her head in her hands. \"Now she has taken everything I've got. And I don't know about you but I can't face going down and facing that cat again. Lena is right. We can't survive on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" you hiss. \"We accept we are her pets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see a better alternative?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't. Jenna puts her arms around you and you hold each other. Despite your macho reputation you start to cry into Jenna'a shoulder. Jenna starts crying too. </span></div></div>",

She glances at the cage and throws you both a big grin. \"With you in a moment, sweeties,\" she coos. \"Just let me get changed and then we're going to have heaps of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does not listen to a response and you realise there is no reason she should. You are just two helpless little pets to her and so why on Earth should she listen to what you have to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she strides cross to her chest of drawers and you can't help but stare at her massive body as she peels off her denim shorts to reveal skimpy light blue underwear underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls open a drawer, which yanks open with an ear splitting growl, and picks out a pair of nylon fishnet tights. She then sits on the bed and you watch her roll them up one leg and then the other until they cover her legs and lower abdomen. Then she puts on a pair of black stilettos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and grins. \"Now let's have some fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls the cage open door and reaching a hand inside easily scoops you both out. She lifts you up to her eyes and grins. As she does so, it occurs to you her mouth is so huge she could Pop you in and swallow you without chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought then are distracted by Lena's soft chuckle which is, to you, as loud as thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cool is that, just a few hours ago, you were big strong secret agents with jobs and lives of your own and now you're two itty bitty pets and that I have complete control of you. I mean I know it must be not as cool for you as it is for me but still it must be pretty massive for you to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides just think, how easy life is for you now. You don't need to work and you don't need to worry about money or working or anything at all. You just need to sit there<br>\r\nand be adorable and I'll decide everything for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've got to be responsible and make sure you stay fit and well so we're going to play a cool game. And, after that, I'm going to take you out for the evening. So here we go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crouches down and places you on the ground. As you glance up at this beautiful<br>\r\nyoung giantess crouching above you, it strikes you that the heels of her stilettos are taller than you are. You feel Jenna next to you and you huddle against each other for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, so adorable.\" You hear Lena coo in a chuckling voice, \"but now you're going to have to race against each other. The game is simple. It's a race. First one to climb to the top of my leg is the winner. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we refuse\" asks Jenna, probably wanting to sound more confident than she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. You aren't going to refuse\" says Lena. As she speaks she reaches a massive finger down and lifts Jenna's chin so she is staring up at the giantess. Lena speaks in a coaxing but commanding voice. \"I'm bigger and stronger than you and you will do what I say. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna meekly nods. Lena chuckles. \"So adorable. Now, little lady, I'll let you choose. Left leg or right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna meekly trots to the toe end of Lena's left foot. You follow her lead and trot to the toe end of the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", Lena says as she stands up to her massive full height. \"Now, ready, steady and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might be tiny, you might be weak and you might be powerless but you're still competitive and you are determined not to lose this race, especially to a girl. But you know Jenna is a tough competitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself up onto Lena's toe and swing your body up and then race along her foot to her ankle. The netting of the fishnets is quite wide and you have to reach but you manage to grab on and get a purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble up Lena's shin and up toward her knee. You glance across at Lena's other leg and see Jenna is behind you but very much in the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's knee proves a far tougher overhang than you predicted and takes some time for you to negotiate. You glance across and see Jenna has climbed around to the back of the knee and climbed the easier route.. Lena giggles as Jenna scrambles across the surface but Jenna makes it with ease and is ahead of you as you pull your self over the edge. Jenna looks across at you as you look across at her and, as your eyes meet, you realise you are both really enjoying yourself and that inspires you to try even harder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get over the top of the knee you have an amazing view up Lena's thigh and up her body and you enjoy yourself even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush up her thigh chasing Jenna on the other side. Both of you realise that the front of Lena's leg will be easier to climb than her derri\u00e8re so you scramble up the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she draws level with Lena's groin, Jenna stumbles and suddenly finds herself having off the fishnets trying to re-establish a grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seize your chance and rush up to the top of the tights. Jenna recovers well but you narrowly finish ahead of her to take the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner have you finished than you feel Lena's hand wrap around you. She lifts you to her lips for a huge victory kiss and then dangles you in front her face. \"Who's my big strong boy?\" she baby talks, \"my clever little man did so well.\" Inside you secretly glow with pride but try not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as I say, I'm taking you out for the evening and the good news is that now you are very used to where I'm going to keep you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uses her free hand to produce a spool of sewing thread which, to you, is as thick as rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the bed, she holds you against her right inner thigh so your head points up her body and you are facing the other thigh. She uses the thread to bind you in place. From your new vantage point, you see her bind Jenna in the same position on the other thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should hold my little guys in place\" she says. As you struggle you realise it certainly will. You are tightly bound in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena then crosses to her wardrobe, her every moment vibrating through your body as her muscles flex as she goes. She pulls out a miniskirt and pulls it on, concealing you and blocking your view of the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grabs her handbag and heads out.</span></div></div>",

She looks so puny and minuscule up against the gigantic leg that holds her and you realise you must look the same. You want to talk to her but the movement of Lena's legs sees you constantly swung away from each other and makes it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you hear high-pitched girls' voices above you and realise that Lena has met her friends. Glancing down, you see the stilettos and boots of the other women as Lena hugs them on greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they walk again. The ground beneath you goes dark with shining lights and loud dance music pumps around you. You realise you are in a night club. Lena goes to the dance floor and begins to dance and you find yourself moving much more rapidly. It's oddly comforting, like being rocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise makes it even harder to talk to Jenna and you realise the thing about being strapped to the thigh of a beautiful woman and unable to go anywhere is that it gives you time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you do so, you realise a strange thing. You might be tiny and you might be a mere pet to this titan who was once merely your enemy's daughter but is now your owner and protectress but you feel more relaxed than you have in a long time. For years your life has been a constant battle to get ahead at work and a constant battle to thwart evil combined with a relentless pressure to impress your colleagues by finding ever-more risqu\u00e9 things to get up to with ever-more beautiful women. And it is exhausting. It's only now, now that you are a prisoner against the slender toned thigh of this humongous captress that you realise how much it has worn you out. And, in a weird way, the stress is off you too. All your life, every time you tried to stop a bad guy, you worried about being defeated. But, now you have been defeated and humiliated and the worst case scenario has surely occurred. And yet you are still standing. You feel strangely good about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are suddenly interrupted as you realise the area around you is far more brightly lit. You hear the massive slam of a door and the click of a lock and then Lena's gigantic manicured hand swoops under her skirt and picks you up with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise you are in a toilet cubicle. Lena smiles down at you. \"I thought my little cuties might need to use the bathroom\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers you to the seat and holds you ok place by your feet as you open your flies and start to urinate. The fact you need someone to hold you in place on a toilet seat to keep you safe is just another in a long line of humiliations that you are learning to be last of your new life.  When you finish and do your flies up, she tucks you between her breasts for momentary safekeeping and plucks Jenna out from her thigh so she can relieve herself too. You look away to preserve her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have both finished Lena gathers you both up in her palm and lifts you up to talk to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm sure you loved being between my legs but going to have to put my little guy and little lady somewhere else for a while. I've a met a big strong handsome man and he's getting excited and I don't want him to try to caress me and discover my little pets. You understand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot help but feel a little crestfallen. Although it should not be surprise, you are still gutted to learn that this phenomenon beauty merely views you as a pet. Jenna catches your expression and glares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Lena says, \"I think the safest place is in my purse. Here you go sweeties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you in a (to her) small leather clutch purse.  She then gives you both a wave and smile and zips the purse up.  Finally you and Jenna are free to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're jealous aren't you?\" she teases.<br>\r\nHer tone is playful with a hint of anger. \"You're jealous of whoever that brat is dancing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That 'brat' saved our lives,\" you reply \"and, like it or not, she owns us now. I think we should show her a little more respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gives a hollow laugh. \"Jack Sterling thinks we should respect a woman. I never thought I would see the day. She's way, way younger than you, Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're the size of a barbie doll and she talks to you as if you were a kitten. It's not going to end happily ever after. Unless you being her kitten is you're happily ever after. Do you even still want to be rescue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good question and you think about it seriously. Then you reply...</span></div></div>",

Your arms feel by your sides, one splashing something wet, the other something of mush. \"Agh, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning your still spinning head, you observe the matter of a freshly discarded banana on your right, while a raining drip of water puddles on your cardboard bed from a half open lid overhead. \"A waste bin in an alleyway?\" You wipe your hands clean on a nearby cloth, the final sweep by your own handkerchief. \"I've been discarded like so much rubbish.\" You get to your feet on this sheet of brown paper earth, looking to the sun above with a palm visor.

Hopping from the cardboard field to the exceedingly scarce width of runway, you overhear a stifled gasp nearby.  You dismiss this second interruption and leap from your perch like a square-winged falcon.

Gentle as Lucrezia is, I'm sure that you wouldn't want to risk an accident between her enormous fingertips, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hate for her to wash her hands of me,\" you grin, setting to the warm, sloping wall of flesh with a gusto.  The physical exercise again distracts you, providing somewhere for your sanity to shelter.  The ridges of her fingertip provide ample handholds, and you are astounded to find Halstead - for all his rotund frame - matching you pace for pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce atop the palm, you marvel at the expanse of it all.  Creases that you would not normally pay attention to now absorb all your attention, and you pause to examine them more closely, the pulse of blood beneath the surface throbbing out an enticing rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ascent begins, and you almost stumble off your feet.

Even the prospect of dirtying up the car doesn't concern you too much; it just means that the men you're chasing will be in a lot more trouble when you finally catch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo low-level nobodies in the service of a crime syndicate made up of former KGB agents.  You're only after them because they can lead you to someone bigger, someone with real knowledge about what's being done with the secret weapon files that someone stole from the Kremlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another day at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you, their car crunches back onto the main street, forcing other motorists to swerve aside or risk a collision.  You follow in their wake, expertly remaining almost exactly within their tyre prints.  Once you've gotten a little further away from this built-up urban area, you can bring out the big guns.  Until then, you'll have to play it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a shot ricochets off your right wing mirror, you realise that they have no such qualms about keeping this business quiet.  One of them is leaning out of the window, plugging away madly with a kolasnikov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they can't blame you now - it was they that upped the stakes first.  You reach for the secret console hidden behind the dashboard, but pull your finger away when you have to follow them around another tight bend.  Seems that they're heading for that big industrial plant ahead; why would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a strange glow covers your car.  Some sort of weapon fired from the car ahead?  No, they seem to be affected as well.  You have no idea where it is coming from, but it seems to be having a soporific effect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to find your head buried in the air-bag of your car.  Unsurprisingly, you lost control when you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting free, you take a look outside.  It's gotten dark, so you must have been out a while.

The constant bashing and pain were enough to knock you all out for most of the giantess' journey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you were alone and captive in some kind of glass tube. Was that horrible encounter some weird fever dream? Were you just drugged and hallucinating? All you could see was white and oak flooring and shrinking? Ha! That was the stuff of fantasy and science fiction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're awake, Mr. Sterling. Good!\" A thunderous, male voice echoed. You jumped and turned 180 degrees. A vast torso clad in a dress shirt, tie and waistcoat loomed in the near distance before you... It wasn't a dream, after all. You walk up and try your best to look up at the sneering, arrogant villain that had you in his grasp and what you saw was... quite a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp high in the sky was a stylish young face that everyone on the planet would instantly recognize. Hudson Kensington, recent inheritor of Kensington Enterprises.  His neatly combed back blonde hair and high cheekbones gave his wicked sneer an enhanced sense of power and dominance. Behind you, another vast wall came into vision as The Vixen reentered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's awake. I did as you asked, now will you finally let me watch you break him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHudson paused for a moment before his response. \"Very well, Amelia. I am a man of my word. You may watch. I might even allow you to... participate if I so feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess beamed with excitement as she rushed over to the desk and lowered herself down so you were eye level. Her blue pupils became the dominant sight on her end as you turned back terrified towards Hudson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, Mr. Sterling. You have found yourself in quite the pickle haven't you? Tiny. Helpless. Pathetic. Sure, you probably feel like the smallest man in the world. But don't you worry soon most of the other 7 billion people on this planet will be joining you too. All of them will realize their true being and true purpose. Looking up to me. Praying for my mercy as my boot sole comes down to tread on them like the insignificance they are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left a moment of silence for you to talk. You couldn't. The giant let out a powerful bellow of a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No comebacks? No promise that you're going to 'stop this'? Good! Because. You. Can't. And I do highly suggest that you accept that and you act like a good obedient ant before his god, Mr. Sterling. After all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lowered down out of sight. Noises from under you suggested that he was looking for something, something that he quickly found as he rose back into sight consuming your horizon once more. In his hand was a vast patent dress shoe. It had no laces and didn't look too worn. Hudson turned the shoe so that the sole was facing your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... my father's disappearance was such a tragic thing and I would /HATE/ for you to meet the same fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight before you was horrific. In the middle of the Gucci shoe's heel was a bloody mess, something that used to be a man but was now just a jumble of splattered limbs and other body parts. You wanted to feel sick. The giant businessman's sneer grew as he pressed a button and The Vixen watched transfixed by the display of twisted dominance from her boss. </span></div></div>",
