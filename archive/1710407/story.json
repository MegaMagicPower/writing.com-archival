I want to make sure I look good.\" Cream was slightly confused by the statement: why would she need to strike a pose if he wants to know if he looks good?

Her face was very full and chubby with large puffy cheeks and a small double chin. Her breasts were a large, perky H cup and her backside and hips flared out nearly getting her stuck between the doorframe. Overall cream was a complete butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Dinner!

She picked it up and slid it onto the trolls finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the statue began to crack as Cream quickly backed away with Cheese hiding behind her in fear. As the pieces of stone shattered Cream was looking away to shield her eyes from the dust that was forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust finally cleared Cream opened her eyes which immediately went wide open in shock as she saw standing before her was the same troll, only not stoned anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll looked around in confusion, and then at his finger. \"I'm free? Ha Ha! I'M FREE!\" the troll shouted in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hello,\" Cream asked slightly nervous. The troll looked over and saw Cream standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Cream the rabbit, and this is my friend Cheese the chao,\" Cream happily said showing her Chao friend who was still hiding behind her. \"Who are you? And why were you trapped in stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" he pondered. \"I suppose you deserve a answer. My name is Winthrop, Winthrop the troll,\" he said taking a bow. \"You see some time ago I wondered into this area during a bad thunder storm. During it the wind caused my ring to fall off.\" He pointed at his glowing ring to cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just froze after it fell off?\" Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you see this ring is what keeps my powers in check. Otherwise without it I lose control and become stone, or worse.\" As Winthrop finished, he looked around the area they were in. \"From the looks of this place, and that hole in the ground, I say I've been stuck here for a long while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop then faced Cream, who he noticed was still staring at his ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Winthrop, I know this is all a big shock for you, but I'm curious to ask is what kinds of powers does that ring give you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop gave a small grin as he moved his hand closer to Creams face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout I show you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring began to glow and...</span></div></div>",

I bet they like to meet you. Or if your feeling tired I can take you to my house so you can rest. I can always give these flowers to my friends tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop turned his back to Cream as he gave her idea some thought. Some rest might help him rejuvenate his ring, plus he could use the rest. However meeting her friends might have him find a way to get his ring working again. Plus maybe he could have some fun with them. The mere thought of it gave him a devious grin. He turned back to face Cream with his answer.</span></div></div>",

Mr. Sonic, this is my new friend Winthrop,\" Cream said introducing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gave a chuckle. \"Well, he's a chubby little man,\" Sonic said patting Winthrop on head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop gave Sonic a angry glare. <i>When I get my ring working again, you'll be the first I use it on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on Cream was looking at her flowers when she realized she had nothing to keep them in. \"Oh! Tails I forgot, do you have something to keep these flowers in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean a vase or something? Uh... I think there's one in the kitchen,\" Tails said pointing in its direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help her find one. Come on Cream,\" Sonic said leading Cream toward kitchen with Cheese following leaving Winthrop and Tails alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just stayed seated awkwardly thinking of way to brake the silence that filled the room. Winthrop was still looking around until something caught his eye at Tails desk. He walked over as Tails took notice of him walking over, wondering what he was looking at? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he realized what caught Winthrop's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

Cream seems to trust him, but she can be a bit naive sometimes. Well then again even if he took it Tails could just call for Sonic and he be there in a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails reluctently answered, \"Okay... but just be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop nodded and opened his hand as Tails placed the emerald in it. Winthrop then held emerald in his grasps. It looked like a ordinary jewel, but as he held it he could feel little vibrations coming from it. There was power in this jewel. Unlimited power... and it was in the palm of his hand... He then moved the emerald closer to his ring. Suddenly the ring glowed in a bright flash that blinded Tails, but Winthrop just stared in awe at the power that was surging into his ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the light died down as it was now just a small gleaming light on his ring. Winthrop's mouth was ajar. The emerald still felt the same, as if nothing had happened. But his ring, was back at full power, even more then it was back when he first had it. The emerald didn't just restore his ring... it empowered it. With this emerald and his ring together, Winthrop had unlimited choices of what to do with it as he pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" Winthrop took his attention from his ring and saw a shook up Tails rubbing his eyes. \"What happened?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop gave a evil grin as he answered, \"Let me show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe directed his ring toward Tails faced as it glowed a bright light which shined in his eyes, causing him to go into a trance. Winthrop moved his ring away as he examined Tails to ensure he was entranced. He even snapped his finger by his ears. Tails was completely under his control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited Winthrop jumped and clicked his shoes in the ear. \"It works! It finally works!\" What was the little troll to do now?</span></div></div>",

He groaned as he threw his arms around his stomach as he felt it start to gurgle. He was starting to feel... <i>bloated</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sonic felt like his entire body exploded as every part of him quickly expanded. His belly filled with blob fat which materialized out of nowhere as he grew moobs that would put Rouge to shame. His arms and legs bloated and sagged. His face bulged as his cheeks puffed up with fat. His mouth become almost squished by the increase of chin flab he gained. And his butt bulged and grew along with him. All within a split second Sonic was now a 20ft tall ball of blob and fat that took up half the room. Thankfully Tails workshop was a large area otherwise Sonic would be in a <i>tighter</i> situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic let out a groan and huffed as he tried to pull together what just happened. He tried to stand up but couldn't manage. As he strained and groaned at himself to stand up, he accidentally banged his head on something. Looking at it he saw he hit a hanging light bulb. Looking up further and saw he was only a few inches from the ceiling. It was only when he looked down did Sonic finally see what he had become; leaving his mouth completely agape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Winthrop was rolling on the floor laughing his head off. Tails just sat in his chair still in a daze. Winthrop pulled himself together so that he could examine the new Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the chubby one now hedgeblob?!\" Winthrop taunted as he patted Sonic's big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic didn't respond, he was still in shock over what had happened. Sonic's been through a lot of the unbelievable in past. But this? This was just plain unreal! He made Eggman look like mouse. Forget that! He made a elephant look like a twig! For the first time ever, Sonic was unsure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Winthrop was still admiring his work as he walked around the enlarged Sonic until he was behind him, facing his humongous rear. \"I guess I'll have to let Cream know to give your food to me. I don't think your keister needs the pounds,\" he said as he slapped Sonic in his huge jello bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's eyes widened in shock. Not over having his butt slapped mind you, that was part of it. No he alarmed over a new revelulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream, Tails. They were helpless. Sonic knew he had to do something. He may be a immobile, enlarged blue hedgehog, but he was still Sonic the Hedgehog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic turned his head to look behind him. It wasn't easy through the folds of his fat, but Winthrop was definitely behind him. Turning back to look at his new self, Sonic got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining himself Sonic started to swing himself back and forth until he managed to finally fall on his back in a body slam of fat, crushing Winthrop under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight...?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't much to see for his enlarged belly blocked his view of everything, and his engorged cheeks make things even more difficult. He just dropped his head on the floor staring up at the ceiling as he wondered what was he to do now? He was still... well not himself. Not to forget his speed was gone as well. Maybe when Cream finally comes in he can get her to wake Tails and he can do something to fix him. Until then all the pudgy hedgehog could do was lie there staring up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the light got darker over Sonic. Giving a confused expression, Sonic wondered why it got a little dark over him? But that's when he realized it was a shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little man's shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop appeared looming over Sonic's head with a evil grin. \"Nice... try.\" Winthrop said as he flicked Sonic's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic turned his head in Winthrop's direction as they were now face to face. \"Might I also say that if you had falling on me giving your... <i>Ahem</i>! Given weight... Little old me would have been crushed! And we don't want that, do we?\" Winthrop spoke as he pinched Sonic's chubby cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic groaned as he tried to pull himself up off the floor, but he was just too heavy and fell right onto the floor. He was really stuck now. He couldn't move, there's was nothing he could do. He was at Winthrop's mercy. Maybe it was the body fat, or from his attempt at a sit up. But Sonic felt a drop of sweat go down his forehead. There was no denying it. Sonic was nervous. For the first time ever Sonic was nervous. In the past maybe he was worried for a friend, but never himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop also saw the drop of sweat. It brought him joy to know he was able to bring a great hero to his knees... or back. He chuckled to himself as he walked a few steps away from Sonic. Confused by what he was doing Sonic continued to eye Winthrop. Winthrop aimed his ring at as his Sonic entire body glowed green. He was then lifted up dropped right on his butt so that he was now back in seated upright position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was now really nervous. A little scared if you might. He must weigh as much as a truck! And Winthrop's ring just picked him up like he was a paper! Right now only one thing came to mind. Calling for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic didn't like to use his friends to fight his battles but this was clearly a situation that would affect them as well. Tails was out of it so that only left Cream. He didn't want to put her in danger but maybe if he told her to get help as he called for her, she or Cheese could get away. His mind was made up. Sonic opened his mouth as he called, \"Crea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, a green light surrounded his mouth, snapping it shut. He couldn't talk. He couldn't get help. Sonic looked down and saw Winthrop with a huge grin on his face and his ring up and aimed at Sonic. \"Once again, nice try,\" he plainly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's eyes were now wide in horror. That was it. There was nothing he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some hero you are. Asking a little girl to come to your aid? And you were willing to put her in the danger? Tsk tsk hedgehog.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's head lowered in shame. For once Winthrop was right. Sonic had a moment of weakness, and tried to put a little girl he cared for in harms way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, for your insolence of trying to do harm onto me, and almost putting my new friend in harms way.\" Sonic gave Winthrop a angry glare. He's no friend of Cream, he's just using her! Sonic could only hope she would figure it out soon enough. \"You'll have the honor of testing my ring even further. I wanna know what else its capable of until I get to meet your other friends...\" Winthrop said with a evil tone, with that last statement sending a shiver done Sonic's chubby back.</span></div></div>",

But before he did that, he wanted to give the hedgehog some false hope. That would add bonus points to the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hedgeblob,\" Winthrop spoke. Sonic looked down at Winthrop's direction with a angered look. \"I'll tell you what, you can either stay like <i>that</i> for rest of the time, or I can change your form into something... that takes up less room if you can do one small thing for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic shook his head vigorously up and down to him. Anything was better then this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop ring glowed as Sonic was flung to the ground smashing his face and stomach onto the floor. Rubbing his nose he looked angrily at Winthrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, all you have to do is give me one push up. It should be easy for so called hero such as yourself. Just one push up, and I'll change you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne push up? Before Sonic could have done fifty with one arm behind his back. But now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe extended his hands to the ground and groaned as he tried to perform a simple push up. He was dripping sweat as his body jiggled from trying. Finally he pushed up in a split second as he dropped back down to ground panting and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop chuckled with a grin as his ring glowed once again as Sonic felt that strange sensation throughout his body again as the fat and weight dissolved from his body. Sonic was soon back to his old figure and lying on the floor panting and covered in sweat. When he looked up Winthrop was standing above him with his ring aimed at him still glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Sonic began, \"But you said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop interrupted,\"Are you new to this whole sneaky villain thing? I said I change you into something that took less space, and I meant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic closed his eyes as a different feeling went throughout his body. He felt his hips widen, his body change, hair grow on his forehead. When Sonic opened his eyes he spoke, \"What did you-\" Sonic closed his mouth realizing his voice sounded different. Sonic looked down at a puddle of oil that was there on the floor and saw what Winthrop did to him. He was a girl! With eyelashes and long puff of hair forming over his head. She looked away in horror as she looked at herself, another thing came to mind. She was a girl who was naked! She grabbed a dirty rag from nearby to cover herself up as she saw Winthrop yucking it up over the ordeal. When he was done he saw the female Sonic staring at him in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry me lady. You must be shivering without the proper attire Sonica. Here...,\" Winthrop spoke as his ring shot at the rag turning it into red shorts, and a white sleeveless shirt that formed onto her body, showing off her curves. Sonica then started walking over to Winthrop with fire burning in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop taking notice of this quickly thought to himself that maybe making him into girl may have freaked him out some more, but she was now mobile and heading towards him. Before Sonica was about to grab him Winthrop shot her with his ring as her body went into a exotic dance. She swong her hips from side to side as she twirled around the lab. Sonica still in control of her head tried to regain control of her body as she shook her head vigorously, but there was nothing she could but continue to do her belly dance for Winthrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop clapped his hands for the dancing hedgehog until her dance was finished as she dropped to the ground panting.Winthrop decided that perhaps having Sonic brain inside Sonica wasn't the best idea. He walked over to Sonica with a grin on his face as his ring glowed in her face causing Sonica to go into a quick daze before shaking it off and grabbing her aching head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened,\" she asked. Looking around she eyed a half broken mirror with her reflection in it. She walked over to it and smiled seductively. \"Hey good looking,\" she said as she posed herself and made kissy faces at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop just watched in the back and laughed. The change was complete Sonic was gone, and Sonica was in control now. He was liking Sonica more then Sonic already.</span></div></div>",

Rouge expression went straight to anger. She then jumped up and went for a dive kick but missed as Winthrop duck, thankfully she landed right on the comfy couch. Winthrop then fully faced her said, \"Lets fix that.\" Rouge climbed off the couch ready to do another attack until she noticed the ring on Winthrop begin to glow. Suddenly she was struck by a shot from the ring and landed back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge are you alright,' Blaze asked concerned for her friend. Rouge once again climbed off the couch and said, \"Yeah I think so. Looks like your-\" Rouge was cut off as she grabbed her stomach and started to sweat as her stomach started to gurgle. Blaze just watched in confusion as Winthrop grinned at the site. Rouge then moved her hands to her bottom as she felt a tingling sensation there. Suddenly she felt her suit get tighter. Within a split second her butt expanded to the size of two elephant butts. She landed flat on the couch which it almost fit. Blaze's eyes were practically bulging at the site, Winthrop was drooling, Rouge on the other hand was uncomfortable. Besides the fact that her new rear did not fit to well on the couch, her suit and her undies were riding up. Her outfit that she always wore was still intact, but that was the problem. She fidgeted trying to move but her bottoms girth far surpassed her legs. She was completely immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Rouge, are you alright,\" Blaze asked nervously. \"How- *grunt* does it look like,\" Rouge responded still fidgeting. She then put her hands on her new bottom to try undue the wedgie she was getting. She tried to outstretch them so they stop riding up, but was having no luck. Blaze shook her head regaining her composure to realize she lost sight of Winthrop. She looked around to try and locate him. Winthrop was behind the couch admiring the full twin moons. \"You!\" His attention was then focused on Blaze. \"What did you do to Rouge?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like how...,\" Rouge strained. Winthrop just chuckled as he answered, \"My magic ring allows me to do basically whatever I want to whomever I want. Before it wasn't that much, but thanks to this emerald my powers have multiplied ten fold. Your friends new behind isn't air, or anything fake. It's one hundred percent real.\" Winthrop finished as he gave Rouge's new behind a pinch making her groan. Blaze took a step back slightly nervous of this new threat. What was she to do? Stay and fight? Or try and get help?</span></div></div>",

I mean you have a nice form, but she let me tell you.

As she tried to regain her composure she was suddenly hit by shot from Winthrop's ring. Blaze flinched wondering what was going to happen, a thought in the back of her head had a small idea which made her nervous. She then felt a warmth in her chest and lower region as she felt her outfit tighten. She saw her breast start to grow, then looked behind her to notice her \"behind\" start to gain some weight as well. Rouge stopped squirming to notice what was happening to her feline companion. Blaze fell to her knees as she groaned and sweated, as her body was changing. Soon her chest grew to D-cup size, and within seconds her butt was almost twice the size of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just sat there on her knees trying to take in when had happened. She didn't know if she should feel upset over the change, or glad that her new behind didn't immobilize her. She looked over to see Winthrop with his mouth drooling at her. Blaze flinched in disgust and embarrassment at the site and tried to stand up. Blaze slowly tried to stand up. The new weight she was supporting made things difficult. As she tried who breast and bottom jiggled in motion as she moved. After almost falling over two times Blaze was finally able to gain her balance. Winthrop clapped for her stating, \"Good job at adjusting to your new self. Just for that, you get a reward.\" He aimed his ring and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do to her now?</span></div></div>",

When glare from the glowing beam was gone, Blaze opened her eyes to wonder what happened. For some reason it felt a little chillier in the room. \"Blaze...,\" spoke a grunting Rouge. Blaze looked at her. \"Coffee table...\" she directed. Blaze got her idea and looked at her reflection in the glass coffee table to see what had been done, and what she saw made her eyes bulge. Her pants along with the rest of her outfit had been reduced to a two piece bikini. Blaze quickly covered herself with arms hoping to hide herself from the being fully exposed to the world... or the people in the room. She scowled at Winthrop who was eying her all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't look at me like that! Be thankful I didn't go for the no piece,\" he chuckled. Blaze stared daggers at him wanted to falay the troll alive. The only thing that was keeping her from doing it was the fear of exposing anymore of herself. \"Blaze...,\" spoke Rouge again. \"Get-*urk*! Get... Amy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what to do Blaze tried to make a run as best she could with her new weight, and bikini... But was stopped by the troll who froze her body stiff by the same binds from before. Blaze struggled to move but couldn't. She tried call out, but was stopped once again by a energy bind to her mouth. She was basically frozen stiff by glowing binds. \"I think not,\" Winthrop simply spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge realized she had to do something. So she was about to scream as loud as she could but before she could her mouth was closed shut by the same binds on Blaze. She tried pull it off her mouth but it was clamped tight on her. There was nothing the to women could do. \"Naughty, naughty ladies. I think you deserved to be punished. But which one shell it be...,\"  Winthrop said sinisterly. Both Rouge and Blaze were sweating like pigs. Each one feared what the wicked Troll would do to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Winthrop choose? </span></div></div>",

But before she could do anything, she was hit by a beam from Winthrop's ring again. This time, the sensation she felt was in her head. She staggered as she rubbed her head. \"What was that,\" she asked slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon regained her composure then look herself over. With a moan she loosened her bra bikini to show off more cleavage. Then pulled up her bottom bikini giving herself a wedgie, but she didn't care. As long as it showed off more of her money maker she didn't care one bit. She then placed her left hand on her hip in a pose as she fiddled her hair with her free hand. All the while Winthrop was drooling a river, and Rouge was left shocked beyond all belief. Blaze the once smart, shy, and independent woman had become... this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you jealous?\" Rouge looked over to a smirking Winthrop. \"If you wish I make you more like her. I mean you may have a bigger caboose, but her! She's the one who's gonna turn more heads then the original you ever did before!\" Rouge just gave him the same angry glare Sonic, and Blaze had given him. \"I get that a lot. All well your loss,\" Winthrop said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then herd a \"Hmm...\" come from Blaze. She turned her head to see Blaze comparing her bottom to Rouge's. \"Her's isn't that much better then mine, is it Mr. Winthrop,\" Blaze spoke in a saddened and slightly jealous tone. \"Oh... Don't be upset kitten. If yours was like hers, then you couldn't strut around and show it off to everyone,\" Winthrop said as he patter her on the head to reassure her. \"Oh you!\", Blaze giggled as she gave him a hug and a kiss, which left Winthrop blushing and Rouge practically gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then got a idea of her own.</span></div></div>",

Amy are you sure there's a vase in this kitchen,\" Cream asked. \"Uh...,\" Amy stuttered trying to think of something. She looked out behind Cream and saw her garden, and got a idea. \"Oh! Why don't you check out there!\" She spoke directing Cream to the garden outside. Creams face lit up as she headed outside with Cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wiped her forehead with a sigh. \"That was close. That should keep her busy for a short time. What's taking Blaze and Rouge so long?\" she wondered. She gasped wondering if maybe they were in trouble.

She saw Rouge trapped the on couch waving her arms for assistance with butt bigger then the Master Emerald, and Blaze wearing a bikini leaning against the wall in a seductive tone.

Winthrop knew he had to be careful with this one. From the dialog from before with Sonic and Cream, and with the stories Cream told him on the way over, Winthrop was definitely convinced that this girl was the most feared of the group, therefore the most dangerous. He didn't want to chance firing his ring and possibly missing her, which could lead to end of story, and the end of Winthrop. \"Aren't you curious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cur-Curious about what,\" Amy replied. \"How your friends came to this fate,\" he answered. \"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop just grinned. Perhaps he could find another way around this. From what he also remembered from Creams story's of this female, was that she was more brawn's then brains. Which means she could be easily tricked, and perhaps with the right words... manipulated. Winthrop knew what he was gonna do. This time though he was gonna use his words, not his ring. Yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop then started to stroll around the room with Blaze following from behind as he spoke, \"I'm asking if your curious to know how your friends became this,\" he finished directing to the giant butt, mouth tied bat stuck on the couch, and a \"plumper\", bikini wearing cat who realizing that everyone's attention was on her again, did a pose showing off her body and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gulped as she was a little nervous to ask almost. \"Uh... sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop smiled as he held out his hand showing off his ring, and took out the chaos emerald which made Amy gasped at the site of it. \"With this emerald powering my ring, I can bend anything to my whim. And as you can see, your friends are proper examples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was confused, and perplexed beyond all belief. Was this really happening? This is the kind of stuff you have in dreams or stories. Not in reality! \"Now then...,\" Winthrop spoke interrupting Amy's thoughts. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pointed at herself in confusion. \"What would you like to become,\" he asked again. This just confused Amy even more. Winthrop just shrugged and picked up a photo as he followed by Blaze walked over to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is, what you like to change about yourself?\" Amy just took a step back asking, \"Why would I want to change myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it,\" Winthrop spoke showing Amy the album he was holding. It was a album of Amy, and her friends, the one Cream was showing Winthrop earlier. The album featured their friends like Sonic, Cream and Blaze, and other people Amy knows. But Winthrop was directing her to the females of of the album. \"Compared to these other broads, your not really anything special. Your no different from Cream! All you both can offer is a cute face. These other lady's can offer that, and more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the picture, then herself, not feeling to good about her body. Winthrop continued, \"Now tell me, which kind of girl do you think any these guys in this picture would choose if they had the choice. Let me tell you sister! It wouldn't be you! And now your chances have gotten slimmer, with the <i>modifications</i> I've made to your friends.\" Winthrop finished directing once again to Rouge, and Blaze who placed her one hand on her hip, and the other behind her head in another pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's hammer lowered as she took in what Winthrop was saying. Winthrop then got closer. He moved his head to Amy's ear to whisper, \"Do you think you have a chance with that blue hedgehog now, then you ever did? I think not.\" He then finished and took a few steps back from Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinthrop's last sentence was still ringing in Amy's head, metaphorically saying. She then took another look at her two friends to see what they become. Rouge was still sitting there trying to remove the energy bind from her mouth, and Blaze was still posing. Everyone stopped what they were doing when Winthrop spoke, \"How about a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then asked nervously, \"A... deal?\" Winthrop shook his head yes. \"Here's the deal, if you promise to let me keep your friends like this, and agree not to tell Cream what I really am. I'll transform you into anything you desire,\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took step back to take what he asked. \"What?\" She then looked at her friends once again. Rouge was sweating and waving her and shaking indicating she was trying to say, \"NO!\" Blaze on the other hand ran up to Amy, to say, \"Please do it! Please!!!\" Rouge and Amy were both taken aback by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it like this! Before I was to shy to even look others in the eye! Now... I'm bigger, and don't care who sees!\" Blaze finished smacking her butt and making a kissy face. Amy was both weirded out, and awkward at the same time. Blaze stopped to speak again, \"Think about it! When Winthrop changes you, Sonic will be drooling all over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that made Amy think. If she were to have Blaze's \"features\", Sonic wouldn't be able to resist her. She knew deep down he had some feelings for her. She just needed something to push him over the edge. This could be it... What was she thinking!? Could she really go through with this!? Knowing that she be endangering Cream, and practically betraying her friends! But... this could be her chance to win over Sonic. She worked hard to maintain her fitness, but she was still developing. And there's also being a late bloomer. Who knows how long before she's fully grown? By then she could miss her chance with Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do to Cream,\" Amy finally asked. \"If your worried if I'm using or going to use my ring on her your mistaken. Believe it or not she's kinda grown on me in her own weird way. So you have my word no physical harm will befall her, or your friends,\" Winthrop answered. <i>But as for mental harm, I can't promise anything. And if Cream provokes me I will use it in a heartbeat. But Cream doesn't seem the violent type.</i> Winthrop thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say? Do we have a deal?\"</span></div></div>",

He could be a troll or an alien, a genie, they could be good, they could be mean/evil, or anything you can think up. May sound kinda weird but the games have had giant lizards(Sonic Adventure 2), gray aliens (Shadow the Hedgehog), and a flying magical dog (Sonic Unleashed). So I think you readers won't find this to far fetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan have:<br>\r\nInflation/Expansion<br>\r\nTransformation<br>\r\nHypnosis/Mind control<br>\r\nGay/Lesbian (Maybe if only used properly like they were forced and not just because you wrote it saying the character is just gay)<br>\r\nVore... (Maybe if used properly too)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen adding try and make the characters personality sound right. Like don't have scenes where we find Shadow acting depressed and cutting himself. Or making Knuckles a complete idiot. He's kinda dumb, but not that stupid. Now if they're personality was altered because they were changed by something like magic or hypnosis, that's a different story. So be smart when adding is what I'm saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse good grammar and vocab. So try and make good entries. Also no swearing. I know its 18 and up but try and keep the language down. (Damn, Hell) Something near that is okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you need more info or have questions, don't hesitate to send a message to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All sonic characters are property of SEGA)</td>",
