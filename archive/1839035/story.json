A loud clatter of the door knocker startled Liz a little, she had not long since returned from walking her three Weimaraner dogs around the neighborhood and she was still feeling the cold a little. \"Bailey, come here boy!\" she shouted to her eldest dog, who was always the most 'agitated' of the three. The two younger, female dogs, Tia and Sasha, weren't as fussy but could still be a handful. \"JUST A MINUTE!\" Liz then shouted out to whoever was at the door, as she rounded up her animals and put them in another room and closed the door. \"And you can shut up too!\" Liz then chuckled at her grey parrot 'Peter', which was sqawking away on its perch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally opening the front door, Liz was surprised to see Steven standing there. \"Bloody hell, what are you doing up at this time? Is your bed on fire?\" she laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...no,\" Steven smirked, keeping one of his hands behind his back the whole time, \"I just wanted to give you this. Happy Birthday love!!\" he then said to Liz, presenting her with an exquisitively wrapped present with a bow. \"And no...I didn't wrap it, I'm not that good!\" he joked. He gently handed the parcel to a surprised...and delighted Liz, who took it in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thank you so much!!\" she gushed. \"Hope it didn't cost too much!\" she then frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but even if it did, you're worth it!\" Steven winked at her. He then looked around him nervously for a moment, causing Liz to smile. \"Don't worry, Eric already left for work\" she told him. \"Why don't you come in for a coffee and get warmed up, I've locked the dogs up so don't worry\" Liz smiled, as she stepped aside and invited her friend into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I don't really like dogs!\" Steven chuckled, as he walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Liz laughed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour passed by quickly, the two friends sharing a few stories, laughing and sipping their coffee. \"So is Eric taking you out for dinner tonight?\" Steven suddenly asked. \"If he is...you might want to put on some better clothes\" he then joked again, gesturing to the Nike jacket, plain black tank top, jeans and sneakers Liz was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky sod!!\" Liz exclaimed with a smile. \"I've just got back from walking the dogs, I don't dress up for the occasion\" she laughed. \"And yes...Eric's taking me out for dinner tonight, all being well\" she then told Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you have a nice time!\" Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz again smiled at Steven, knowing how he felt about her. \"Thank you luv!\" she uttered gently, as she picked up the gift she had been given. \"I'll open this while you're here\" she then said, as she began to carefully unwrap the present. Steven just sat in silence as she peeled the paper away...to reveal a glass prism, triangular in shape, that seemed to capture the sunlight that was coming in through the window. \"Wow!! That's beautiful,\" Liz gasped, \"Where did you get it from?\" she then inquired as she held the object up in front of her, admiring the way the light reflected off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not it was from a small stall near the Meadowhall shopping center, an old woman sold it to me\" Steven explained. \"She said it was a very old, very...valuable trinket\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz threw Steven a skeptical stare. \"You didn't buy that crap did you?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Steven said with a shake of his head. \"But I did think it was nice, even if you only use it as a paperweight\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is, I love it!\" Liz again said, as she continued admiring her new present, running her thumbs up one side in a specific pattern. Just then the prism seemed to make a sound...and Liz stopped what she was doing when she saw the three sides of the object start moving. The sides retracted downwards and disappeared into the base of the prism, revealing a small, velvet-covered pedestal on which lay an old key of some sort. \"What the hell?? Is it supposed to do that?\" a shocked Liz asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've no idea!\" Steven replied, his jaw hanging open in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling the prism down on the coffee table in front of them, Liz proceeded to pick up the key and study it. From the shape it was evidently an old key, and it was coated in either copper or brass, and in the middle of the head of the key...was what looked like a small emerald. Liz ran one of her fingers over the jewel..and seemed to be mesmerized by its brilliance. Another, louder sound off to her left then drew both her and Steven's attention. \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" Liz's parrot Peter shrieked out repeatedly, before flying into the kitchen out of the way. The two friends then watched as one of Liz's wall cabinets disppeared...and the wall began to shimmer, and second later...a carved wooden door appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what did you put in that coffee?\" Steven asked Liz as his throat suddenly dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...coffee!\" Liz muttered in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stood up and walked over to the door, studying it intently. \"I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I bet that's the key to open this door\" Steven said, pointing to the key in Liz's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...doors just don't appear, and where the hell did my cabinet go?\" an increasingly agitated Liz muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I know?\" Steven answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one for hesitating, Liz just stared at the key in her hand for a moment...then slid it into the keyhole on the door and turned it. A clicking sound told both of them that the door was now unlocked. Steven then stepped forward and opened the door...and it creaked as he did so. \"Darkness!\" he whispered to Liz, after peering inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to physics, that should lead to my kitchen!\" Liz mumbled, a serious expression etched on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just looked at Liz. \"I think physics just got thrown out the window!\" he told her. \"Come on, its got to lead to somewhere, do you have a torch?\" he then asked. \"Um...yeah, hang on\" Liz replied, rushing to a nearby cupboard to retrieve a flashlight. Steven smiled as he took it off her, then he turned it on and ventured into the room, with Liz following close behind, literally hanging onto his t-shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven just kept quiet as he shone the flashlight around what seemed to be a very large room, no walls could be made out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further they went into the room, the more apprehensive...even scared...Liz became. The diminishing light from the open doorway didn't really help matters of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get out of here\" Liz then whispered to Steven, tugging on his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...look, over there!\" Steven suddenly said, pointing to a 5 ft tall pedestal nearby. And both Liz and Steven could vaguely make out something that was resting on the pedestal. Approaching it through the haze, it became clear what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was it?</span></div></div>",

You do it!\" she then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we both do it?\" Steven suggested with a shrug. Liz thought about it for a moment and then agreed, and both of them stepped up to the pedestal and put a hand on the lid of the mysterious looking urn. Neither of them could have known that trapped within the container was a mysterious...and even dangerous power that could imbue a person with the ability to manipulate the bodies and minds of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid of the urn came off after a few attempts, and a blast of dust suddenly shot out all over the two of them, making them cough. \"Crap!\" Steven grumbled, as a swirling mass of glowing energy then escaped from the jar and shot into the air, where it hovered for a moment, then it shot forward and enveloped one of them in a mystical energy field for a moment...before disappearing into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who did it envelop?</span></div></div>",

Probably someones cremated remains, and now its all over my hair!\"  Liz sounded pretty frustrated and was trying to clean herself off frantically.<br>\r\nThe dust must have been in her eyes when it happened so she didn't see it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was this weird light that came out at me...\"  He began.  \"Look if this is your idea of a joke its not funny.\"  Liz interrupted.  \"Look I am going to go clean myself off and you.. get that urn out of my face!\"  She seemed pretty upset as she stormed off.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit..\"  Steven grumbled.  Then he felt his body spontaneously straighten up with his arms firmly at his sides.  He couldn't move.  A seductive woman's voice filled his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for freeing me Steven, I don't know how long I've been trapped in that jar.  Decades, centuries.\"  She had a strange accent.  She sounded like some sort of gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!\"  Steven shouted into the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to shout my knight in shining armor, all you need to do is think and I will hear you just fine.  The villagers used to call me witch, but I was formally known as Lela, the Lesbian.\"  She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do you want with me?</i>  Steven immediately thought, unsure if he would get an answer this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The villagers burned me and banished me to this urn because of my knowledge of magic and.. my forbidden relationships with the local women in town, but I swore I would come back one day.   Thank you for giving me a body Steven.\"  Her voice rang through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand let me.. go!\"  He broke free of his invisible restraints and ran, ran until he bumped into Liz and knocked them both on the ground.  \"What is your problem today, and what were you yelling about?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I... oh my god everything is blurry I can't see!\"  He gasped.  Steven took off his glasses to clean them then let out another gasp.  Everything was crystal clear.. and he wasn't wearing his glasses anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz I can see!\"  He clung to her shoulders in excitement.  \"What the hell are you talking about?  You can't see, you can see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My vision is better somehow, this is amazing!\"  He exclaimed.  \"Wait Steven... your eyes, they are so green...  they weren't green before were they?\"  She asked in astonishment.  Steven got up off the floor.  \"No they aren't green.. what are you talking about.?\"  He asked confused.  \"Help me up and I'll show you a mirror.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Little does Steven know, Lela has possessed his body.  He will slowly turn into the beautiful seductive witch.  At times Lela will take control of his body and make him do things he wouldn't normally do against his will.

Steven too was admiring Liz's 'assets' as they jiggled under her black tank top. He was so entranced in fact that he didn't feel the 'tingling' sensation permeating his scalp. His short brown hair slowly turned a brilliant auburn colour and silky to the touch. When Liz looked up at him...her jaw fell open in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven...your hair!\" she pointed out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Steven shrugged, as he forced his eyes to 'divert' from Liz's ample chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me!\" Liz blurted out, grabbing Steven's hand and leading him out of the strange room and back into her living room. \"There...look!\" she said, after taking him over to a mirror on the wall in her living room. \"Oh my god!\" Steven gasped, running his fingers through his hair, unaware that it was also slowly...growing longer. \"What's happening to me?\" he then asked a dumbfounded Liz, who just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should drive you to the hospital?\" Liz suddenly suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Steven heard Lela's voice in his head again, and he looked around nervously. \"Hahahaha! There's nothing with you my prince, at least nothing that one of those leech doctors or faith healers can fix\" she laughed. \"I simply wish to make your 'vessel' more suitable to my own needs\" she told Steven. He refrained from responding incase Liz thought he was losing his mind. But given what was happening to him...how could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...no, I don't think the doctors can do anything, I say we just...wait\" Steven said to Liz, letting out a sigh and studying his reflection. He threw his now 'redundent' glasses on one of Liz's small tables and just sat down on the couch. Liz, who was equally stumped as to what to do, just took the scrunchie out of her hair and ran her fingers through it before putting it back up into a fresh ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, red hair does actually suit you,\" Liz muttered, breaking the uneasy silence that had pervaded the room. \"And you look better without the glasses too\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Steven chuckled as he looked up at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven looked into the mirror again running his fingers through his reddish hair with awe.  Even though he couldn't explain how it changed so fast, has heard of people's hair changing color as they grow older.  But he couldn't figure out an explanation for the change in his eyes.  Part of him had shut this Lela woman out of his mind.  He thought he was going crazy. \"<b>Your not crazy Steven, I'm still here.</b>\"  A voice echoed through his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled he leap back a foot and hit the coffee table sending a bowl of M&amp;Ms all over the floor.  \"Oh shit, sorry Liz.\"  He said looking back.  \"Its not a big deal, here can you help me clean this up before Eric gets back?  He should be here any minute.\"  She said getting on her hands and knees scoping up the candies into her palm.  Steven quickly got on his knees and did the same.  As he crawled forward he suddenly stopped realizing he was about to bump right into Liz's backside!  He paused a moment and couldn't help but admiring the view he had right now with her on all fours bent over in front of him.  She had a pretty nice ass, it was to bad she was married to that asshole though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I agree that is a nice ass.  Who cares if shes married that never stopped me</b>.\"  The woman's voice again!  He must have seriously gone crazy.  What kind of drugs was in that urn??  \"<b>Well if your not going to make the move I will.</b>\"  Steven's right hand shot straight out and pinched one of Liz's butt cheeks.  She squealed in surprise and lurched forward.  \"STEVEN!  I can't believe you just did that!!\"  She shouted.  \"It wasn't me!\"  He protested.  \"Oh come on who else?  I have never seen you act like this.\"  She said as she got up off the floor.  \"I'm about to go on a romantic dinner with my husband soon.  What if he walked in as you did that?  Really Steven...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it was an accident.  I don't know how else to explain it, but it was like I had no control of my hand\"  Steven said.  \"Well I guess your only a man.  My butt is pretty nice isn't it.\"  She joked, then her face got stern.  \"But don't you ever do that again.  I am serious Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ha, she thinks she has a nice butt does she?  I have curves no man can resist.  Lets show her a real bum!</b>\"  The sexy voice rang through his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Liz I think I might be going crazy.\"  Steven began as he got on one knee preparing to stand up off the floor when suddenly his legs buckled and his body lurched forward back on all fours.  His back bent inward and his backside stuck straight in the air.  \"What the.. Lela what are you doing to me?!\"  He cried out finally acknowledging the spirit that possessed him.  \"Who the hell is Lela..  Steven whats happening to you?\"  Liz said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven felt an uncomfortable tightness in the muscles on his rear.  He felt like he was pulling something or like he had just broken a bone.  His ass began to swell out in ever direction filling up the back of his jeans.  He grunted in pain as his hips widened and rounded out.  Liz cupped her hands over her mouth.  The button on his jeans burst off and bounced across the room to make way for his expanding rear.  When the pain subsided he collapsed to the floor breathing heavily and sweating.  Although he could not see it, he now sported a perfectly round, feminine butt.  Lela wasn't kidding, it was irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz.. what happed..\"  Steven moaned.  \"Oh my god Steven I am not sure..  Your... you swelled up.  You must be having a terrible allergic reaction to that dust or something I don't know!\"  She panicked.  \"What do I do, what do I do?  Maybe I should see if I can reduce the swelling or the muscle tension.  Honest I don't really know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz-</span></div></div>",

She rushed out of the room into the kitchen.  Steven pushed himself up off the ground.  His jeans felt uncomfortably tight even though he lost the button.  \"<b>Hmm, she didn't seem to like it as much as I thought she would.  I like it when they play hard to get</b>.\"  Lela said.  <i>What did you do to me...</i>  Steven thought back to her miserably going back to the mirror.  He let out a funny yelp when he saw what she had done to him.  He stood looking over his shoulder with his back to the mirror and slowly pulled down his pants revealing a round smooth perfect butt.  His underwear now was so tight it was giving him a wedgie feeling, it was practically a thong and it was crushing his genitals.  He just kicked off his shoes and dropped it all to the floor to relieve the pressure.  \"<b>Nice isn't it, but your legs are ruining the perfect picture here.</b>\"  Lela said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Along with her seductive voice came the feeling again, this time in his legs.  It wasn't as painful this time but it wasn't pleasant.  The hair on his legs were slowly regressing back into his skin and this thighs began to thicken giving him a more feminine shape.  His feet even shrunk a little with him.  The sensation he felt as his feet shrank over the carpet was like the feeling you get when standing in the sand at the beach when the water washes away the sand from under you.  His lower body looked stunning.  The only problem was now he was standing half naked in Liz's living room.  He still had his own penis thank god but he didn't want to think much about that in case Lela was reading his mind right now and wanted to change that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steven one more second, I'm just filling this bag with ice I'll be right there.\"  She called from the kitchen.  Steven couldn't let her seem him like this, he was a freak!  \"<b>Come on Steven lets show her our wonderful curves.</b>\"  Lela cooed.  <i>Not like this, I won't let you.</i>  He began walking very face towards the hall opposite the kitchen.  \"<b>Where are you going?  She is the other way.</b>\"  Lela protested.  Steven opened up the hall closet door, but before he could walk in, his legs froze in place.  \"<b>I don't think so mister, we are staying out where she can see us</b>.\"  Steven still had control of his arms.   He reached inside and grasped the inside of the door frame pulling his body inward.  His legs tried to fight it, but it was a fight they lost as he tipped forward and fell in.  Steven rolled to his back and with both hands pulled his legs in.  They felt very firm and toned, and smooth he thought.  He closed the closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked into the living room.  \"Steven where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Tell her your in the closet and its her turn to make out with you.</b>\"   Steven's sexy new legs thrashed about knocking over golf clubs and winter coats.  He grabbed a hold of them tightly and stopped them from making so much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's despair the front door of the house opened.  Eric was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz who were you talking to?\"  He asked walking inside looking very concerned.  \"Nothing, I... I was just talking to myself just now.\"  She stammered.  \"Whats that ice for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. hit my head.\"  She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Who is that?!</b>\"   Lela demanded to Steven.  <i>Its her husband..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill very suspicious, Eric walked into the living room.  With the lighting he managed to not notice the hole in the wall.  \"Look at this mess.\"  He kicked some M&amp;Ms out of his path then stopped when he saw the jeans.  \"Whose are these?\" He demanded.  \"They are yours honey.\"  Liz quickly responded.  \"Bullshit I don't own this brand, who the hell owns these jeans??\"  He looked around at the mess.  \"Your not cheating on me are you?  Is the bastard still here??\"  He sounded furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey they are yous, I came out here to fix the button, but I slipped and hit my head on the table.  Thats why everything is on the floor right now.\"  Liz explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good response.</i>  Steven thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Eric believe her story?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought you were a lesbian.\"  Steven thought.  \"<b>I want to make him jealous and see the crushed disappointed look on his face.</b>\"  Lela said.  \"<b>You better start doing as I ask.</b>\"  This time Lela spoke in a tone so cold it sent shivers down Steven's spine.

His erection started up again, sticking up very noticeably under his fur coat.  He grabbed a couch cushion to cover it up.  Forgetting to even pick Liz's glass up, Eric walked straight for Steven holding just town glasses.  \"Really?\"  He said.  \"Why don't we take a look?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLela made Steven's legs spasm a little in an effort to knock the cushion off but Steven pushed the cushion down with both hands keeping it down and out of sight.

As her two friends looked on helplessly, Carly was lifted up into the air, her arms waving and her legs kicking helplessly as she rose upwards. \"HELP ME!\" she then screamed. After a couple of minutes the energy dissipated and Carly came down with a thump on her stiletto heels...before falling onto her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did Liz and Steven rush over to her and help her. \"Carly....CARLY!\" Liz said frantically as she passed out. Steven quickly picked her up and carried her back through the strange doorway and into Liz's living room, with Liz herself following close behind. \"Put her on the couch!\" Liz directed Steven, who gently laid Carly's unconscious form down. Meanwhile, the doorway had disappeared behind the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some water!\" Liz then said, as she sat beside Carly and started fanning her face with a magazine. Steven rushed into the kitchen and got a glass of cold water and hurried back to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened in there?\" Steven asked Liz, who just frowned at him and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know\" she replied, as she took the water off Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDabbing a bit of water on Carly's forehead, Liz then lifted her head slightly and poured a bit into her mouth. Only then did she start to come around. But she wasn't calm!\" \"No...no...I don't want it...GO AWAY!\" Carly shrieked, her eyes still closed. Liz struggled with her for a moment until Carly actually opened her eyes, and then she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened to me?? What the fuck was that place?\" a scared Carly blurted out, demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Steven just looked at each other, then at Carly. \"We don't know!\" they mumbled in unison. They both knew that Carly must have been 'disturbed', because she never usually cursed at anyone about anything. Carly just exhaled deeply and took the glass of water off Liz, who stood up and walked over to stand beside Steven. Carly then swung her shapely legs off the couch and took a drink while running her fingers through her stylish blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have some idea what just happened, this is YOUR house!\" Carly then addressed Liz, looking at her directly. She had only come over to wish Liz a Happy Birthday, but that was the last thing on her mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We really didn't think anything like that would happen\" she finished, holding onto Carly's hand to give comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz then walked back up to Steven, Carly began feeling a little 'odd'. An endless stream of ancient knowledge was flooding into her mind, and she soon knew that the swirling energy had imbued her with amazing new powers. She looked at her Steven and Liz again, and this time Carly didn't just see her friends, she saw matter particles that she could transform at the slightest thought, a collection of body parts to rearrange, toys to 'play' with. She shook herself out of a trance, and then cleared her throat. \"I don't feel too good\" she suddenly exclaimed, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should stay here for now, you can't drive home in this state!\" Liz suggested, looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get you anything?\" Steven then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just looked up at them both and shook her head. Far from being excited by what had happened to her, and about the powers she supposedly had, Carly was frightened. She was unable to view her friends or anything else for that matter in quite the same way. She knew she could alter reality with a mere thought, manipulate the physical world however she wanted. It was a power few people had ever been blessed with, and most of those that had been...were soon corrupted or sent mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...just like that, Carly's headache went away, and she looked at the glass of water on the small table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong luv?\" Liz asked, causing Carly to look at her and Steven again. She smiled...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's go back inside of the house...\" Liz suggested, seeing that Carly was almost trembling with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven led the girls out of the dark room and back inside of the house again, closing the door behind him.

I'm just... tired...\" she said quietly while she felt something the minute Steven's hand touched her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if her mind suddenly established some sort of invisible connection with Steven. Carly was suddenly able to hear his thoughts and she was keenly aware of all his emotions. Not only that, but deep down, something told her that she had gained the ability to not only control anything about Steven, but she had the power to manipulate anything about him as well! She had become amazingly powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so... Ummm... You...

She could enter inside of him any time she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Carly said, speaking through Steven's mouth. \"How did I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the bathroom door opened.

It was as though the sight of Liz's body excited Carly in some way and caused her powers to kick in again. Carly shifted uncomfortably in Steven's chair as she tried to move his now 12-inch 'python' into a more comfortable position. And since she had unconsciously enlarged his scrotum again too...Steven's jeans were now pretty close to bursting open right there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling contently, Carly flexed Steven's muscles again and admired her handiwork...then decided another 'modification' was in order. \"Excuse me, I need to pee!\" Carly said, excusing herself from Liz's company and walking to the bathroom, still in Steven's body. Once in there she locked the door and unzipped his jeans, she then pulled down his boxers and gasped in awe as his huge, semi-flaccid penis saw the light of day. \"Maybe I've overdone it!\" Carly thought with a chuckle, as she zipped his penis back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, lets see here!\" she then said, as she gazed in the mirror at Steven's reflection. She lifted up his t-shirt and focused on his 'average' stomach and slightly sunken chest. \"And just like magic!\" she muttered in her friend's voice...as his stomach hardened into a solid 'six-pack' and his chest solidifed also into an impressive pair of pecs. She also quickly added some considerably muscle to Steven's legs, and she felt them get stronger beneath her. Even his ass firmed up a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\" Carly nodded, as she removed Steven's t-shirt entirely and flexed his new muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, after putting Steven's t-shirt back on, Carly returned to Liz...and pretending to be playful...she touched Liz on the neck, pretending to tickle her. \"Boo!\" Carly laughed, causing Liz to roll her eyes. Right then...she knew she could now get into and modify Liz's body too, the very thought excited Carly even more. As Carly slumped back down in Steven's chair, she looked across at her own, still sleeping body and smiled. She wasn't ready to go back just yet. She focused on Steven's crotch and shrank his cock by two inches, making it a still impressive 10 inches in length.

As for Carly, she quickly opened her own eyes and sat up, looking at Steven with a grin on her face. \"Hey Steven, how are you feeling?\" she asked him inquisitively, wondering what his reply would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little strange actually!\" Steven replied, \"but not too bad\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...good to know!\" Carly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to know if she could do it again, Carly then closed her eyes...and focused. And the next thing she knew she was again looking through Steven's eyes, controlling his body. \"This is so cool!\" she laughed, as she clenched and unclenched his fists repeatedly. As Liz approached from the bathroom and sat down, Carly quickly went back to her own body again, leaving Steven feeling even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Carly's eyes opened, Liz turned to her. \"How are you feeling luv? You were out for a while\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm fine, it was only a fainting spell. Not surprising considering what just happened\" Carly responded, giggling a little. \"I think its best we all forget about that weird doorway opening up\" she then suggested, getting a nod from both of her friends. \"Anyway, as much fun as its been here, I have to get going, work calls!\" Carly then said, as she jumped up out of the chair, feeling more alive than ever. She neatened her ruffled dress and checked her heels and then headed towards the door, followed by Liz and Steven. \"See you later luv\" Liz said to Carly, as she took hold of her hands and kissed her on the cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Liz touched her, Carly felt the same 'connection' with her as she had with Steven, and while keeping hold of Liz's hands...Carly closed her eyes. A moment later...Carly was looking through Liz's eyes at her own, motionless body. \"Cool!\" she muttered in her friend's voice, staring down at the enormous breasts that were pushing out Liz's Nike jacket and black tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly staying a few seconds, Carly then returned to her own body and let go of Liz, before walking out the door. \"BE ya later!\" Carly waved back to her two friends, who thought she was just joking. They watched Carly strut confidently to her silver sports car in her heels and climb inside, then Liz closed the front door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In small lettering on the underside of one of the device's 'prongs' it said <i>Transmogrifier</i>. \"Hey, we got a name!\" Liz mentioned to Steven, who quickly came over and crouched down beside her to read it. \"Huh! What do ya know!\" he said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what...it transforms things?\" Liz scoffed in scepticism, eliciting a smirk from Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that!\" Steven shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thought-operated transmogrifier? O...kay!\" Liz just laughed. \"Lets give it a test shall we!\" Liz then said, hardly expecting the thing to work, but then again...neither did Steven. She pointed it at a vase on her table nearby and focused intently, but instead of it being transformed...a red light shot out of the device...scanned the vase and then dissipated. \"Okay, at least it works....sort of, but it didn't transform the vase into a glass of vodka &amp; coke like I wanted\" Liz mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it doesn't work like that!\" Steven suggested, as he took his glasses off to clean them. \"It looked like that 'bulb' or whatever it is in the middle just scanned the vase\" he added, as he put his glasses back on. \"Try pointing it at something else now\" he told Liz, who shrugged her shoulders and aimed at a picture of her husband on a nearby cabinet. To both their surprise...a faint yellow beam shot out from the device and struck the picture...transforming it into a copy of Liz's favorite vase. \"Oh my god!!\" Liz shrieked, \"It works!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is...amazing!\" Steven muttered, his jaw agape in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther tinkering with the device revealed it also had a small button which could bring up a small holographic screen above the it, and on the screen was the 'forms' which had been scanned and saved to the device memory. They could be scrolled through and selected at will. Obviously there was only one 'form' saved so far, that of Liz's vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets try it on something else!\" Liz suggested giddily, as she shifted in her seat.

We have each other's bodies, right?\", asked Steven and hoped that his hallucination theory was correct. He had no luck.

You did not have to be a mind-reader to see that she was scared to death and tried to understand what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven noticed that. \"Okay, calm down.\", he said although he was not sure if he said it to her or to himself. \"Calm down...\", he repeated, louder but more insecure this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at him and it looked like she wanted to say something but was still too shocked.

But amazingly...Eric didn't seem to notice anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rooting around in the closet under the stairs for a few minutes, Eric emerged with his hammer, and then he turned to face Liz, who was now slightly taller than he was. \"Hope you enjoy the rest of your birthday babes\" he then said to her, as he gave her a hug and a kiss.

He admired his generous cleavage and felt a slight dampness between his legs as he wiggled his dainty toes inside Liz's sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear,\" Eric muttered, \"Say, why don't we all pop down to the pub for a quick drink before I head back to work?\" he then suggested, catching both Liz and Steven somewhat off guard. They just looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Steven began answering, not sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun honey!\" Liz quickly cut Steven off, eager to spend some more time with her husband, even in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll be in car\" Eric grinned, before exiting the house. That left the headswapped Steven and Liz alone once more. \"Liz!! Are you crazy?? We can't leave the house like this?\" Steven grumbled loudly, gesturing down to his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Liz replied, shrugging her broad shoulders (while at the same time rubbing the hard-on in her jeans). \"Eric didn't notice anything wrong, so I doubt anybody else will\" she continued. \"We'll be fine! And besides...I need a drink\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just stared 'up' into Liz's face and then arched both his eyebrows and nodded. \"Fine!\" he relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got her house keys and locked up, then the two of them got into Eric's car. Steven was the one who had to sit in the back, and he watched as Liz and Eric shared another passionate kiss. <i>\"Oookay!\"</i> Steven then thought, as he saw Eric caressing Liz's slender thigh, his hand getting rather close to her new male genitalia. Not wanting to watch anymore, Steven turned and looked out of the car window at the people passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio were soon on their way down the road to the nearest pub, <i>The Plough</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was now wearing a white blouse, a black, knee-length skirt, a small white apron, tan-colored panythose and a pair of black patent flats.

The reality-bending powers of the ray gun were phenomenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven took hold of his own beer glass and took a drink, while still looking down admiringly at his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz, would you believe that I don't have your body anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, come on, I recognize it!  It's just like I always remember it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't.

I mean it, too, Liz, this isn't your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Steven.\"  Liz said, now annoyed.  \"You really did it.  God, I hoped you were putting me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, Liz.  Don't worry, I can get your real body back anytime.  But, think about this, no one would know if we messed with people here.  Think about what we can do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're quite right about that.

I wouldn't do that to you.\"  Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pointed Steven's hand to two men about ready to fight each other.  The bigger of the two seemed to be the one that instigated it, and the second one, much smaller, while ready to fight, seemed to know the odds were against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little guy needs some help.\"  He said as they zapped both of them.  Suddenly, the once-bigger man, seemed a lot less willing to fight, while the smaller man, now on the bigger man's body, grabbed his former body and threw it out of the pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then turned his attention to a group of twenty year-old women, all of them the pretty, bubbly sort, all excitedly talking and drinking.  Behind them was a tall, lean man doing his best to not listen in.  Steven smiled and they zapped him with one of the women.  Steven had no idea that someone could run that fast in a dress and heels, as the man, finding his head on the body of one of the women, did his best to get away from them as quick as he could.  The woman who was swapped with him walked back and got back into the conversation like nothing had ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were laughing at this when suddenly they both hit the gun and it went off.  Neither had any idea who it hit, if anyone.  After a few seconds, they found out what happened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just exited the toilets when the errant beam from the device was fired in his direction. Eric's noggin was now attached to a woman's body, probably in its early 40s and dressed in a white top, a pin-stripe skirt suit and 2-inch heeled pumps. \"Sorry I took so long, I seemed to have taken a detour to some woman's table\" he apologized while laughing. He then maneuvered his new, female form back into his seat, his slightly sagging D-cups jiggling a little as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Liz could do was stare at her husband in shock, despite the fact that she still had her head on Steven's body. As she eyed up her husband's new body, its nylon-clad legs, manicured nails and impressive bust, she felt her cock hardening into an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know...I didn't plan that\" Steven whispered into her ear, as he leaned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit!\" Liz responded, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz's attention then stayed on Eric, Steven looked around the cafe. He smirked at the sight of the woman now with Eric's body under her head, and at the side of the busy waitress rushing around with her head on Liz's busty form. And seeing the other headswapped woman acting very 'feminine' around her friends with her new male body...was hilarious. Whle Liz wasn't looking, Steven aimed the device at the waitress again...and swapped himself with her again. He hurried back across the room to his table and ushered the confused waitress off, handing her tray of drinks back to her. He then sat down quietly, without Liz realizing what had happened. <i>\"Hello girls...nice to see you again!\"</i> Steven then grinned...as he looked down and lifted Liz's heavy breasts a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Liz suddenly muttered, turning to look at Steven playing with his tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...nothing!\" Steven smiled, letting his hands drop into his lap. He then pointed to himself and grinned at Liz. \"I got your body back!\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just frowned. \"Really?\" she responded, not sure if he was telling the truth. She found it quite 'unnerving' that she no longer recognized which body was really hers. In the end she just decided to trust Steven. \"Okay...good, thanks\" she smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling a little mischievous, and while Liz was distracted with Eric's new appearance, Steven decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was Steven's headless body as well as the the headless body of the waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile both Steven's and Liz's heads were sucked into a type of purgatory. They awoke with their normal bodies below their heads and surrounded by hundreds of other normal looking people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked towards Steven, \"Where the hell are we?\" Steven shrugged his shoulders and approached a teenage girl wearing a short skirt and cleavage revealing top that had the number 5433 on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss where are we?\" Steven said to the girl. The girl smiled and asked, \"First time inside one of the guns?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside?\" Steven questioned and the girl responded \"Yes..when the lightning bolt on the gun is pressed you become absorbed in the worldwide database.\" Liz next questioned, \"Then what happened to our bodies?\" The girl smiled and laughed \"My boyfriend Joe ended up on the waitress' body while some black lady ended up on yours. He's going to have trouble with everyone calling him by a girl's name. \" \"Girl's name?\" Steven asked, \"You mean everyone thinks we're the person our head is on?\" The girl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven further inquired, \"When do we get out of here?\" The girl replied, \"When your number is up.\" I'm next so I really need to get to a tube so I can be sent out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thanked her for her helped and watched with Liz as the girl walked into a tube looking instrument next to a black man in a similar tube. Above the two tubes there was a large tv screen showing a white 40 year old mother talking with her 10 year old boy and in a flash the black man and girl disappeared and replaced the mother and son's heads. The black man looked out of place wearing a dress and on a white body, while the girl looked slightly normal other than her long hair on the boy's short body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Steven and Liz heard a voice ring out, \"Steven and Liz to the North American loading station!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz saw a North American sign and grabbed Steven's hand and advanced the two towards it.

Her gaze shifted to the second tube, with an image of a 30-something male teacher situated above it. He was quite handsome, and well-built, but Liz was still confused...he was still 'a guy'. Then again, she'd had her head attached to Steven's body until a few moments ago, but that was different, he was a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...why?\" Liz questioned, only to be berated by the loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions please.

Below him was the stunning body of a tan white 17 year old cheerleader dressed in a midriff exposing top and a tight red skirt that rested above his toned upper thighs and long sexy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven again felt the prod behind him and was greeted by a teenage girl dressed in the same manner that he currently was. The girl whispered, \"Are you ready for the game tonight Michelle?\" Steven was confused and stammered, \"ugh..... Michelle?\" The girl smiled, \"You know... you... Michelle, the head cheerleader. You're like so ditzy sometimes.\" The girl giggled and Steven turned back around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was seated in a classroom and saw that the teacher in the front was a good looking guy's body, but there was one problem, he had Liz's head attached to it. The class murmured as Liz looked to be struggling to say anything at all. Suddenly a bell rang and the students began to leave the classroom in a hurry. Steven stood up and attempted to further pull down his skirt, but it was far too short to go anywhere below his mid thigh. Liz looked up after running her hairy hands up and down her new male body and inquired, \"How the bloody hell are we getting back to England? I can't stay a man forever! I have a life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven attempted to comfort Liz, \"Look...we used the device to end up here, so this cheerleader and the teacher must have had a device as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Steven continued staring at it, but Liz's eyes soon drifted onto Steven's sexy new teenage body, and as she looked at his smooth, tanned legs...she felt hew new appendage 'stirring' in her pants. Then...in an instant...the 'stirring' had turned into a full-blown erection that was straining against the inside of her Calvin Klein boxer shorts. \"Oh god!\" she gasped to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Steven responded, looking up into Liz's 'embarrassed' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...nothing luv, never mind!\" Liz shook her head, not wanting to tell Steven what was happening, though from the size of the bulge in her pants she knew that he's pretty much be able to tell what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How comes things seem to get out of control so fast?\" Steven then asked Liz, as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and then rested his new hands on his curvy hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They always do!\" Liz sighed, trying not to stare at Steven for too long at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...this isn't normal!\" Steven stated firmly, as he gestured down to the gorgeous, female body his head was now fastened to. He had to marvel at his big breasts, shapely legs, well-defined curves and his feminine attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then interjected again. \"And...I wonder if that waitress still has my body back home?\" she mentioned, starting to panic a little. \"And...there's a black woman's head on your body Steven\" she continued, as she brought her larger, male hands up to her face and rubbed them against her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Steven responded with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, lets see if we can keep ourselves distracted a little, right?\" Liz suddenly suggested, as she reached into the drawer and retrieved the head swapping device. Steven immediately knew she planned on maybe maybe swapping other people around in school. Or maybe she wanted to check for a button to undo all that had happened. Liz was anxious to find out where her original body now was, and whether the oblivious waitress still 'owned' it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have to try to understand it before using it on ourselves. You saw what happened.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at the device which she held in her hairy hands and tried to ignore the hard-on in her pants. \"Steven really looks hot right now.

Steven pointed to a 16 year old girl with raven black hair, heavy make-up, black painted nails, a black dress and black boots with a two-inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with whom?\", asked Liz and looked at the device and then back to the girl. Steven pointed to a group of 4 boys standing in the hallway. They were all dressed like they were in the school's football team. \"One of them. No matter who. I guess, me as a cheerleader, can go over to them and ask them out without a problem. So we can find out if the thing works just like ours.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I think it's the best if you touch it as well.\", suggested Liz. \"Last time I had no idea what you had swapped and maybe, just maybe, you can tell if you touch it as well.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shrugged his dainty shoulders. \"It's worth a try.\", he said and grabbed for the device when Liz began aiming. Soon they were blinded for a few seconds and when they could see again, they saw that the goth girl stood in the same position as before but was no having the body of the football player. On the other hand, the guy was now having the body of the goth below his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's get to know him much better.\", said Steven grinning and walked over to him. He failed to notice it but his butt was wiggling from one side to another seductively. Liz noticed and her member pressed even more against the boxers she was wearing. \"Does he do this on purpose?\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\", greeted Steven the boys and put on his best smile. \"Hi, Michelle.\", they greeted back. \"How are you doing?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine.\", replied Steven. \"So... What are you guys up to. Nice dress by the way.\". She looked at the boy who was now dressed as a goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you know. Hanging out.\", said the goth dressed boy. \"Thanks. I like it as well.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But with these heels he can't outrun us.\", joked one of the others and punched him on the shoulder. \"You're lucky that you're our quarterback, otherwise we would steal your keys.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\", replied the quarterback. \"I think I'll catch you snakes even with these.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven continued smiling and had to concentrate so that he does not laugh at the conversation. \"Anyway, have fun hanging out.\", said Steven. \"I'll have to go to the... er... toilet.\". With that he hurried back to Liz and walked around the corner so that the boys could not see them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it works just fine. Just like at home.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\", asked Liz. \"Maybe it's just coincidence.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's try it out again.\".</span></div></div>",

He had spotted a young couple, obviously enamored of each other, chatting nearby. \"You wanna share the fun again?\" he asked Liz, offering to share his grip of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just rolled her eyes, then sighed...before holding the device again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl they were targeting was wearing a floral-print, short dress and a pair of sandals with a modest, flat heel, she was 'perky' in the bust department and only standing about 5' 3\" tall. She was very cute, or so Steven thought. Her boyfriend was standing roughly 5' 11\" and was attired in beige pants, a blue shirt and sneakers, his chesnut-colored hair kept tidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZzaaaapppppp!!!!   The pair's heads were switched onto each others' bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to engage them in conversation?\" Steven then asked Liz, as they watched the blonde girl gently squeezing one of his boyfriend's perky breasts. They then shared a kiss, and as Liz watched, she felt her erection growing ever stiffer. When Liz showed renewed reluctance in talking to the newly swapped couple, Steven went ahead to ask them a few questions himself. And while Steven was away, Liz tried her best to ignore the 'stirring' in her pants, but with each attractive girl who walked past...it got harder...literally. Worse still, if a girl caught her staring at her Liz knew she would be viewed as a horny male teacher (Professor Samuel Brooks, 39) rather than as a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Liz looked up when she heard Steven's voice again. He adjusted his tight fitting top and his boobs as he talked to Liz, which only made her think more that he WAS teasing her on purpose. \"Well...that's interesting, the girl thinks she's her boyfriend...and vice-versa.\" Steven grinned. \"Unlike the football player and the Goth, who retained their own identities\" Steven then said, frowning a little. \"This device is amazing!\" he then exclaimed in excitement. Steven and Liz now knew that the device definitely had two different functions, and maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, amazing or not, I want my body back!\" Liz again grumbled, folding her arms across her broad chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry and loosen up a little Liz\" Steven told her, as he looked around for more 'victim's to mess with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think not one person would find a way to reverse all of this and lock the devices away?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed. \"I guess your right...\". Even if there was something like a reset button, there was no way she could find it just now. Someone else who had the device longer might have. \"I... I guess you're right, Steven... We have to use the device more, try to understand it. Maybe... Just maybe... We find a way to reverse all of this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grinned broadly at his friend with the teacher's body. \"Now that's the spirit!\". He gently took the device out of Liz's hand and weighed it in his hand. He was amazed when he thought what powers the device had and what he could do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\", he began. \"I'm curious. So far we know that it is possible to simply swap bodies as well as seemingly swap heads, or how would you describe what happened to the couple? Anyway, like I said, I'm curious. Are there more settings the device has and, which is much more interesting, how do they affect if someone who touches the device. I mean, what will happen if we swap me with someone and the same swap occurs like last time. Will I simply have the others head? Will I get another body but everyone will still think of me as this Michelle?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged her shoulders. \"No idea... But I guess you want to try it out... Even though we have no idea what might happen this time.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grinned. \"Exactly.\". He then pressed the device against Liz's hand and swapped himself with a middle-aged female teacher who was just walking along the hallway. When Liz could see again she saw the teacher's head on the cheerleader's body. The question is: Does Steven retain the cheerleader's body and identity and acquire the teacher's head or does he acquire the teacher's body and retain the cheerleader's identity?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now dressed in a burgundy-colored skirt suit, tan pantyhose and black, 3-inch heeled pumps, and those clothes were on his new body, that of the 43-year old female teacher he had just swapped with. \"Woah!\" he muttered, as he grabbed his new, slightly saggy boobs. He then looked off to his right when one of the other school cheerleaders spoke to him. \"What the hell Michelle, you can't practise in that skirt and those heels!\" the girl scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I know that!\" Steven responded, frowning a little at the 'interruption'. The cheerleader just rolled her eyes and walked off, typical stuck-up attitude about her. \"Make sure you're ready for practise later okay\" she waved, while disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that answers that!\" Steven stated as he turned to face Liz, who was looking him up and down, stil sporting a firm erection. \"I've got the teacher's body but every still sees me as Michelle the cheerleader\" he said, as he felt himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fair enough, now stop doing that!\" Liz snapped at him, slapping his hands away from his boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I still have the remote!\" Steven added, as he waved the device at Liz. Both of them then watched as the middle-aged teacher also disappeared from view, now the owner of a vibrant young cheerleader's body. \"And she doesn't notice a thing!\" Steven smirked as he paced around, the heels of his pumps clicking on the floor. It felt good having such a mature female body under his head, perhaps more so than Michelle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" Liz asked Steven, who just shrugged his slender shoulders and passed the remote to Liz.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven, oblivious that Liz had another body, waved again with his manicured hand in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what are you thinking. I have the impression you're on drugs or anything like that. You can't finish even one sentence.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, luv.\", smiled Liz innocently. \"I was just thinking too much. There is just too much happening at once. But what I wanted to say is that we should try to swap back the safe way. Trying to avoid this place we were in before.\", she explained easily, now that her body was not driving her mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by safe way you mean?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there isn't really a bullet-proof way, BUT I think it's safer if we try to look for people with which we can get back to England and to our bodies. I doubt that you could simply vanish while having the identity of this cheerleader. Also it would be hard for you to get a ticket. Plus, I don't want to screw up anybody's life.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded. He understood what her plan was but noticed one minor flaw. \"But this plan only works when we can decide to swap our identity. So far we have not figured out how we can do this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Yeah... That's why we have to continue swapping. Trying to figure it out. Otherwise we have to swap ourselves with so many people who could easily get England until we get the identity of two of them.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wanted to respond with something when a cheerleader approached him. \"Here you are Michelle.\", she said and took Steven's middle-aged arm. \"Come on, we have practise.\". Steven looked pleadingly at Liz but she could not do anything to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to figure it out alone... I can't get him near the device now and otherwise he would not notice.\", sighed Liz. \"Well, I'll have to wait until he finishes practise.\". Liz then wandered down the hallway, looking at the device and trying to figure it out more. She did not notice the tall man, the principal, standing in her way, his back turned to her and talking to a mother about her child. She bumped into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\", she shouted out instinctively and noticed a nano-second later that the device flew out of her hand and to the ground. \"Oh no.\" was all she could think before the device crushed to the ground.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked down at her current, 16-year old body, which she had \"borrowed\" from a passing girl. She grabbed her perky boobs and stared down at her long legs and high heels..wondering if she had ended up on another body or not. She hated the fact that you had to be touching the remote to be aware of its effects. Unused to wearing such 'awkward' footwear, Liz tottered over to the device in her stiletto heels and bent down to pick it up, her denim skirt pulling tight on her thighs and ass as she did so. \"Seems undamaged!\" she mumbled, before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a voice behind her, the school pincipal's to be exact. Professor Richard Wozniak, 54, was a very tall, strict individual with a balding head, and he liked to keep a 'tight ship' as it were. And he now viewed Liz as one of his male teachers, Professor Samuel Brooks, 39. \"Ahem!\" the principal cleared his throat, causing Liz to look around sheepishly. \"Mr Brooks, do you really think that is an appropriate way to dress for work? A good example to set for your students?\" the principal berated Liz, referring to her 'trampy' clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I guess not...er...sir!\" Liz mumbled back nervously, as she peered down at her teenage body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. It isn't, and I hope tomorrow you cover yourself up a little more\" Professor Wozniak continued griping, causing Liz to roll her eyes. \"You're a great teacher and I would hate to see your standards slip\" the mustached principal then added, and Liz just stood there, listening to his 'lecture'. Eventually, the principal walked off and Liz just let out a relieved sigh before setting off walking again. She started following the principal, tempted to 'punish' him with the device, but then again she wanted to find Steven again, who by now would probably be the only middle-aged cheerleader on the field during practise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz tried to keep track of the principal, but her main focus was on avoiding bumping into anyone else. The very last thing she wanted to do was drop the remote again and have something happen to complicate the situation even more. One of the people she did pass was the raven-haired, attractive teenage girl (Tiffany Phelps) who now had Professor Brooks' masculine body from the neck down. \"Thanks for the loaner luv!\" Liz mumbled to herself as she glanced at an oblivious Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way through the throng of student and teachers, Liz kept Professor Wozniak in sight for a time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would have let him go under normal circumstances but she just lost her body and life and the old professor lectured her for dressing in a way she was not responsible for. Is it her fault that nearly every girl in this school dresses like this? When the light had faded away she saw that the principal now had the body of a girl. He now had small B-cups on his chest and was wearing a green t-shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have swapped him with a girl dressed as skimpy as I am but the time was running out. Oh, well, better than nothing.\", she thought and turned around. \"I hope you enjoy your body. Maybe, if your breasts get as big as mine.\", she looked down at her own borrowed breasts. \"You'll understand why I dress like this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then glanced over her shoulder to the girl who was currently talking with some of her friends and now had the professor's body. \"Again no identity swap. Did I press another button the last time?\", she thought and then continued walking down the hallway and started looking for Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take too long to find him. The practise could be either in the gym or on the field and considering the shining sun outside, he would be on the field. Liz strayed around school until she finally found the field. \"You would think I could find a field this side so easily... Oh well.\", she thought and saw that the cheerleaders had finished warming up and were now practising some moves, among them Steven with his middle aged body and dressed in the same costume the rest were wearing. He looked so ridiculous in it with his sagging boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not want to interrupt him in anyway and walked over to the stand and sat down. She just had to watch this. It was not like a swap would help him. Reality would adjust for him and she had no idea what that might do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven noticed Liz's arrival right away. She did not seem to notice his pleading look. \"Come on!\", he thought. \"Swap me away from this. Swap me with the coach or something like that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was amazed that he knew every move and could perform every move he needed to do, even though he was sure that his current body had not done any cheerleading in the last 20 years. Maybe it had something to do with the identity swap that came with the cheerleader body he had before this one. But even though it helped him, he felt ridiculed and embarrassed being on the field and jumping around as a cheerleader with sagging boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems to be enjoying it!\", he thought angrily when he glanced to her sitting there and just watching him. And she did. She really did. She watched the whole cheerleading practise, grinning broadly whenever Steven was jumping around. The best part was when they formed a pyriamid with Steven at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he quickly got changed back into the clothes that came with his current body and was the first to be outside of the locker room. Liz was already waiting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you had fun.\", she grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be so cruel sometimes.\", he responded. \"Now let's go and swap us with someone who is getting on a plane to England.\". He was really pissed that he had to endure the whole training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. But I didn't want to risk a swap with you not being aware. I mean, we have no idea what might happen.\", she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed. \"It's okay... Let's just... Not talk about this. I know that we don't know the device... You couldn't save me.\". Still he had to admit that he liked the experience. It was one of the things he would and could have never done in his life but the device made it possible, but it was an experience he would have loved to not make.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven was wondering just how to get them on the plane when he saw Liz pointing the device at a couple in their early 40's stood nearby with their 13-year old son. \"What are you doing...?\" Steven asked...as he watched the couple's heads get switched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practising!\" Liz shrugged, as she watched the couple. The man, whose hair was thinning on top...now possessed his wife's shorter, pear-shaped body from the neck down, and apparently from what Liz could tell...he had her identity too. And vice-versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, there was an identity swap that time\" Liz noted out loud.

But then he suggested several avenues, there were two off-duty airline pilots sat in a bar nearby having a drink, two female flight attendants from a foreign airline were off to their left chatting, and of course...there were thousands of passengers boarding their flights in the terminal, heading to an assortment of destinations no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well lets press the same button I just used, since we'll need their identities as well as their bodies\" Liz muttered, as she raised the remote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Steven nodded, then he watched as Liz prepared to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their uniforms were a sky blue in color, with a white low-cut blouse underneath, and as it turned out they had switched heads with two Air Sweden stewardesses. \"Hi Inga, Astrid, nice of you to join us\" one of the other three women said as Steven and Liz (respectively) walked up to them. It sounded like perfect English, but to everyone else...the other stewardesses...AND Steven and Liz were all speaking Swedish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah, a slight delay, nothing serious\" Liz replied with a nervous smile. She and Steven then looked out of the window and saw the plane they would soon be on.

Besides, even though Inga has been hard done by, at least 'Astrid' now has a body younger and more flexible than hers is\" Liz then said, as she studied her new body and briefly felt her new boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay, I guess Inga will just have to continue living Michelle's life...with a teacher's body from the neck down\" Steven frowned, \"This is getting even weirder you know\" he then chuckled a little as he looked down at his feminine legs, skirt and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird yes, but also amazing you have to admit\" Liz said, as she took the remote from Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they were both addressed again by the other stewardesses. \"Come on you two, time to leave, we're due for a stopover in Dublin before flying home\" one of the women, Felicia said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, this plane isn't going to Britain\" Steven grumbled, as he and Liz set off walking again, as quickly as their high heels would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but its going close,\" Liz responded, \"we'll have to swap with two other people when we reach Dublin airport I guess\" she reasoned, as they boarded the plane. And not long after that they were airborne and headed for the Republic of Ireland.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As long as I don't make something loud and silly, they won't notice me.

But I'm too curious what it is capable of.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thought he scanned the cabin for any good swap. First he saw a family with two boys. The older one looked like he was around 8 years old. The younger brother looked around 6. The boys were arguing with each other. From the look of their faces, Steven guessed that the older one was picking on his younger brother because he was smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\", thought Steven delighted. \"Let's see if we can't change that.\". Steven had thought about swapping him with his brother but that would not be any fun, would it? He looked for another victim, preferable a woman. He wanted to make the younger brother a younger but bigger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that's good.\", he grinned when he aimed the device at an overweight black woman. Steven pressed the button he now knew was responsible for a simple head swap and after a short moment he could see the boy's head on the woman's body right beside his brother. The older one was still picking on his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now he's picking on him for being so fat. Oh well.\", grinned Steven and looked around for more victims.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, he won't notice.\", she thought and zapped the woman and the behated man. Liz grinned at her creation. The man was now wearing a tight, yellow T-shirt and a knee-length red skirt.

They're mine!\" Liz whined at him, causing him to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment they're not!\" Steven chuckled at her, as he continued feeling his new 'toys'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is funny??\" Liz then asked him, her anger growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Liz, you've got to admit this is amazing!\" Steven said to her, gesturing to the gun without removing his hands from his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to swap back, I can't let Eric see me like this!\" Liz panicked, as she peered down her tank top and saw her loose-hanging bra and flat, slightly hairy chest. A sudden 'pulsating' sensation between her legs then reminded her of the other piece of Steven's anatomy she currently owned. Steven smiled at the sight of a firm erection forming a bulge in Liz's jeans as she stood there in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you going to hide <i>those</i> from your family and friends?\" Liz then asked Steven, pointing at the breasts that used to be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just shrugged, and kept feeling himself up. \"Not sure!\" he mumbled, apparently not caring too much. The more he groped his breasts and tweaked his nipples, the more aroused her got, and he could feel his \"borrowed\" vagina getting 'wet'. Liz however wasn't stupid, and she knew what was happening. \"Unless you want to orgasm right here in the living room, I suggest you stop feeling your...MY breasts\" she advised Steven, looking at him sternly, hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough!\" Steven shrugged again. \"But er...I'll need your bra to keep these babies secure\" he then winked, jiggling his boobs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unimpressed Liz took off her tops, (now that she had nothing to hide), and unclasped her bra, before handing it to Steven. Both he and Liz herself couldn't believe how weird she looked with now breasts, and she quickly put her tank top and jacket back on to cover up. \"Be back in a jiffy!\" Steven then grinned, as he went into one of the spare bedrooms to put 'his' bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" Liz grumbled, as she picked up the strange looking gun to study it some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Steven, she was eager to reverse the 'damage' it had done.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he returned Liz could tell he had gotten the bra on without too much trouble, as his, no HER, breasts were now properly supported.  Seeing her breasts on Steven's chest only made her want these changes reversed even sooner.  Unfortunately, she had found no other switches or dials on the gun indicating other settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven came back into the room he caressed his new assets one more time.  He loved the feel of the added weight on his chest, as well as the jiggle when he walked.  This of course upset Liz even more.  Without thinking she aimed the gun at him and pulled the trigger yelling the whole time, \"Keep your hands off!\"  The gun went off.  This time the red beam lasted longer than the two previous swaps.  The ensuing glow took longer to dissipate as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz dropped the gun and covered her mouth in shock.  \"Oh my God!  What did I do?\" she mumbled through her hands.  That's when she started noticing the changes.  Her stomach tightened up and her shoulders where becoming broader.  Her arms seemed to be a little longer and her hands got bigger.  Looking at Steven as he viewed the changes to himself, it was obvious they hand now switched both their arms and torsos.  Steven even had Liz's wedding rings on his new left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just stared numbly at their new body configuration as she slumped down on the couch.  Her mind slowly going into denial that this was even happening.  Steven on the other hand seemed to be enjoying his new assets.  He now had Liz's body from the neck to the waist, and her privates.  He was now beginning to wonder just how far the gun would go in swapping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picked the gun up from where Liz had dropped it, he finally noticed the state of shock his friend seemed to be slipping into.  He was thus torn.  Should he try to comfort her?  Or should he use her near catatonic state to continue swapping with her?</span></div></div>",

However, she then looked down at her ill-fitting clothes, the sleeves of her Nike jacket were now a third of the way up her arms, and both the jacket and her tank top were tight around her broader shoulders. She reluctantly agreed, and the two switched tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice!\"</i> Steven thought, as he peered down at his wonderous cleavage...before zipping his jacket up to breast level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay like this!

As the changes began Steven knew the gun had done what he wanted.  He was shrinking.  His legs were taking on Liz's familiar shape and size, and his hips and rear were shifting as well.  Steven quickly unbuttoned his jeans as they began getting tighter.  He also noted how long they had gotten on him.  He was now Liz from the neck down and this made him more excited than he could ever remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout this time Liz finally noticed what had happened.  \"DAMMIT STEVEN!!  AGAIN?\" she yelled.  Standing up she took in the sight of her former body under Steven's head.  It almost looked normal except for the ill fitting jeans.  Her anger was once again displaced by a near hysteria.  Ripping off her now ill fitting clothes, she then threw them at Steven and ran off to her bedroom, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the hurt expression on his friend's face was almost enough to bring Steven down from his hormonal high.  But having the pile of clothes Liz threw at him brought him right back.  Stripping out of his remaining clothes, he began dressing in the remainder of Liz's. He nearly creamed himself as he slid Liz's knickers up his legs.  He loved how soft they were as well as how they covered his new vagina.  It wasn't long before a very aroused Steven stood in Liz's living room, wearing her clothes as well as her body.  His heart was racing at the thought of what he was now doing.  He was tempted to loosen his new clothes and play with \"herself\" right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was some unfinished business.  He was missing a crucial part of Liz's body.  Her head.

He picked up his own jeans, boxer shorts, socks and boots and left them outside the bedroom door for her. And then he 'retreated' into the spare bedroom down the hallway from Liz and Eric's room, from which the sound of Liz's sobbing could still be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That is...strangely exciting\" he commented, as he viewed his reflection in a full-length mirror. Liz's familiar, delectable body...with his grinning noggin sat atop of it. It was actually a dream come true for Steven. He had dreamt of literally getting into Liz's knickers lots of times before, but he never thought he would. His heart rate increased exponentially as he reached up and grabbed his large breasts, and then he took off 'his' Nike jacket so he could get a better look at them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!!\" he gasped in excitement, staring down at his generous cleavage while continuing to grope and squeeze his boobs. And all the while...his new pussy became more and more aroused, he was definitely loving having Liz's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he was sat on the bed, and he slowly unfastened his low-rise jeans and pushed them down to his knees, doing the same with his knickers. That left him sat there...staring in awe at the glistening lips of the moist vagina between his legs, Liz's vagina no less. He was well on his way to orgasm even before he touched his new sex. Once his slender new fingers did trace the outlines of his snatch and then 'probe' their way inside...Steven was lost in ecstasy. The sound of Liz's loud sobbing in the other room was drowned out as Steven was overwhelmed with blissful feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was soon fingering his pussy vigorously, and loud pants and groans escaped his lips. He knew the moans of pleasure would have sounded sweeter in Liz's voice, but he would have that soon enough. Just then...all thoughts went from his head as he experienced his first...amazing...female orgasm. \"OH...YES!!\" he cried out in pleasure, no doubt peaking the interests of Liz's neighbors in the adjoining house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had descended from his amazing high, Steven cleaned himself up and pulled his knickers and jeans back up. He then exited the spare bedroom, carrying the ray gun with him in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The danger of being seen with his male head on top of his dream body sent an overwhelming shiver down his borrowed spine.  Returning to the guest bedroom to retrieve 'his' jacket, he slipped it on and zipped it back up to breast level, still showing off his impressive cleavage.  He could still hear an occasional sob from the master bedroom, so this might give Liz a little more time to adjust as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little before lunch time so it wasn't extremely busy outside, but there were a few people walking around.  The thought of stepping out of Liz's house, wearing Liz's clothes as well as her body had Steven feeling damp again.  Taking a deep breath Steven opened the door.  At the last minute he decided to put the hood on his jacket up.  Not a perfect disguise but one that would slow down recognition from a distance at least.  A wide grin spread across his face as he stepped out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole experience was slightly intoxicating.  From his smaller stature to the redistributed weight, it was all so new.  And he was loving it.  He was only going for a short walk, around the block, maybe a little farther.  He just wanted to feel the excitement a little more.  After about ten minutes or so, he found himself slowly nearing his point of origin.  Liz's house was in sight and he was ready to go see how she was coping.  And hopefully finish this swap.  He was loving his new body and couldn't wait any longer to have it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sway of his hips and the jiggle of his chest had him a little distracted, so he wasn't really paying attention to who was around him as he approached the front door.

As Steven slowly lowered the hood of his Nike jacket, his friend just smiled at him. But her smile quickly turned into a frown when she noticed how 'short' Steven seemed to be.

Andrea's jaw once again fell open in shock, this time at the sight of her friend Liz's ponytailed head affixed to Steven's tall, broad-shouldered body. \"Oh my! Er...how are you Liz?\" Andrea asked, trying to act as normal as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz for her part had heard Andrea's voice and so she wasn't surprised to see her. Andrea had always been the one Liz talked to whenever she was down in the dumps or annoyed, so in actual fact she was happy to see her. \"Oh...I'm just great!\" Liz grumbled sarcastically, as she gave Steven a scowl. Liz then glanced back at Andrea and caught her staring at her crotch, which made her feel a little embarrassed. \"Yes, its a penis, ...Steven's penis! And yes I have an erection because I CAN'T CONTROL THE DAMN THING!\" Liz suddenly snapped, raising her voice considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea just looked down at the floor, and then looked over at Steven, who was playing with Liz's former breasts. \"Steven? Are you responsible for this?\" Andrea inquired, very much like a mother would try to wrangle an admission of guilt out of her son if he'd done something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...this device is, not me personally!\" he answered, showing Andrea the gun. \"And I wasn't the only one pulling the trigger either\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to swap us back you idiot!\" Liz spat at him, folding her arms across her flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...great job!\" Steven smirked, gesturing down to his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea quickly interjected. \"Ok enough, both of you! Give me that thing!\" she said, holding her hand out. Steven handed over the 'gun' and proceeded to tell Andrea all about the secret room, the pedestal and basically how they had come into acquisition of the thing and what they had done with it. Meanwhile, Liz had slumped herself in a chair and was trying to ignore the hard-on between her legs. She glanced at the clock and let out a worried sigh, she knew Eric could be back from work at any time if he finished early, as he often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we obviously have no idea how this works\" Andrea concluded as she studied the gun. \"Firing it at each other after the first swap wasn't very bright now was it?\" she admonished her two younger friends, who were now sulking. \"Liz, my family is away for a couple of weeks if you want to come and stay at my place?\" Andrea then offered. \"We can tell Eric you just need some time alone...perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that'll just piss him off!\" Liz grumbled in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the alternative is you staying here and hoping he doesn't mind seeing your head on another man's body!\" Andrea said, arching an eyebrow. \"Because the last thing we need to do is use this thing again\" she continued, holding up the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Liz sighed, then she scowled again when she saw Steven with 'her' hand down 'his' hip-hugger jeans. \"HEY!\" she shouted at him, making him stop abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven...please stop doing that in front of Liz, that is her body after all\" Andrea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Steven grumbled again, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea then continued looking at Steven. \"And...you're welcome to stop at my place too you know, since you can hardly be seen walking around like that\" she said. \"All we can do is hope the effects of this thing 'wear off' or something. If not...well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That takes care of the problem at home, but what about work, I'm the supervisor, I need to be there!\" Liz mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea seemed at a loss for a solution this time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without thinking she moved to answer the door, only to be reminded by Liz of the current situation, that she and Steven had swapped bodies from the neck down. \"Are you kidding Andrea??\" Liz spat quietly, gesturing down to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...er...Carly will understand, she's like me\" Andrea replied, dismissing Liz's concerns out of hand, which only annoyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I want her to see me like this!\" Liz insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven put his suitcase down and glanced over at Liz, still not used to seeing her pretty head fastened to her taller body. \"Look, we can't hide from everyone!\" he told her, but Liz just scowled at him in response. She blamed him for their predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let her in, but don't expect me to stick around\" Liz grumbled, before disappearing into her bedroom and slamming the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea and Steven both looked at each other and rolled their eyes, before the former answered the door. \"Hiya sweetheart, what are you doing here?\" Andrea greeted her daughter, who was surprised to see her mother standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey mum, is Liz here? I wanted to give this birthday card to her\" Carly smiled, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better come in, we've got a 'problem' here\" Andrea informed her daughter, gently closing the door behind her after inviting her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Steven's face, Carly smiled. \"Oh hey Steven, you here too?\" she greeted him, before moving over to a chair to sit down, apparently oblivious to the difference in Steven's height and build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah, I'm here!\" Steven replied, as he slipped his feminine hands into his jean pockets, catching Liz's engagement and wedding rings on the fabric as he did so. He then looked down at his ample bosom and waited to see how long it would take for Carly to notice that he was Liz from the neck down. Andrea also remained silent, thinking it best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>What happens next?</b></i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Steven could answer, Carly then saw the two massive 'protrusions' that were pushing out the front of his Nike hooded top. \"What the hell...\" Carl gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not cross-dressing sweetheart, those are Liz's clothes...and that's Liz's body\" Andrea chimed in, but of course Carly was in a state of disbelief. Andrea then held up the mysterious 'gun' and explained how Steven and Liz had shot each other with it several times and switched bodies from the neck down a bit at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Carly finally drew her hands away from her mouth and got to her feet, approaching Steven. Used to being so much shorter than Steven, Carly was now amazed to be standing slightly taller than him with her heels on. \"This is amazing!\" she exclaimed, staring at Steven's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, pretty much!\" Steven nodded, as he somehow refrained from grabbing his boobs in his slender hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where's Liz?\" Carly asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea let out a sigh, then replied to her daughter's question. \"Oh she's not a happy bunny, she's in the bedroom, she doesn't want you to see her like she is\" Andrea explained, and Carly looked genuinely concerned. But her focus soon shifted back to the body Steven now possessed from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This your way of getting into her knickers?\" Carly joked, trying to lighten the mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven decided it best not to respond to that statement. He just chuckled nervously and looked down at himself again. Andrea then explained to Carly her plan for both Liz and Steven to stay at her house for a while, until they could (hopfully) figure out a way to return them to normal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That sight was Liz's head affixed to Steven's body, and the first thing that became apparent was how much taller Liz now was. \"Um...hi Liz, ...Happy Birthday?\" Carly muttered, holding up her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happy about it Carly?? I've lost my boobs and I have an erection that won't go away\" Liz grumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Squawk!! Mardy bum!\"</i> Liz's grey parrot Peter suddenly said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it you!\" Liz snapped at the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven smiled and turned away to hide it, Andrea just shook her head at Liz. \"Don't take it out on him\" she told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked Liz up and down for a moment, and she recognized the body as Steven's alright, and the clothes she was wearing. \"Are you...okay?\" Carly asked, realizing it was a pretty stupid question to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look okay?\" Liz growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it could be worse, you could have an older body, or a much younger one\" Carly said. \"At least you swapped with someone you know\" she then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't really make me feel that much better luv\" Liz mumbled. \"Neither does the fact that Steven keeps playing with MY boobs whenever he thinks we're not looking\" she said, throwing a scowl in Steven's direction. \"See what I mean!\" she said, pointing to Steven, who was once again groping his massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Steven apologized, withdrawing his feminine hands from his promiment chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just looked at Steven and shook her head in a mixture of amusement and annoyance. That said, she could maybe understand why he was always playing with his new 'assets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you lot, lets get to my house\" Andrea suddenly interrupted, clapping her hands together. And as Andrea was trying to keep the exchanges between Liz and Steven civil, Carly approached the trait swapping gun and picked it up, inspecting it. She couldn't believe what it had apparently done to her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch that!\" Andrea suddenly berated her daughter like a little girl, taking the device off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sorry mum!\" Carly said in a surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want what's happened to these two to happen to you\" Andrea said, gesturing to Liz and Steven.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz frowned...and then groaned as she put her hands on her stomach. \"What the hell...?\" she mumbled, as she felt her breasts lightened with them shrinking.  She instinctively stood with her legs apart in an attempt to relieve the pressure, it was as though her tank top felt loose. A few moments later...and Liz could tell that her chest was flat. She felt her nipples reshaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!\" Liz squealed as she saw that her chest was flat.. \"What's happened to me?\" she then screeched, not noticing that Steven was too worried about his own changes, which were happening simultaneously to Liz's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven felt his own stomach tense up, and he grunted as they did so, he then experienced what could only have been described as a sucking sensation as his chest was expanding making his stomach hurt until they were H-cups. An even more uncomfortable sensation then overcame him as his chest were quickly budding themselves to female nipples. The 'pained' expression on his face then diminished a little, and he felt an enormous weight pulling on his own chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down...it was hard for him to hide his delight when he saw his t-shirt stretched out in front by a pair of large...very familiar breasts. \"Wow!\" he gasped. He then reached up with his hands and took hold of his new boobs, giving them a squeeze confirming he wasn't imagining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz....my...my chest...is...its...gone!\" Steven gasped in shock, looking up at his friend as he felt his enormous chest. His shock only increased when he saw Liz patting the evident flat chest in her own, extremely loose tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is my...my...you know!\" Liz nodded in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them then instinctively looked at the weird looking gun, which Liz had dropped on the floor once the 'changes' began. \"I...I...think that thing did it, it made us switch chests!\" Liz then murmured. \"This...this is YOUR chest I've got!\" she then stated to Steven, gesturing to her flat chest. \"And you've...oh my god...you've got MY chest!\" she then gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just looked down at himself in disbelief, hardly believing what had happened. \"Okay...er...shoot me with it again, maybe it'll reverse it\" Steven suggested in haste, but Liz shook her head. \"No...no way! she said firmly, \"It might cause some other changes, I'm not even touching that thing again!\" she said, as she tried to get used to the 'extremely loose' tank top. \"This feels so weird!\" she muttered quietly, staring down at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again!\" Steven responded, while patting his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!! How am I going to hide this from Eric?\" Liz then asked, starting to panic. She looked at Steven as though he could give her an answer to solve the problem she had...that they both had...but he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Steven shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is funny??\" Liz then asked him, her anger growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Liz, you've got to admit this is amazing!\" Steven said to her, gesturing to the gun without removing his hands from his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to swap back, I can't let Eric see me like this!\" Liz panicked, as she peered down her tank top and saw her loose-hanging bra and flat, slightly hairy chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you going to hide those from your family and friends?\" Liz then asked Steven, pointing at the breasts that used to be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just shrugged, and kept feeling himself up. \"Not sure!\" he mumbled, apparently not caring too much. The more he groped his breasts and tweaked his nipples, the more aroused her got, and he could feel his penis hardening. Liz however wasn't stupid, and she knew what was happening. \"Unless you want to experience how sensitive they are right here in the living room, I suggest you stop feeling your...MY breasts\" she advised Steven, looking at him sternly, hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough!\" Steven shrugged again. \"But er...I'll need your bra to keep these babies secure\" he then winked, jiggling his boobs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unimpressed Liz took off her tops, (now that she had nothing to hide), and unclasped her bra, before handing it to Steven. Both he and Liz herself couldn't believe how weird she looked with now breasts, and she quickly put her tank top and jacket back on to cover up. \"Be back in a jiffy!\" Steven then grinned, as he went into one of the spare bedrooms to put 'his' bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" Liz grumbled, as she picked up the strange looking gun to study it some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Steven, she was eager to reverse the 'damage' it had done.</span></div></div>",

Just wait until your back starts aching!\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean the breasts, I meant the bra!\" Steven responded. \"How could I not love having these babies.?\" he then grinned, grabbing his large, heavy breasts in his hands again and giving them a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just let out a sigh and bit her tongue. Like most other women, she couldn't totally understand the male obsession with big breasts. Steven was no different, and now he had a pair of his own to play with... hers. \"Look, can you stop feeling yourself up and... I don't know... help me? We need to figure out how to reverse this or we're screwed.\" she complained, idly scratching her own, flat chest through her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shrugged. \"The only way I can see of correcting this is to use that thing again. I mean... its not as though it came with an instruction manual.\" Steven said to a distraught Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and what if it swaps something else between us?\" Liz asked. \"We can't take that risk!\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm gonna have to leave soon anyway.\" Steven then told Liz,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just looked up at Steven... and frowned, as though she couldn't understand what he had just said. It sounded that stupid. \"Are you brain dead?? You're not going anywhere Steven, not with my boobs. How would you explain them to your family and friends anyway?\" she said. \"You're staying here until we can set this whole thing right.\" she then told him forcefully, even as he began groping his breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about work?\" Steven asked, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the supervisor at work, I know how important it is, but THIS is more important. I WANT MY BREASTS BACK!\" she shouted, losing her temper. And with that Steven decided not to try and aggravate her any further. Though constantly playing with his new tits seemed to be doing that. Just then there was a knock on the door, and Liz and Steven both looked at each other in shock. A few moments later... there was another knock, and Liz heard her friend Andrea's familiar voice. \"Liz sweetie, are you in there?\" she shouted through the door. \"I've got your birthday card luv.\" Andrea was a full-figured woman in her early fifties and a co-worker of Liz and Steven's, and she was the mother of their close friend Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gonna answer your door?\" Steven inquired, looking at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And say WHAT exactly when she notices that I have no boobs!\" she replied in a loud, angry whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just ignore her, she knows you're home because your car is parked outside.\" Steven reminded her. \"Maybe she'll be the understanding sort, you know how open-minded Andrea is.\" Steven explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rubbed her eyes and let out a sigh, letting Steven's words rattle around in her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And she was about to remove the ring when it was as though it suddenly adjusted in size to fit her slender finger. \"What the bloody hell...?\" she muttered, before looking at Steven and holding up her hand for him to see. \"It didn't fit a second ago, now it does!\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Steven asked her, frowning a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course I am you idiot!\" Liz snapped back. \"Um...I'm sorry, I just...\" she then started apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its okay, it was a stupid question, I'm sorry!\" Steven interrupted her. He then slid the other ring onto his left, second finger, but it only went so far up. \"Mine is too small!\" he said with a raised eyebrow. Seconds later however...he was able to slide the ring all way up his finger, a perfect fit. \"Er...I d...don't know what to say!\" Steven stuttered, as he inspected his new piece of jewelry. \"It fits now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I wasn't imagining it!\" Liz affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never said you were luv!\" Steven muttered, almost incoherently, as they both suddenly began feeling light headed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although she hadn't noticed, her own jeans were now considerably looser around her own waist. \"These trainers are usually really comfortable, I don't get it!\" Liz frowned, looking down at her shoes, which still fit her, but not as well as they did a short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are these jeans!\" Steven grunted, adjusting his belt again. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His hips had taken on a distinct feminine appearance, which explained why his jeans no longer fit him.

He then cleared his throat a little, noticing a change to his voice also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz...have you got that robe yet?\" Steven called out from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for an answer, Steven looked down at his chest, now almost hairless and his nipples had grown in size.

It was like a scene out of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and they both began feeling 'funny'. \"Holy shit! What did you do?\" a shocked Steven asked Liz, who didn't respond, instead she just looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Liz's jeans began to loosen around her waist and she watched as her breasts began shrinking. Her sneakers suddenly got a little tight and the sleeves of her jacket started retreating up her arms as she grew some eight inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, Steven shrank in height, and he felt his jeans becoming tight around his waist and backside, his boots suddenly became a little too large for his feet and he felt a pressure in his chest... shortly before he started growing a huge pair of tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then grabbed at her ponytail... shortly before it disappeared as her hair was sucked into her scalp. \"What the fuck is happening?\" she screamed... her voice now several octaves lower... as she grabbed at her flat chest. \"Oh my god!!! My boobs!!\" she cried. Then it got worse for her as she felt something 'pushing out' from her groin, straining her knickers. She felt two distinct 'pops' as two testicles emerged underneath her new penis. \"Jesus...I've got a... DICK!!\" she then shouted out in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute or so it was over, and Liz looked over to Steven... and her jaw fell open in absolute shock. She was staring at herself... dressed in Steven's clothes and wearing his glasses. She dropped the wand on the floor and took a good look down at herself.. grabbing at the bulge in her jeans. \"We swapped bodies!!\" she then said in a somewhat subdued tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...fuck!\" Steven exclaimed in Liz's voice, as he grabbed the large, unrestrained boobs that now stretched out his t-shirt. His hair was now long and untidy, his jeans were cutting into his widened mid-section, forcing him to unfasten them. But they were now also way too long for his shorter, more feminine legs. \"I'm...you?\" he asked Liz, as he removed his glasses, which he no longer needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I covered that with <i>'we swapped bodies'</i> you idiot!\" Liz spat, grabbing the glasses from Steven and putting them on. \"Woah... weird!\" she gasped, as her her poor eyesight adjusted to the lenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then looked at the wand on the floor while rubbing the 'void' between his legs. \"Maybe we shouldn't have messed with that thing!\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz immediately picked the wand back up and frantically tried to reverse their body swap, but to no avail. \"Grrr, its not working!\" she growled. \"Look, our clothes don't fit us now, lets trade until we sort this thing out\" she then sighed, beginning to strip out of her ill-fitting clothes and sneakers. Steven then did the same, neither one seeming too bothered about seeing each other naked in their current forms. Minutes later Steven was dressed in Liz's underwear, and he was relieved to have his heavy new breasts secured by her bra. He soon slipped on her jeans and black tank top, then slipped his slender feet into her sneakers and put on her Nike top. Then he turned to Liz, who had already got dressed in Steven's boxer shorts, black jeans, boots and t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... now what??\" Steven asked, digging his knickers out of his ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we learn how this stupid thing works and fix this\" Liz repsonded, retrieving the wand and inspecting it again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz's clothes were disappearing as she stood there examining the \"wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they weren't disappearing, he realized as the skin on her body became almost totally visible. The clothes were fading, but they were still there. He could see the outlines of them and their stitches. It seemed like an x-ray picture except he couldn't see through her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tried to picture Liz's skeleton, but her skin wouldn't let him. It was a cloak over all her innards. A pale wrapping, except for the nipples and areolas that were a milk chocolate brown. Her massive mounds were held up in the bra like a delectable offering. He almost reached out to hold them. They looked so soft and fondleable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I had those breasts, I'd want them to be fondled,</i> he thought. In fact, he always thought Liz had great boobs even though he had never seen them out in the flesh. <i>They're what I'd want to have as tits if I had tits,</i> he mused while unconsciously raising his hands toward his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wand. But I wonder what it does,\" Liz murmured as she turned the thing over in her hands holding it right at waist level. \"What could it be used for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words drew Steven's attention away from the billowy muffins framed in the outline of Liz's transparent bra and broke his action about to grab his own non-existent breasts. Behind the wand Steven could see Liz's navel centered on her round tummy. <i>The wand would be a perfect fit in that,</i> he thought for some strange reason. It's just that she was holding it out in front of her and, to Steven, poking her belly seemed the obvious thing to do so that the wand would protrude from it like an antenna on a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't chubby, exactly, but she didn't have a flat waist either. Carly had a flat waist. He had seen it a few times when she wore a midriff-exposing blouse and once when they were all the beach and she had on a bikini.

Upon reaching the desk, Liz and Steven saw that the 'figure' was in fact an elderly man with a long white beard and a grey cloak, very much like Gandalf from Lord of the Rings...minus the pointy hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, visitors!\" the man muttered in a frail, deep voice as he looked up from his parchment. \"Been a while since I had anyone come see me, in fact...I can't really remember the last time I had guests\" the old man frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah, okay, what are we doing here?\" Steven asked, realizing it was a stupid question that would probably beget a stupid reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't know young man, I certainly don't!\" the elderly man responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just nodded and looked upwards into the blackness. \"Yep, thought so!\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past Steven, the old man smiled at Liz. \"Greetings young lady, I hope I find you well?\" he said to her as he got to his feet. \"Oooh...my word, I'm certainly feeling every one of my 607 years!\" he groaned, holding his back as he straightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...fine, thanks!\" Liz meekly replied to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah...hold on, you're 607 years old?\" Steven suddenly blurted out. \"How's that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man turned to Steven and let out a deep sigh. \"Time has no meaning here, but I decided to keep track of my birthdays all the same, I did almost lose count on a few occasions, in fact...I almost forgot my name once or twice\" the old man rambled, even chuckling. \"Anyway, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Eorlund Morrowind, at your service\" he continued, bowing to Steven and Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live here?\" Liz asked, glancing around...and seeing nothing except the small desk, on which were scattered Eorlund's quill, inkwell and parchments, and a staff with a jewel-encrusted tip was propped up against the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund frowned at the question. \"I suppose you could say I'm the caretaker here my dear young lady\" he then answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking care of...what exactly? There's nothing here!\" Steven pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn 'annoyed' sigh escaped the old man's lips. \"You're mistaken young sir, there is 'everything' here, your mind is just not advanced enough to comprehend the wonders of this place\" he smirked at Steven, who didn't seem impressed with the little 'dig' at his intelligence. \"This place exists outside the realm of your own reality, yet they are closer than you would think. As you have seen, only a doorway stands between us\" the white-haired individual explained to his two guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get the point of you being here\" Liz said with a shake of her head. \"I mean, what's YOUR purpose here, what do you do?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...observe!\" the old man replied, coughing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Observe what?\" Steven interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your world, and everyone in it, but...I'm not allowed to 'interfere' so to speak\" Eorlund replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interfere?\" Steven then asked, his curiosity peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear I've already said too much!\" Eorlund said out loud, his voice echoing out. But then he moved closer to Steven and Liz, and gestured to his staff, propped up by the desk. \"I um...have the power to 'alter' things in your world\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Liz asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reality...as it is, well...I can change it in any way I want with a mere thought...and my staff\" Eorlund smiled, before nervously looking around him and backing off a little, as if he was afraid of being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" Steven suddenly said, causing Eorlund to scowl at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I speak the truth, and there's no need for such profanity!\" the old man admonished Steven. He then turned around and paced back over to his desk a lot faster than when he had approached Liz and Steven. Grabbing hold of his staff, the jewel in the tip immediately began to glow. \"I could give you a demonstration if you like\" Eorlund then whispered loudly...before smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Liz just looked at each other, unsure what to say next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven wasn\u2019t sure what or who the hell this old man was, but he was quite sure he didn\u2019t want to be around when he showed up again...whenever that was.  The two ran like crazy through the darkness until the wooden door came into view.  \"There it is!  Keep going!\u201d Steven shouted, excited that the two were almost home.  He ran up to the door.  Thankfully, the door locked only from the outside.  Steven put his shoulder down, ramming the door, and it flew open as he and Liz bounded through the opening.  Steven, panting and nearly out of breath, turned and quickly locked the door, then turned his back to it and just leaned back, basically slumping on the door as he tried to catch his breath.  He smiled and chuckled a bit as he gasped for air.  He looked over at his companion, \"That was a bloody close one, eh Liz?\u201d he said with a tired but relieved tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven looked over at Liz, he noted she was...different.  Instead of struggling to get her breath, Liz stood there in relative calm.  In fact, she was smiling a bit.  A strange smirk adorned her face as her hands seemed to probe her body, working their way up from her wide hips to her belly and all the way up to the wonderful globes that adorned her chest, nearly visible already through the thin tank-top she had worn for her jog.  \"Liz?\u201d Steven asked uneasily.  Liz looked up with a weird smile, \u201cClose enough I'd say, my boy!\u201d she said, but her voice was different.  In fact, it wasn't her voice at all; it was that of the old man from the cabinet!  Steven's jaw dropped to the floor, and he began to slowly back up.  Liz, or rather the man inside her, still groping her body, looked for a minute at Steven.  Her smiling face seemed to contort and change for a moment...it shifted...into the old, wrinkled, and bearded face of Eorlund!  It did so for just a split second, then shifted back into Liz\u2019s smiling profile.  \"Oh my god!\u201d Steven said, terrified, as he tried to run.  Suddenly, the staff from before appeared in Liz's hand, \"You're not excused yet, boy!\u201d he said as he pointed the staff at Steven, who suddenly found himself in mid-air.  Liz then turned the staff a little, and Steven was turned around to face his tormentor.  \"And 'Goddess' is probably more accurate while I'm in this body,\u201d Eorlund said with a slight chuckle, this time using Liz's real voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?!  With her?!\u201d Steven demanded as he hung in the air.  \"Release!\u201d the old man shouted from inside Liz, \"See...when I'm in that damn box, I can't do any more than tweak your world...but I had just enough power to compel an old lady to give you the key to my prison!  Turns out I can\u2019t get out myself, luckily Liz here was kind enough to assist me in that regard,\u201d he said as he motioned to the woman he now possessed.  \"Let us both go you old bastard!!!\u201d Steven thundered in a rage.  Liz frowned, \"Now why would I want to do that?\u201d Eorlund said with a smile, \"I want to give you something,\u201d he said.  \"I\u2019ve been given a new lease on life and a new opportunity to make you mortals my playthings...I've been given this nice young body!\u201d he said, \"it's only fair that you get something too!\u201d he said as he pointed the staff menacingly in Steven's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?<br>\r\n1) Turns Steven into a curvy, buxom woman.  The idea here is that physical changes will be fairly quick, with mental changes occurring over time once Steven is in his new body.  This mental transformation should take the form of a female persona fighting and gradually beating Steven\u2019s mentally male self.<br>\r\n2) He makes Steven his willing slave.<br>\r\n3) He tells Steven that his current male body is unsatisfactory and that he must pick from among a number of female bodies to occupy.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd had rathered you accept willingly, but now it seems I need to resort to Plan B.\" Eorlund said in Liz's voice. Her eyes began to radiate a blue energy and Steven couldn't take his gaze away.

Steven nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master.

Slowly, two large breasts formed on his chest, his hair became long and red, and his penis disappeared into a new, womanly part. He even got in better shape, giving the new woman a curvaceous body and making her absolutely stunning. Once this was done, some sexy new clothing was added, giving the slave tight black leggings, a tight red tank top, and black and red high heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you look absolutely stunning now don't you?\" the being wearing Liz's body said, smiling.

And who knows what kind of strange thing Eorland might do to him; might as well be someone attractive, like Natalie.  25 years old, 5 foot 6, shoulder length hair, and B-cup breasts.  There was no doubt about it, she was definitely very hot!  Steven always secretly, deep-down wondered what it would be like to be a girl, and if he had to choose someone to possess, a girl like Natalie might be perfect for starters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, fine choice, my boy; very fine choice!\"  Eorland says using Liz's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-will it hurt?

Nobody was in the area, so it's not like it caused a scene.  A second later, Steven opened his eyes and even though there were a few eye flashes here and there, everything was fine.... well, except for the fact that it was clear he was in Natalie's body.  She was shorter, younger, and her breasts looked like they ballooned out from her chest (or at least it felt that way to Steven).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven inspected his very attractive new body.  Feeling the soft, silky brunette hair that draped right down to his shoulders.  He loved the sensation of taking his hand and tracing his shoulders down to his hips, feeling the curves of his body, his new curves.  Steven then took his soft, dainty hands and gently lifted his breasts up a few times, feeling the light weight of them.  He then took his hand and went inside his shirt, past his bra, just to quickly touch his nipple, which caused a nice pleasurable shiver to tingle down his spine, turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're enjoying yourself there, my boy.\"  Eorland says in his own voice with a smile, but this time he was inside another beautiful girl named Claire.  Steven didn't know much about her, other than the fact that she was a per diem worker who worked only every so often due to college work.  Claire walked closer up to Natalie, put her small hand up onto her cheek, and then gave her a slow, passionate French kiss.  She made sure to move her tongue all around inside Natalie's mouth, inspecting every inch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like minutes (but actually only seconds), Claire pulled back and looked into Natalie's eyes with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna continue?  I can show you all the real fun of being a girl\"  Claire says to Natalie, with a devious smile.</span></div></div>",

True enough, his new body was seriously turned on, but he didn't want to let Eorlund know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert? I think not!\" Eorlund sighed, his deep voice leaving Claire's pouty lips. \"I just want to show you a good time, and here you are throwing up these barriers, it isn't very sporting of you now is it?\" he muttered, standing there with his feminine hands on Claire's curvy hips. He then grinned again...and disappeared in front of Steven's pretty new eyes, only to rematerialize again moments later behind Steven. \"Now are you going to cooperate...or do I have to take more drastic action?\" Eorlund chuckled, as he reached around and groped Natalie's sensitive breasts, eliciting a moan from Steven. But once again...he wriggled loose from the old man's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...its just all going a little too fast, and this is...my friend's body after all\" Steven said, making up an excuse to put off what was probably inevitable. \"Ever hear of guilt?\" he asked Eorlund, before rolling his eyes...\"No...I don't suppose you have!\" Steven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its your body now my young friend, for all intents and purposes...you are Natalie, her friends, her family and all her co-workers have always known you as Natalie, so what's the big deal?\" Eorlund explained, shrugging Claire's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big deal is that it should be Natalie in her own body and not me!\" Steven pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sod the morals, they ruin everything!\" Eorlund stated bluntly, this time in his host's sweet sounding voice. \"Just think of the fun that you can have living life as an attractive young female\" he grinned again, slowly approaching Steven again, and this time he didn't back off. Eorlund used Claire's tongue to lick her own lips and then he kissed Steven again...on his own, luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now doesn't that feel...right?\" Eorlund whispered gently, as he then slipped one of his host's hands down the front of Natalie's pants and found the moist folds of Steven's new vagina. All Steven could do was let out a subdued moan of pleasure....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surely you wish you could look better and not like the unremarkable schlub you currently are, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven winced, it was true but having Liz, even if it was just some creepy old wizard controlling her body, say that stung. \"Well yes, of course I want to look better. Everyone does.\" Steven replied, \"But I would rather do it on my own or at least in my own body. Not stealing the body and life of another person. Couldn't you just, perhaps, alter me to be more handsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk appeared on Liz's face, \"I could do that, yes.\" Eorlund stated, \"But that's boring. Where's the fun in that? When you've been stuck outside reality forced only to observe for centuries on end you want fun and excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't include me in that fun and excitement because I don't want any part of it.\" Steven declared emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to willingly go along with this?\" asked Eorlund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shook his head, \"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then if you won't choose, I will make your decision for you.\" Eorlund stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at Eorlund in surprise. \"Make my decision for me? Just what are you talk--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Steven could finish his thought there was a flash of bright light. As vision came back to Steven he noticed that he was back in the hardware store, middle of the afternoon from the look of outside he thought. He instantly noticed that he had shrunk in height and was much skinnier. He noticed a bit of black hair that seemed to stop around his shoulder and looking down noticed that the standard store shirt covered a pair of pert, average sized breasts; a star and crescent pendant resting over the shirt. And on that shirt was a nametag that Steven was taken aback by when he read it: \"MONA\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona Nazari, the cute Iranian girl who worked with Steven at the hardware store... he was now in her body. \"Why?\" he wondered to himself under his breath, \"Why am I in Mona's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I told you, Persian girls make fine vessels. Figured I'd show you first hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven spun around at the sound of the voice, much lighter, higher and cheerier than he was expecting. Even more surprising to him, he was greeted by the smiling face of the blue haired Becca, another worker at the store who was known for her cheery personality and constantly changing hair colors. \"Eorlund?\" he asked in shock. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I figured that if I was going to put you inside of her it might be better if I went a bit younger myself. Keep you company and all that.\" Eorlund stated, \"This girl has a nice bum by the way, seriously check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Eorlund grabbed Steven's now daintier hand and placed it onto Becca's butt. He quickly pulled away, \"Stop that! Someone else might see us!\" He snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if they do?\" Eorlund smiled, \"Isn't that type of relationship much more accepted nowadays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mona! Becca!\" came the voice of the now de-possessed Liz as she appeared from the back of the store before Steven could reply. \"Looks like we're going to be especially slow today so if you two like you can take the rest of the day off. Eric should be coming in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" Steven asked wondering why Liz's husband suddenly worked at the store, \"I thought I--er, Steven was your go to guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven who?\" Liz asked, \"You know nobody works here by that name. Anyway run along you two and have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned to Eorlund in astonishment, \"What's going on? Since when don't I work here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I should've mentioned that, huh?\" Eorlund replied, \"I already told you I can re-write reality so when I put you into the lovely body of Mona here it had the side effect of erasing 'Steven' from existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't exist anymore?!\" Steven exclaimed, his voice rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you still exist... but think of it as if you've always been Mona. 'Steven', your physical self that is, no longer exists.\" Eorlund explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grabbed the old man wearing Becca's body by the collar, \"Well change me back!\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time, perhaps.\" Eorlund said, \"But for now have fun. I want you to experience more than your boring, drab existence. Be Mona and then, perhaps, I'll let you have this.\" he continued gesturing towards Becca's body, \"And be some of your other co-workers, maybe even Liz. Be an American girl, be a celebrity... be everyone! Experience life from all kinds of viewpoints and visit all kinds of places... and bodies!\" With that Eorlund grabbed Steven's hands and placed them once more on Becca's butt, \"In fact, what do you say we get out of here, go somewhere private and visit these bodies a little more intimately.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not stealing Mona's body!\" he insisted. \"And you're not stealing Becca's either, he then said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only borrowing this vessel!\" Eorlund giggled in Becca's high pitched tone, \"but if you refuse to go with me on my travels...I'll make sure that you remain in that delightful little Persian 'package' permanently\" he 'politely' threatened Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down a little, Steven let go of Becca's collar and backed off, taking another moment to look down at himself. His slender hands rested gently on his pert breasts as he looked down at Mona's trousers and converse shoes...that were now his, along with every other item of clothing. After squeezing his breasts slightly, he removed his right hand and took hold of the pendant around his neck. He couldn't believe what Eorlund had done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go somewhere a little more private before you start 'exploring' that body\" Eorlund suddenly whispered to him, and this time it was his own, deep voice that left Becca's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glanced at him, and having the old man so close (even in a friend's body) sent a shiver down Steven's new spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where exactly were you planning on going on these 'travels' of yours?\" Steven inquired, as a sigh escaped his luscious new lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund again flashed Steven one of Becca's cheekiest smiles. \"Anywhere!\" he exclaimed, throwing his feminine hands in the air in an idle gesture. \"But why don't we just start with a walk around this quaint little town of yours, I've already noticed that you have a 'variety' of people living here, all different races and ages, it should be fun to mess around with them am I right?\" he then rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like screwing up people's lives don't you?\" Steven said in disgust, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't know anything, I change reality too remember, and besides, like I said...this world is boring, it needs someone like me to liven it up a little\" Eorlund explained, as he suddenly grabbed Steven's new hands and placed them on Becca's breasts. \"They feel nice...correct?\" he grinned. \"Not as large as Liz's I know, but still pleasurable\" he winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Steven pulled his hands away and looked around nervously. \"Stop that!\" he grumbled at his 'tormentor'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" Eorlund suddenly stated, looking down at himself. \"These clothes won't do!\" he said, as he tugged on Becca's company sweatshirt and peered down at her black jeans and blue &amp; pink sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always dresses like that, and plus...we are at work!\" Steven again muttered in Mona's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I'm the one 'driving' now, and this outfit simply will not do!\" the old man stated firmly from inside his host body. And with that...he waved Becca's right hand in the air..and enveloped himself in a swirl of glowing energy. In mere seconds...Becca's drab clothing transformed into a hot pink thong, a form-fitting blue dress that acentuated her large ass and a pair of matching blue pumps with 3-inch stiletto heels. A diamond necklace also appeared around Becca's neck, and a matching bracelet on each wrist. \"Ahhh, much better!\" Eorlund said in his host's voice as he patted down her body with her own hands. He then ran his now manicured fingers through his blue hair...which matched the color of his dress and shoes perfectly.\"Blue always was my favorite color!\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just stood there staring...Mona's jaw agape as he did so. \"Wow!\" he muttered under his breath. He had to admit Becca looked hot dressed in such a feminine manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, would you like a new outfit, or are you content as you are?\" a giddy Eorlund asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" Steven replied, unsure what to say.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bye bye.'', Eorlund chirped cheekily as Becca winked. In that instant, her clothes changed back into the company's shirt and everything went back into normal, except of course that Steven was still in Mona's body, nervously looking around and frantically searching for Eorlund, whereever he might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eorlund smiled as he examined his new self. Through the vanity mirror, he saw himself, now a 5' 6'' tall brunette squeezing her own boobs, chuckling delightfully. Eorlund was sure that soon, Steven would not be able to thank him enough for the new experiences. For the moment though, Eorlund wanted to get more intimate with his new found body, years of 'imprisonment' had deprived him of such pleasure - not to mention made him as eccentric as the Mad Hatter - as his power is limited only to work in a lesser dimension such as the 'real' world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund chuckled as he took off Natalie's clothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day in the hardware store went on as normal. During break, Steven went to the bathroom, almost entering the men's room before two mounds of flesh hanging on him reminded him that he was no longer his old self. Steven stared at the mirror, pinching himself to make sure that he was not in a dream. After inflicting a few red marks on himself, Steven was convinced that he was not dreaming and in fact he no longer was Steven. He was and always had been Mona, 18 years old and of Iranian descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glanced downwards at his borrowed cleavage. Although, he had scorned Eorlund before, he was also turned on by his present predicament.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was surprised to see his friend Natalie standing there. \"What....?\" he muttered, before seeing the broad grin on Natalie's face. \"I might have known!\" he then sighed, realizing that his tormentor had found a new 'vessel'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what you think!\" Steven sneered, in answer to Eorlund's question. \"You might not have any respect for my friends' bodies, but I do!\" he then informed the mischievous old man firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't last!\" Eorlund giggled in Natalie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...why isn't everyone else wondering what we're talking about?\" Steven suddenly asked as he gestured with Mona's arms. \"Surely they can HEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!\" he then said, raising his feminine voice. But he didn't get any reaction from Liz, who was at the Help Desk dealing with a customer complaint, or any of the customers walking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've fixed it so we don't get bothered with stupid questions\" Eorlund responded, as he folded Natalie's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...great!\" Steven sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to change your attitude if we're going to start having fun\" Eorlund then said to Steven, as he walked over to him.

As Eorlund expertly teased Mona's clit...Steven felt her legs give way beneath him, and he slumped to her knees, the back of his head now nestled snugly between Liz's large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any more proof of my sexual knowledge?\" Eorlund then asked, this time in Liz's own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Steven gasped, shaking his head, as Liz's hands were withdrawn from Mona's knickers. \"Good girl!\" Eorlund then said to him condescendingly, before helping Steven to 'Mona's' feet. As Steven zipped his pants back up, Eorlund began groping the huge bosom that he was once again the owner of. \"I'll say it again though, your friend Liz here is certainly blessed for someone of her size\" the old man 'giggled' as he played with Liz's tits. \"I may have to keep coming back to his vessel\" he then added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glared at Eorlund, who knew exactly how Steven felt about Liz, and he didn't need his powers to figure it out. \"There are plenty of other girls out there with big breasts you know\" Steven grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm well aware, but you're not as attached to them as you are to Liz now are you?\" Eorlund responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Steven stated in Mona's sweet tone, wanting to change the subject. \"Now what? We just going to stay here all the time? Sounds pretty boring to me!\" he told Eorlund as he folded his arms under his perky little boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience my fiery little Persian temptress!\" the old man joked in response, Liz's voice having changed back to Eorlund's own, baritone voice. \"There's still fun to be had around here I'm sure\" he muttered, as he watched Helen assisting a male customer nearby. And further down the aisle...Becky and Charlotte were tidying up some shelves and also helping customers when the need arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fun??\" Steven asked, then suddenly wishing that he hadn't done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund just grinned again from inside Liz's body....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Going into a cubicle, Eorlund pushed Steven down onto the closed toilet seat...and crouched down in front of him, grinning. <i>\"This guy's just a huge, old pervert!\"</i> Steven thought, as he watched Carly's manicured hands unzipping Mona's trousers and pulling out his new cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why some females have an aversion to such practises\" Eorlund said, as he then began sucking on the bulbous head of Steven's erect penis, causing him to groan in Mona's voice in the process. A few minutes later...Steven shot his load into Carly's mouth, and Eorlund seemed to savor every drop of cum as he swallowed and licked his \"borrowed\" lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, delicious, and very healthy I've heard\" the old man chuckled, now using his own voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for the real test!\" Eorlund winked, as he took off Carly's knickers, lifting each leg at a time as he did so, and the clicking sound of the heels on Carly's shoes turned Steven on as they made contact with the floor again. The 'horny' immortal being then hitched up Carly's skirt and wasted no time...sliding down onto Steven's cum-drenched appendage. Eorlund squealed in Carly's cute voice as her vaginal walls clamped down on Steven's cock. \"Now doesn't that feel nice?\" he giggled, looking into Mona's eyes, but he could see that Steven was lost in ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some vessels are much more enjoyable than others, and this is one such body!\" Eorlund then casually explained, as he rode Steven like a horse. Mona's toes tensed up inside her converse shoes as Steven quickly approached yet another orgasm. \"That's my girl!\" Eorlund then chuckled, as he felt a jet of seamen coating Carly's insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I need a cigarette!\" Steven gasped as he descended from his sexual high, his clammy, slender hands made their way onto his perky breasts and he squeezed them in an effort to keep himself aroused, but he was spent, or...rather Mona's body was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, wasn't that fun?\" Eorlund said, as he briefly wiped Carly's slick pussy with a piece of tissue and then put her knickers back on. \"Oh, no need for that now is there\" he then mentioned...gesturing to Steven's semi-erect cock. Steven looked down just in time to see his appendage being sucked back into Mona's svelte body like a noodle, and his scrotum followed...forming themselves back into his friend's vagina. \"Better!\" Steven muttered, still trying to get his breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what shall we do next?\" Eorlund asked, as he unlocked the cubicle and walked out...over to the sink. He washed Carly's hands and wiped the excess cum off her chin and then he neatened her disheveled clothing. \"Come on, get up, can't sit there all day\" he then snapped at Steven, who was only just zipping Mona's trousers back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, Steven was somewhat unsteady, not surprising considering what had just happened, Mona's legs felt really weak under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you need a recharge!\" Eorlund laughed at Steven as he staggered over to the sinks. Steven just looked over Carly's familiar...and sexy body, still not quite believing that the tormenting old geezer was actually wearing it like a cheap suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have just the thing!\" Eorlund then grinned, as he raised Carly's right hand and clicked her manicured fingers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The click clacking of Carly's heels on the floor kept Steven constantly distracted, it was a sound he wasn't used to when walking. He did however have to admit it felt kinda nice being in Carly's sexy body, and he couldn't stop groping her boobs with her own, manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing anyway?\" Steven then asked, but Eorlund didn't answer. Instead, Mona's face twisted into another wicked grin as the two of them emerged out onto the shop floor. \"Carly should be at her salon anyway, why did you drag her into this?\" he asked Eorlund, but again...he didn't get an answer from the centuries-old immortal being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I can deal with the silent treatment\" Steven sighed, as he saw Natalie walking towards him. Suddenly...she stopped talking...and held her head, only to start walking a moment later. \"Man I could use a fucking beer!\" Natalie suddenly cursed, causing Steven to frown.

Natalie then approached the two of them and she wolf whistled at Steven...slapping Carly's shapely ass hard. \"Looking good sexy!!\" she exclaimed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund returned Natalie to normal before she disappeared upstairs, much to Steven's relief. \"Very funny!\" he muttered, causing Eorlund to smile again. \"Well...I thought so!\" his tormentor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, lets get out of here!\" Steven suggested, as he tried to stop the old man messing with more of his friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where'd you go? Why didn't you answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the torch and held it under her chin giving her a really creepy look with deathly deep-set eyes. The shadows gave her a greenish complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into the darkness,\" she deep throated like a demon and showing a devilish grin. Then she continued in a normal voice. \"I, ah, panicked when the door disappeared and just started running. But now I'm back,\" she chirped at the end and reached out with both hands leaving the torch wedged in her cleavage. \"Come show me you care, luv,\" she purred and pulled Steven towards her with a wickedly enticing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Beware.

Hold me and warm me up,\" she breathed in a way he had only dreamed she would with him.

It was hard to avoid getting it in his eyes looking down at the much smaller woman especially since it was only natural to gape at her marvelous cleavage, but Steven forced himself to look into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven loved the color of her eyes. They almost always sparkled when they were together, and Steven liked that. Any time she was in a mood, he would always do his best to cheer her so they would sparkle again. But as he pulled his focus to those beautiful orbs, he found them completely different than he had ever seen them.

Something wasn't right here, but at the same time it felt so right. Then in the distance he thought he heard running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cold, Steven.

Where are you?\" he called waving the flashlight into the darkness while his eyes readjusted. He heard running approaching and finally beheld a pair of sneakers and the bottom of jeans in the beam just like before. Turning the light up shown a black tank top stretched out by a large set of boobs with Liz's face protruding barely over the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god it's really you, Steven. ... It is, isn't it?\" She asked as he climbed to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I was, ... well, er,\" she sputtered then paused before finally exploding. \"I kept hearing these voices, whispers, that kept saying \"This way to the door,\" and \"No. Go back.\" I kept following until I was too tired, and then I heard your voice near me but couldn't see anything and you .. it ... something touched me. It was so cold and tried to grab hold of me, and I ran away calling for you and saw the light and you answered and ... and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally ran out of breath and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK now, Liz,\" Steven said putting a hand on her shoulder for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">It's not alright.</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Get out!</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">No. It's OK to stay.</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">It's not OK.</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Get out!</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Stay.</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Go!</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Let yourselves go.</span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!\" they both yelled at once.

Show yourselves and explain yourself!\" he screamed continuing to shine the beam overhead and around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a soft glow began to fill the room. Sensing light, Liz opened her eyes and lowered her arms. They both gazed all around turning in a circle. There was still only emptiness in this new whiteness and no edges to the room, if there were any at all, just sort of a hazy endlessness with the floor dissolving into nothing as it rolled off from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey remained mesmerized by the change while a breeze swept over them and mist spun in front of them until ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hoods concealed any facial feature, and the cuffs of the arms overlapped together as if clasped hands. Although the robes did not appear to touch the floor, no sign of feet were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-who are you?\" Steven tentatively quizzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was more blunt. \"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the guardians of this realm. We are the energy, thought and force that control it as desired by the master or mistress,\" all spoke as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's contemplation, or more likely confusion, Steven asked, \"Which is the master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. The master is the one who controls the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" Liz exclaimed producing the key with the jewel that had opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress. We are here to serve you and make this into whatever you desire. Did you bring this man as a sacrifice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WHAT?\" Steven shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that? He gave me the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand that. When the key is relinquished, it is normally because of a defeat, and that person is usually eliminated. Is he your slave then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven almost boiled over at this and stomped his foot as Liz giggled her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. He is a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you scare us in the dark?\" Liz then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our apologies, Mistress. We did not know it was you. We only acted on your own deep thoughts to protect the realm until you confronted us to materialize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody mean rather,\" Steven interjects. \"Forming into ...\" But he stopped short realizing he didn't want to explain the phony Liz or let his feelings be found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this <i>realm</i>?\" Liz queried as she rubbed the jewel on the key with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is anything and everything that you want. We can change anything within it to your desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they spoke, Liz's garden appeared around them and on a warm spring late afternoon as the sun began to dip low. Fragrant flowers surrounded them as birds sailed across the blue sky seemingly pulling a few white puffy clouds. Though in the familiar garden, it had never been so bright or full. It was at most always just a few struggling blossoms and mostly bare dirt. Plus, it was still winter before they entered the doorway. Here it was brilliant, lush and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth felt the grass under their, now, bare feet on a soft green carpet. This change had them glance down to see Steven in a pair of pressed long khakis and fine white linen shirt with the cuffs rolled up above the wrist. Liz was uncharacteristically in a light summer skirt of pastel yellow flowing just below her knees. Her blouse was a lavender print that draped lightly over her chest. As Steven looked up, he saw her hair bouncing on her shoulders in little curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stood mesmerized until Liz realized that she was in one of her dreams. Instantly she accosted the figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this,\" she told them, and the scene vanished back to the white room and their normal clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not like it, Mistress? We thought it was one of your fond memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Liz could deny anything, Steven blurted, \"You mean you can read minds as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We can manipulate them as well while in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about outside?\" he continued to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot control anything outside. It must come into the realm to be changed; but however it leaves, it will remain until it returns, and we can change it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Steven looked at each other as thoughts filled their heads of what they could do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least that what's she thought of it as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is an easier term to understand than the physical science we employ,\" the three explained. \"And yes, we can alter minds as well as physical characteristics, but it is something to be quite careful about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was looking quite bewildered not knowing Liz's thoughts that the three were responding to. He just sighed and looked at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's expression had gone from pensive to a grin and eyes sparkling very mischievously. Steven knew most all of Liz's moods having her as his super and becoming good chums over time, but he was surprised by her normal serious self disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I try something?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Now you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puzzled Steven but only momentarily and not as much as finding himself looking Liz almost evenly in the eyes and perched on his tiptoes with straps digging into his shoulders. As he staggered around to gain balance, blond hair swung across his vision, and he felt like his pants had fallen. When he looked down, he screamed, a very feminine scream which caused him to gasp and scream again still staring down into the top of a pink blouse and the small cleavage now part of him and the short black skirt and heels on his lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" Liz commented. \"You do look exactly like Carly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I BLOODY WHAT?\" came Carly's voice from Steven whose eyes almost bulged giving him, or rather her, a rather sensual as well as concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a full length mirror appeared in front of him, and Steven stopped dead. He tried to look around for Carly, but he only saw her movements mimic his in the mirror. Gradually, he did the obvious of raising one hand at a time and waving at himself, finally watching as his fingers touched the reflection in the glass proving he was now Carly in body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ... like a .... I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel odd or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. I feel ... strangely ... very normal. Proper even,\" Steven replied as she swung and paraded Carly's body in front of the mirror as she often would straightening he outfit so it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm glad that worked so you weren't completely freaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had them give you Carly's body as well as her sense of being in that body.

Staggering in circles he smacked into the mirror. \"Excuse me,\" he said before realizing the reflection was him. \"My god, Liz, I look like Carly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a problem?\" she asked calmly stifling a giggle as best she could and putting on an expression as if being Carly is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem? PROBLEM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's eyes, or actually Carly's eyes, went wide, and his/her face flushed into Carly's typical miffed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - I - I'm ...\" Steven sputtered, a loss for words but finally spewing, \"I can't look like Carly. I'm a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I was so looking to go for a coffee like she and I often do since it's my birthday, but she's working all day,\" Liz sighed faking her saddest puppy dog face at Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he felt like exploding and desperately wanted his own body back, he couldn't ever get angry at Liz. He gazed into her pretty eyes and swallowed all his negative words then let out a sigh. It was her birthday, and he had given her this gift even though he didn't know it was such a power. If it would make her happy, he knew he would have to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is your birthday,\" he acquiesced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I should be able to do what I want,  but you're not really Carly,\" Liz laughed watching Steven turn back to his tall male form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shook his head. \"Not funny.

He knew that he really wanted was for them to be a couple, but she was married which would be even more wrong if she returned his ardor. Maybe he should just change her in some embarrassing way like she had to him. Actually, the humor in him being Carly finally struck  him as he thought of ways to change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was considering what to do, everything began to shimmer before him until ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He can only shake his head figuring he must be in the form of Carly again, but it doesn't seem the same exactly. His hair was pulled back, and the bra straps were digging more into his shoulders straining with extra weight on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did ...\" he started and stopped hearing the voice and knowing exactly what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then threw Eric's arm over Steven's shoulder in a hug and said, \"How about I take you out for a birthday coffee, snookums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was shocked. Too shocked to reply, and he found himself walking with Liz-as-Eric towards the open doorway. Suddenly the implication of the whole situation hit him. He would be pretending to be married to Liz with roles swapped. This tantalized and frightened him. Yeah, he was fond of Liz, but no way would he ever try to breakup her marriage or ask her to cheat. But was this cheating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doorway neared, Steven's head was swirling ever faster unable to reconcile his concerns especially with the way Liz was grasping the body he had making it feel right. He stared down at his feet watching Liz's sneakers move his body forward in parallel with Eric's nice shiny shoes. Liz had Eric dressed in a nice pair of trousers that fit rather snug, so snug in fact that ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my god!</i>\" Steven thought. \"<i>She's got an erection.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him hold back just short of the doorway. Steven knew that men always had trouble controlling their, uh, ... you know. Even though Eric was older and more mature, his body might still overwhelm Liz's common sense, and what could ensue was making him scared and uncomfortably aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little shy today are we, pookie?\" Eric's voice threw Steven further into confused paralysis, and her using Eric's hand to massage Liz's shoulders that Steven now had was sending very mixed signals through the body he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Is it getting warmer in here?</i>\" Steven wondered. For the first time, he sensed every inch of Liz's body noting particularly her breasts that now pressed her nipples tighter against the bra. As he looked into Eric's eyes, something about this whole situation was making his perspective hard to focus. He wanted to ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NO!

It was like someone had locked the only means of escape, for he knew transformations could only happen inside the room. \"What's wrong babes?\" Liz asked him, as he pulled him close, wrapping her manly arms around his shorter, feminine body. Steven just smiled...and frowned at the same time, Liz seemed to have no issues with looking 'herself' in the face, and she seemed to be slipping into the role of her own husband rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we should be doing this?\" Steven asked in Liz's former voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? A married couple sharing a hug, and going out for a coffee together? Of course!\" Liz responded with a smile, leaning in to kiss her former body. Steven found himself unable to recoil since she was holding him in an embrace. As her lips touched his, he felt a 'rush' overwhelm him, and his new, studded tongue interlocked with Liz's..or rather Eric's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Steven moaned quietly, \"But er...I'm hardly dressed for a coffee\" Steven then said, looking up into \"Eric's\" eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look perfect!\" Liz hushed him, as she peered down Steven's tank top at the huge breasts that were normally hers. As she admired his cleavage, she became even more aware of the throbbing erection pressing against her underwear and forming an evident bulge in her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just smirked again, chuckling a little as Liz dismissed every concern he had. \"But what if we run into the real Eric?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's at work, we're quite safe sweetie\" Liz reassured him again. She then hugged him tighter, and Steven's large breasts further pressed into Liz's new body. \"I think I know my body well enough to know that you're probably feeling very...VERY flustered right now...right?\" Liz's deep voice then teased Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just remained silent, but the look of embarrassment on his pretty new face told Liz everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come on, we're just a husband and wife going out for a morning coffee together\" Liz said to Steven, as she broke their embrace and put her arm around his slender shoulders, walking him outside of her house. As his anxiety and his excitement both increased, Steven looked up and down the street, seeing people going about their normal daily routine. The occasional comforting pat on the back (or his backside) by Liz kept him moving in the direction of the town center, and the coffee shop where they were headed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of them even spoke to old Mr. Livingstone (a fitting name given his chiseled, grey complected face). Liz-as-Eric managed to make mention that it was Liz's birthday, and Steven blushed appropriately although it was embarrassment tinged with fear. The old man offered his congratulations holding out his arms, and Steven instinctively pushed forward into a friendly hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the cafe, Steven even ordered his, or Liz's own and favorite latte. He had been out with her enough to know the three types and flavors she preferred. He was relaxing at a window table quite happy with himself and wondering why he had been so concerned to begin with. Being in Liz's body no longer felt foreign. Different, yes but not foreign. He had easily crossed his legs under the small table without any squeezing pain he would have suffered in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then realized that he actually liked being Liz, not that he wanted to have her body permanently. It was just good to experience what every guy wondered without any catches. Except for his initial reaction to what being married could lead to, he hadn't thought about the various female parts of his body. Now as he waited he realized that he had the perfect opportunity to explore them first hand, but obviously not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, <i>my love</i>,\" Liz said with Eric's deep but gentle voice as she set the cups down on the table and took a seat. \"Enjoying yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you, <i>dear</i>,\" Steven replied now comfortable in his role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to get the window being it mid morn work day, eh? Perfect to celebrate a birthday,\" Liz smirked with a wink. \"Watching the parade, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a sip as Steven nodded. It was rather interesting the various people that strolled by. Working late shifts had never allowed Liz or Steven to experience the day like this together or even when they joined friends for a coffee on the weekend. It was always so crowded then. Now it was relaxing never knowing who the next person might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven was taking a sip (he actually found it rather tasty though he had never liked this type before, and he wondered if it was Liz's body reacting), when suddenly there was knocking on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Liz. Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Carly dressed as usual in a sleek skirt suit and heels with her short blond hair styled perfectly along with the light touch of makeup. It all made her look the personification of a very attractive, very feminine woman. Of course, she had to look her best since she was a beautician and her customers expected it. Even so, Carly had always taken great care of looking good as well as keeping healthy with the right food and exercise. However, that never stopped her from having a good time when out on the town or even at a small house party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven naturally froze from the surprise and fright, and Liz had to give him a nudge with her foot under the table to react. Quickly, he did the good friend wave as he set his coffee down just managing not to choke, snort or blow any out his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So out for an early birthday celebration, <i>or ...</i>,\" she added with a wink and a light fist into Steven's shoulder, \"an after celebration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned wide Liz's eyes in his head as he became warm and realized he was deeply blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to guess,\" Liz chuckled in Eric's rumbling way. \"Here, have a seat. What will you have?\" he asked getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, handsome. A Tazo Green Tea Cr\u00e8me Frappuccino, please,\" Carly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just like you in that bright green outfit with a white top,\" Liz teased mussing her hair with Eric's big hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm even sweeter,\" she retorted with a bright smile then shook her head so her hair fell perfectly back into place as Liz walked away. \"Happy Birthday, luv,\" she continued grabbing Steven's small hands and leaning over to plant a kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Steven mumbled still trying to gain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lovely day, don't you think? I just couldn't stay inside any longer. I'm glad I ran into you,\" Carly started and then kept going and going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was glad Carly didn't get into anything personal and was such as great talker leaving him to just nod and add a few words here and there. Steven knew Carly fairly well, and she knew him, too, a few things he wished she didn't. Hopefully, this would be one that she'd never know. Although as he sat there completely fooling her, he enjoyed it and almost wanted to surprise her with it. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a lucky one to have such a strong, handsome man,\" Carly sighed as Eric approached with her drink. \"So tell me, what presents have you gotten so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come over and see for yourself,\" Liz offered as Carly took a big sip of her Frappuccino.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was both surprised and shocked when he got the opposite from \"Eric\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on babes, its your 30th, its a special birthday, why don't you wear that blue dress I bought you for Natalie's wedding reception\" Liz said in her husband's voice, a grin appearing on her \"borrowed\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly eagerly nodded her approval of the idea. And all Steven could do was sit there, giving Liz a look that screamed...\"Why?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see!\" Steven just muttered, then he returned to his coffee. \"In the meantime, why don't we head back home so that Carly can see what 'gifts' I got\" Steven then suggested with his own, cheeky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, good idea, I bet Eric here has got you a lovely bracelet or necklace right luv?\" a giddy Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see won't you!\" Steven responded, as the three of them finished up their drinks and headed out, taking the short walk back to Liz's house. Glancing at Liz, Steven caught her glancing at Carly's petite, shapely body, and she was managing to maintain almost a constant erection which was more than evident in Eric's snug-fitting trousers. Steven himself still found Carly attractive and would no doubt have had his own erection by now had he not been in Liz's form. But perhaps more worryingly for Steven, who was straight, he now found Liz's current form, that of her husband, a much more 'satisfying' sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon back at the house and Steven made them all some more coffee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz's body was definitely telling him something, and he liked it. No longer was he scared about this. He was actually becoming more and more curious about every part of Liz's body. He could feel her nipples again pushing against the bra which made him smile. So lost in thought about mentally exploring Liz's body that he didn't see her pull his head over and plant a big kiss on his lips. Quickly he wanted to disengage but Liz's body was telling him otherwise especially as Liz used Eric's hand to caress his shoulder and push him tight against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you two are so cute and so lucky to have found each other,\" Carly pined. \"So what could be more special than Thai?\" She pondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the percolator sounded and gave Steven an excuse to break away and pour the coffee. His mind was now swimming with ideas about testing Liz's body when he could be alone. He even started to get concerned of whether Liz was just playing or had bigger ideas of her own pretending to be her husband making love to herself. She would know every perfect thing to do. Steven shook his head to clear those thoughts sending Liz's pony tail whipping back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" he called as he walked over with Carly's and his cups. Liz got up and retrieved what was to be Eric's and stood leaning on the counter while Carly continued her interrogation, this time with Steven. Liz smiled as Steven played the role of her quite well though  she helped whenever it looked like Steven would be tripped up, but only a couple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drained the last, Carly seemed to have finally given up, but then she got a very excited look and blurted, \"I know now. There's only one place left: The Silver Spoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Steven giggle. The Silver Spoon was one of the fanciest places in town. It had excellent food, and the service was impeccable, not that he had been there. He had heard all about it from his coworkers who hadn't gone either but had heard all about it from others who were never inside either. The rich and mighty would be seen trotting in regularly. It was a place where you'd only go for very special occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't fool that sharp little cookie,\" came Eric's voice causing Steven to turn and gape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo, Liz. If he's taking you there, you need to look your best,\" Carly said getting up and reaching to Steven. \"I've got time right now to do you up right.\" she added pulling Steven up and towards the door before he could react. \"I'll have her back in plenty of time, luv,\" she told Eric. \"And you better look your best when I do, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn't know what to think or do, and Carly had taken charge so quickly that he was almost to the door before ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially the latter...who was a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven politely greeted Chloe as he walked past, and he felt her eyes checking out his bosom. <i>\"Oookay!\"</i> Steven thought to himself, smirking a little.

She had seen descriptions of creating illusions, and maybe this was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood still not sure if her two supposed friends had gone bonkers and were about to push her down a coal shoot that would trap her in the dirty cellar with creepy-crawlies. They seemed normal, but sometimes the greatest blood-thirsty criminals are the ones that appear most normal, at least that's what the unsolved crimes mystery series said on the telly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, luv. What's holding you back?\" came Eric's strong manly voice, and his hand pushed Carly's lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't move, but Liz used Eric's muscles to scoot Carly on her heels skidding right into the void. Immediately, the three hooded figures appeared before her like a set of Grim Reaper triplets. Carly screamed and tried to turn, but Liz blocked the entire doorway. There was no way to get out, so she panicked and screamed again just as Liz stepped through causing the lights to come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the bloody matter with you, girl?\" Steven said using Liz's annoyed voice coming round Liz and pulling Carly straight by her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked up wide-eyed and shaking like a blender which was how her insides felt as well. Slowly she saw the white glow encompassing everything as if there were no walls, ceiling or floor. Truly this was some sort of magic. She looked into Liz's eyes, or who she thought was Liz, and watched as Liz's head began to raise up and shimmer itself into the face of Steven smiling at her. Steven then spun her around so she could watch Eric's manly form that Liz was possessing sprout hair and stream down his back as the rest of his body began to shrivel down (except his chest which actually expanded) into Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ... my ... god,\" Carly gasped putting her hands over her mouth as she backpedaled right into one of the hooded guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Liz's and Steven's turn to gasp as Carly ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a shocked Steven and Liz looked on, the hooded figure then reached up with his manicured hands and pulled down his hood, revealing Carly's pretty, blonde head. Her face was expressionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!\" Liz exclaimed, putting her hands over her mouth. \"W...what happened?\" she then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed individual before her just slipped his new hands into the sleeves of his robe and answered his mistress obediently. \"Do not worry yourself Mistress, your friend is not gone, or dead as you would understand it\" he explained in Carly's voice. When she stepped into me, she was merely absorbed. We too have the ability to change our forms into those of humans, but only if we 'consume' that human for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you've eaten her?\" Steven blurted out, looking angry and disgusted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the new Carly stated simply. \"When we absorb a human, our transformation is automatic and instant\" he explained. \"I can return your friend to you whenever you wish\" he then told Liz and Steven, who began calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...give her back!\" Steven muttered, raising his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress?\" the new, robed Carly turned to Liz, asking her permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we want our friend back!\" Liz nodded. \"Do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Mistress\" the hooded (and currently cute looking) figure obeyed at once. First he revealed his dainty hands again, then he put his hood back up. The other two figures began chanting in a strange language, and after a few seconds, Carly's high pitched voice joined in. Moments later...and with a weird 'squelching' noise...Carly emerged from the hooded figure and went tumbling into Steven's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...god! What happened?\" a seriously confused Carly asked, holding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked back at the central hooded figure, who was now back to normal, then she helped Carly to her feet, steadying her on her heels. Liz then explained Carly what had just happened, and she looked at the mysterious figures stood in front of them...and scowled. \"Um...be very careful what you think about them, they can read our minds\" Liz then advised her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Steven suddenly addressed Carly, who turned to look at him. \"We told you we weren't who we appeared to be!\" he grinned, him and Liz now both having returned to their own forms within the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know what to say\" a stunned Carly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then smiled at her in a mischievous manner. \"So, is there anyone you've always wanted to become?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gave that question some careful thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carly was a rather confident and decisive person. Her small stature never stopped her from accomplishing anything she set her mind to. She was well liked and had a very attractive figure which she kept in excellent shape. She knew how to dress and groom herself to look her best, and everyone admired her. So it wasn't surprising that Carly didn't have some immediate response to become someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should choose then,\" Steven offered. \"Let's see, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him, luv,\" Liz told her shaking her head at Steven's comment. \"That's just what we, ah, sorta did to ourselves without really thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>thought</i> about it,\" Steven protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just rolled her eyes.

You don't have to choose anything now,\" Liz said as she patted Carly's arm. \"These guys can probably change just about anything ...,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress, we can,\" the three voices sounded together frightening Carly who jerked aside staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled and explained, \"They can read minds and then make happen what we think. We just thought about being someone else, and then ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Carly interrupted having regained her composure, but then giggled seemingly for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked confused as she replied, \"Well, we only changed our bodies, but ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then stopped while she gaped at what had happened to Carly. Her clothes had transformed into a white thick-fur coat with hints of grey. It reached all the way to her ankles and down her arms. Her black-and-white heels peeked out from under, and she now had on fingerless light grey gloves showing black nail polish. As Liz and Steven scanned back up still in a bit of shock, they found her wearing a fuzzy hood attached to the coat that had pointed grey \"ears\" on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Liz finally gasped as she brought her hands to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody wild, Carly girl,\" Steven chuckled once he found a voice. \"You look rather like Tia, your cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly smiled and hissed at them playfully baring her left front claws. Suddenly a full length mirror appeared, and Carly turned to it marveling at what she saw. Her face was all aglow as she preened and modeled her new outfit turning round to see all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meow,\" Carly purred contentedly. \"You like?\" she then asked the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks very chic,\" Liz complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just shrugged. \"A giant cat. I never would have guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly giggled with joy. \"Sometimes at home I would think about how lucky Tia is to have such a coat and how adorable she is.\" She ended by putting on her cutest face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luv, you're just as adorable as you were before ... and are underneath,\" Liz said. Then she began to think about her own pets wondering what she would look like dressed as one of them and which one might be the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven snorted then laughed at Liz's comment causing Liz to give him a scowl that slowly turned into a devious grin as she wondered what animal Steven would be best to be dressed as.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A pair of 'furry' light grey tights (pantyhose) then appeared on her legs and her sneakers changed into a pair of dark grey flats with talons 'imprinted' on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not drastic I know, but still fun!\" Liz said, as she held her hands out, inspecting her feathers gloves too. \"And if you can't guess who I'm dressed as, I'm afraid there's no hope foy you\" she laughed at Carly and Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very nice luv!\" Carly smiled, as she felt the material of Liz's new overcoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you change your name to Polly?\" Steven quipped, causing Liz to glance at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him!\" Carly chuckled. \"Though to be honest, I thought you'd choose to dress like one of your dogs\" she then told Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just grinned, hugging herself. \"Weimaraners don't have as thick a coat\" she muttered, enjoying the warmth of her new outfit. \"Besides, Peter might enjoy having an owner who looks, and maybe even smells like he does\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a feed tray putting out?\" Steven suddenly joked again, obviously not knowing when to stop. He knew from years of working with Liz that it was a mistake of pushing her too far, and that rule applied now more than ever, since they were still in 'her' magical realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just looked at him and shook at her, a look of 'pity' on her pretty face. \"Not smart Steven!\" she said, before looking back at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's smile quickly evaporated as he saw Liz sizing him up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But after seeing Liz's face remain serious if not getting a bit sinister, he added, \"Can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence in the room with Liz eying him this way in her fathered outfit made the hair on his neck tingle. He glanced over at Carly, but her eyes in that cat-like outfit gave him the feeling of being a mouse-like prey between two predators. Strangely, he was much bigger than both. Now his arm hair was on end in fear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Twas just a jest, luv,\" he pleaded starting a slow backpedal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he knew he better make a quick escape if he didn't want to be decked out in some silly outfit like a yank's Halloween. Spinning towards the door, he took two bounding strides then began to leap at the exit. He felt his clothes shift and bunch up on his body and something swing on the sides of his head, and he knew it was too late. Now it was just a simple choice to make: continue out the door and possibly be left this way if Liz didn't let him back in which meant being seen by, at least, Eric when he got home (not a pleasant thought at how he would enjoy Steven's situation), or accept his fate and stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last hop, he stopped. He stared at the door just a meter away then slowly turned round without looking down at himself. He wasn't sure he wanted to know. What he did know was that whatever he was wearing, it was very baggy in front at his waist and his shoes seemed overly long. Perhaps Liz had just made him a clown for his clowning with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling his feet, Steven looked at the two women - one bird and one cat - both grinning like giddy schoolgirls who had just seen a boy wearing a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahl? How do you like it?\" Liz parroted as Steven neared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know since I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly a mirror materialized before him, and his jaw dropped leaving him looking like a fish out of water, but he wasn't a fish. He was grey, well mostly except the tail, but didn't look like a dog either. He sighed and shook his head watching and feeling the flapping on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Carly-cat prodded him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked very annoyed and dejected, but gradually his eyes began to sparkle, and the edges of his mouth turned up. With that, he let out a huge laugh and started springing up and down on the balls of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggest bloody rabbit I ever saw,\" he chuckled then tried to wiggle his nose while shifting his hips to get his powder-puff, white tail to move. \"I could be the star of \"<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wandg.com/flash_site/index.html\">The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.wandg.com/flash_site/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Fluffy would appreciate that though,\" Liz giggled sending the feathers on her large chest waving at Steven as her breasts bounced underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo!

And both of them also noticed that the drawbridge of the castle looked like a giant dog's tongue, hung out of the castle opening and stretched across the moat that had also appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Liz asked, gesturing around her with her arms and grinning like the perverbial Cheshire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just giggled at her. \"Its amazing!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...surreal!

And within a few seconds...a host of animals, from cats...to dogs...to rabbits, had appeared in their new wonderland. \"That's better!\" Liz cooed, as she then picked up a nearby cat and nuzzled it as it started purring in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bring a whole new meaning to the term 'animal lover' Liz\" Steven grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do me a favor Carly?\" Liz suddenly asked, smiling at her, \"Go fetch my dogs, I want them to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Liz!\" an equally giddy Carly nodded, before rushing for the doorway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sensation was actually pleasureable, and he again thought about how he might sneak off and inspect them in depth by fondling the actual flesh. He almost gave them a squeeze right there when Carly's voice reminded him that Liz and Carly were just across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" came a high pitch shriek followed by a softer, almost sensual, \"You naughty boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled with Eric's deep voice and patted Carly on the thigh just where her skirt ended and her slender sexy leg started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until the kettle's hot,\" Liz spoke to both. \"Let's show Carly what Steven's present was, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up taking Carly's hand and leading her into the living room.

Lovely,\" Carly cooed looking back rather quizzical wondering why Steven had given Liz a door in her living room that obviously would just lead back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me,\" Liz offered stepping along side Carly and unlocking the door then putting Eric's strong arm around her waist to usher her into the waiting darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a shrill whistle sounded making Steven start sending Liz's boobs on his chest to pound up and down. The surprise had him grab them to stop the motion which was amazingly pleasant both before and while holding them.

The only other noise to be heard was the clicking of her stiletto heels on the floor, the noise amplified by the void around them. \"I thought we'd just end up in the kitchen or something\" she then admitted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is a very special place\" Liz said as she glanced back and flashed one of her husband's cheekiest grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special?\" Carly responded, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Yes, VERY...special!\" she chuckled at Carly. \"Are you here?\" she then called out into the emptiness, and was relieved when the three mysterious hooded figures popped up out of nowhere. \"We are always here Mistress!\" the three said in unison, startling Carly, who increased her hold around \"Eric's\" waist. \"Its alright, they won't harm you\" Liz tried reassuring Carly, who soon looked downright confused as well as shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are these guys?

As soon as the door vanished when Liz closed it with her and Carly inside, Steven's small hands had risen to hold the large breasts on his chest as he looked down admiring them and enjoying the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder how Liz can focus on work and normal things with these always readily available needing attention? And there's so much more,</i>\" he thought now sensing an eager arousal wash over his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and sighed as he gave them a good hard squeeze. Then he became very self conscious or perhaps a bit guilty playing with his good friend's body. He looked around the room eying the front door and the cupboard where the mystery door was hidden. This wasn't a good spot to grope himself since anyone would immediately see. So, with a smirk, he waltzed down the hallway to the bedrooms, anticipation fueling an adrenalin rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had never been past the living room or kitchen in Liz's house. It wasn't that big with only three doors in the hall. As he approached the first closed door still having a great time fondling his breasts, he heard noises inside and stopped, scared cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did Eric come home?</i>\" he wondered. \"<i>Or a burglar?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of being embraced by the real Eric flooded his head. It both disgusted and excited him leaving him paralyzed with confusion. He licked his lips as one hand dropped from its groping and reached for the door leaving the other holding tight as if for reassurance. The movement inside padded away from the door as he quietly turned the knob to peak. He just wanted to be sure. If it was a thief, he could call help. If Eric, ... well, he wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door had a small crack, he leaned round to peer in. His body tensed, and he held his breath opening it just a bit further when nothing came in sight. Suddenly, the door pushed in as three shadows bounded through jumping against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackpedaling, Steven gave a terrified scream with Liz's voice as the three Weimaraners joyfully greeted who they thought was their owner. A slobbery tongue stung Steven's face as he tried to fend off the beasts not yet remembering what they were. It wasn't until two of them broke off running back out to the main that Steven recognized them and began laughing in relief. It naturally came out as Liz giggling and continued uncontrolled for some time. Eventually, he shook off the hysterics only to hear voices talking to the dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back toward the living room figuring Carly and Liz were back, he was greeted by a tall, slender, leggy woman with dark hair in a tiered pageboy cut and wearing glasses. She appeared to have average sized breasts pushing out the t-shirt she wore and small rounded hips and bum held tight in her jeans. Steven thought she looked like someone he had seen often but couldn't place who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, luv,\" she greeted Steven in a familiar though higher pitched voice. \"You like the new look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her, Liz appeared still decked out as Eric and wearing an extreme smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly?\" Steven asked staring in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a better name would be,\" Liz started and paused mysteriously looking back and forth at the two women while the new woman preened and paraded herself in front of Steven. \"Stephanie!\" Liz chuckled turning into a deep toned howl of laughter as Eric would at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" came a bewildered mutter from Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted me to be Steven, but I convinced her I was not the male type,\" Carly explained swaggering in her gorgeous model-like body. \"So we agreed just to use Steven's body as the template but leave me all female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's your mirror twin, ol' chum,\" Liz beamed. \"Steven does makes a real lovely, right? You're not jealous are you, babes?\" Liz asked coming over and swinging an arm over Steven's shoulder pulling him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven couldn't believe what he saw or heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You - you turned me into a girl ... I-I-I-I mean, Carly into a girlie version of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, luv. ... \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Height differences, breasts shrinking, hips and ass widening and expanding. When the changes stopped he caught site of long, blood red hair. \"What just happened?\" he asked and stopped, his voice was way different. Definitely not Liz's voice but it sounded familiar. And then there was a mirror, probably created by Liz, and Steven caught sight of himself in it. Or rather he caught sight of Becca. Liz had turned him into Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" she asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you... why did you change me into Becca?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you liked our younger co-workers sooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the middle of a thought, you know.\" Steven retorted in his new, cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I can turn you back into yourself if you want.\" Liz stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven caught sight of himself in the mirror again.

She gasped...and chuckled as she felt her penis being sucked up into her body, forming a teenage vagina, and long blonde hair cascaded from her head. In no time at all...Becky was standing where 'Eric' had been. And Liz was also wearing the clothes that Becky normally wore for work, a red company sweatshirt, black leggings and a pair of black flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Liz asked Carly and Steven, as she modeled her new, younger body. She flashed a smile at the two of them and showed off Becky's braces, which just made her look downright cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look adorable Liz!\" Carly answered, nodding in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly then looked down at her current body, a feminized version of Steven's own body, and then glanced at Liz. \"And what about me?

It felt like he was wasting his breath, or...Liz's breath. Whatever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to wear tonight babes?\" Liz inquired, as she walked up to Steven and embraced him. She knew all too well that being in close proximity to Eric's body had an 'arousing' effect on Steven while he was in her form, and she was enjoying 'teasing' him. Steven though seemed reluctant to give in while there were still 'loose ends' to be tied up. \"Ooh, I know,\" an excited Liz then suddenly said from Eric's body, \"...we go back in the room and I can change those drab clothes of mine...er yours...sorry, into all kinds of sexy outfits, see which one you like best. How does that sound?\" she asked him, as she glanced him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just looked 'up' into Liz's new face and frowned. She would never have worn 'sexy' outfits if she still had her body, but now she was all too eager to see him dolled up in feminine attire and high heels. He couldn't completely figure out the change in her attitude, but he figured it was a result of her being in her husband's masculine form. Men, it seemed, always wanted to see their partners looking sexy, and apparently Liz was no exception to the rule now that she was \"Eric\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lizzie!\" Carly then chimed in, calling Steven by a cute version of his new name. \"Lets have some fun!\" she said, wild eyed as she straightened her glasses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz started shuffling Eric's loafers and trying not to make eye contact.

Liz's body that he had seemed to be puffing up about to explode, and then it did. He found himself joining them in hysterical laughter at how much and how well he just imitated Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all was so silly, and they each knew it. The three of them in different bodies role playing.

Again his body started to warm with arousal even as he felt Liz's erection press against his belly. He tried to remind himself that this was just his friend Liz, but his body was pushing him so strongly. When Liz finally eased her grip, Steven looked up into those deep manly eyes of Eric's body and closed his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't something that either Liz or Steven would have ever done. Both knew who they really were and that even in role playing they shouldn't let anything override their moral conscience, but they each felt something more than they wanted to admit. Maybe that's why Liz just gave Steven a quick peck and pushed him back with hands on his shoulders so he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righto, birthday girl. We won't force you into dressing in anything that you don't want,\" Liz told Steven starting with a wink but ending looking again a little sad. \"So what ideas do you have since it was your present that started this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven suddenly was unsure. He was never one for making decisions or planning ahead. At work, he did what he was told. When going out with friends, he always followed their lead. However, Liz always had a mind of her own though she usually consulted with her husband on any serious matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, luv,\" Carly purred at him taking his arm and leading him to sit on the couch next to her like Liz and Carly often would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell. What is your deepest desire for the evening, babes?\" Liz added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought hard about what would be right and what his body was telling him more and more. He stared down into his bosom - Liz's large, wonderful, fleshy globes - but managed to keep his hands in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them could continue to have a wonderful time, but Eric would soon be home and couldn't be deprived of the special plans he had for this evening with Liz. Steven hoped he would be able to keep Liz's body, at least for a while, but was unsure if Eric would approve. Although, it might be fun to play a prank on Eric. He was quite the jokester himself, but also a powerful man who might not take well to Steven faking it as his wife. As his wife? Steven wasn't sure he even wanted to be Liz to Eric's Eric and what that could lead to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" both Liz and Carly said all at once.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew that being Liz meant more than just looking like her, he would have to be the loving wife that she was too. He knew it might be difficult, but he was fairly confident he could pull it off. Simply because he recognized the feelings he got from being close to Liz (in Eric's body) as a physical attraction to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really want to do this Lizzie?\" Carly asked, again calling Steven by his new name, or at least a variant of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" he stated firmly, looking at the feminized version of his own body that Carly had become. \"But that means that you're going to have to leave the house\" he then said to Liz, who just smiled and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" she muttered in Eric's voice. \"I can just become someone else\" she chuckled. \"Imagine if Eric comes home to the sight of his loving wife,\" she said, gesturing to you, \"and two other lovely looking ladies\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, who are you gonna be?\" a giddy Carly asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure!\" Liz mumbled, as she gave it some careful thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz pondered her decision, Steven looked down at himself again and admired his generous breasts, that nicely filled out his tank top and Nike jacket. He then outstretched his new legs in front of him and moved his feet rapidly from side to side, staring at the familiar sneakers on his feet. He poked and felt his 'fuller' thighs...and smiled when he then looked at his flat crotch. It was the one part of Liz's anatomy he had not yet explored..or even touched, but he was anxious to. Just not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who are you going to be?\" Steven suddenly asked Liz, who finally made her choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides he really liked the body he had and was again staring down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Liz</i>,\" Liz said sweetly using Eric's affectionate tone. \"Since it is your birthday, I'm willing to let you decide who I should be.

His Liz-body tingled all over with the way it sounded, and he almost reconsidered having her change. He was still a little nervous about fooling Eric, but also was very excited to see, hear, and feel the touch of the real one. That tingling made Liz's nipples swell in his bra, and he couldn't really think of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about one of your co-workers?\" Carly offered giving Steven a few more seconds to straighten his thoughts and pick a person for Liz. \"That way it would be easy to say I was a friend that came with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Good idea, <i>Stephanie</i>,\" Liz agreed. \"Should I be older or younger?\" she asked to no one as she looked up and stroked her chin in thought with eric's big hand before glancing back at Steven still staring down into his cleavage. \"OK, luv.

It made him tingle all lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the blue dress that Liz owns,\" 'Becky' said as Steven's clothes changed into that outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven suddenly realized that he would not be dressing Liz's body. It would all be using the room which was why he tingled before. He felt rather disappointed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's so last year,\" 'Stephanie' frowned then grew excited and chirped, \"I know an outfit I saw at Merkles that would be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steven could offer a protest, Liz used her teenage Becky voice. \"Go ahead gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then found himself in a lavender print, short-sleeve, full-length dress and wearing some matching flats on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

His shoes were open-toed and shiny black with a bow and about 6 cm lift but, fortunately, full heel so he didn't twist an ankle or topple over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt really great on him the way it seemed to caress his skin where it touched and cupped his breasts. Steven was really enjoying trying outfits now. He ran his hands down his sides and hips feeling the lusciousness of the material and lost his focus into Liz's dramatic cleavage on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo!

However, it was only a couple seconds before Liz put a smirk on Becky's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to leave you alone all night with Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, er, ah, ... well,\" Steven mumbled in Liz's voice realizing that he may not want to really go that far in fooling Eric. \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What about me, I mean Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, yet, even that,\" Liz teased putting a cute look on Becky's face that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked confused as Liz ignored explaining any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's setup our party room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the mist at the edges swirled into walls, and furniture grew from the floor. A ceiling spread out over their heads, and even a buffet table with food including a tiered cake materialized. Soft music began to play one of Liz's favorite bands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Steven gasped when it was done. \"If they can do this, why not have your favorite band play live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot make life without life as in changing a person physically,\" the three intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a knock sounded on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to greet your guests, <i>birthday girl</i>,\" Liz told Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled one of Liz's most gracious ones and nodded to the two women. Straightening his dress and peering into a mirror on the wall ensuring his hair was properly back in a pony tail, he glided out to let in the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after he walked out, Carly asked, \"Should we go get Bailey to make one of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz replies, ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds Carly's new body was elegantly attired in a short black skirt, a white halter top and a pair of white, 2-inch 'kitten-heel' pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, me likey!\" \"Stephanie\" grinned as she ran her hands over her new clothes...and her perky breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I even changed your glasses into ones with a more feminine frame\" Liz winked at Carly, as she put her hands on her teenage hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Carly muttered in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Liz nodded. \"And as for my outfit, well...I'll wait and see what Becky is wearing I think\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the front door, Steven had hesitated before opening it, anxiously checking his appearance. He checked his ponytailed hair to make sure there weren't any loose strands hanging down, then he briefly lifted his large boobs with his hands as he made sure his dress was fitting just right. \"Okay, acting time!\" he mumbled, before opening the door to Becky and her friend Katie. \"Hi Becky!!\" he greeted her cheerfully, giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Liz, that dress is really nice!\" was one of the first things out of Becky's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love your shoes!\" Katie then weighed in, causing Steven to turn his attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Steven responded, modeling his new footwear, and Becky quickly introduced Katie to him. \"Its nice to meet you Katie, I just know you're going to love this party\" Steven said, flashing on of Liz's prettiest smiles in the girls' direction. \"The others haven't arrived yet, so why don't we just head on into the 'main room' and you can grab something to eat\" he then told the two teenagers, as he closed the front door and led them into the mysterious room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered, the three mysterious (and now invisible) figures made minor alterations to Becky's and Katie's perception of the room, just so they wouldn't question its size and its location . \"Oh wow! This room is beautiful!\" Katie gasped, as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is isn't it?\" Steven grinned again, turning to glance at the girls, causing his ponytail to whip around behind his head. With each step he took, his large breasts jiggled on his chest, making him more excited than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the spot where he had left Liz and Carly, Steven looked around. \"Stephanie\" was still there, but Liz was out of sight. \"Um...this is \"Stephanie\", another friend\" Steven introduced the female version of his own body, that Carly was currently wearing. And the usual polite greetings were exchanged between the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then looked around to see where Liz and her three hooded 'servants' were.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sure the others will be here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it does look so <i>delish</i>,\" 'Stephanie' chirped her eyes going wide at the large array of goodies. \"Let's see what these are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Carly and Becky headed over taking the small plates and plopping some of the finger items on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for letting me come also,\" Katie told Steven who she thought was Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that you were with Becky when I called. I'm always up for making new friends,\" was Steven's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Steven was becoming more and more comfortable in Liz's body and easily acting like her, the latter part of his comment actually came from Steven's male side as he was quite taken by Katie. Her long dark hair only held back by a couple barrettes from hiding more of her beautiful face full of color unlike Becky's paler complexion. Her beguiling smile through narrow pink lips looked delicious, and her deep brown eyes shone with fun and enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had on a maroon sleeveless dress that drooped in folds like an arrow point into her cleavage hanging just right to not actually see any. It made it more tempting and sensuously teasing. The small silver charm on a thin chain round her neck in the wide area of exposed skin gave Steven an excuse for continuing to stare in hope the dress would shift to reveal more, but it never did. Although Steven quite liked the large mounds on his own chest that he had admired for some time on Liz, he was at heart a breast man and enjoyed seeing the fleshy flashes of cleavage from anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself - or actually herself - famished as well, Steven followed Katie watching her hips sway as her silky, toned legs moved her along. He took up a plate concentrating as much on Katie as the food and forgetting his good friend whose body he now had was lurking somewhere with her three hoodies observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I see Steven is fascinated by Katie,</i>\" Liz giggled to herself as she watched the goings on with the three controllers of the space hidden behind a mirror. \"<i>But right now I need to make sure that I copy Becky's dress exactly,</i>\" Liz thought inspecting Becky more intently to apply it to the body of Becky that Liz had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was wearing a medium green cotton dress with round neckline almost to her neck that didn't show any cleavage, although the torso stretched revealingly tight to clearly display the ample size and form of her breasts, perfect for her body. She had a black belt around her slender waist that fit through a couple of small loops which let the dress hang delightfully over her rounded hips showing her nice, attractive, hourglass figure. The hem stopped just above the knees letting her slender legs show, and she had on black 7 cm heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked down at herself to see she now had the exact copy of Becky's outfit. \"<i>That was easy,</i>\" she marveled as Becky's blond hair dangled in front of her eyes, the ends resting just below her shoulders. This bothered her as she preferred her hair back out of the way, but Becky always had her hair free except for her long bangs which she pulled behind her ears. Liz shook her head to try to get it more behind than down the sides, but it naturally fell back along the sides of her cute face. Shaking also had her stagger a bit on the small, pointed heels to catch her balance. Another thing she preferred not to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"<i>I guess I can get used to it,</i>\" she thought practicing a few strides and standing which was harder than walking in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If you'd like, Mistress, we can give you the woman's sense of herself so you feel more comfortable,</i>\" the triple voices played into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked again over at Becky and how she moved so easily displaying her teenage body so well without any concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It might be difficult not to constantly grab her hair to pull it behind me as well as not twist an ankle on these heels.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to be Becky, she would have to deal with this and look natural. Plus she didn't want to miss anything that happened this evening. She wondered if she should use their help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Liz thought \"... <i><br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

In doing this, Liz was ignoring her own disdain for the footwear she now wore, and in part she blamed Steven for having turned her into Becky instead of someone else. But those thoughts of ill-feeling rapidly diminished as she concentrated on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too stressed Mistress,\" the three hooded beings said as one, \"release the frustration inside of you...and focus\" they informed her. And Liz just feigned a smile in their direction, not quite believing they were practically giving her a pep talk. But she knew they were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it didn't help that her eyes kept darting over to where the others were stood chattering. Liz did find it amusing that Steven, despite being in her body, still found a girl like Katie ever so appealing. \"You obviously didn't give him my sexuality then?\" she asked the three 'hoodies'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely Mistress\" the three replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled and nodded, before glancing back to Steven and Katie. \"Good! That might be fun to use\" she muttered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Becky again, Liz then re-focused on the job at hand, copying the teenager's mannerisms, and hopefully her mastery at walking in heels. She did swallow some of her pride and requested help in getting used to her loose-hanging blonde hair, but she stuck to her guns on the heels thing. And after a few more attempts, Liz was doing a fairly good job in walking in Becky's shoes. <i>\"Not perfect, but it'll do, after all...everyone knows she's a little clumsy, and she always wears flats at work\"</i> Liz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's that taken care of\" Liz suddenly said, turning to face her three 'friends' again. \"Now I think its about time I showed my face...or...should I say Becky's face\" she giggled. <i>\"But first I need to 'dispose' of the real one\"</i> she thought, and the three hooded figures read her mind clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked back over to Becky, who was conversing with \"Stephanie\", and she noticed that Katie and her smitten admirer Steven were having their own conversation, not paying attention to them. This was the perfect time to change either Becky or Katie, and Liz knew who she 'needed' to change first before she could join the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you three, lets do this\" Liz sighed, addressing her three servants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since Liz  went to hide, she was thinking what background she could use for herself since the guests were bound to ask questions. At first she planned to use her resemblance to Steven to say she was his cousin or some relative, but that might get confusing if Steven or whoever Liz turned into Steven didn't know and said something different. Everything would be blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, nothing had come up about that, so 'Stephanie' was just trading her interests with Becky when she noticed Becky go out of focus. Thinking it must be her glasses, she closed her eyes and blinked. When she looked again though, she saw Steven standing before her which made her wonder if Liz had had the three magic workers spike the food with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've been working for Liz for some time,\" the new 'Steven' told her with Steven's voice and following Becky's previous sentence without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was stunned for a moment until Becky came walking up to them calling, \"Steven. Good to see you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Becks,\" he merrily replied greeting her with a friendly hug. \"Good to see you for a change when we don't have to be working. Have you met my cousin, Stephanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin? She looks like your twin,\" the new 'Becky' replied. \"Nice to meet you, Stephanie,\" she offered cheerfully and then whispered in 'Stephanie's' ear as they did a friendly embrace. \"Replacement number one finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly giggled and answered 'Becky's' question throwing in what she thought would be cute, \"I know, but we're just cousins. People used to tease us when we got together when we were little, and we even would sometimes dress up as each other and try to fool them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steven' blushed and then pleaded to 'Becky,' \"please don't tell anyone that, especially Liz or ... your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steven's' eye clearly indicated Katie who was still talking to the real Steven in his form of Liz. Neither of them had noticed the switch, and Liz gave Carly a wink that just made 'Stephanie' giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry, Stevie,\" she said unknowingly using his family nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was another knock at the door, and Steven as Liz excused himself from Katie to go answer it. He was feeling quite full of himself at the way he had been able to easily talk with Katie. Usually, he managed to bungle his words or just become stymied of what to say when with a girl he was attracted to. However, being Liz had not made him as self conscious. He strode towards the door again feeling Liz's melons bouncing pleasurably on his chest, and he quickly fell back into her persona checking her ponytail and dress, as well as glancing down into her cleavage and smiling, before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether the hooded three knew that Steven's current feelings were not truly his male self or not, they infused these feelings and confidence into the new 'Steven' since Liz had wanted the imitation to be as much like Steven as possible. Liz already had a sly grin on Becky's face, but turned it a friendly cute as she took the imitation 'Steven' by the arm and lead him over to Katie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then shook hands with what had been her best friend right up until a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\" a nervous \"Steven\" smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz watched the two politely exchanging words, neither apparently wanting to seem too 'bold', she felt quite pleased with herself. <i>\"I should get a job setting people up with each other\"</i> she mused with an inward chuckle, as she stood there rocking slightly in Becky's heels. However she also knew that if Andrea were to arrive, Carly's absence would no doubt be noticed, Liz pondered what to do in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back for a moment, and let Katie and \"Steven\" chat a lttle more. And \"Stephanie\" soon came up behind her and whispered into her ear. \"That was very smooth, I didn't see her change into him\" she complimented Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we're getting good now\" Liz bragged, glancing back at where her three 'helpers' were still observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I take it you're leaving Katie as she is? After all...how often is it we see \"Steven\" with a girlfriend\" Carly giggled, straightening her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm not sure!\" Liz responded, shrugging Becky's slender shoulders. \"As delightful as this scene is, we still need a substitute Carly\" she then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gave it a thought, then smirked at Liz, whispering again. \"Well, more guests will be arriving shortly, you can always change one of them into me\" she suggested. \"OR...there's still Bailey back in the other room, I think he'd love being human\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps!\" Liz mumbled, stumbling suddenly in her heels. \"Damn shoes!\" she growled quietly, as Carly grabbed her arm to steady her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them then walked up to Katie and the new Steven, and smiled. \"Getting along nicely I see!\" Liz grinned, causing them both to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are actually Becks!\" Katie smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly for her part went up behind \"Steven\" and whispered in 'his' ear. \"Go get her tiger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's attention was then grabbed by \"Liz's\" return. Steven strode confidently in, now mimicking Liz's walk and mannerisms perfectly. \"Hey everyone, look who's here!\" he called out, gesturing to Helen behind him. \"Hi guys!\" the pretty, 40-year old woman waved. They all greeted her with enthusiasm, especially Liz in her Becky form, and after she'd kissed Helen on the cheek, she kept hold of her hands and admired her outfit. Helen's wavy, shoulder-length black hair was looking well-kept, and she was dressed in a 'marble-print' blouse, a knee-length black skirt and a pair of knee-high, black boots with two-inch block heels. \"I love your outfit Helen!\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks Becky, I love yours too!\" Helen repaid the compliment. However Helen was more taken with the dress and open-toe shoes that \"Liz\" had on, it was a rare sight to see her friend and work supervisor in such a feminine outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz-as-Becky then introduced Helen to Katie and \"Stephanie\", and she of course already knew \"Steven\" from work. \"Nice to see you socializing love!\" Helen muttered in the new Steven's ear as she gave him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad I came\" the oblivious Becky responded, turning to flash a flirtatious smile in Katie's direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His manner was perfect-Liz, and he was quite enjoying himself, not just because he was fooling everyone, but also because he was so enamored with the feel of Liz's body. He had admired it for so long and often wondered what it would feel like, but he could never have imagined the sensations that filled his mind whenever he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lost in these thoughts as Liz's breasts jiggled with each step and his hips swayed while his thighs lightly brushed each other under the dress and his ponytail tickled his neck. The material of the dress slid against his sides and stomach and rose up and down across his chest with each bounce and step. It was so smooth, like a gentle caress, that it made him sigh contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This feels so much better than those pants and jacket Liz was wearing. Even the shoes feel nicer. I don't understand why she doesn't dress more like this.

With flowing strides, Carly felt Steven's feminized body that she had now whisk her along like a glider above the rest in the room. Being now over six foot tall as 'Stephanie' gave Carly a whole new outlook. For years she had compensated for her height with heels and by taking great care of her body and looks - one reason she became a beautician - and Carly was quite attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like a model, slender and tall with near-perfect proportions of her chest and hips, she gracefully waltzed across the room exuding even more confidence than usual. Being over half a foot taller now as Stephanie than Carly was even in her tallest heels made her dream about being out at the fancy clubs and mingling with celebs, perhaps even getting to date one, or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed back into the living room with her thoughts of dancing with a tall, dark and handsome man, she met head-on with Steven who was escorting someone that Carly knew very well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A smile appeared on \"Liz's\" face as Steven looked at Carly, he could guess just how she was feeling at that moment. \"You know, I really do love your dress Liz!\" Andrea complimented Steven, as she felt the material of Steven's new black dress, and those shoes match it so well\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you luv!\" Steven gushed, again copying Liz's tone and mannerisms perfectly. He then drew Andrea's attention to \"Stephanie\", the tall young woman who had been her daughter until some time ago. \"Andrea, this is Stephanie, Steven's cousin!\" he introduced the two to each other. Carly stepped forward somewhat nervously in her 'kitten' heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello love, its nice to meet you\" Andrea smiled courteously, shaking Carly's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...hi, yes...you too!\" Carly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea then studied \"Stephanie's\" appearance, and she was obviously astounded by the 'family resemblence'. \"You know, you and Steven really do look alike\" she addressed Carly, causing her to look at \"Liz\", who couldn't help but grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More alike than you think mom...er...Andrea\" Carly erred, quickly correcting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven-as-Liz then took a step back in his feminine footwear and folded his arms underneath his large boobs as he watched Carly 'squirm' a little talking to her own mother. He had to admit it was kind of funny. \"Must be nice being so tall\" Andrea laughed, as she looked 'up' into \"Stephanie's\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is!\" Carly nodded in response, straightening her designer glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Steven by the way? I haven't seen him for a while!\" Andrea then asked who she thought was Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's in the 'other room', I'll take you to him,\" Steven replied. \"Helen, Becky and one of her friends are here too\" he added. However he left out just who was who, as that would have been spoiling the party, at least for him, Liz and Carly (in their current guises of Liz, Becky and Stephanie respectively).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly not here yet?\" a surprised Andrea inquired. \"She phone me earlier to say she was coming over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure she'll be here soon\" Steven answered, dismissing Andrea's concerns. \"Come on, lets go see the others\" he then said, as he took hold of Andrea's arm and led her in the direction of the aforementioned room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must go to the loo!\" Carly quickly excused herself, \"I'll be back in a mo!\" she continued, as she scurried away to get Bailey from the back bedroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had never felt this way before. The dogs were usually so friendly around her, and she always felt comfortable with them. This sensation was just weird. Then she thought how Steven always feels around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe I'm more him than I thought.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off with a deep breath as she stood outside the door, Carly put Stephanie's long fingers around the doorknob and turned. Immediately, two dogs rushed out the door and ran past her before she could stop them. As she turned to watch them escape, she was surprised again when something pushed up against her bum. Spinning, she saw Bailey sniffing her and wagging his tail. His big friendly eyes greeted her with obvious recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Bailey, you can see through my disguise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey nodded with a yip in response that made Carly laugh. Stephanie's laugh was quite a different laugh than Carly's. It was deep and sensual, although Carly paid no attention to it as she rubbed Bailey behind the ears using both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz and I have a special job for you, big boy,\" she somewhat baby-talked in tone. \"We need you to impersonate me while I fool people like this. Can you do that, Bailey?\" she excitedly asked garnering another nod and yip from Bailey making her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Carly and Bailey reached the door to the party room, they could hear quite a ruckus inside. Poking Stephanie's head around the edge to see if Liz was ready to have the three magic workers transform Bailey, Carly was very amused at what was happening. Tia and Sasha were running around 'Becky' who was carefully trying to get them to stop and go play with Steven who had Liz's body so it would look natural. She wasn't having much luck for two reasons: they could smell the real Liz, and Steven was still uncomfortable with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one good thing about all this is that no one was looking at the doorway. So Carly knew that when Stephanie led Bailey into the room, Liz could have the hooded controllers change him into the imitation Carly without anyone seeing. That was a great relief, and she almost lost hold of Bailey as he was anxious to join Tia and Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, boy. Stay,\" Carly told him with Stephanie's sensuous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good that as Stephanie she was bigger and stronger than the real Carly, otherwise Bailey would have probably been inside and Carly would have to find another to take her place. Bailey sat and looked up at her pleading to be let free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't play now, Bailey. Remember our plan,\" she joked to him as if he could understand her. He then nodded as if he did making Carly giggle. All she had to do now was take Bailey inside and let the three hoodies change him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she could see that Tia and Sasha were pretty much making the plan to change Bailey into the substitute her inoperable. Eventually, Liz did glance back to the doorway, and she just brushed her long 'Becky' hair behind her ears and shook her head. \"Yep, plan postponed!\" \"Stephanie\" then mumbled to herself with a sigh. \"Come on boy, back to the bedroom for you\" she told Bailey, who seemed to be actually quite crestfallen. His whines as she led him back to the room made her apologize to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shutting Bailey back in the bedroom, Carly brushed herself off and headed back to the room, where Tia and Sasha were still running riot around Liz. \"Tia, get down!\" she mumbled quietly in Becky's voice. Carly rushed over to her in order to lend a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea by this time was talking to Helen, and she paused when she saw the dogs making a fuss of \"Becky\". What confused her more was the sight of \"Liz\" stood by the buffet table, near \"Steven\" and Katie, eating some food and barely taking notice of the two 'rampant' animals. \"Excuse me a minute Helen\" Andrea politely excused herself, before walking over to who she thought was Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, I think Becky could use your help over there\" Andrea laughed. \"Tia and Sasha seem to have escaped from where you were keeping them\" she said, and Steven-as-Liz just looked across at the dogs and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah, they do seem to like her\" he mumbled, as he refrained from lending his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea nodded, then frowned a little. \"That's what I don't understand, they normally run straight up to you\" she mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have fallen out with me\" Steven just laughed, sounding <i>exactly</i> like Liz. He then took a bite out of a sausage roll and spent a moment brushing some loose bits of pastry off his black dress. \"Besides, her and Stephanie seem to have things under control now\" he then gestured, as Liz and Carly began leading the two dogs to the door by their collars. It was no easy task for Liz, trying to keep hold of an excited dog while wearing Becky's precarious heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Andrea sighed, with a smile, then she returned to Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Bloody dogs!\"</i> Steven thought, rolling Liz's eyes as he finished downing his sausage roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia and Sasha were soon back in the bedroom with Bailey, and after re-checking their appearance, Liz and Carly returned to the room, and both of them walked straight up to Steven, who was still loving his time in Liz's busty body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could tell by their determined stride and stern look that they meant business. He just didn't know what since he was quite enjoying <i>his</i> birthday gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Becky' glanced around to make none of the others could hear then quietly started, \" Steven, you really ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on that the doorbell sounded causing everyone to look their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven perked up Liz's face that he wore and dabbed those lips with the napkin removing the crumb from the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ladies,\" he offered in Liz's voice smiling at the two of them. \"More of my birthday guests have arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he bounced happily with Liz's body causing her breasts to swing with each stride in a most enjoyable way. Steven had found that walking more with one foot in front of the other rather than side by side made Liz's body move with delicious sensations. What he hadn't found was that it really wasn't Liz's style, but then she so rarely wore a dress that no one caught it. In fact, they thought she looked quite the ravishing young woman. Well, all except Carly and Liz herself in Becky's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outrageous!\" 'Becky' hissed to 'Stephanie' watching Steven display as he exited the room \"He's going to make everyone realize it's not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" 'Stephanie' added thoughtfully. \"He actually makes you look very feminine and attractive in that dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the bloody dress. The way he's acting, eating like that and flaunting her .... <i>MY</i> body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not flaunting. It's normal for most women. Sometimes I wish you'd act more like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Becky's' eyes go wide with surprise and a bit of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he really needs to get ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think anything rash, luv,\" 'Stephanie' interrupted pointing towards the buffet where two hooded caterers and a hooded butler were freshening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stood speechless for a bit until she finally was able to speak. \"I wonder why they ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has to,\" the butler speaks as he approaches. \"Unless you'd prefer to have never-ending, self-replenishing bowls and plates. That could be arranged as well as altering minds further so as not to notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. That's fine. No more altering minds, at least not just now. Go ahead and continue,\" Liz told him with Becky's sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Miss,\" the magical servant replied with a nod and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of altering minds and such,\" Carly asked as she glanced around the room. \"Whatever happened to Becky, er ... 'Steven' and Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz immediately scanned the room as the butler turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Steven and Miss Katie, I believe, went off to another part of the house. They seemed quite in-tuned with one another.\" He then again started to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In-tuned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" he said after again spinning back in their direction. \"Quite enamored with each other from the way they held hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shakes her head and rolls her eyes, and the butler once more turns back as Andrea approaches them looking very concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have either of you seen or heard from Carly? That's my daughter,\" Andrea explains gently tapping 'Stephanie's' arm. \"I tried calling her several times, but she isn't answering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly trying to defuse the situation, Liz lies, \"I'm sure she's just busy or maybe ran her phone dead with too many texts.\" 'Becky smiles politely as she touches Andrea's arm to help comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess so,\" Andrea sighs. \"You just never stop worrying about your children. Have you noticed how Liz seems so different tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, enjoying the buffet?\" 'Stephanie' offers to change the subject seeing 'Becky's' eyes with fire in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so far, but there are a couple things I want to try, Excuse me girls while I do,\" Andrea giggles and makes a bee-line for the tiered tray of sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get Carly here somehow,\" Carly hisses quietly and getting more and more agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know.\" Liz replies. \"But the dogs were a disaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry 'bout that. They got out so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your fault, luv. 'Twas Steven, really. If he'd just tried with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Becky's' face was becoming flushed as Liz seethed about the way Steven had mangled their plans. Even Andrea was noticing his actions. Liz wasn't sure if maybe she should reveal the whole thing, but she couldn't do that with Becky off in the house with Katie, and she thinking she was with Steven. Maybe she could bring in one of her other pets and change them. It was such a mess, and she still blamed Steven.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And from the look of things, they were both complimenting Steven on his dress, as had everyone else. Carly did pay particular attention to how Steven was behaving, and then glanced at Liz, whose anger and frustration was still clearly evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we've got five unchanged party guests!\" Liz sighed in Becky's sweet sounding tone. She then changed the subject in an instant...back to Steven. \"Does he think he's on the catwalk or something?\" she grumbled to Carly, who just smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz...I really think you're just a little jealous because Steven is acting way more feminine in your body than you ever did\" Carly responded, being slightly fearful that Liz might change her in some way as 'retaliation'. But Liz wasn't THAT angered about the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Ask Eric how feminine I am when he comes in\" Liz grinned smugly, sounding very much like the teenager she now appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean in terms of clothing and mannerisms, not in bed\" Carly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir little discussion came to an abrupt halt when Charlotte came scurrying up to Liz. \"Hiya Becky!!\" she greeted her peppily, taking hold of her hands. \"Can you believe how amazing Liz looks in that dress?\" Charlotte then asked, irritating Liz a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuel to the fire!\" Carly mumbled under her breath, as she slowly wandered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...she looks wonderful doesn't she?\" Liz said through gritted teeth, as she glanced over at her former body. She knew she was jealous, but she was hardly going to admit it to any one of her friends. What she was feeling was mainly frustration at herself, as even in Becky's body she was 'clumsy' walking in heels and uncomfortable in a dress. Yet she had been female all her life, unlike Steven, who had taken to being her like a duck takes to water. After a few more brief exchanged words with Charlotte, the talkative girl scampered off to talk to Andrea and Helen, leaving Liz standing there alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay Mistress?\" the 'butler' suddenly asked \"Becky\", who snapped out of her trance. \"Your mind is troubled!\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me!\" Liz chuckled, letting out another sigh. \"And yes...I'm fine thank you\" she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can make Master Steven 'less comfortable' in your guise if you wish?\" he then offered, but Liz quickly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no, its okay, leave him as he is\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Mistress!\" the hooded 'servant' nodded, before returning to his two companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz watched Steven slowly 'saunter' over to the buffet table in her body and re-engage Becca, Charlotte, Helen and Andrea in conversation, then she herself scoured the room for \"Stephanie\" and tottered back over to her in Becky's heels. \"Your mother is getting anxious. We need 'Carly' here now!\" Liz pointed out, and Carly readily agreed, not wanting to worry her mother unduly. And at this point, they weren't too fussy about who or what they selected to become the substitute Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...where is our substitute Steven and his new girlfriend?\" a curious Carly then smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make an educated guess!\" Liz grinned in response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz glared at him as he swayed past smiling contentedly parading Liz's body like a first prize float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That face doesn't do you well, <i>Becky</i>,\" Carly spoke softly at Liz with her deep, sensual voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Liz swallowed and brightened up, but her eyes were still flaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, luv. Let's go see what <i>your</i> friend and \"Steven\" are up to, 'K?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that Liz calmed down, and now both were grinning like silly girls as they pranced towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Becks!\" Becca called. \"Can you help us for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca had started talking with Helen and Andrea as soon as 'Liz' left to answer the door about that incident with Steven the other day. It was the one all had managed to keep from Liz so she didn't get upset with him. Only the three of them and Steven knew it, but Charlotte was now getting the low down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at 'Stephanie' and shrugged. \"You go find them. I'll catch you later,\" she whispered then turned and called back, \"Sure thing.\" She was disappointed not being able to find 'Steven' and use it against the real Steven later for how he acted as her, but she knew she had to keep up the masquerade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly headed down the hall and started searching the house, avoiding the bedroom with the dogs so they didn't get loose again. With Becky being best friends with Katie, it was obvious that 'Steven' would hit it off quite well and rather quickly with her. Carly giggled at the thought of Steven finally having a girlfriend, at least he would once he and Becky were transformed back. She wondered how he would cope with not knowing what 'Steven' and Katie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then 'Stephanie's' face went aghast at the thought of what they might be doing. Surely they wouldn't do that in Liz's house, but Carly was well aware of how young men Steven's age get with a woman as well as how a woman can also get being one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stephanie's' legs moved Carly even faster throughout the house, but they weren't anywhere inside. So she checked outside. They weren't in the yard either. Now Carly began to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh no. If they wandered off to town and didn't come back tonight, 'Steven' couldn't be turned back into Becky and Liz would have to stay as her or switch with Steven to be her until they could get him back.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost panicking, she went back through the house again checking the closets this time as well. They were definitely gone. That along with the missing Carly since she was in Stephanie's tall, lanky, and sexy body meant problems had just gotten even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she better tell Liz, Carly ran towards the party room.

Hiya, is Liz in?\" a chirpy young woman, late 20's asked Carly. The woman was about 5' 5\", short blonde hair, and was dressed very business-like in a black trouser suit, white blouse (open at the collar) and black patent, high heel pumps. Carly thought for a moment as she stared at the birthday card and present in the woman's hands, then it clicked. \"Oh...er...hi, you must be Liz's boss?\" \"Stephanie\" then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm Liz too, but everyone calls me Elizabeth at work to avoid any confusion\" the woman laughed.

Original...I know\" she said, shaking Elizabeth's hand. \"The party's through here\" Carly then gestured, taking Elizabeth into the room where the others were, or rather where MOST of the others were. \"Becky\" was somewhat startled to see her boss walking into the room, and Liz couldn't believe that Steven would invite her to the party on her behalf. But of course Steven-as-Liz was delighted to see Elizabeth, as well as to recieve another birthday card and present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the introductions were out of the way, Liz stumbled over to Carly in her heels and the expression on her 'Becky face' said it all. \"Why didn't he just invite the bloody Queen while he was at it?\" she grumbled, as Elizabeth chatted away to \"Liz\", Andrea and Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a bigger problem than that, our new \"Steven\" and <i>your</i> friend Katie...are gone!\" Carly told Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone? Gone where?\" Liz responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew that luv, I'd be going after them\" Carly frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Liz sighed, \"with all this power at my disposal, you'd think it would easy to keep things in check wouldn't you?\" she groaned, rubbing her eyes. \"But I suppose with the power being limited to just this room...that's not possible\" she continued. She knew that 'damage control' was now needed. To aleviate Andrea's concern, there had to be a Carly at the party, Katie and \"Steven\" had to be found, and Liz wanted to stop Steven from 'acting out of character' as her, which was actually the thing that was most annoying to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the options immediately available to her, was to become herself again, and change Steven into Becky. That at least would clear Liz's mind enough to think of how to deal with the other problems they had. And of course...she could always change one of her pets into Carly, or change \"Stephanie\" back into Carly for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear the cogs turning from here!\" Carly muttered with a chuckle, as she saw the look of concentration on 'Becky's\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Liz made her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if on cue, the doorbell rang, and then again three more times in rapid succession. Steven initially turned to answer on the first but looked confused with the multiple bell giving a glance over to 'Becky.' Liz nodded innocently at him then put a big grin on 'Becky's' face knowing exactly who that would be and that Steven was in for a big surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becks, what's with that smile?\" 'Stephanie' asked staying in character using the name of who Liz currently looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just pulled her grin in but 'Becky's' eyes still sparkled mischievously. \"Oh, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knew something was up and wanted to follow Steven to the door, but Liz dragged her further into the room as Steven passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven again paraded by and out the door with his own smile, obviously enjoying the sensations Liz's big breasts gave him as they jiggled on his chest. But it was not just that. Steven was no longer interested in the pleasure that Liz's body sent to his brain by those breasts, or her thighs caressing each other when he moved, or even the ponytail that pulled on his head so delightfully as well as teasing his back through the open back on the dress he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Steven had become comfortable in Liz's body, so comfortable that he didn't have to think about staying in character with his walk or manners or speech. What he now felt seemed absolutely normal, and he was no longer aroused by the newness or differences that had so fascinated him earlier. Of course, Liz and Carly didn't know this. They just thought he was being too different when in fact he was being more and more like a new Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becks, what's up?\" 'Stephanie' asked more adamantly this time, but 'Becky' just smirked. \"Becky, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelenting, 'Becky's' face became serious as she checked if anyone was within earshot, the whispered, \"I just realized that I can do a switch at any time.\" She winked and added, \"And finding Katie is easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Liz opens Becky's purse and pulls out her mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You can just call her and have her come back with 'Steven'. But how can you change anyone with everyone around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the lights blinked out for a second. When they came back, Carly was now looking <i>up</i> at 'Stephanie'. A quick glance down revealed that she was now in Becky's form. She looked back up at Liz and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good trick, but how do we get a Carly here so my mom doesn't call Scotland Yard to find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stephanie' winked as she scanned the room then gazed back at the doorway to the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call Katie and get them to come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Becky' hit speed dial for Katie as Liz then took two strides that set her at the door just as another blackout hit. Immediately, she whirled around feeling her body shrink. When the lights came back, 'Carly' was now standing there in her outfit from earlier. Liz had timed it perfectly so that it looked like she was just entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz teetered on the heels for a moment then made her way back to 'Becky.\" Liz forgot how Carly liked to dress, and she was having an interesting time trying to sort out and control all the new sensations. Carly's outfit was not just meant to flatter her form, it was meant to be pleasurable to wear. Unfortunately, Liz was not used to the silky feel. Even when she was Becky, her clothes were simple cotton that <i>hung</i> on her body. Carly's <i>caressed</i> her body, the body that Liz now had, and it was rather distracting as the new \"Carly's' nipples pushing forward demonstrated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven was probably too surprised to resist, and Eric must have made it very long and passionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Eric said coming up to 'Carly' and giving her a hug and kiss on the cheek. \"You're looking your usual great self, though not as good as Liz.\" He gives a sly wink and smile. \"It's almost as if she's a different person with that dress and our, um, ... kiss before we came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, luv. She really is,\" 'Carly' replied trying to not get upset by the extreme contentment and joy on Eric's face and his dreamy eyes. She usually only saw those after they had been very passionate, and this was just about breaking the proverbial camel's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Eric greeted 'Becky' then moved on to the other guests.

Liz's new body reacted and soon she was returning the passion being heaped on her, much to the real Carly's chagrin. It wasn't until \"Becky\" loudly cleared her throat that Liz and Simon finally broke their embrace. \"Uh?\" Liz murmered in a dreamy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you two get a room?\" Carly just said, folding her slender arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry...um...Becky\" Liz apologized, before introducing Carly to her own husband, which was a little weird. \"I'll be back soon love okay, there's something I need to do\" Liz then then Simon, who took hold of her arm as she began walking off in Steven's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah baby, not so fast!

She knew all too well just how insistent (and horny) Simon could be, and she knew Liz wouldn't get away from him. Ocassionally, Carly glanced over at \"Liz\" and Eric, seeing the affection they were showing towards each oher, and suddenly...she felt left out. \"Becky...you okay? It won't kill you to smile you know\" Charlotte said, getting Carly's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was thinking!\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so that's what that noise was\" Becca joked, drawing a feigned smile from Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Liz was torn between staying with Simon and trying to switch back with Steven. She wanted her body back...and her own husband, but her new body was certainly enjoying Simon's 'advances'. Simon was younger and fitter than Eric, and their encounter was reminding her a little of her first sexual encounter with Eric all those years back. \"You want to get out of here?\" Simon whispered into Liz's ear, as he reached down to grab her pert ass with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, sounds nice!\" Liz cooed in Carly's voice, as she put her arms around his neck and kissed him again. \"But its Liz's birthday party, I don't think we should be buggering off just yet, it'd be rude!\" she told him. She omitted the part about \"Steven\" and Katie having already abandoned the party to seek <i>fun</i> elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right!\" Simon shrugged, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then took Simon's manly hand in her own smaller, manicured one and led him towards Andrea and the others. As Simon and Andrea began talking, \"Becky\" pulled Liz to one side. \"Well, what are you going to do? Switch with Steven or continue making out with MY husband?\" she asked, clearly agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just flashed one of Carly's own smiles in her direction, which only irritated her more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't like the way Steven actually seemed to be enjoying Eric's attention, but she also noticed he did try to avoid them as well.

Carly just smiled and then glanced back over at Liz and frowned a little before exiting the house with her unsuspecting hubby. Liz, for her part, turned her attention on the antics of Steven in her body and her own husband Eric. It was her intention to try and keep them apart...any way she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Simon was driving \"Becky\" to a specific club in the center of town. It was called the <i>Millennium</i> and was very popular with young people, and Carly had been told by Katie that she and \"Steven\" were there. \"So um...does this friend of yours, Katie, often run out on birthday parties?\" Simon suddenly asked with a chuckle, causing Carly to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...only if she meets a guy I suppose\" she answered in Becky's cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed again. \"Well, she's doing Steven a favor dating him, its about time he found someone\" he mumbled, as he continued driving, paying careful attention to the road and the other cars around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...right!\" Carly just said, forcing a laugh, then she rolled her eyes. If he only he knew what was really happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later they arrived at the club, and Simon parked the car in a car park a couple of hundred feet away. \"Right, lets go and drag them back to Liz's place\" Simon said, gently nudging \"Becky' in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly quickly diverted her stare from her husband's crotch and looked up into his face, feeling maybe a little embarrassed that Becky's teenage hormones were having an effect on her. \"Yeah okay, lets get inside\" Carly nodded, wasting no time in stepping out of the car. She took a moment to neaten her dress and then lifted her legs one at a time to check her heels before setting off walking, accompanied by Simon. When it came to crossing the road, Simon scooped \"Becky\" up in his muscular arms and swiftly carried her across before dropping her back down again. \"That was fun!\" Carly giggled, as she rested her new hands on her husband's broad chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hardly weigh anything, you're easier to lift than Carly is\" Simon laughed, instantly wiping the 'flirty' smile off \"Becky's\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Carly snapped. \"Are you saying I'm...?\" she then began to ask, before stopping herself. A smile then appeared back on her face, but it certainly wasn't as 'friendly' as before. \"Ooooh that's naughty, I don't think your wife would like to hear you hinting that she's fat\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon just laughed, dismissing the comment. \"Nah, she's not fat, bless her\" he said, as he set off walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I'm not!\" Carly grumbled under her breath as she scowled after him. She then followed him into the club, but for the first time in her life she had trouble gaining admittance. Luckily Simon was there to slip the doorman a little cash. The blare of dance music immediately filled their ears as they entered the main area of the club, and Carly's eyes darted around, trying to locate Katie and \"Steven\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She glanced over at her husband who was also scanning the crowd and tapping his leg to the beat. His handsome physique and her natural love for him amplified by the teenage hormones in her made her sigh and completely forget his earlier comment. She grabbed his hand suddenly because 'Becky's' young body was craving to dance with Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see them dancing this way,\" she said pulling Simon out to begin dancing with her. \"We can work our way around better if we dance,\" she explained flashing her prettiest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was a very sweet smile. It made Simon feel proud to be with such an attractive young woman, not that he was more attracted to her than Carly. It was just that every man likes to be seen with good looking women and think all pretty girls want them. It boosts their egos, and dancing wasn't like he was cheating on his wife. After all, she sent him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of them were completely absorbed into the music. Simon was a great dancer, and 'Becky's' body was perfect for dancing. They worked their bodies like a matched pair (which they were except Simon didn't know and 'Becky's' body was not the usual one Carly had). They were having such a good time that they forgot about having to drag 'Steven' and Katie back. Besides this was much more fun that standing around talking to Liz's co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the party, Liz noticed that Steven was cringing less each time Eric was a bit affectionate. Initially, she enjoyed seeing Steven have to let Eric kiss him and hold him close, but now she saw a real change. Steven was not just letting Eric have his way, he was starting to flirt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>First he parades my body around, and now he's enjoying Eric,</i>\" Liz thought getting more and more flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, being in Carly's body kept her busy with her mom and the other guests. She couldn't get away from them let alone get Steven away from Eric far enough that a blackout change wouldn't be noticed. What's worse was that the way Eric was keeping 'Liz' close was making Liz jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly, what's got into you?\" Andrea asked looking rather concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, nothing.\" Liz offered in Carly's voice avoiding eye contact, instead looking over at 'Liz.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly, dear, look at me. You've been all upset ever since Simon went off to fetch Becky's friend. Did you two have a spat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Liz shot back surprised since she wasn't thinking of Simon and Carly at all. \"No. Of course not. Simon and I are fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is it? I'm your mother, and I can tell that something is bothering you.\" Andrea followed Liz's glance. \"Is it something with Liz? You two have always seemed so close. I know Liz can get uppity sometimes.\" She then checked to make sure no one else was in earshot then leaned in and quietly said, \"She gets rather bossy at work occasionally, usually around that time, but others too. Anyway, we have a signal to let the others know she's in a mood. We call it \"Liz Fizz\" because of the way her mouth twitches and seems to bubble out like a fizzy soda.\" She then leaned back and started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was flabbergasted. She had never heard of this although did remember a few times overhearing someone mention Liz Fizz. Liz thought it was some new drink somewhere maybe that Becky or one of the others had had at a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Carly's' face went red with embarrassment and anger. Liz quickly looked away to not show Andrea but couldn't bare her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, ... that's, ... that's, ...\" Liz sputtered caught between her outrage and need to pretend to be Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. come on,\" Andrea giggled nudging Liz with her elbow. \"You know it's funny. At least as funny as the things you've told me of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Liz was even more surprised, and her face showed it. Not only was Steven driving her crazy using her body, but now she finds out that her workers have secret names for her and her actions. Even her good friend tells stories about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz spun on Carly's heels to walk away and nearly fell not being used to them. She stumbled forward and spun around ending up face-to-hood with one of the guardian/servers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After having a couple of drinks, they were back out on the dance floor and Carly had her arms wrapped around Simon's neck. Their hips were gyrating in unison and she enjoyed feeling the 'prod' of Simon's erect penis through his pants. \"Oooh, getting excited are we?\" she giggled in Becky's voice, flashing her cute braces at him when she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon just smiled back in a typically 'smug, masculine' way, and shrugged as he continued dancing. He certainly wasn't feeling guilty about what he was doing, dancing so provocatively with another girl, or so he thought. But Carly, despite her own arousement, was slightly annoyed by the fact Simon would flirt with another girl so easily. But unlike Liz, she wasn't so quick to judge, flirting was one thing, having sex was something else, and she was sure Simon would stay faithful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, in this case, it didn't matter, since it was Carly herself who Simon was 'flirting' with, unknowing to him. That thought amused Carly no end as she continued enjoying herself in the club with him. Carly's main goal, locating the rightful owner of the body she now wore and her friend Katie, had now slipped back to a secondary 'objective'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate or fortune would have it however, while she and Simon were 'busting their moves' on the dance floor, \"Steven\" and Katie blundered right into them...literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...sorry!\" the transformed Becky apologized, without noticing at first who she had bumped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky!!\" an excited Katie then exclaimed, as she stepped forward to hug who she thought was her friend. \"So nice you could make it\" she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just smiled and cleared a throat a little, then she hugged Katie. \"Er...yeah, we came to find you, but thought we'd have some fun while we're here\" she explained in her teenage voice, glancing at Simon, before introducing him to Katie. The young girl seemed impressed with Simon's physique, but not enough to 'steal' her affection towards \"Steven\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you out and about pal!\" Simon then greeted \"Steven\" with a manly hand shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Becky responded, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose. \"Does Carly know you're here?\" she then asked in Steven's relatively deep voice, causing Carly and Simon to look at each other for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she knows!\" \"Becky\" then responded with a cheeky smile, her voice barely audible over the din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, um...we all heading back to the party? Everyone is missing you two\" Carly then asked her two friends. She was hoping it would be easy to persuade the two 'lovebirds' to head back with them to the party.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The buzz in the room had greatly increased as everyone began discussing their, hopefully, hallucination<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" came Liz's own voice from Steven in her body as he rushed up to her. \"Everyone, except you, became a pig for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you would behave yourself, I wouldn't have gotten so upset and accidentally, uh ... you know,\" Liz retorted trying to sound firm and apologetic. Unfortunately, it came out like a sweet sounding joke especially when she giggled nervously at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope no one noticed,\" Steven whispered looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if they do, you better have a good explanation,\" she pouted. \"Now why don't we just take a stroll so we can discuss this,\" she added taking 'Liz's' arm and leading her towards a new archway that materialized leading to another part of the room and out-of-sight of the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure why she had pulled him away or where this strange new hallway lead, but 'Carly' was not one to want a private conversation unless it was serious which scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was actually a bit confused since he wasn't sure who this Carly really was. Maybe she was actually Carly. The original plan was for Carly to be Becky, but he thought Becky had been turned into him and Liz stayed as 'Becky.' Carly was 'Stephanie,' but he hadn't seen her lately. So maybe this was Carly, unless Liz had changed someone else to be her.

At the same time, 'Andrea' and 'Carly' came towards the real Carly sharing snickers knowing 'Becky' didn't know who was who. As they did, Simon walked around 'Becky' with a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sweets. Miss me,\" he said as he wrapped his arms around 'Carly' and planted a big kiss onto Andrea's mouth and proceeded to give her a most passionate kiss while she had Carly's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Becky, where did you and my son-in-law run off to?\" 'Andrea' asked pulling 'Becky' from glaring at her, Carly's, husband kissing, now, another person. Steven readjusted his new dress so it better highlighted his new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ah, Liz sent us to bring back Steven and Katie,\" she replied assuming this 'Carly' in Simon's grasp must be Steven since Liz was back as herself. This made her snicker knowing that Liz wanted to punish Steven and having another man kiss him was probably her plan. However, she noticed that 'Carly' was really getting into it in a way that looked very feminine and not the pretend female that Steven had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea, now, had her face in shock staring at 'Steven' and Katie who were over in a corner being very affectionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah-wah-what happened to them?\" Steven stuttered unable to take his eyes from their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems they really hit it off,\" 'Becky' giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-that's amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's about time Steven found himself someone,\" Carly explained. \"We almost lost them for the night,\" she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Andrea's' face went pale then flushed red. \"You mean they would have ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely they will later still,\" Carly giggled with Becky's teenage voice and broke into some hiccups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven continued to stare at his likeness and how Katie was showing real affection towards him. He thought how he was so uncomfortable with girls and never able to get close to any of those he had dated. He almost wished he could be that Steven. Almost. But then he thought about the wonderful female body he now had or was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea was older than Liz, but she was still attractive even in her fifties and her body was just as voluptuous as Liz's with a great set of breasts. Steven took a deep breath to make them rise and fall on his chest enjoying the sensation. He really would like to take a closer look, but Andrea didn't have a low-cut dress like Liz that he could stare down into and watch them bounce as he walked. Still, perhaps there might be a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, dear. I need to find the loo,\" Steven said politely using Andrea's voice and his best manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Carly replied going back to staring daggers at her husband who was using one arm to crush a Carly-look-alike around her waist. She knew she shouldn't be jealous especially since Simon didn't know it wasn't really her. Beside, he had played the perfect gentleman and not tried anything with her when they went to the club. Still she felt alone and ignored and really wanted someone to show her some attention.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to all that had been going off, Steven had forgotten that Liz's three dogs were still in the house, trapped in her and Eric's bedroom, eager to have contact with someone or to at least stretch their legs a little. Instead of going to the loo, Steven minced his way down the hallway in Andrea's 'full-figured' body and headed straight into the main bedroom. No sooner had he got inside than Bailey, Tia and Sasha 'rushed' him, jumping up at him and barking in an affectionate manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my god!\"</i> Steven shrieked in Andrea's voice as he tried to push the dogs away from him. It was all in vain, and then as he tried to exit the bedroom...Tia got under his feet and he went sprawling on the floor. It was then that he let out a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum!\" Carly exclaimed in Becky's voice when she heard the scream from the other room. Amazingly, nobody else heard it because Liz had but a CD on to entertain everyone with a little party music. Carly quickly scurried off to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, she giggled when she saw the three dogs clambering all over her prostrate mother, or who she still thought was her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get these bloody animals off me!!\" Steven said, as he stopped Bailey from licking his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was than that something 'clicked', and \"Becky's' face contorted into an intense frown. Carly knew her mother normally loved dogs, especially Liz's, but that Steven disliked them, which led her to the obvious conclusion. \"STEVEN??\" Carly exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly couldn't believe that it was Steven now in her mother's body, which meant that the person was making out with her husband Simon was...her own mother in her body. \"Why are you my mum?\" Carly asked the obvious question, as she pulled Tia and Sasha off of Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grabbed hold of Bailey's collar and then pushed the dog away before slipping out of the room. Carly followed him and closed the door behind her. Carly folded her arms under her perky 'Becky' breasts and waited for Steven's answer. But he took his time in neatening his disheveled dress and running his hands over his mature boobs. \"Ahem!\" Carly then said loudly, clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven eventually looked up, and shrugged his new shoulders. \"Carly, your mother wanted to be young again, and Liz suggested that she be you for a while, her own daughter\" he explained. \"This way I guess she finds out just how great a lover Simon is first hand\" he then smirked, but Carly wasn't laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain why Liz changed you into my mum\" Carly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agreed to it\" Steven said, smiling again, and looking down at himself. \"Its...'interesting' being an older woman\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just sighed and frowned again, looking Steven over. \"Whatever floats your boat!\" she grumbled. She knew that Steven would have preferred to have kept Liz's body, but since that wasn't possible....he was after some new experiences. \"Its a good thing nobody else heard you scream\" Carly mumbled, as she took hold of 'Andrea's' arm and lead Steven back into the room to rejoin the others. Steven was a little chagrined that he hadn't got a chance to check out his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Carly to locate her mother, sat in an empty corner of the room snogging with Simon. Andrea was feeling very aroused in her daughter's youthful body and she apparently saw nothing wrong with making out with her son-in-law.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He again felt stuck between two missed opportunities: having a girlfriend and discovering the mature female body he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz saw the two return she headed over to see what was going on. However, as she approached, Eric rushed up and pulled her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more leaving me alone with your co-workers, please?\" he pleaded with her. Of course Liz couldn't resist his little-boy expression and walked back together fingers intertwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly and Steven continued to watch the action that they should have been in. Their emotional hormones stirred them ruthlessly. Finally they began to realize that it wasn't them or even there look-alikes. It was Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, 'Becky' and 'Andrea' sighed then muttered, \"This is getting out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly they looked at each and spoke simultaneously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to do something about your ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend.\" \u00a0 \"Daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they both started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what each of them would think if they knew who they were really kissing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell Simon once you change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly thought for a while, her face going from inquisitive to smirking and then confused before answering. \"I'm not sure. Are you going to tell your <i>girlfriend</i> when you take her home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't the two of you be leaving together? You came together. I mean, Becky and Katie came together, so ... won't they leave together?\" Steven asked with pure naive innocence that looked so unnatural on 'Andrea's' mature wise face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Becky' just giggled shaking her head at Steven. \"That's not how it works, luv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that 'Andrea's' expression became shocked. Steven had not even thought that he would be taking Katie home. As a matter of fact, Steven hadn't been thinking anything more than one moment at a time enjoying himself, or rather whoever's body he had. He was quite satisfied with having a full-figured female body experiencing all the new sensations that it gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but I don't know anything about her. What will I do? What will I say? I can't ask her the same questions I already, ... I mean ... I mean ... he, she, ... that other ...\" Steven sputtered with Andrea's voice panicking and starting to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly immediately recognized the symptoms and tried to calm Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take slow breaths. Take slow breaths. Relax. It will be OK,\" 'Becky' repeated as best she could but her young voice just kept getting higher. She lead 'Andrea' away from the scene of 'Steven' with Katie and looked around for somewhere they could sit. \"Liz can fix this, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz watched as she stood with Eric talking to Elizabeth and Helen. She wasn't sure why Steven was acting so frantic and scared, but she just thought it served him right. However, when she saw 'Becky's' eyes catch hers and looking very desperate, Liz pondered whether she should do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was about to go help, when a slow song started, and Eric pulled her out to dance. By halfway through the song, the other two couples were also clutching each other tightly and swaying to the music provocatively grinding. Liz could feel Eric's love press against her, and all thoughts of the others disappeared by the time the music ended. Eric then looked her lips with his most passionately, and the other couples did the same.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A combination of the confusement and shock...combined with being in Andrea's weaker, female body was just too much. \"Oh god!\" 'Becky' gasped, reached for something to start fanning Steven with. She also tried to get Liz's attention again, to no avail, and nobody else seemed to have noticed either. Eventually Carly calmed herself, and when he noticed that Steven's breathing was steady again despite him being unconscious...she turned her attention over to her husband and her mother. <i>\"Right, that's it!\"</i> she grunted, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorming across the room in Becky's heels, Carly went right up to Simon and her former body...currently worn by her mother. \"Carly!\" she snapped sharply. \"Can I have a private word with you please?\" she then asked, being rather polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea stopped snogging with Simon long enough to look up at 'Becky'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...can it wait?\" Andrea replied in her daughter's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" Carly exclaimed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was the one who quickly defused the situation. \"Its okay babes, go and talk to Becky, I'll be here when you get back\" he winked, chucking Andrea under the chin. Andrea then reluctantly broke her embrace and removed her shapely leg from Simon's lap before walking away with 'Becky'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, what's annoying you so much?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know,\" Carly answered acerbically, \"Maybe its the fact that you're making out with MY husband!!\" she glared at her former body. \"Or maybe its the fact that your body is passed out over there with Steven inside, or that Liz doesn't seem to give a crap what's happening around here anymore\" she continued, launching into a 'quiet' tirade. Andrea looked across at her own body with some concern, then she glanced across at Liz and Eric, who were still holding each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sweetheart, I was just...I...I haven't felt this way about a man in a long time, I guess I got carried away\" Andrea apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay mum!\" Carly sighed, sweeping Becky's long hair from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I get Steven some water and you go and have a word with Liz\" Andrea then suggested. Carly nodded in agreement and then her mother sauntered out of the room in her high heels, handling her body masterfully. That left Carly standnig there, still in Becky's form, her eyes fixed on Liz. Under normal circumstances she would already be talking to her if something was irritating her, but she was a little hesitant to approach Liz, now that she had her three hooded friends backing her up. Carly was bucking up the courage to go and confront Liz when Charlotte suddenly screeched in her ear like she often did with people. \"HIYA BECKY!!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, why are you so loud?\" Carly responded, covering her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I am!\" Charlotte answered plainly, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Carly grumbled, feigning a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the party has got to the old lady over there\" Charlotte then said, in betwen sipping her drink. She was referring of course to 'Andrea', currently being tended to by the imitation Carly. The real Carly, in Becky's body, just frowned, annoyed by Charlotte's lack of respect for other people, especially her mother...or rather...Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must just be hot in here\" Carly grumbled, as she tried to think of a way to get away from Charlotte.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Watching couples here can be very <i>annoying</i>,\" Carly offered in Becky's voice as she glared back at her own body again that was changing poses to look ever so like a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OO, YEAH,\" Charlotte beamed loudly again as her eyes sparkled at the thought and she wildly waved Becca over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth 'Becky' and 'Carly' cringed at the noise of Charlotte's voice and traded unpleasant smiles, Carly looking even cuter with 'Becky's' braces, and Andrea appearing very prim and attractive with Carly's face and body once more shifting her position making her seem more mature and sophisticated than the \"girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bec, we can still make the dance. Whacha say?\" Charlotte quizzed her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Liz wouldn't mind if you three young ladies wanted to go have some more fun,\" Andrea threw out immediately hoping they would take the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two,\" Carly sternly spoke indicating she wasn't about to leave her mother looking like her and her husband not knowing the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Becky,\" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. It'll be fun,\" Charlotte almost squealed she was so excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Katie and I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Katie would agree,\" Becca whispered nodding her head toward Katie and 'Steven' again snogging just a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for you to be alone, dear,\" Andrea interjected putting her daughter on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Becca sighed looking at the two lovebirds holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just couldn't. I need to ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get out with us,\" both Charlotte and Becca said together each grabbing one of 'Becky's' arms and hauling her towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now have fun and don't think of us old folks milling around her,\" Andrea teased as she watched her daughter in 'Becky's' body struggle while giving Andrea a nasty look over her shoulder. However, the two girls were not about to let 'Becky' remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea felt very smug at her success causing a big smile to grow across her face. She sighed contentedly and brushed her outfit straight again sensing the young body she now had. It so reminded her of when she was young, and she just wasn't ready to give it up, at least not just yet. Besides, she didn't plan to do anything to embarrass her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three disappeared out the door, 'Carly' turned and glanced across at 'her' handsome husband. She couldn't wait to feel his arms around her again. A little innocent affection wouldn't hurt anyone. As she sauntered seductively his way, her whole body felt warm and tingly. It made her forget being old, and just about everything else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had got rid of her former body with Steven inside, and now she had got her daughter out of the way so she could have her way with her unsuspecting husband Simon. \"Hey handsome!\" a horny Andrea grinned as she approached Simon, who was stood with his hands in his jeans pockets. As soon as Andrea planted a passionate kiss on his lips, Simon withdrew his hands from his pockets and put his arms around her, returning her affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Liz and Eric were stood not far from Andrea and Simon at the buffet table, having a bite to eat, and the love-struck 'Steven' and 'his' girlfriend Katie were still making out to Andrea's right, hardly coming up for air. Their giggling and murmerings could be heard by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was about to kiss Eric when suddenly Elizabeth interrupted her. \"Dwindling number of party guests Lizzie!\" she commented, causing Liz to turn and look at her. Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Elizabeth, the assistant manager at the store where most of them worked at. And even though she was now at a party, Elizabeth was still dressed as she normally would for work, in a smart black trouser suit, a white blouse open at the collar, and a pair of black patent pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick glance around the room, Liz then shrugged. \"Oh well, could hardly expect to keep all the teenagers here now could I?\" she laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least not those otherwise 'occupied' right?\" Elizabeth giggled, gesturing to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled at the sight of 'Steven' and Katie kissing and fondling each other. \"I'm happy for Steven that he's found someone\" she chortled. \"And speaking of other guests...where are Andrea and Helen?\" Liz then suddenly asked, frowning a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I saw them leaving earlier,\" Elizabeth responded, as she ate a cupcake. \"Andrea didn't look too good, maybe Helen took her home\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" Liz mumbled, wondering why Steven hadn't said goodbye before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we all head out to the pub?\" Eric suddenly suggested, his mouth watering at the thought of downing a pint of Guinness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like that idea\" 'Carly' suddenly chimed up, as she and Simon walked up, arms around each other. \"I could do with a nice glass of red wine\" she then said, before looking at Simon again and kissing him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wine? Since when have you drank wine?\" Simon quizzed his 'wife'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Carly' just smiled and stuck her tongue out at her hubby. \"I guess there's more of my mother in me than I knew\" she joked. \"I just feel like having a nice glass of Echo Falls!\" she said, before glancing to Liz, who was smirking also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth meanwhile had wandered off back to the buffet table, and it was Andrea who drew Liz's attention to her again. Liz knew she couldn't leave Elizabeth in the house alone, and neither she, Eric, Simon or 'Carly' wanted her tagging along to the pub, her being management and all. It would also be rude to ask her to leave. \"You trouble-shoot that little problem Liz, I'll inform the lovebirds we're heading to the pub\" Andrea said to Liz after pulling her to one side.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wiggling her toes, she giggled.

They had been friends for years. Even though physically transformed and given Steven's memories and personality, some of the real Becky must have leaked through. It got twisted just enough to make this 'Steven' much more bold than the real one would have ever been and enough things in common from Becky to make them a great pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and Stevie is such a dear,\" Katie added running a finger down 'Steven's' chest and looking all lovestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is going to be very interesting when they switch back,</i> Andrea thought. <i>But then, there's no real rush,</i> she smirked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of us are going to head down to the pub for a few,\" 'Carly' told them with a smile. \"Coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" 'Steven' started but was interrupted by Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice, but we, ... I don't want to seem like a third wheel, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steven' just pulled her into a hug. \"There's no third wheels here,\" he said before planting a kiss on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea shook her head and figured this was going to be quite interesting when everyone was back to who they really are. And it was going to lots of fun until then. However, she started to think that once they were at a pub, it was going to hard to get everyone to go to Liz's to switch back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed over to Simon, she wondered how long she should stay as her daughter. She now realized that her initial prank to let her stay as Carly a little longer might go further than she thought. Not that she wouldn't really mind going home with such a handsome man as Simon, but she was beginning to feel guilty.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd had enough of all this and wanted Liz and her three hooded 'playmates' to put an end to it. And she wasn't polite about it either. She grabbed Liz by her arm and pulled her to one side, startling her a little. \"Alright, this has gone far enough Liz, my mother is WAY too happy being in my body...and kissing MY husband!\" she grumbled, trying to keep it down. \"And I think we should get Steven back here and change him and Becky back to normal too, its not fair him being stuck in my mum's body\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to end the fun?\" came Liz's amused response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun??\" Carly snapped. \"It was at first, but then my mother got involved!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she said that, Andrea sauntered up in Carly's sexy body and interrupted the conversation. \"Look, sweetheart...I'm really sorry about this, but put yourself in my shoes for a minute will you.\" Andrea said, drawing a feigned chuckle from her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I?

The last thing she wanted was other folks at work to know about what Steven's birthday gift to her could do. Her mind also began wondering what it might be like to sit up in management rather than supervise the bottom tier workers and make everything happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure we could ever pull that off,\" Liz added relaxing with a thoughtful pose hoping Elizabeth might come clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth stood back with a small grin and scanned the room as if checking to see if anyone could hear. Liz kept her eyes on her trying to read her body language. Elizabeth usually seemed so business-like and poised at work. She made pleasantries and an occasional humorous statement, but she was known for her proficiency and seriousness at her position. The way she was acting now was not her usual character. Then again, Liz and Elizabeth rarely socialized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's going to be a shakeup with the company, but you didn't hear it from me,\" Elizabeth finally told her. \"It won't affect you or any of your workers, so don't worry or tell anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished, Elizabeth was giddy with excitement. Her face beamed with light as she slightly pranced on her feet like a little girl. Obviously, it was something that had been bubbling around inside her looking to be shared with someone. Liz's party just happen to loosen her up enough, and she must trust Liz enough to let her know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thanks, Elizabeth,\" Liz replied with a confused smile. She didn't want to pry, but found it all very quite interesting. <i>What could possibly be going on?</i> she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're quite welcome, Liz. And thank you so much for inviting me to your party. I know we don't usually get together, but it makes me feel good that you included me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't know what to say as she shifted her position allowing her dress to slide back-and-forth against her skin sending a satiny caress like a shiver through her and augmenting physically the effects of Elizabeth's compliment to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the party's winding down to couples, and I need to be getting on,\" she added. Elizabeth then moved closer and gave Liz a little hug saying, \"Thank you again, luv, and happy birthday,\" she said as she finally sauntered out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just stood there thinking what a strange night this had been and not just because of the room. Or maybe having Elizabeth over was because of the room since Steven was in Liz's body when he invited her.

But her smile turned into a frown when she looked to her left and saw 'Steven' grabbing in between his legs, rubbing the erection that Becky had sported just moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz immediately pushed Andrea away from Becky and Katie for a moment and slapped her hands away from her crotch. \"Stop that!\" Liz admonished Andrea, looking 'up' into her face. \"Not when around others anyway\" she added. She knew that it was different for Andrea being in Steven's body than it had been for Becky, since Andrea was aware of who she was. That however was not reason enough for her to start masturbating in front of people, according to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels...weird!\" Andrea mumbled in Steven's voice, as she checked herself out, her eyes wandering once more onto the bulge in her pants. But then she smiled a little. \"But it does actually feel nice too, you were right luv!\" she then mentioned to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya!\" Liz grinned smugly. \"Now um...your girlfriend is missing your already, don't leave her alone\" she told Andrea, gesturing behind her to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...okay\" Andrea said. \"This should be interesting too\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then politely led Becky away from the two 'lovebirds' and allowed them some time alone. Poor Becky still seemed a little confused, but a little mental 're-wiring' by Liz's 'associates' reset her back to her normal, cheery, teenage self. This made Liz feel a lot better, the only now not in their own bodies were Andrea and Steven. But she knew she had to get Steven back to the party. As she got out her mobile phone, she hoped Helen wouldn't mind picking 'Andrea' up again and bringing her back to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We having a drink today or not?\" Simon suddenly shouted out. \"My throat is as dry as Ghandi's flip flop!\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at Simon, with Carly clinging onto his arm, apparently unwilling to let him out of her sight again. \"We'll head out in a bit okay!\" Liz said, before turning away, waiting for Helen to pick up her phone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm home early just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven popped off the couch like a jack-in-a-box trying to figure out which way to run and hide. Unfortunately, his initial motion took him towards the front door; and when Eric swung it closed, their eyes met, and Eric dashed over and embraced him with all his passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only panic in Steven's mind, but the body of Liz, especially her sensitive breasts crushed against Eric's strong chest, flooded him with happiness and arousal causing him to return Eric's kiss. At first it was just friendly, but soon Steven found himself whole heartily clinging to this man trying to suck his lips off while running his tongue across Eric's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have lasted a whole minute before Carly coughed trying to stifle a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't know you had company,\" Eric apologized still holding Steven round the waist with one arm as his attention went fully to the tall, slender, very attractive young woman rising from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked dazed with a silly smile of happiness on his face that took a couple moments for him to catch himself and shake Liz's head to clear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ... um, I, ... er, ah, yes, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Stephanie,\" Carly said stepping forward and offering her hand which Eric took. \"You must be Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Eric replied forming a debonair smile that can flatter and entice any woman. Then his face turned quizzical. \"Have we met before? You seem rather familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just giggled, blushed and looked down unable to control herself. However, it just sounded and looked like she was really taken by the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, and I'm the other Eric,\" Liz said stepping into view form the side offering a big, strong hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just went into a trance as he held out his hand naturally. Liz took it and shook it vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along you handsome brute. There's something I want to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stumbled forward as Liz rubbed the key to make the mysterious door appear again, then pushed him into the room after unlocking the door. Steven and Carly followed Liz and the dogs dashed in with them before anyone thought to keep them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place? Where did it come from? Who are you? Who are they? What's happening?\" Eric rattled off one question after another looking around at the amorphous space and the three guardians before becoming shocked watching Stephanie turn into Carly, Liz turn into Steven, and finally the other him becoming a laughing Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" was his final question as he then stood in awe and silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven gave me a little gift that turned out a bit more than he knew,\" Liz started before filling Eric in on everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" is all he could say at first, but then the wheels spun quickly, and his eyes became very excited. \"They can change ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you need to be careful with limited intelligence becoming human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric was dumbfounded standing as Liz told him, \"Oh, I forgot. They can read minds, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then smiled and suggested enthusiastically, \"Let's see them switch us with Bailey, Tia and Sasha.

And out of Steven and Carly, the former was more willing to take part in the little 'experiment'. He watched the three dogs running around, making a fuss around Liz, and to a lesser extent around Eric. \"When we finally make our decision, I want you to change us into the dogs and vice-versa\" Liz told her three new servants, who nodded obediently. \"Yes Mistress!\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets get on with it already!\" an impatient Eric grumbled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven and Carly dropped their arms to their sides becoming concerned at what Liz might be thinking. It didn't take them too long to find out as they watched Eric shimmer and turn into a copy of Sasha. He immediately took off running across the room disappearing into the milky edges and out of sight. As he did, Bailey barked and took off in pursuit. Before Tia and the real Sasha could join in the romp, their bodies began to glow and grow until they were standing next to Liz. Steven and Carly were agape at the two figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you two behave and don't make a mess anywhere,\" Liz commanded of the two transformed dogs, and both nodded. \"And you two who don't want to be dogs,\" Liz started looking over at Steven and Carly who were feeling their bodies shiver and not sure if it was a transformation coming or just being scared, but she said no more and just fell to all fours and changed into a copy of Tia.  As she started to run off after Eric and Bailey, she stopped and watched Steven and Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Oh no. Oh no,\" Carly kept repeating as she started flapping her arms in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at her then kept checking himself, then back at her, then himself, then the two humanized dogs. He hoped he wasn't going to be a dog. His mind started to think about having a collar and leash down on all fours with Tia and Sasha holding <i>his </i>leash and taking <i>him </i>out for a walk where he'd be naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Ah! Ah! Awk! Awk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's voice was sounding horse as Steven couldn't believe his eyes. Carly's clothes were starting to fray and change color. Her hair formed into many little silky mats. Still waving her arms in a panic and dancing around as if on hot coals, she suddenly and rapidly shrunk to maybe a foot tall but was fluttering in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly? You're ... you're ... you're a ...\" Steven stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parrot. Awk!

Steven's penis slowly grew into an erection as he looked at them, and they seemed to sense his aroused state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" Steven suddenly cleared his throat, but was unable to take his eyes off the mouth-watering curves both 'dogs' now possessed.

Horny sod!\" Carly suddenly squawked in Steven's ear, making him wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet bird brain!\" Steven responded with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly then suddenly pecked Steven up the side of the head. \u201cOw!

A smile appeared on his face as he looked at Carly on his shoulder again, and he immediately turned to the three hooded figures. He didn\u2019t have the say anything, they read his mind as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room around suddenly started shimmering and after only a few seconds they were on the deck of an old sailing ship. Steven's body and clothing then began changing also. In no time at all Steven was the epitomy of a pirate, long hair, straggly beard and mustache and a peg leg. He was dressed like Jack Sparrow, his glasses were gone and had a patch over his left eye. \"Arrr me ol' mateys, call me Jack!\" Steven called out loudly, really getting into the spirit of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk! What an idiot!\" Carly squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven gave Carly a disapproving glance with his one visible eye. \"Arrr, shut your beak Missy!\" he told her, causing her to flap her wings in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what I wonder are these two girlies doing on my ship?\" Steven then chuckled, as he approached a puzzled looking Tia and Sasha.

Wenches aboard a bad omen, Cap'em. Awk,\" Carly squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush up bird,\" Steven growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sound made Tia take a couple steps back. It wasn't clear if she understood the words, but a growling male is not something to approach, well, unless ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha was not phased and circled Steven sniffing him up and down. Steven watched smiling at her lovely form now somewhat more clothed in a sheer, dirty-white smock that billowed in the wind. The rocking motion of the ship gave Steven a mesmerizing performance by her perky breasts, and the cool breeze also coaxed her nipples way out. Steven was glad to have on baggy pantaloons so his erection was not strapped tight in his normal jockey briefs. Even so, it was still visibly quite obvious that he was extremely aroused. As Sasha came back to front, Steven's hands reached out on their own to touch the beautiful woman that came from a dog. His hands strolled up to cup her chest as his thumbs pushed her buttons making her moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk. Watch those hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do what I want with my hands,\" Steven hissed out the side of his mouth at the Carly parrot still on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk.

Hoist the sails. Hoist those sails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Steven didn't and soon tripped over the pants around his ankles when he tried to catch his balance on the rolling ship. This sent Carly flapping into the air where she circled while it sent Steven sideways ending on all fours. Quickly he crawled round only to immediately face Sasha's delightful rump swaying before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding back on Steven's shoulder, Carly called, \"Awk. The bitch is mating ready, matey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Carly's warnings lit the bulb in Steven's head.

He had never had sex before, but he was now acting as though he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk, awk, storm on the horizon!\" Carly sqawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Sasha just moaned in a very sensuous, human voice, biting her lower lip as Steven pumped away inside of her. Tia was watching from the sidelines, as were the three hooded figures whose domain this was. \"Oh god...!\" Steven groaned louder, his faked pirate accent now gone...at least for now. As his back and forth motion increased, so did his heart rate, he could feel himself about to 'blow' inside Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another loud moan...Steven had his orgasm and shot his load into Liz's transformed dog. Then he just partly collapsed onto her rump as he descended from his high.

However he then looked over at Tia, and felt sorry for her. He did however decide against having sex again, and instead he stood up and pulled up his pantaloons as the ship rocked back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly soon landed back on Steven's shoulder as he clonked across the deck with his peg leg, and he used a telescope the probe the horizon that wasn't really there. After a few more moments he looked down at see Sasha pining around his legs again, running a hand over his re-stiffening penis. <i>\"She's insatiable!\"</i> he thought to himself.

He found himself in a large park with many trees but plenty of open space to just run, and that's what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him he could hear Bailey barking. He would recognize that bark anywhere since he had been with Liz and she had Bailey for so long. He was glad Bailey was following him because he wanted to share this feeling of freedom. Bailey was always up for a good time. The two of them often enjoyed an evening out when Liz was off at the late shift at work. They would run together in the park, which Eric just realized was identical to this except now he was a dog,too. They would also tumble and wrestle on the ground when the weather was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slowed and looked around wondering if this was the same park. He hadn't left the room, he thought, but it was so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We have the ability to create space and places as well as alter creatures,</i>\" came into his head from the guardians. \"<i>It was what you were thinking, and the Mistress said that you should be allowed to be pleased.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric panted with his doggy smile as he heard Bailey trot up to him. He faced Bailey, and they sniffed each other. Eric kept turning to face Bailey not really wanting to sniff his hindquarters, but Bailey kept trying to get behind him. This dance soon had them running in a tight circle until Bailey bumped Eric hard and sent him rolling into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on his back, Eric pawed the air as Bailey tried to push him over, but it felt so much fun this way almost like when he was human. Eventually, Bailey barked and ran around Eric until he got up, then he jumped at Eric putting his front paws on Eric's back. Eric twisted away and they continued to play in this manner until Eric got tired and stood still letting Bailey approach as he desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Eric a few seconds until ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bailey it seemed understood Liz's barks as disapproval, and quickly 'dismounted' Eric. Liz then approached her husband, currently in the guise of her youngest female dog and she reached out with a paw and hit him gently. <i>\"Mistress wishes us to warn you how close you were to having intercourse as a dog\"</i> said the voice of the guardians in Eric's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What??\"</i> a surprised Eric thought, turning to look at Bailey. Eric barked twice in his direction, only to get a plethora of retaliatory barks from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to lighten up the situation, Liz then jumped on Eric and the two fell to the ground, rolling and pawing, their new tongues hanging from their mouths as they had fun. Bailey soon joined in the fun again, but Liz and especially Eric kept a close eye on the horny dog's actions. Eric didn't want no surprises from behind. And Liz for her part didn't want to see anyone/anything having sex, including Bailey. She did think it a little unwise to leave an untransformed Steven in the presence of Tia and Sasha in their new human forms, but since he was a virgin, she doubted he'd try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rolling on the ground for a while, Eric suddenly bolted again, running through the imaginary (but incredibly vivid) park scenery with Bailey in pursuit once more. Letting out another bark, Liz set off after them to 'supervise'. It felt like she was back at work...sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they went, it grew darker until they saw a light ahead, an opening as if the mouth of a cave. They slowed and trotted together, tongues hanging out panting and trying to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a salty smell to the breeze coming from the light ahead, and shortly they were swaying as the cave entrance and the ground they were on rocked up and back from side to side. The opening now had the look of a doorway, rectangular with height over width. Beyond they could make out shapes. One looked like a big straight tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey immediately raced ahead leaving the two girl dogs, Sasha and Tia (Eric and Liz respectively) alone in the dark hollow. They watched as they slowly walked on. Bailey ran into the light and straight to the tree where he sniffed then raised his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in bloody hell?\" came a scream as Eric and Liz emerged. \"Who let a dog on my ship to pee on the mast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, they saw a tall figure with a peg leg, eye patch and dressed like a pirate. On his shoulder was a parrot flapping its wings. Behind them were two lovely wenches outfitted in what could only be considered provocative dresses from a fifteenth century themed porn pirate movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk. We have stowaways, Cap'n,\" the bird called settling back on the pirates shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey looked up at the two and barked causing the pirate to backpedal. The two women though instantly made a barking sound and walked over to the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suppose?\" Eric murmured in a guttural dog whine looking over at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's definitely Carly, the bird, and Sasha and Tia in human form. Why and how this scene came about, I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was his suggestion, Mistress,\" came three voices at once. Off to their left, three hooded \"pirates\" now stood. \"He thought he should be one if he had a bird on his shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Eric looked at each other and broke up into howls of laughter. Steven was beside himself and not just because of Bailey's actions or the howling dogs which he didn't realize were laughing at him. He wasn't comfortable around the dogs and actually felt a bit scared of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk. Awk. Make 'em walk the plank or toss 'em in the brig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting who they really were, Steven commanded his crew which for now was just the two transformed dogs, \"Tis not funny sneaking aboard. Take those creatures down below and secure them before they leave something else on deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wenches easily lead off Bailey who was jumping at them happy to see his two companions, his sensitive nose recognizing them even if they were human now. Taking Liz and Eric by the collar, they walked back into the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk. All secured, Cap'n.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Breaking free, Eric immediately bolted back in Steven's direction, and when Steven saw the dog barreling towards him his eyes became wide and Carly flapped away on his shoulders. \"Awk, mutiny aboard Cap'n!\" she squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avast ye mangy beast!\" Steven yelled out, pulling out his sword...only to discover the blade was half gone. Steven stared at the broken weapon and frowned, before glancing over to the three hooded 'pirates'. \"Sabotage!\" he cried out in his pirate drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith \"Sasha\" now upon him, Steven discarded his useless blade and began hobbling around, his peg leg thumping on the deck as Eric barked and jumped up at him. Carly somehow managed to keep her grip on Steven's shoulder with her claws, and all the time she squawked in his ear and flapped her wings. After a few seconds, Liz also broke loose as well and joined her husband in pursuing her friend, if only to try and bring him back to 'sanity'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only need to give your command Mistress, and we can return everything to normal\" the three hooded figures addressed Liz, as she scampered around on the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz heard their voices and wondered whether that might actually be the best thing right now. Things were getting a little out of control, thanks to Steven's overactive imagination and his obsession with pirates. But she also knew that there were inumerable others ways to calm things down, including transforming everyone again. After all, she was the one 'calling the shots' so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarking at Eric, Liz quickly caused him to stop chasing Steven, who seemed more than thankful, but he kept a beady eye on his two canine 'assailants'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over to her three new servants with her tail wagging, Liz then gave them another 'command'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first \"Carly\" to enter was wearing a simple light blue dress.  Modest cleavage for Carly but average length on her, just above her knees.  It clung to her body in just the right places to show her immaculate sense of style.  Of course she was wearing heels, one of her favorite pair in fact.  A three inch heel with a zebra print.  They perfectly matched the small clutch in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second \"Carly\" to enter was dressed a little more formally.  She was wearing a rather smart red skirt suit with matching heels.  The lapels of her jacket shone with a gold embroidery.  Both Carlys stopped within a few feet of the door.  They stood there, arms crossed beneath their breasts, a stern look upon their faces, looking straight at Steven, who of course also looked just like Carly, only wearing a pink top and black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the Carly in blue spoke up.  \"So, you think there should only be one of us.\" she said indicating the three Carlys.  \"As you can very plainly see, there are in fact three.\" she continued in a fairly stern voice.  Steven could tell she was trying very hard to keep a straight face, but a smile kept peeking out at the corners of her mouth.  Next the Carly in red started talking to the Carly in blue.  \"Don't be so hard on her.  She does seem to have a point.  After all, Carly was supposed to take Liz out for coffee for her birthday.  Outside of this room, nobody expects more than one Carly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then continue their conversation, practically ignoring Steven.  \"So you're saying that once we go outside again, we're going to need a 'Liz', a 'Carly', and I guess someone else.  At least if all three of us are going together.\" blue Carly stated.  \"Yep. And we have to decide who will be who.  Personally, I think the Carly in the pink top should stay Carly.  What do you think\" responded the Carly in red.  \"Lovely idea, luv.  That just leaves us with which of us will be Liz and who the other of us will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was a little shocked that these two, who he knew to be the real Carly and Liz, would make such a decision without even consulting him.  \"Excuse me.  Don't I have any say in this?\" he asked, still a bit surprised to hear Carly's voice when he spoke.  Both girls looked over at him and said \"NO.\" in unison.  They then looked back at each other, realizing what they did, and erupted in a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later and it was decided that the Carly in blue (the original) would be going out as Liz.  They just couldn't figure out who Liz wanted to go as.  The most obvious choice was to go as Steven, since he was already going as Carly.  But Liz also liked the idea of going out as her husband Eric.  He was at work and not expected to be back before 5 pm.</span></div></div>",

At this point, Steven knew which 'Carly' was Liz. \"So I think maybe...\" Liz then started to say, before she started morphing right before Steven's eyes. The Carly 'duplicate' immediately grew several inches in height, lost her perky breasts, gained 'something else' between her legs, and her stylish blonde hair retracted into her scalp forming a short, brown haircut. The feminine outfit she was wearing also changed into some very familiar, male clothing. The last thing to change was Liz's face, as it changed from Carly's into Steven's, complete with glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Steven exclaimed in Carly's cute voice, as he looked at 'himself'. \"This feels...weird!\" he then stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah, you're telling me\" Liz laughed in his voice, as she grabbed between her legs, feeling the erection forming in her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly immediately threw a question in Liz's direction. \"So um...what's it like having a...penis?\" she asked her, as Steven looked away, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, kind funny actually, but it feels nice\" Liz responded, as she rubbed her 'firm' crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" the original Carly exclaimed in shock, as a smile formed on her pretty face. She stood there, hands on hips, looking Liz up and down. She was now Steven in every conceivable detail. \"So, we're down to two Carlys!\" she then murmured, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just one!\" Liz responded, a devilish grin on Steven's former face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Carly felt herself changing, but not as much as Liz just had. Carly gasped as her breasts began expanding against the fabric of her blue dress, and she couldn't help but reach up and grab them, even as her french-tip manicure receded into her finger ends. Her blonde hair grew in length, turned light brown and shifted itself up into a familiar ponytail, and she her arms and legs became a little more slender. She only gained two inches in height from her transformation, and as she felt her face shifting into a new configuration, Carly held up her left hand and saw Liz's wedding rings appear on her second finger. Carly's sexy outfit was the last to change, morphing into Liz's black tank top, Nike jacket, jeans and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello...'me'!\" Liz chuckled in Steven's voice, as Steven looked on in surprise through Carly's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping her boobs, the new \"Liz\" couldn't help but giggle. \"Don't you ever get tired of carrying these around?\" she joked to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but now you're giving me a break\" Liz smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there teetering in his high heels, Steven didn't know what to say. Liz was certainly mixing things around a little, and from the 'boner' in her jeans...he could tell that she was enjoying herself too. \"So now what?\" he asked in Carly's tone, as he crossed his arms under his perky breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...we go out for coffee, you silly girl\" Liz-as-Steven replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're buying!\" Carly-as-Liz giggled, \"After all, its MY birthday!\" she winked, flashing Steven one of those 'Liz smiles' he adored so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Steven nodded, taking a moment to adjust his bra strap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Evidently she'd rather alarmed him in possessing him. She looked down, taking in her 45 year old body, the rather paunchy body wrapped unfashionably up in a wooly jumper.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The setting of the story is northern England, a town of not much importance. On January 18th 2012, a young man named Steven (age 32) buys a gift for his friend Liz for her 30th birthday. However, neither Steven, Liz or their friend Carly have any idea just what path this otherwise ordinary purchase will send them down. Quite literally Into the unknown....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main protagonists:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, a 32-year old individual, quite slender in appearance, really short brown hair, he is almost 6 ft tall, wears glasses. He is normally someone who likes to be on his own, rather than around others. He has never been in a relationship of any kind, mainly due to his complete lack of self-confidence because of the way he looks. Steven harbors (maybe not so secret) feelings for his friend and co-worker Liz. Steven works part time as a retail store assistant in a hardware store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, 30 years old, and the recipient of the strange gift purchased by Steven for her birthday. Quite petite, standing almost 5' 4\" tall, she has long, light brown hair (mostly worn in a ponytail), most men would deem her 'average looking', though she does have her 'perks', namely her 30H breasts (30G U.S). Liz is married to Eric, to a man 15 years her senior, a fact that is not lost on Steven. <br>\r\nLiz is Steven's supervisor at the hardware store they are both employed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, 29 years old, a petite, 5' 2\" tall 'bubbly' girl with short, stylish blonde hair and C-Cup breasts, she's a self employed beautician and one of Liz's friends. In contrast to Liz, Carly dresses very 'girly', always seen in a dress, or a skirt/top combo and a pair of heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please add chapters if you want to and feel free to add more characters....</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b>There are no rules.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b>I will be correcting spelling mistakes and others errors, but no major re-writing will be done without the particular author's permission.</b></span></td>",
