He did use magic in order to create his children the most important things in his life who said magic couldn\u2019t be used again to fix his problems with his enemies? He could do things like possibly make more children from them, more soldiers for his army as reliable ones were hard to come by,...or even a wife. With the possibilities in mind he knew to target Mario first as he spent two days using magic and natural recipes to make a cursed mushroom to be sent to him via mail making it look like it came from Peach to begin with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Mario went out to check his mail when he noticed a package with the imprint of the Mushroom Kingdom Castle on the side immediately thinking it had to be from Peach excited to see what was inside the plumber quickly pulled it open to discover a black mushroom with red eyes...Mario found it odd but ate it anyways as if Peach made it it would have to be good but instead all he tasted was an extremely burnt mushroom with some gooey sticky liquid inside that he couldn\u2019t get out of his mouth no matter how he struggled little did he know it was making him...</span></div></div>",
