That's really starting to tickle Heeeee! Come on quit it!\" as she giggled and squirmed constantly Dr. Sputnik noticed something else was happening to her the Girl Of Steel was getting bigger he in jaw dropping shock glared up as she grew higher and higher taller than the biggest buildings in the city until she was nearly 100 feet tall with still a slight smile on her face the scientist didn't want to try and tick her off at this size knowing for a fact what would happen so he quickly deactivated his machine setting it for self destruct and quickly fled the scene just as she looked in his direction unfortunately Supergirl didn't notice him leaving at all \"Hmmm\" she thought \"It seems I'm now a 100 foot Girl Of Steel what shall I do now?\" she ponders </span></div></div>",

Wonder Woman needed to end the fight fast because Giganta was causing much damage to the city.<br>\r\n  \"When will you learn Giganta?\" asked Wonder Woman. \"You've fought me numerous times and you've never won.\"<br>\r\n  \"Well I'll just keep trying until I do,\" replied Giganta.<br>\r\n  But then Wonder Woman gave Giganta a thunderous upper cut that knocked the giantess over. But she landed on a building and her head hit one of the sharp parts of the roof. For a moment Wonder Woman thought she had killed the villainess. She saw the former giantess shrink back down to her normal size. <br>\r\n  Wonder Woman flew down to her and picked her up. She noticed blood coming out of Giganta's head. If Wonder Woman was a heartless person she would have left the villainess there to die. But she didn't kill unless she had no choice. <br>\r\n  Wonder Woman then began to fly towards the nearest hospital.

The only time she was allowed to grow was if it was an emergency.<br>\r\n  Thankfully not many people recognised the brilliant doctor. She use to remember how she would take comfort in her work. But with that gone she had nothing to do hardly. She use to have fun destroying buildings and harming people. But those days were over now.<br>\r\n  One day she was allowed a chemistry set and she started to mix around with it. She began to create things that would benefit people instead of harming them. But eventually it was time to see her councilor. She had a woman who was a little on the short side but very beautiful. She had to look up at Giganta she was easily 6'6 without using her powers.<br>\r\n  \"Ok Doris how are you feeling today?\" asked the Councilor.<br>\r\n  \"A little bored,\" replied Giganta. \"I'm not allowed a lot of things here.\"<br>\r\n  \"Well it's a safety procedure.

I'll even find out the times at the local movies.\"<br>\r\n  \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n  A little later Giganta went to the movies to watch Where the Wind Blows. She was a little nervous and she hoped that no one would recognise her when she wasn't at giant size.<br>\r\n  She sat at the back of the theater where no one would be able to see her. She wanted to keep a low profile until her name had been cleared and she was deemed a hero instead of a villain.<br>\r\n  She enjoyed the film and there were parts that made her shed a tear.

Wonder Woman leaned up against the dusty arm of a gargoyle on a rooftop overlooking the Gotham Natural History Museum. They had heard rumors that Intergang was going to try and steal the Rosetta Stone. Batman skulked about in the Shadow's nearby. The two had been arguing about relationships for what seemed like hours. \"No? No dating for the Batman...might cut into your brooding time.\" Batman said nothing. There was a prolonged awkward silence before he finally responded. \"One, dating on the team always leads to disaster. Two, you're a princess from a society of immortal warriors and I'm a rich kid with issues, a lot of issues. And Three, if my enemies knew I had someone special they'd stop at nothing till they got to me through her.\" Wonder Woman had heard enough. She crushed the gargoyle's head with her bare hand. \"Next...\" she seethed coldly. Suddenly they were interrupted by an alarm. A pair of red lights on the museum began to flash violently. The two heroes wasted no time. Wonder Woman drifted down to the alley between the museum and the adjacent building with Batman close behind her. However, when they landed only a slim, darkly dressed woman in a ski mask stood at the side door, crowbar in hand. \"Just a common thief?\" Wonder Woman said with disbelief as she made eye contact with the criminal. \"What happened to Intergang? I guess J'onn got a bad tip\" she went on. \"It happens\" Batman replied, \"I'll take that crowbar\". The thief's eyes quickly flickered with a sort of arcane mischief. She tossed the crowbar at Batman but it suddenly morphed into a vicious viper midair. Batman quickly tossed it aside. \"That trick always went over big in Egypt\" the thief cooed. There was a bright flash of yellow light. The seemingly normal thief was gone, now before them stood a green clad woman with dark hair. A sort of mystical aura emanated from her. \"Circe!\" Wonder Woman cried, \"Be careful she's...\" Batman cut in, \"yeah I know, I've read the Odyssey\". The two heroes lept at her. In the ensuing struggle Circe let loose ray after ray of mystical energy. Wonder Woman deflected them with her bracelets, while Batman simply dodged them. As the two closed in around her, out of nowhere a shockwave sent both back. They tumbled to the ground, weakened by the sorceress's vile magic. \"I promised to leave your mother alone, little princess, but nobody said anything about you. Rest assured, after I get done with you, Hippolyta won't want you for a daughter, and your pointy-eared boyfriend here won't want you for anything.\" A strange green flame erupted from her hands as she began to chant another wicked hex. Before either hero could react the spell shot out of her arms and struck Wonder Woman square in the chest. She flew back and hit the brick wall behind her. Batman threw three batarangs at the witch, but just as they were about to hit their mark she disappeared in a puff of smoke. Batman wheeled around on his heels, \"Diana are you...\" he paused. His jaw dropped. Before him was Wonder Woman, slumped over unconscious but her body was expanding. Her legs stretched out, her torso grew up into the sky. Her mottled shadow quickly spread out over Batman. </span></div></div>",

Below her, tiny civilians gathered around to catch a glimpse of the titanic amazon. She slowly rocked up onto her feet, causing the ground to shake violently. The crowd began to panic and quickly dissipated as Wonder Woman's massive shadow fell over them. She dusted off her legs and surveyed her surroundings. Gotham's buildings looked like little cardboard boxes now. The cars were like toys, and the little people running around her more like bugs. She took a few steps, passing a few blocks. She then knelt down over another nearby building and caught site of the iceberg lounge. Minuscule patrons were exiting into the foggy streets below her.

It was clear it wasn't a good idea to linger in the city any further. \"Diana, are you there? Can you hear me?\" J'onn's voice said as Wonder Woman's earpiece crackled to life. \"Yeah I'm fine...\" she boomed back. \"I need to get out of Gotham, people are panicking, and I'm too big, have you found Circe?\" There was some static but the Martian's voice finally returned. \"Not yet shhhhhh I-shhhh don't go sshhhhh\" before it finally cut out. Wonder Woman rolled her eyes and took to the sky. She flew over the city skyline to a clear spot just outside of town near an old suburb. Some unsuspecting pedestrians caught a glimpse of the massive heroine as she soared overhead. When she touched down, the quiet neighborhood lit up. Slowly, dozens of curious onlookers filed out of their homes to discover the source of all the tremors. They stared up in awe as the towering beauty knelt down to address them. \"Its ok everyone, I'm not gonna hurt you, return to your homes, I will just be here a little while longer.\" Her voice echoed out, causing many to clap their hands over their eyes to shield themselves from her pounding voice. The giantess sighed and took a seat. As she leaned back she felt something fragile crumble underneath her hand. </span></div></div>",

Aside from a few crater-like footprints and a rather large depression left after she sat down, the little suburb looked relatively peaceful. That is until she caught site of the smoke. A large, billowing cloud of black fumes had started up nearby. Turning around, she saw a house ablaze with bright yellow flames. Around it were piles of debris and smoldering rubble no doubt caused by her destructive movements. Startled, and feeling a bit guilty, Wonder Woman quickly knelt down to see if she could help. With one hand she tore the building's roof off. After tossing it aside she leaned in closer to the fire to see if she could spot anyone trapped inside. Though the smoke wafted up into her face she simply waved it away with one of her gigantic hands. Sure enough, huddled in the center of the burning house was a young man no older than 20. Seeing that he was trapped she quickly reached two of her fingers down and gently pinched them around his body. The adolescent looked up in horror as the giantess lifted him up into the air. His body shook with coughing fits and fearful tremors. Wonder Woman set the boy down in the center of her palm before leveling it with her face. \"Are you all right little one? Is anyone else in there?\" At first he didn't respond, but after some time he managed to muster up the will the speak, \"no, I, they all fled, I was too afraid to come out, then the building caught fire...I...you saved me...I could've died!\" he cried out weakly. Wonder Woman gave him a sly smile. \"Its ok, you're safe now...\"</span></div></div>",

The beams did not stray either, they remained fixed on her for a while. It would seem someone wanted to get her attention. Diana was a little annoyed by the sudden interruption but felt compelled to see what was going on. She began to drift back down toward the ground. The citizens in the streets below panicked and fled in all directions like swarms of ants. Her descent was tricky as she was careful not to crush any fleeing civilians or topple any of the now comparatively tiny buildings. When she finally touched down, flattening a few abandoned cars beneath her boots, she saw that skyscraper was none other than Wayne Tower. Two men, both in black suits waited on top of the roof with several large spotlights. Wonder Woman looked down at them, for the tower only came up to her stomach. <br>\r\n\"What is this?\" she boomed.<br>\r\nOne of the figures brought a megaphone up to his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Mistress Diana?, Master Wayne has contacted me to try and get a hold of you.\" the tiny figure replied in a staunch British accent. <br>\r\nWith all the commotion overhead.

Each step she took she could feel the microscopic limbs of the young man grabbing and pushing against her skin. Her face began to twist into an expression of utter disgust. Finally she stopped dead in her tracks and looked down at her stomach. By this point he had climbed the length of one of Wonder Woman's hands  above her navel. With one hand she rand her fingers over her abdomen, feeling around for the tiny figure. When her fingers brushed over the tiny human she paused. Her index finger pressed against the young man's back, pinning him to her skin. <br>\r\n\"That's quite enough little one, that scrambling is driving me crazy.\"<br>\r\nWith that Wonder Woman raised her otehr hand and...</span></div></div>",

Along the course rocky slope leading up to the mountain-top facility, jacked stones served as vantage points from which Wonder Woman could glimpse her target. Not six hours earlier Steve Trevor had disappeared in that building whilst investigating for IADC. For weeks they had been monitoring it, mostly because it was the supposed hide-out of long time criminal Dr. Stephen Ingstrom, a brilliant but trouble scientist who had been experimenting with alternative nuclear energy. Just last year he claimed to that he had perfected the blueprints to a new nuclear weapon, that would harness pure radioactive energy which could be focused almost like a laser. The tests were uncertain, and many other scientists claimed it was preposterous. The politicians meanwhile demanded that the plans be destroyed, fearing such weapons would be too devastating and unconventional. The poor doctor went mad and fled the night the US Government ordered his arrest. Now, they had found him. Any second now he was going to release his weapon upon the world, no doubt focused on those who opposed him. Wonder Woman's mission was clear, she would disable the weapon, save agent Trevor, and apprehend Dr. Ingstrom at any cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside the facility...<br>\r\nDr. Ingstrom was a frail man, with thin layers of greasy hair covering his misshapen head. As he paced about his body shook with anticipation and anger. Not far from where he stood, Agent Trevor sat strapped into a chair, his face bloodied from the beatings delivered by Ingstrom's goons. \"Now Mr. Trevor, you and the rest of the world will see the value of my work!\" cackled the doctor. Steve shook and tugged at bindings restraining him. \"You'll never get away with this Ingstrom, mark my words...\" The doctor simply laughed. \"Ahh my good man, but I already have...\" He flipped a few switches, pulled a dozen levers and a suddenly a large chrome machine whirred to life. Like a telescope its muzzle was pointed out at angle, prepped to release a beam of highly concentrated energy. It began to glow yellow, heralding doom for whoever was unfortunate enough to be in its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Wonder Woman saw the beam charging up from the roof. Knowing that she was too late she quickly flew up to the facilities roof and jumped in front of the beam hoping to prevent any damage it may do to innocent people (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wonderland-site.com/pix/photos/wonder/ww0896.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wonderland-site.com/pix/photo...</a>). The energy coursed through her veins and outward into her extreminities. As more radiation pumped into her body she felt her power grow. The strength inside of her began to increase exponentially. It was then she realized it wasn't just her strength but her size too. After a matter of minutes she stood hundreds of feet tall with the facility at her feet like a small shoe box.</span></div></div>",

It was as if everything leading up to this moment was winding up a series of chords in her brain and then all of sudden they just snapped. Looking down at her now massive form she suddenly grew angry. She forgot her earlier mission and lifted up her enormous red boot and held it aloft over the facility below. Then, after a brief moment of complete silence, she brought it down on the roof. A defeaning crash and cloud of dust were sent out as her heel easily crushed everything below it. She brought her foot down again, and again, and again, until nothing but a smoldering pile of rubble remained. Yet, even with the building destroyed she still felt angry. She turned her attention to a small neighborhood in the distance in the shadow of a few lone mountains. With a few lumbering steps she stepped off the small plateau and began heading towards the cluster of houses. In a few massive strides she stood over the tiny suburb, her long shadow casting out over the tiny citizen below causing them to whip up into a panic. Tiny cars whizzed about, whilst little people scurried into their homes. Wonder Woman looked down at them all (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wonderland-site.com/pix/photos/wonder/ww0712.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wonderland-site.com/pix/photo...</a>). She lifted her right foot and brought it down on top of the nearest home, flattening it immediately. Tiny screams echoed out from all over. She knelt down. Her hulking form caused the earth to shake violently, causing the ground to crack underneath her. A little red car pulled out of a nearby drive way and tried to speed away. Wonder Woman reached down picked it up with two fingers. The horn blared as she brought it up closer to her face. She could hardly see the tiny people inside, shaking about in terror. She tossed it aside and began to look about further. </span></div></div>",

She lowered her right hand to stabilize herself, smashing two homes in the process. With her left hand she reached out plucked the bus off the street with two fingers, lifting it up into the air like it was nothing at all. Again she brought closer to her face for a better look. Dozens of horrified scream echoed out from the bus's interior. Wonder Woman's eye caught sight of the helpless victims inside. <br>\r\n\"Awww how cute...\" she thundered, causing the bus's unfortunate inhabitants to scream even louder. \"All you little children in there! What ever shall I do with you?\"<br>\r\nWonder Woman thought for a moment, all the while observing the tiny yellow vehicle held between her fingers. She gave it a little shake, causing her hapless victims to whip up into an even greater frenzy. Their cries will pure terror. Whatever she decided would be their fate. After a while she came up with an idea. <br>\r\n\"Well I'm awfully hungry, being this big seems really work up an appetite. So here's what I'll do\" <br>\r\nWonder Woman clenched the other end of the bus with her other hands snapped it in two. Then, she gingerly lifted one half up over her head until it was just above her mouth. She shook gently, allowing all the terrified children to tumble down into her mouth where she swallowed them whole. Once satisfied she tossed the fragment aside and looked down at her remaining victims. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, that wasn't very much, I could hardly taste you tiny little morsels. Hmph, well I'm sure I can find a better use for you later.\" At that she moved second half of the bus toward her chest. She slipped it in between her gargantuan breasts and said: \"Now I'll keep the rest of you down there, careful, would want you to get lost now.\" she concluded with a slight laugh. Satisfied with her conquest she stood back up to her titanic height and looked around once more. <br>\r\n\"I can do better than just a little neighborhood, where's that- Ah there we go!\" she said cheerfully as she spotted the city on the horizon. With a few careless steps she advanced toward the sprawling metropolis, flattening cars, houses, and people along the way. Only a path of utter carnage and destruction were left in her wake as she moved onward. From a distance the citizen of city grew panicked when the saw the massive woman coming toward them. Their doom was at hand. </span></div></div>",

It soon grew to monsterous proportions and it began to grab the Joes' jets from the sky.<br>\r\n  \"What the hell is that?\" asked Scarlett.<br>\r\n  \"Seems to be the new Cobra weapon,\" replied Duke.<br>\r\n  As the Jets were being pulled to the ground some of the Joe's were able to get out and parachute down. A few were still in their jets and couldn't get out. They were at the mercy of the vine.<br>\r\n  When on the ground most of the Joes were captured by the plant and only Scarlett was left. She thought that Destro was somehow controlling them and she began to run towards him.<br>\r\n  He didn't notice her until she kicked him and he went flying. But he accidentally dropped the growth formula and it went onto Scarlett's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she grow?</span></div></div>",

But there wasn't much she could do. She needed a weapon. But then she saw something that got her thinking. She could see Snake Eye's jet and the thrusts were facing the plant itself.<br>\r\n  \"Snake Eyes put your thrusts on,\" said Scarlett. \"It's our only chance.\"<br>\r\n  Snake Eyes then put the thrusts on and the plant set on fire.

She didn't notice her body go through any changes.<br>\r\n  The next morning she was woken up by her alarm clock. She switched it off and she sat up on her bed. She didn't notice anything wrong even though her clothes were now tight. She was too tired to notice.<br>\r\n  But then she stood up and went to the bathroom. But when she tried to go through the door her head hit the door frame. She gave out a little ouch.<br>\r\n  \"Who lowered this door frame?\" asked Scarleet.

But she tired to put it into the back of her mind.<br>\r\n  \u201cWow you\u2019re very tall,\u201d said a little Girl.<br>\r\n  \u201cI know I am,\u201d replied the American Dream. \u201cI normally am tall but no where near this tall.\u201d She smiled a little.<br>\r\n  \u201cYou must drink a lot of milk.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cI sure do. And if you want to grow up big and strong you really should do the same.

In Midtown High School we go to room 154. This is where the students would go to get bored out of their skulls with Math. That's right Math. The mot boring subject in the World. Plus today they had the most boring teacher on the planet teaching this class. This teacher is Dr Evans. But the main two students we'll focus on is 15 year old Peter Parker aka Spider-man. And his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson.<br>\r\n  \"Ok Class,\" said Dr Evans. \"Can anyone tell me what the squared root of 25 times 100 plus 1 is?\"<br>\r\n  \"Psst,\" whispered Mary Jane to Peter. \"This is like so boring.\"<br>\r\n  \"Is there something you would like to share with the class?\" asked Dr Evans.<br>\r\n  \"No Dr Evans.\"<br>\r\n  \"Good now pay attention this will be on the test.\"<br>\r\n  \"How much longer is there?\" whispered Peter.<br>\r\n  \"45 minutes.\"<br>\r\n  \"What we still have ages left.\" But secretly he was gonna take Mary Jane out for a surprise date.<br>\r\n  Eventually what felt like an eternity the Math class ended. It was time for the students to go home. But not for our young heroes. Peter took Mary Jane to the roof of a building near a Technology lab. He had bought her up there to watch the sunset.<br>\r\n  \"Isn't this romantic?\" asked Mary Jane.<br>\r\n  \"Yeah that's why I bought you up here,\" replied Peter.<br>\r\n  Then there was a sound of an alarm from the lab.<br>\r\n  \"You should go.\"<br>\r\n  Peter started to get his Spider-Man costume on. In a few seconds he was nearly fully costumed. All he had to do was put on his mask. Just before he did he kissed Mary Jane.<br>\r\n  \"Stay here,\" said Peter.<br>\r\n  He then web slinged to the lab. There just leaving was a pair of masked thieves. They were carrying expensive equipment including an experimental matter expander ray.<br>\r\n  \"Hey it's the guys who's gonna get their butt kicked by your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man,\" said Spidetr-Man.<br>\r\n  \"Oh no it's web head,\" said one of the thugs. \"Let's get outta here.\"<br>\r\n  The two thugs run off in seperate directions. One of them goes towards the city. But the other one with the matter expander ray ran in the direction of Mary Jane. Spider-Man chased the one which was heading to the city.<br>\r\n  Meanwhile Mary Jane had gotten herself off the roof and back down on the ground. Then suddenly she saw the thug.<br>\r\n  \"Hey what are you doing?\" she asked.<br>\r\n  The thug was completely taken by surprise. He dropped the matter expander and ran away. But then suddenly the matter expander started to turn on. Then suddenly a green ray hit Mary Jane and she falls to the ground. </span></div></div>",

Spider-Man was very angry.<br>\r\n  \"What the hell do you think you're doing MJ!\" shouted Spider-Man.<br>\r\n  \"Killing you,\" replied Mary Jane.<br>\r\n  \"What?\"<br>\r\n  MJ goes to punch Spider-Man but he dodges with his spider sense. He punched her back but she was unmoved. She accidentally punched the wall and it caused a huge crack. After three minutes Mary Jane shrank back to almost normal size. Yet again she was an inch taller than she was before her latest growth. She fell to the ground.<br>\r\n  \"I'm sorry Peter,\" said Mary Jane. \"I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n  \"Come on lets get to the lab.\" He picks up Mary Jane and continues his journey to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill they get an answer there? </span></div></div>",

She recognised him as Dr Sivana. \"Sivana I knew you would show your dirty face sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n  \"You guessed right,\" replied Sivana through the Robot. \"Now you have reached the final chapter in your life Mary Marvel.\"<br>\r\n  Then Mary Marvel notices a shop next to her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat type of shop was it?</span></div></div>",

The others were in position on Earth but he didn't think it would be trouble until he looked out the window and saw that it was Mary coming for him! He cocked his head to the side and looked closer, something was different. He gasped and bent closer to the window, sweet Mars was she different, She had had her hair straightened, she wore makeup, she wore an ultra tight T-shirt that contained her unbelievably perky, unrestrained, breasts that had no doubt been expanded out of proportion, long white heeled boots that came up to her knee, a pair of ultra-mini and tight jean shorts that he was sure to be illegally short, by the time he had taken all of her enhancements in she had already covered most of the distance and he started to panic, he could sense that they had strengthened the signal of her mind control to a point that she would have no concious desire to resist and to top it all off they had implanted a high sexual lust. He swallowed and stepped back from the figure closing the distance between herself and the ship, this could get messy.</span></div></div>",

She bent down to Marvin who was proccupied with trying not to make contact with her crotch and stopped just in time to look up and see the tip of her right breast send him shooting out the other side. he slammed into the wreckage of his ship and lay calm. he would have to find another way. Mary was just too powerful. He peeked out and started panicing. Mary was pulling the top of her shirt forwards. there was noway he could urvive if she did that! He gazed at her breasts through the shirt. It was too tight already! He flew out and immediately Mary's shirt (now looking like a second skin.) snapped back and Mary smiled. He knew at once that this was not a smile that said Im saved, this was the kind of suggestive smile something that knows it has you trapped puts on. He started to back away but then Mary squeezed her chest together, stretched out her long legs and made the most disarmingly beautiful smile ever created. She couldn't be all bad, right? he started to slowly drift towards her when suddenly she started to suck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, imagine this.

He was too bruised to do anything and fell out, sliding off her lower lip and falling off her chin, he bounced off her breast like a trampoline and then dropped like a stone, wincing when he passed her jean shorts, the bruise her crotch had left still hurt. he slammed into the ground and fell unconcious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke with a start in a huge room with a platform at the other end of the room, upon it standing a dark figure with a following of ten or twelve people, 7 girls and 5 men. <br>\r\n\"Ah, so the martian is finally awake.

It gave Jeff a nosebleed. Ah the funniest part was when you got whacked though, we didn't plan that but my god did it work to perfection! Sorry, I advise that you don't try to escape however, even if you somehow find the strength to phase outside, We gave Mary an unmatched sexual desire that would make what you felt before seem shy, she is prowling around outaide, sort of reminds me of a starving cat looking for a mouse.\" On cue the assembled henchmen and womenbehind him burst into laughter.

He dove to the ground and shifted so he had a clear view of the dust cloud from the safety of the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long he heard a weird kind of purr and a single monstrous hand cleared the crowd, it was gigantic. It slid forward a bit and he could see an ultra tightly covered wrist come into view. He could see the material was bright red and fit like a second skin. Without warning Mary sprung forward into the middle of the warehouse. On all fours she was one of the most intimidating beings he had ever seen, his captors had no doubt purposefully made her clothes too small and he could see clearly the strain her new breasts were having on the spandex jumpsuit acting like a second skin, he frowned, he supposed it kind of counted as clothing, I  mean she was covered but the spandex left little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted as she found nothing but hatched a mischevous grin and rose to her full height. She grabbed the zipper and again looking around, started to pull down. The martian let his mouth hang wide open, was she serious!? The following seconds answered his question as she spewed a stream of unnecessary moans. He bent his head down and tried not to look, but the new Mary was too much to pass up and he let himself stare on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mary stopped and stared at what she had been hoping for, a small bit of drool had escaped the crates and leaving the zipper in the lower half of her cleavage, she once again bent down on all fours and making huge motions with her shoulders, steadily made her way to the pile. She first used the tip of her finger to knock away the top one. The Martian wondered at the noise and poked his head out the front only to bump into the mountainside of her left breast as it hovered menacingly over the pile, threatening to smash every crate in the pile. The martian finally realized what was happening when Mary shoved half the stack into the valley of her cleavage and tumble past the zipper to come to an abrupt stop as a bulge in the base of her crotch before she ground her crotch into the floor and came up without a bump to be seen, realizing where the boxes had been sent he dove into the back of the pile.

The thin layer of spandex that held them was stretched to dangerously near bursting!  Starting at her sternum, Mary drew an imaginary line through her cleavage down her torso, eventually catching the straining zipper.

Supes was to busy rushing off to save an old lady in a car to notice that he took my last sane family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quit my job a star labs and took over lex corps because then my crazy brother Limor wanted to take over the company.

He and I were about to reconcile when the big blue lug comes in and try's to take the gun from my brother who panicked and shot himself rather than go to jail.  I lost half of my family to that red, yellow, and blue b%%%%%%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why mary, no one should have to endure what I endured.  And what if he goes rouge, how do you stop him?

While Beast Boy and Cybork stood on the surface made by her stretched mini-skirt, talking with Starfire about who could've fired the laser that still sat in the middle of the warehouse floor. Raven and Robin tried to find out more about the laser itself. <br>\r\n\"Hey Raven, I've found out how to turn on it's targeting computer!\" Robin called out to Raven. Raven came over to Robin and crouched down behind him, \"I hope this isn't too much like reading over your shoulder.\" Robin turned around and looked up, right at the bottom of her costume that her legs on either side potruded from, \"not at all.\" <br>\r\n\"So what's the password?\" Raven asked Robin.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Robin peered at the small screen and the 5 spaces that indicated where you entered the letters. \"Maybe it's...\" Robin typed in the letters slowly, S-L-A-D-E, and the laser exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was the first to awake, he was on starfire's chest, his back propped up against her left breast.

Robin shook Beast boy lightly \"wake up\" Robin whispered. Beast Boy just rolled a little bit which sent him off Raven's thigh, onto Starfire's mini-skirt and slid off that and under the front part of the skirt. Robin leaped down, if Starfire woke up right now, he would hhave a tough time explaining why he and Beast Boy were there. Robin jumped into Starfire's skirt and crept towards Beast BOy, who was snoozing about a foot away from the wall of fabric that was Starfire's panties. Robin jumped over Beast boy, his back against the panties and scooped up Beast Boy and Leaped out. He then set Beast Boy down in the small space between Raven's butt and Starfire's Breasts where he had woken up. He jumped back up on Starfire's breast andmade his way up onto her face, he slipped at one point and fell into her mouth, but he clung to a tooth and pulled himself up. he then dragged Cyborg down from her face and through her cleavage to the place where he had Beast Boy. Robin then made his way off Starfire and walked to where Raven's face hung. Robin was surprised when Ravens eyes were already wide open, <br>\r\n\"hey Robin. I would've moved but I didn't want to squish you Cyborg or Beast boy.\" Robin nodded and told Raven to roll to her left and down Starfire and away from the others. Raven did so and was soon lying beside Starfire, on her back, conversing with Beast Boy and Cyborg. Robin sighed, this would be the tough part. he climbed back up Starfire's face and rested below her mouth, he beacame scared when he lost his footing and slid towards her mouth when she inhaled, he had to be more careful, but when he stood up to wake up Starfire, she inhaled deeply and Robin was suckeddown until his head rested on her lower lip and his arms struggled to pull himself up. he placed his legs on a front tooth and used it to propel himself towards her face, he sat on her chin and made his way to her left ear and yelled, \"Starfire!\" Robin looked back and saw her eyes open  and he leaped back to the safe place below her breasts. Starfire leaned her head forwardand piced uup Beast boy, Cyborg andRobin in one hand and deposited them on Raven's smaller lap. </span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sick of everyone thinking I\u2019m so weak!\u201d Jubilee said aloud.<br>\r\nShe thought for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, no wonder I get left behind, all I can do is shoot fireworks, how useless is that?\u201d She continued, shooting a few sparks off to vent her frustration \u201dIf only my powers weren\u2019t so weak\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJubilee read through a newspaper that had been left in the room. It seemed dull to  her until she found one article of interest to her. It seemed a team of scientists were doing some sort of  research into mutants, and had apparently found a way to enhance a mutant\u2019s powers and were looking for volunteers to test the procedure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJubilee\u2019s heart leapt for joy as she read this and she jotted the details of the lab down. \u201cOh boy! Finally I won\u2019t be left out all the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuck out of the mansion and raced down to the lab. Surprisingly she was the first volunteer they had (maybe this was because the article had warned that there was a big risk and they weren\u2019t sure if it was safe, but Jubilee skimmed over that part, reading the article in haste). Jubilee hurriedly filled in the forms she was given, without really bothering to read them, then walked over to the machine they were to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Miss before we begin I should warn you that this hasn\u2019t been fully tested and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJubilee cut him off with a casual wave of her hand, \u201cYeah, yeah, lets just get this done\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJubilee went into  a large booth, and had some wires attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d One of the scientists asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just hurry up already!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was started, and took a few minutes to get going, but eventually whirled to life, and rattled loudly. Jubilee felt a strong current of energy flow through her, it was a little painful, but felt energizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the scientists looked down at a counter on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh is that supposed to happen?\u201d A scientist said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was in pain, not enough to yell, but noticeable. Not only that  but She  grew faster, and her head bursts through the roof. She wipes, the debris off her head and sits down. Jubilee trys to pull the wires off, but even with her increased strength they don\u2019t seem to budge. Somehow the wires have attached themselves to Jubilee in a unbreakable grip! Ever times she trys, she gets a sting and is forced to withdraw her hand. <br>\r\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d Jubilee yelled, waving her arms in panic.

The Danger Room readings were showing how tall she was becoming. At first it read at 100 feet tall but Kitty was still growing. Professor X was amazed to see her growing at such a fast race. he reached 600 feet in seconds but her body refused to stop growing. The next readying was 1,500 feet. By now Professor X was getting a little worried. All though the Danger Room had been greatly expanded there was still a limit on how big she could become in it.<br>\r\n  Another few seconds past and she past a mile easily. The Professor expected her to stop but she didn't she kept getting bigger. her height reached ten miles but then he head hit the ceiling. She was becoming more cramped. In another minute she had completely filled the space. She was at 30 miles tall but she felt she could still get bigger. But her body didn't have anymore room so she shrank down to a little over 6 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She hugged her Dragon soft toy on her bed. It seemed a little smaller than she remembered but this just made her smile.<br>\r\n  She was enjoying her new powers almost too much.

She even walked past an ant that was the size of Godzilla compared to her.<br>\r\n  After half an hour of being tiny she then grew until she was the size of a skyscraper. Now there wasn't much room in the mansion grounds so she left it a little and went not too far away.<br>\r\n  She saw how everything seemed so small now. The cars looked like tiny ones kids would have as toys. She found this funny and she also saw many people staring at her. She blushed a little and just gave them a little pose.<br>\r\n  When she had had her fun she shrank down to just over 6 feet and went back to the mansion. But when she got there Professor X was there and he wasn't too happy. They talked in his office.<br>\r\n  \"Kitty do you realise what you just did?\" asked professor X.<br>\r\n  \"I was only having a little fun,\" replied Kitty.<br>\r\n  \"Maybe but someone could have gotten hurt.

She was doing things that took them a while to learn. She was outgrowing Giant-Man and out shrinking Wasp.

Kitty was able to pick up both Amazons and throw them to one side. But she began to feel something. Her body was getting heavier and she fell to the ground. It happened to the others as well.<br>\r\n  \"What gives?\" asked Kitty.<br>\r\n  \"Oh yeah one more rule,\" replied the Announcer. \"The gravity randomly changes.\"<br>\r\n  \"Great I can't move.\"<br>\r\n  Rogue could still stand up with her new found strength. But she couldn't beat both of the Amazons by herself. She needed to use Kitty's powers again. But in a different way.<br>\r\n  \"Kitty shrink until your the size of a doll,\" said Rogue.<br>\r\n  \"What why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill her plan work?</span></div></div>",

They were beaten and Kitty shrunk to normal.<br>\r\n  The gravity went back to normal and she was able to stand up. She looked up at Rogue. This was one of the few times that it would happen.

Some days she would make herself shorter then usual and sometimes she would amke herself taller. This annoyed some of her tema mates but they didn't mind that much.<br>\r\n  But in New York City a girl was just going into a lab. She had been arrested and charged for multiple drug offences. But she was given the option to spend a long time behind bars or become a human test subject.<br>\r\n  Inside the lab it was the type that anyone would expect to see in a science fiction movie. There were several professors around a machine that she was going to be tested on.

She was still 7'5 and she was still naked.<br>\r\n  \"Stop looking,\" said Kitty.<br>\r\n  \"I can't help it it's so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n  Then Kitty punched Bobby. \"Now get lost.\" She runs back to her room. She goes into her wardrobe and puts on some new clothes. Well since she's only been 7'5 for t a few days she didn't have that many clothes her size. And it was impossible to shop for her. it was times like these she hated her new powers. But when it came to doing things with Bobby she loved them. What she didn't realise is that soon she really needed her powers to save the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is this threat?</span></div></div>",

Piotr saw this so they decided to take a break. They went to the food court. Piotr bought the food. But now Kitty was eating enough to feed a small family.

They had been ordered to capture a certain individual. They moved closer and closer to Kitty who was asleep in her throne. First they made rude jesters at her. Then they see their target in her hand. it was Duane.<br>\r\n  They climbed the throne making sure not to wake the sleeping giantess. They went to her hand. Then they gassed Duane so he wouldn't wake up. They carefully opened Kitty's hand. It took all of them to do it but they did it. They grabbed onto Duane and started to take him away. One left a note for her.<br>\r\n  The next morning Kitty woke up. Something felt odd. She looked at her hands and Duane was gone. At first she thought it was nothing serious.<br>\r\n  \"He's probably just getting an early breakfast,\" thought Kitty. Then she saw something. \"What's this?\" She sees that it's a letter. She picks it up and reads the small writing. Her eye sight had increased with her size. <br>\r\n  It said \"We have your friend. Surrender the planet or else he will be killed. You have 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n  Kitty then started to fill up with rage. She stood up from her throne.<br>\r\n  \"Everyone come here now!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n  Then all the Ewoks came over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

The planet held a huge celebration for her and she was thankful to everyone.<br>\r\n  She had started to do less for the Ewoks. She didn't do this to be mean but to see if the Ewoks could cope by themselves. If she went away for any reason she wanted to know that the Ewoks could do things for themselves.<br>\r\n  The Ewoks respected her judgment and they were able to cope without her help. She still enforced the laws that she had made and she even created the planet's first police squad.<br>\r\n  But a new twist was that leaders from other planets had come to do some trading work. The planet had many materials that other planets wanted and they were able to give Endor many things that they needed.<br>\r\n  The Ewoks' standard of life had risen higher than anyone could have imagined. And they were all thankful to their Goddess Kitty for all her hard work that she had done.<br>\r\n  Amongst the traded items were silk. This made some new clothes for her and the Ewoks.

Too many wars and too many have died. It must stop right here right now.\" Some of them cheered. \"We would also like to introduce the latest member of the United Planets. The Planet of Endor and their leader Kitty Pryde.

He was surprised to find the controls were in English.<br>\r\n  \"The Sycorax translating device must also translate writing as well as speech,\" said Duane. \"If this thing can shrink people it should make them big too.\" he fumbles with the controls. He finds a tiny life sign. \"That must be her.\" Then he pressed another button and a cctv camera caught Kitty. Duane saw that she was smaller than an atom and to his horror she was still shrinking. \"Ok let's put your college knowledge to good use.\" He pushes more buttons and a blue ray hits Kitty.

But she was growing. Like the process in reverse She grew from 1/8 of an inch to an inch. Then she was 3 inches then a foot. Then she was 2 feet then 4 foot. She stopped growing at her old height of 5'4. Although she wasn't gigantic anymore she was still happy to be normal.<br>\r\n  \"You saved me,\" said Kitty.<br>\r\n  \"That's one for me and about 50 for you but who's counting?\"<br>\r\n  \"Give me a kiss.\" This was now unusual for her. For the three months she had known him she looked down at him now she had to look up but she didn't care. She jumped at him and kissed him. Then they heard banging on the doors.<br>\r\n  \"Oh crap the Sycorax are back,\" said Duane. Then Lockhead flew off his shoulder.<br>\r\n  \"What are you doing?\" asked Kitty. Lockhead just flew to the door and several Sycorax came through. He used his fire to temporarily drove them back behind the door. Duane and Kitty quickly closed the door and locked it. But just before they did Lockhead was hit by a ray from a Sycorax laser gun. Although he didn't die he was still badly injured. \"Lockhead no!\" Kitty got to her knees and tried to comfort Lockhead. In her mind there was only one thing she could do. \"Duane make me a giant again.\"<br>\r\n  \"What?\"<br>\r\n  \"Make big again so I can fight these guys.\"<br>\r\n  \"But the ray said if you become gigantic one more time you won't be able to become normal again.\"<br>\r\n  \"I don't care.Make me big it's the only chance we have.\"<br>\r\n  \"Ok grab Lockhead and come to the ray. That door won't hold them for too long.\"  Kitty picked up the injured Lockhead and went to the ray. When she got there Duane took Lockhead off her and he put him in a safe place. Then he went to the machine. \"Are you sure you wanna do this?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes just get on with it before they come through.\"<br>\r\n  \"Ok here goes nothing.\" Duane activates the machine and the same blue ray hits Kitty. She begins to grow. her slave clothes also grew with her. She was 10 foot then 17 then 26 the 38 then she was back to full size. \"Right you're back at exactly 59'11 15/16th tall.\"<br>\r\n  \"Great and not a second too soon.\"<br>\r\n  Then the Sycorax burst through the door and Kitty prepared herself for another fight against the Sycorax.</span></div></div>",

But now they would face a problem of gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n  We start our tale in the lab of Mister Fantastic the leader of the fantastic four. He had recovered some sort of meteorite from Senegal (In Africa). He was studying it and found out there it emitted some strange form of radiation. At one point during his research it blasted out a bolt of energy but fortunately it didn't hit anything. After a while Sue Richards his wife came into the lab to bring him a sandwich. Reed had been working for 8 hours straight.<br>\r\n  \"Are you alright Reed?\" asked Sue.<br>\r\n  \"I'm fine but I just can't figure out what this energy this meteorite,\" replied Reed. \"For all I know it might just be pink lighting.\"<br>\r\n  \"Is it dangerous?\" <br>\r\n  \"As far as I know no.\"<br>\r\n  \"Have something to eat you must be starving.\" Then she notices that the meteorite was starting to glow. \"Reed what's it doing?\"<br>\r\n  Reed had only just realised what was happening. \"You better get back honey.\"<br>\r\n  Then the meteorite started to fire beams of energy in random directions. One went towards Sue.<br>\r\n  \"Sue move out of the way!\"<br>\r\n  \"I'm alright I've put up an invisible force field.\" <br>\r\n  Then the beam hits her. She immediately falls to the ground.<br>\r\n  \"SUE!

In fact I feel better than fine. I'll just see if I can do something about your lunch (Since it had fallen on the floor).\" She tries to use an invisible force field but for some reason she could create one. \"Reed I can't use my powers.\"<br>\r\n  \"Turn invisible.\"<br>\r\n  She tries to turn invisible but she couldn't.<br>\r\n  \"Reed I can't what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n  \"The meteorite must have taken away your powers.\"<br>\r\n  \"If that's true then I'm now as good as useless to the team.\"<br>\r\n  \"No you're not still a valuable member of the team.\" Then Reed notices something. \"Since when have you been that tall?\"<br>\r\n  \"I'm not taller.\" replied Sue. Then she grows to a height of 30 feet (Just inches from the ceiling). \"Reed what's happening to me?\" Then she shrinks to 10 foot. Then she grows again to over 60 feet. Now she had to sit down so she wouldn't go through the ceiling. <br>\r\n  \"That meteorite must have taken away you and given you new ones.

When SUe grew to 150 ft Reed entertained himself by playing a kind of football with Sue, the game was on her torso, Reeds goal was Sue's cleavage, Sue played by blowing on the \"field\" Reed made one goal thendid a victory dance on the spot. While Sue then played defense by blowing on Reed. Sue once blew so hard that Reed was sent flying downfield and only stopped when he rolled down the front of Sue's bikini bottom and fell down into Sue's crotch. That provided a few laughs  for the both of them. The only dangerous part was when Reed was practicing and Sue had fallen asleep. Reed had scored another goal and ran back to start from a depression he had made in the bikini bottom when Sue turned over in her sleep and Reed was caught by her bikinibottom front to the sand below. He finally managed to escape by using his powers to escape to her crotch, he thenran up Sue's body and pulled back the strap for her bikini top as hard as he could and snapped it back to get Sue's attention. What he hadn't counted on was Sue thinking he was a bug and slapping her haand down onhim. Reed was not really hurt and clung to the hand when Sue turned back over. When Sue sat up and put her hand to her face to yawn Reed flew off when Sue inhaled, the good thing is that this jerked Sue awake andshe blew him out. The bad thing was that Reed had to hold on and try not to be swallowed and then when Sue blew he was sent flying out into the atlantic. Sue immediately realized where he had gone and waded out into the deep, looking for Reed. She thought it was bad that the water was up to her neck and thought that might hinder her, and so she grew until the water was level with her bikini bottom strap. unfourtunately Reed was not aware of her growth as he approached her and expected to hold on to herbikini top strap and pull him self up, but because of Sue's growth he instead held onto a very wet bikini bottom strap and was jerked around by the movement of her legs. Reed weighed his chances between hanging on for his life on her strap or facing Sue's anger and climbing into the bikini bottom it self. Reed was jerked just hard enough then to decide, he slowly slid him self up to his neck and waited until Sue made her way back to shore. Reed then showed himself to Sue and they both went home, still scared by what could have happened.</span></div></div>",

Doom walked over to Reed and looked down on his cringing figure. \"So Reed, no Invisible Girl to help you out this time.\" <br>\r\n\"Maybe not, Bu t Colossal Girl is going to substitute.\" Doom whipped around and found himself at the crotch in the spread eagle pose Sue's legs had taken. Sue leaned over Doom until her massive mouth was a foot from Doom's head. \"Boo.\" Sue said simply, and Doomfell back wards and collapsed on his rump. Sue knelt down right in front of Doom and grabbed him with her still wet hand.

But 65% said no she shouldn\u2019t be charged. What\u2019s your view Burt?\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cWell my view is that she should be charged,\u201d said the Anchorman. \u201cShe killed all of those people. If we didn\u2019t charge her then people would think that it\u2019s alright to commit genocide. But however on the other she was not in control of her body. She even tried to warn people. If she as in control of her body then I would say lock her up and throw away the key. But since she wasn\u2019t we got to give her some sympathy.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cThank you Burt.\u201d<br>\r\n  Sue just sat there and cried. She shrank until she was a mere dot on the seat. She still cried because some people were still blaming her for what had happened. She want to shrink out of existence so she didn\u2019t hurt anyone else.

There were stories in there about Spider-Man and about the X-Men latest fight against Anti-Mutant fascists. She did see a small article about her scaring the teenagers the previous day.<br>\r\n  \"Why do I even read this paper?\" thought Sue. \"All it does is give superheroes a bad name.\"<br>\r\n  Then outside she saw an armoured car robbery. The paper said that Spider-Man had been put out of action for a while so she knew that it was up to her. She put her coffee down and she went outside.<br>\r\n  Sue saw the thieves robbing the armoured car to get the money. She grew and they didn't notice. She picked up the van and the thieves looked up in amazement.<br>\r\n  \"Hey guys you don't mind if I take this toy car?\" asked Sue. \"I need it for my collection.\" The thieves then started to shoot her. \"Oh and I almost forgot. I also need some little men a lot more than I need this van.\"<br>\r\n  She then put the van back down and she picked up all of the thieves. She looked at them and they were full of fear.<br>\r\n  \"These little guys will be perfect.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But when the police came she stopped juggling and she kept them in her hands.<br>\r\n  Several officers went to her with handcuffs. She gave them the thieves and she made sure that they didn\u2019t get away. Then she was approached by Police Chief.<br>\r\n  \u201cThank you Colossal Girl we\u2019ve been after these guys for weeks,\u201d said the Police Chief.<br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d replied Sue.

She lifted the special weight.<br>\r\n  \u201cHmm 110 lbs at 5\u20196,\u201d thought Sue. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much I can lift at 8 feet tall.\u201d She then grew to 8 feet and she increased the weight that the machine put on the weights. She was able to lift half a ton. \u201cWow half a ton at 8 feet? My strength must be growing quicker than my size. There was no way I could have lifted that up at such a small size.\u201d<br>\r\n  She practiced for about half an hour. The tallest she became was 50 feet and at that size her strength was immeasurable. For her size changing abilities that was only the tip of the iceberg. She could get a lot bigger if she wanted to and her strength would increase dramatically. She guessed that at 500 feet she would probably be able to move a mountain. <br>\r\n  But just then Reed came in.

She made sure that Lois and Clark were asleep. <br>\r\n  She opened the front door and sneaked out. Clark heard a little something and woke up. He used his X-Ray vision to see into the Spare room. To his horror Lucy was gone. He figured that she would be going back to the Lex Corp building.<br>\r\n  Lucy hitch hiked a ride to the Lex Corp building. When she was younger she used to do gymnastics. But she gave it up for her career with Dr Starr. She was able to slip past all the cameras and she made her way into the building.<br>\r\n  She knew from her time in Lex building she knew he had some secret cells in the lower basement. She also knew that you needed a special card to operate the elevators so she used the stairs.<br>\r\n  When she got to the sub basement she easily found the cells. She looked through the spy hole for all of them and then she eventually found Dr Starr.<br>\r\n  \"George,\" she said. \"Oh thank God I found you.\"<br>\r\n  \"I beg to differ,\" replied a voice.<br>\r\n  When she turned around she saw Lex Luthor with his ray gun.

She liked them and she didn't really want to take them off. They felt comfortable.<br>\r\n  George had sold most of the coins but he kept a few for his own collection. He also had a few letters from people claiming to be long lost relatives but he just ignored them.<br>\r\n  Lucy was happy. She was glad to be back on the mainland rather than being stuck on an island that could barely sustain her colossal size. She was seeing her relatives and they marvelled over her size. Her parents were a little disappointed that she married so soon. But if it was with the man she truly loved they would support her.<br>\r\n  She even used her size to help people. She did charity work a number of different charities that did different things. She donated quite a bit of money like they promised and she would do charity events. She once did a ride around Metropolis for money. The money went to charity.<br>\r\n  But she would also go to a children's orphanage and she would spend a little time with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill she need her size to fight evil anytime soon?</span></div></div>",

I was just a normal high school drop out who needed money. So I went to LexCorp. There I met Dr George Starr. He was researching in making things bigger and I was the test subject. It worked but I shrank back down after a few seconds.  They found this really annoying so they made one that was permanent.

But whenever I lost my temper I would go mindless and if I really lost it I would grow. I\u2019ve had a fight or two with the Man of Steel himself. First time he beat me but the second time he let me win.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cYou fought Super-Man?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was 5'2 and was a sweet and gentle woman (As you all know). Unfortunately she didn't do so well in school. Her grades were lower than average. But she was able to find a job.<br>\r\n  She left her apartment and went to her small car. She drove to the Lex Corp building where she worked. But she wasn't a scientist.<br>\r\n  She went up to the main lab and got changed int her work clothes that simply consisted of a thin cotton suit that completely covered her from the neck down. In the lab there were many scientist and her employer. The brains behind the operation was Dr George Starr. Lucy had a crush on him. Her employer was Lex Luthor.<br>\r\n  Lex Corp was testing a new formula that increased the mass and strength of living being. The animal tests were successful so Lex gave the go ahead for human trials.<br>\r\n  The lab had a 100 foot ceiling and was surrounded by lights. Lucy stood in the centre of the lab. Dr Starr walked up to her with a ray gun that had the formula in it. The other scientists had kept their distances.<br>\r\n  \"Are you ready?\" asked Dr Starr.<br>\r\n  \"Yeah I'm ready,\" replied Lucy.<br>\r\n  Dr Starr then fired the ray at Lucy and then he ran for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Lucy grow?</span></div></div>",

If not for that she would be extremely uncomfortable. She stopped growing at a height of a little under 60 feet.<br>\r\n  \"Wow that was weird,\" said Lucy.<br>\r\n  Lex then goes to Dr Starr and shakes his hand. \"You're a genius Dr Starr you'll make this company billions,\" he said. <br>\r\n  Then everyone noticed something else.

Then she heard George's cries for help. <br>\r\n  \"Oh my God George!\"<br>\r\n  She instantly dropped the food and started to run to where she left George. She saw the helicopter about to fly away. She just about got there but it took off and flew away. She could see him in the copter but she couldn't get to him. She saw the helicopter was blue and had the words Metropolis on the side.<br>\r\n  \"Metropolis? METROPOLIS!\"<br>\r\n  She then dived into the sea and started her swim towards her former home in hopes of finding the man she loved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
