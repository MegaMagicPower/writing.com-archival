Here are the three main girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Kelly Green:</b></u> The eldest of the girls at age twenty-three. She is loud and a little bit loopy, but a genuinely nice person. She is the only of the girls who smokes and drinks and has had sex, so she's a little more loose than the others. She suffers from depression. She is already a bit overweight, once saying her stomach has it's own orbit, but she is learning to appreciate her curves. This fair may be where she has a breakthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Jessica Smithson:</b></u> She is the middle of the group, aged twenty. She is the smart one, the honor student. She is athletic and dating, but she's still a tad on the chunky side. She's in college to become a nurse. She's slowly gaining weight already, and she's come to the fair to relax for the first time in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Carrie Smithson:</b></u> Jessica's younger cousin. She's into the whole goth thing. She suffers from a milder case of depression. She's been through a string of boyfriends, yet ironically, she's studying to become a psychiatrist. She is a band geek, in the drum line. She's very sarcastic and surely, but a bit of a softie (inside and out). She's always wanted bigger breasts, and wouldn't mind putting on a few inches around the waist to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, them's the girls. Have fun and be careful with them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica reluctantly forked over the twenty dollar entrance fee, and cautiously strode into the fair, immediantly regretting paying. There wasn't much there, only a handful of cheesy Carnival rides, a thick smattering of greasy food stalls, and the meandering guests, all of whom seemed a bit on the hefty side, and were nonchalantly munching on large, greasy, fatty snacks. Oh, and there was a large white banner, which decalred in bold red letters, 'All food free for patrons!!'<br>\r\nGreat. Jessica had decided just last week that she needed to tighten up her diet. Her waist, while infintismal in comparison to most of the sloshing bellies around here, most of which appeared almost pregnant to term, was still too big for her liking. It was all her mothers fault, really. she had always insisted that Jessica eat all  of her Fattening dinner, and unsuspectful Jessica had decided that a satisfied mom was a more freedom-allowing mom. <br>\r\nBut then Greg had moved to town, just last summer. Greg was gorgeous, the most handsome guy in this hick-town by far, and at first he actually seemed to be interested in Jessica, and then came those awful words, Sorry, Jessica, but I like girls of a different...size\"<br>\r\nall of a sudden her world came tumbling down on Jessica, those words turned over and over in her sleep, she barely ate, and went through almost a week in a stupor. then as quickly as he had come, Greg was gone, taking most of the hearts of girls with him, leaving only a promise to return.<br>\r\nthat was when Jessica had made the decision to slim down as much as she could. she had taken to vigorous training, got up early every morning to run a quarter mile, and had breakfast before anyone got up, so her mother couldn't complain, typically she had only toast, or sometimes some leftover salad, she had immediantly declared meat and meat products off limits, they were too fatty,and then jogged to school. The fair was fairly new in town, it had arrived only a week after Greg left, and some of her previously slim friends had already started to bulk up. She focused on her classes, was rigorous in her work, and in gym she always tried to impress the couch, but he always seemed a bit too interested in his chips to look up at what the students were doing. Thus, Gym became more of a free period for most students, they were free to gossip, or quickly jot down last night's homework as they pleased. But not Jessica. She was always lifting weights, or climbing that big rope to the ceiling, or sparring with Matt.<br>\r\nMatt was the only other kid who didn't sit around, or harass the vending machine. They sparred all the time, but they never really tlaked. Most people assumed they were a couple, they talked about how Jessica and Matt were going to go off to the army together, and how they were the fitness-nuts in love. But that really wasn't the case. it was just that they happened to be the only ones on the jogging team. And they were the Basketball team. And almost all of the other recreational activities, consisted of either them, or nobody. All of them except Chess-club, which consisted solely of that geek, Arnold.<br>\r\n'but enough flashback,' Thought Jessica, 'I just need to get through this without ruining my figure, and when Greg comes back, it'lll all be worth it. and if I don't, all this training will have been for moot.'<br>\r\nand with that, she strode off, when something round and greasy bumped into her from behind, knocking her to the ground.<br>\r\nIn a flash, Jessica was up and stood in karate pose, until she saw her assailant.<br>\r\nIt was a childhood friend of hers, her name was Carla.<br>\r\nFor as long as Jessica had known Carla, which was since kindergarten, Carla had despised fat. However, instead of excersising like Jessica, Carla just barely ate. She was Anorexic, to a degree that once, she had actually had to be hospitalized.<br>\r\nHowever, that apparently was no longer the case. Carla's waist, which was once so small, you could literally put both of your thumbs on her belly button and at the same time put your index fingers on her spine (which all twelve of her boyfriends had proven this year) was now stretched to the limit of her white T-shirt, which was coated in grease and sugar. All in all, Carla's gut was now the size of a bowling ball. in one slightly meaty hand, Carla held a fat hotdog, smothered in mustard, ketchup and relish,only a bite taken out of it, and the other grasped a large overfull, Quart sized soda, which contained what appeared to a thick brown milkshake, which Carla greedily slurped down, without really noticing. <br>\r\n\"Carla?\" Jessica gasped, not wanting to believe the sight.<br>\r\n\"Hmm?...Oh, yeah...That's me\" the girl looked blearily at Jessica, and then blinked, \"Hey... Jessss...ca  right?...the fit...ness-nut?... I never... expected to ...see you hear...HILP! scuse me...hope you enjoy it...\"before Jessica could offer much reaction, the cup eminated a dry sound, and Carla stumbled away, almost waddling, to the nearest stall. Suddenly, she tipped back her head, and swallowed the remainder of the hotdog whole. her eyes closed with pain at the size of the object, but then she smiled lazily, and took the pretzel offered by the man in the stall. It was massive, almost twice the size of an ordinary one.<br>\r\nShaking her head, Jessica walked off, and decided to get on a ride.</span></div></div>",

All these people around, and the temptation to pig out, was making her nervous.<br>\r\n\"yeah?\" she shyly replied, and for the first time looked at him. <br>\r\nSome people would say it was love at first sight. Others would declare it hypnotism. And still others would mildly compare it to the way a Jaguar paralyzes her's prey, right before the pounce. Whatever the words you would string onto it, Jessica was right in the middle of it. She stared deeply into deep, dark, chocolate brown eyes, and could feel him looking back into her baby blue ones. Only for a second did she feel a slight chill. Only for a second did she notice the way his eyes drifted to her midsection, only for a second did she suspect the cold way he glanced at her, which was for barely a microsecond, like she was a pet, and not a favorable one.<br>\r\n\"You look kinda hungry, here, take this. On the house. Er, tent.\" The boy offered her a small bag of fries. Jessica considered taking it; it was so tiny, and free, and he was hot, and apparently interested in her. Then suddenly she remembered, GREG. He was the reason she was on such a rigorous program, she had to become that size for him.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm on a diet. But thanks for the offer.\" Jessica tried walking off again, but the boy laughed,<br>\r\n\"A pretty lady like you deserves a cheat-day. And the boss doesn't like it if we put food back.\"<br>\r\nJessica considered it, but then an idea came to her.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just eat it. You must get hungry, standing there all day, watching everyone else.\"<br>\r\nHis answer was quick, and coupled with a pained smile,<br>\r\n\"We're kinda 'forbidden' from eating any of the food ourselves\"<br>\r\nReluctantly, Jessica took the fries, daintily nibbling on the smallest one.<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could work off anything I gain from this,\" she commented as she munched<br>\r\n\"That's the thinking,\" the boy said, eyes on her teeny midriff, \"names Carl, by the way.\"<br>\r\nJessica swallowed the fry, and was about to thank Carl when something happened</span></div></div>",

I give up.\" She admitted her defeat to the definitive winner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaira finished her milkshake before she spoke. \"You're stopping?

All of the milkshakes Taira drank expanded her stomach to the size of a giant beach ball. With a circumference of five feet, it stood out prominently from her waist. She couldn't even wrap her arms around the bloated belly. \"Well, maybe I did go overboard with the milkshakes, but can you blame me? They were delicious.\" She gave her stomach a playful slap, causing the milkshakes inside her to slosh around. \"Besides, you drank a decent amount as well. I'm sure your stomach suffer the same fate. In fact, let me take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to do that.\" Carrie tried to reassure the approaching Latina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to be shy. Now let's see that belly of yours.\" Taira lifted up Carrie's black shirt and out came Carrie's stomach. It plopped out of her shirt as the milkshakes move about within her stomach. Carrie blushed in embarrassment at the whole ordeal. \"See? I'm not only one who earned themselves a gut from those milkshakes. Just listen to all of that liquid goodness slosh around.\" Taira proceeds to shake Carrie's belly. The poor Goth girl can feel the milkshakes swish up, down, and all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Taira, you made your point. You can stop-<b>BBRRRRAAAAAAPPP!!!</b>\" Carrie's hands immediately covered her mouth after she released her impressive belch. The blush on her face turned a deeper shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Taira was too busy laughing to continue shaking the blushing girl's belly. \"Hahahaha! I didn't expect that to happen. Too funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say.\" Carrie pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Carrie, there's no need to sulk. Think about it like this.\" The bloated Latina waddle her way towards Carrie until both of their bellies were touching one another. \"Compare to this behemoth of a stomach, yours is relatively small.\" She comforted with a slap to her giant belly as it wobbled from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that one way to cheer me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could help. So, what do you want...\" Before Taira could finish her sentence, a loud rumbling noise was heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\u201d Carrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Taira's turn to start blushing. \"Um...

Even after all of those milkshakes you drank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's still room in this giant orb.\" Taira rubbed her belly as it began moaning for nourishment. \"OK, I hear you. I'll get you more food. Do you want to come with me Carrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Someone has to make sure you don't overindulge yourself.\" joked the Goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bloated girls waddle towards to numerous food stands, their milkshake bellies slosh around with each step. The intoxicating smell of the nearby cuisines made Taira's mouth water while her stomach growled louder with each food stall they passed. They continued waddling until they encountered the scent of barbecue. Moving to the source, they came to a stand that specialized in grilled food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. The name's Charles. What can I get for two you?\" introduced the vendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you serve ribs? We caught the scent of barbecue.\" Taira asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just ribs. Burgers, cheesesteaks, chicken, steak. If it can fit on a grill, I can serve it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GGGGGGGRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRLLLLLLLL</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three them of stared at Taira's giant orb belly as it roared in excitement at the variety of food. Her belly quaked from the growl; the milkshakes inside sloshing audibly. Her cheeks blushed as she tried to calm down her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound like I got my work cut out.\" Charles chuckled. \"I'll fix something up for you. And what about you Miss?\" He asked Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to drink? Preferably something that's not a milkshake?\" She requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Give me a few minutes and both of your orders should be ready.\" Charles told the two females and went right to the grill. It wasn't long before he returned with two plates stockpiled with food. \"Here you go: four racks of ribs; three burgers loaded with cheddar, smoked bacon, grilled onions, and honey barbecue sauce; two hot dogs with relish and barbecue sauce; and baked beans and onion rings on the side.\" He handed the plates to Taira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks amazing. Thank you so much Charles.\" She expressed her gratitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. And before I forget, cherry soda for the two of you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take them.\" Carrie said. \"Come on Taira. We should find somewhere to eat before your stomach makes a scene again.\" She jokingly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny Carrie.\" Taira retorted.  \"Thank again Charles!\" The Latina thanks the vender before she waddled after her friend. The two came across a table vacant of people. Taira placed her food on the table before adjusting herself in her seat. Another growl emanated from her big belly as it impatiently waited for the upcoming meal. \"I hope you're ready belly because it's feeding time!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I literally watched you devoured everything with no remorse. You ate like a lion that was deprived of food for several days.\" Carrie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cut me some slack! You heard my stomach screaming at me. When a stomach is that hungry, you're going to eat everything you can until it's full.\" Taira blurted. Taking a sip of her cherry soda, she stared down at her bulbous stomach. Before she arrived at the fair, it was flat as an ironing board. Since then, it has bloated out into a giant sphere. It gurgled and bubbled loudly as it tried to digest all the food inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken.\u201d Carrie checked the time on her phone. \u201cIt 11:30 already? Jeez, where did the time go?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe been stuffing our faces the entire afternoon. Did you already forget our milkshake chugging contest?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I still remember the contest. I can still feel the milkshakes swishing inside.\u201d Carrie answered as she rubbed her bloated stomach. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s time we started heading home. Give us a chance to digest all this food.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a good night sleep sounds nice right now.\u201d Taira mentioned. The Latina attempted to rise from her chair before coming to a sudden realization. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taira fidgeted in her chair. \u201cUhh\u2026 I think I\u2019m stuck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures. You stuffed your stomach to the brim and now it\u2019s pinning you down. All right, give me your arms.\u201d Carrie reached out and grabbed Taira\u2019s arms. \u201cReady? One, two, three!\u201d Carrie pulled the big-bellied Latina out of the chair. The force of the pulling sent Taira crashing into the Goth girl. They collided to the ground; their distending bellies pressing against one another. A pair of loud belches erupted from both of their mouths right in front of each other. They immediately covered their mouths, red-faced from the surprised burps. The two stared at one another until Taira broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was\u2026 unexpected.\u201d She sheepishly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so how long are you planning to stay on top of me? It hard to breathe with that blob you called a stomach crushing my body.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Sorry.\u201d Taira rolled herself off Carrie, her belly moaning loudly at its owner movements. \u201cOhhh. Hey Carrie, I\u2019ll talk to you later. Right now, I really need to get home and let my belly digests.\u201d The bloated Latina waved goodbye before waddling her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie watched her friend leaved the area as she let out a yawn. Pulling out her phone, she saw it was ten minutes to midnight. \u201cI better head home too.\u201d Yawning, the tired Goth absentmindedly rubbed her belly as she walked towards the fair\u2019s exit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was ready to plop down on her bed and call it a night. \"I bet my parents are sitting on the couch, waiting to give me an earful about not coming home so late.\" she groaned. Unlocking the door, she walked in and prepared herself for the verbal berating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she would have if it weren't for the fact her parents were not in the living room. Aside from the nightlight glowing, the room was practically pitch black with no one in sight. Scratching her head, Carrie walked up the stairs to her parents' room. She carefully opened the door and saw her parents sound asleep. Normally, she would waked her parents and tell them she's fine, but the aching pain in her feet told her to save it for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently closed the door and went to her room. She sat on her bed and took off her boots. With her feet finally free, she breathed a sigh of relief before turning her attention to her pudgy stomach. After an afternoon of feasting, it stuck out prominently from her shirt. Carrie poked her abdomen and watched her finger sink into her stomach. Strangely enough, she didn't fell disgusted or upset with the bulge. She felt, for lack of a better word, content. Letting out a yawn, she decided sleep was more crucial than examining her belly. After changing into her pajamas, she jumped into her bed and succumb to slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later came a new day and the radiant warmth of the sun. Its rays pierce through the blinds of Carrie's room and landed on the sleeping Goth's face. With the sunlight on her eyes, Carrie begrudgingly wakes up from her slumber. She walked to her dresser mirror while rubbing the sleep out of her eyes when she noticed something different about her appearance. Taking a closer look, she saw her cheeks were a little plumper and her face seem to be getting rounder. She pinched her left cheek and felt more skin than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder...\" Carrie lifted up her shirt to see her stomach. While its size receded from digesting overnight, there was a noticeable bulge. Below her stomach, she could tell her hips and rear end grew by how snug her pajamas pants felt. Unfortunately, her breasts, one thing place she was hoping would grow, remain the same size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\" Carrie huffed, \"The fat went to every possible area but my breasts. It's like they're dead set on maintaining this size. Ugh, whatever.\" She pouted, folding her arms across her petite chest. As Carrie wallows in her self-pity, an unexpected noise startled the small breasted Goth.</span></div></div>",

Taira?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie, hey!\u201d answered the energetic Latina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing calling me at 8:20? I thought you would be in bed after your disastrous display of gluttony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. Yes, I went a little overboard with eating, but I wouldn\u2019t called it disaster-<b>uurrrppp!</b> Uhhh\u2026 J-Just forget I said anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-uh, sure,\u201d Carrie smugly replied. \u201cAnyway, did you want to me asked me something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you wanted to hang out at the fair again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Carrie waited for a response before she resumed speaking. \u201cI\u2019ll admit their food is delicious, but besides that, it\u2019s not worth the thirty dollars admission fee.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the news? If you paid this week, you can go back the rest of the year for free.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Just exchange your ticket for an annual pass card and you\u2019re good to go. You still have your ticket, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie scurried towards her closet and found the pants she wore yesterday. Searching through the pockets, she pulled out her ticket. \u201cYes, I still have it. So, you still want to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. How does 10 o\u2019clock sounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll see you there, glutton.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Carrie-<b>eEERRRPPP!!</b>\u201d There was a pause on the other end as Carrie stifled her giggles. \u201cI-I\u2019m going to get ready now. Later.\u201d An embarrassed Taira muttered before ending the call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her friend\u2019s antics. After she calmed herself down, she took a quick shower and picked out her outfit. She went with a gray loose fitting shirt, black pants, and black boots. Looking in the mirror, she still noticed the bulge of her stomach through her shirt. \u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Carrie admitted as she rubbed her stomach. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep this once my breasts grow out. Of course, that\u2019s <b>if</b> my breasts grow out.\u201d Letting out a sigh, she grabbed her phone and purse and headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie walked downstairs, her mother, Donna, was watching the news in the living room. \u201cWell you\u2019re up early on a Saturday. Shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping?\u201d Donna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend I met yesterday said she wanted to hang out at the fair today,\u201d Carrie answered. \u201cHey, where\u2019s dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s out grocery shopping.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay. Umm\u2026 Listen, I should have called you yesterday. I lost track of time and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Carrie. Granted, your father and I were worried about you, but we know you would handle yourself. Just make sure you tried to call or text us next time, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Well, I better get going. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Carrie opened the door and waved to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and waved back as she watched her daughter closed the door. \u201cI sure hope she has a good time. Hopefully it helps with the rough patch she\u2019s going through.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie arrived at the Rotund Bros. Fair at 9:30. After she exchanged her ticket for the annual pass, she walked in before a familiar voice called out to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie, over here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and saw Taira walking towards her. However, Carrie notices that the Latina looked heftier than yesterday. Her face had taken a rounder shape with chubby cheeks. Every step she took caused the slightest hint of a wobble from her breasts and stomach. But her lower body took the biggest hit. Her pants looked absolutely tight, trying to contain her enlarged hips and rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh wow. She really did pack on the pounds,</i> Carrie thought. <i>God, just look at her breasts. It\u2019s like she has a pair of grapefruits inside that sweater. What do I have to do to get bigger breasts? Ugh, it\u2019s so unfair.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie? Hello? Are you in there?\u201d Carrie jumped as Taira broke her out of her internal diatribe. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Taira asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was just thinking about something. So, did you arrive at the same time or you were grabbing a bite to eat and just so happen to spot me?\u201d She teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I got just here. Just because I ate a lot last time does not mean I have food on the brain,\u201d Taira folded her arms and looked at Carrie\u2019s stomach. She began to smile as an idea was forming. \u201cSeems I\u2019m not the only one that gain weight. Don\u2019t think I can\u2019t see your stomach through that shirt.\u201d She proceeded to poke and pinch Carrie\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!! Stop that!\u201d blurted Carrie, her cheeks turning a bright shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, what\u2019s wrong? Is the Goth ashamed of her pudgy tummy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock it off!\u201d the flustered Carrie knocked Taira\u2019s hands away and wrapped her arms around her stomach. Upset and embarrassed, the blushing teen shot daggers at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to be angry. I was just pestering you. It\u2019s all in good fun,\u201d Taira explained. \u201cLook, why don\u2019t we put this incident behind and get some food? I doubt neither of us had the chance to eat breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their stomachs growled loudly at the mention of breakfast. The two females rubbed their bellies before they agreed to find some place to eat.</span></div></div>",

Luanne touched it to make sure it was real. \"How did this happen?\" She asked out loud, but nobody replied. Luanne grabbed a stray cheeseburger and took a large bite, one hand rubbing her bloated belly. She didn't understand how it had gotten so big...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ride jerked into motion again. Luanne grabbed another burrito as it fell from the roof and greedily consumed it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the cart jerked forwards, plunging it's riders into a dimly lit room, Luanne tried hard not to release another belch...she was already feeling humiliated after overdoing it and burping in the goth girl's face in the last room, and was determined she would not eat anything else this fair had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder what we're going to get this time?\" The chubby goth said out loud, licking her lips noisily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights flickered on, and Luanne heard the sounds of machinery coming to life above her. She looked up and was surprised to see that a ton of milkshakes - not unlike the ones you might be served in McDonalds - were being lowered from the roof. One of them was lowered straight into her lap. She looked around and saw that the bulging girl behind her was already gulping down a chocolate one, the rich chocolatey scent filled the air...it smelled delicious. She reached for the milkshake in front of her and put the straw in her mouth. <i>Well...I am kinda thirsty...what harm could it do?</i> She asked herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne sucked on the straw and gave an involuntary groan of delight as the rich, thick, chocolate milk slid down her throat. It tasted amazing, better than any milkshake she had ever tried in her life! She gulped it down eagerly, and when she finally swallowed every last drop, another one was lowered into her lap. She looked down at her stomach, which seemed to have grown a little larger after the shake...but not by much. Ignoring her belly, Luanne grabbed the second shake and chugged it down, oblivious to the fact that her stomach was slowly causing her shirt to ride up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are delicious, huh?\" The chubby goth piped up as she tipped the contents of one of the cups into her open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne turned around, her mouth covered in milk. \"They're amazing! What did you say your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie,\" the girl smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luanne,\" Luanne smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, looks like you've got another!\" Carried pointed ahead as a new shake was pushed into Luanne's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they never stop coming!\" Luanne laughed as she excitedly began slurping up her new shake, her belly bloating at a rapid pace as it was filled with gallons of chocolate milk. Her shirt had now ridden up past her belly button, and her growing stomach was growing bigger and rounder by the second. But Luanne was too focused on her delicious, addictive milkshakes to pay any attention to her ballooning belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was putting away even more, and her stomach was causing her some serious discomfort as it forced it's way into the safety bar in front of her. Her pants were stretching apart at the seams, her belly was completely exposed and growing softer and flabbier with each passing moment and her butt was wedged in the chair. On top of that, her cleavage was increasing, her swelling boobs beginning to overflow her ridiculously tight top. But still she barely noticed, focused only on eating and drinking and filling her bloated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...mmmm....hmph....\" Luanne made only mumbling noises and greedy snuffles as she consumed milkshake after milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cart finally began to move again, Luanne was actually a little disappointed...she could have easily drank another two or three. She gave a moan as her stomach made a gargling noise, and received the shock of her life when she looked down and saw that her massively bloated stomach was totally exposed. Her shirt had ridden to just below her breasts, and she tried desperately to pull it back down, only to find it wouldn't budge. There was no way her top was going to cover that belly. \"Oh my God! How did I get so big?!\" She squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Carrie belched and placed a hand on her shoulder. \"Relax, you're just bloated. You should see the size of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne turned around and gasped at the size of Carrie's gut. \"Oh my God! You look ready to pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart moved forwards into the next room, which was filled with...</span></div></div>",

She hoped there wouldn't be any more food...and yet...she didn't quite feel full yet. It was a strange situation; she had eaten more food than any girl her size could pack away, and yet part of her still yearned for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what we'll get this time...\" Carrie said from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne didn't have to wait long until she found it. Suddenly, a long tube lowered itself from the ceiling, and as she looked up, forced it's way into her mouth. Luanne gave a muffled cry and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. Behind her, Carrie saw the tube approach her own mouth and opened wide to let it in. Luanne struggled desperately, trying to free herself, but it was no good. She was trapped, and she couldn't even call for help. What the hell was going on on this ride?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, machinery was beginning to rumble up above, and within seconds Luanne heard liquid moving somewhere in the ceiling. She could see the tube above her filling with some sort of brown goo, which, within moments, was gushing towards her. She struggled again, banging her hands against the cart as she looked on in terror. The liquid was soon flowing down her throat, and she found herself growing strangely relaxed. She stopped beating her hands and freaking out and let the liquid flow down her throat and into her full belly. She wasn't sure what exactly the substance was, but it had the same delicious taste as everything else she had eaten at the fair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as more and more of the substance was dumped into her mouth. She could actually feel her stomach stretching and bloating even wider. Her jean skirt was starting to feel tight as well, and her already sizeable butt was beginning to tingle. She laid her hands atop her bulging belly as it expanded beneath her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Carrie was really starting to pack on the pounds. Her pot belly had become a huge, round gut that was at least three times the size of Luanne's, while her thighs were finally beginning to rip through her pants. She could hear the material tearing, but paid no attention, enjoying the sensation of her clothes ripping apart. She had been chubby when she first arrived at the fair, but now she was officially <i>fat</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the tubes retracted, leaving the two bloated girls gasping for air. Luanne opened her eyes and stared down at her enormously bloated stomach, which now pushed up against the safety bar, wedging her in her seat. She struggled to free herself, but her stomach was too big and full, and she quickly gave up the effort. \"Oh my God...what is happening to me?\" She groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's pants gave a loud rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrip, and she gasped as they were left in tatters around her meaty, thick thighs. Her exposed belly bulged into her lap, and her big butt wedged into her seat. She couldn't have escaped even if she tried...but she didn't <i>want </i>to escape. She was enjoying this far too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne was starting to relax a little more as well. She was amazed by how big her belly had grown, but the amount of food she had packed away had left her feeling tired and strangely content. She rubbed her stomach as the cart powered up again and wheeled them into the next room...</span></div></div>",

Carrie groaned as she rose to her feet and stepped out of the cart, leaving the tattered remains of her pants on the seat, barely noticing how exposed she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuanne was stuffed, and not used to being this full, and she gave a loud belch as she shuffled out of her seat and stood up. The food had worked it's magic on her body, though she was not nearly as chubby as Carrie; her thighs rubbed together as she stood up, her belly bloated out from beneath her shirt, and her ass - already bigger than average when she got on the ride - threatened to escape from her short jean skirt, the bottoms of her swollen butt cheeks hanging out for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Luanne gasped as she saw the half naked Carrie walk by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...my skirt...\" Carrie said, barely able to see past her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other passengers got off the ride, Luanne noticed they had eaten a lot too; one guy's pants had burst open, another girl  was in her bra with a massive belly jiggling everywhere while two skinny girls with massively bloated stomachs just collapsed on the floor, rubbing their food stuffed guts. Luanne tried to think straight, wondering how they had all gotten so full so quickly...how their bellies had gotten so big...but she couldn't remember...had it been the ride? She felt dizzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a handsome young fair worker appeared before the girls, causing Luanne to blush and try to cover her exposed belly up. Carrie didn't seem bothered, and just scratched her heavy stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss,\" the boy said. \"We noticed you'd had a clothing malfunction. Here, have these on us.\" He held up a large pair of denim shorts, big enough to fit around Carrie's huge ass and chubby waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, thanks,\" Carrie smiled, taking the shorts and pulling them over her chunky thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...the ride...what did it...do to us?\" Luanne groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shrugged. \"Just gave us some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...so big...\" Luanne moaned, rubbing her bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you that big when you went on?\" Carrie asked, looking confused. \"I know I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you...the food...your clothes...\" Luanne clutched her head as she struggled to think. She had been skinny before all this...hadn't she?! </span></div></div>",

Both girls were now quite rotund compared to how they looked when they started their day, but Luanne was having a hard time tracing her steps, she just followed Carrie until Carrie abruptly stopped. This quick stoppage shook Luanne out of her head and caused her to look up and see what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her was a gathering of large women all looking up at man on a stage. \"You girls ready to eat?\" The man said in an entertainer kind of voice. They all screamed back yes like they were at at rock show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie what is going on?\" Luanne had tapped Carrie on the shoulder to figure out what was going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where they have a lottery to select someone to partake in a delicious feast. Food way better than the carnival stuff around here. Here is your ticket, good luck.\" Carrie handed Luanne a ticket with six digits on it. Luanne paid no attention to how Carrie had osmosised all this information, but it was becoming time to see who the winner was. Luanne had the number 208657. The guy on stage had the winning ticket number in his hands and started to read the number aloud very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2-0-8...\" All the women were still eagerly looking in his direction. \"6!\" Only a few moans were heard but most were still in the race. \"5!\" Now there was a much larger moan as most of the women were now hanging their heads in defeat. \"6!\" Luanne looked back at her ticket to make sure she had not read it wrong, but she only reaffirmed that she was a loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeppie!\" Next to her Carrie was squealing. Carrie had the winning ticket and started making her way waddling up to the stage. The man congratulated her on her accomplishment, and Carrie was sporting a smile from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this year as a bonus you can pick one friend to join you for your feast. Go on deary, who do you want to bring with you?\" Carrie's finger pointed straight at Luanne. \"Her?\" Luanne was probably the smallest of the pack of hefty women but still Carrie's only friend in the crowd. \"Alright little lady come on up and join your friend. Luanne did as told and both girls were taken backstage and into their room where their tasty feast awaited them.</span></div></div>",

Can you help me out?\" Carrie's attention had been caught by a food service woman who waved her arm. \"Geez. What did I do?\" Carrie stuck her hands in her brown jacket pockets and traveled toward the commotion. \"I've got so much. I feel like I've over prepared.\" The fair woman whined, clearly it had to be about the absurd amount of fair food she made. Carrie looked at the nacho buckets, fried candy bar baskets, triple dipped corn dogs. Yikes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God this stuff could kill a person just by looking at it,\" Once again her nose caught a waft, \"Still. I paid a lot to get in and it's free.\" Her gothic eyes looked at the selection. The fair woman smiled at the notion that Carrie considered. \"Just one of each item will be enough. Everybody who's had it said they're REALLY good.\" Carrie huffed, \"If there were other people then why was I singled out like this?\" she thought, \"Has she been doing that to everyone? Anyhow, I might as well.\" Carrie grabbed the bucket of nachos drenched in an absurd amount of nacho cheese and a basket of fried candy bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fair woman practically cried from Carrie's decision. \"Thank you! Thank you so much! I just hate to see good food go to waste.\" Carrie opened her mouth to make a soul shattering remark in terms of the woman's hefty stature but kept her mouth closed. \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Not bad,\" spoke Carrie after a few nachos. The ratio between nacho texture and load of melted cheese is scientifically perfect. But, Carrie doesn't know that. Although, she beginning to learn how good this stuff actually is. Usually, nachos and cheese at a fair tasted processed to all hell. Clearly this stuff wasn't store bought. It had to be home made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie occasionally took a break from the nacho bucket to take a good chomp from the fried candy bars that tasted a lot less disgusting than they sounded on paper. The wonderful tastes of chocolate, fried dough, cheese and tortilla chip combined on her tongue wonderfully. The food would make for a wonderful journey down to her stomach. That would be until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I NEED A DRINK!\" Carrie gasped, having trouble swallowing. Luckily for her a soda cart, piloted by an elderly man with a grotesquely round belly, stopped at her table. Without a word, the man poured a soda of unknown flavor (probably Cola) into a massive cup and placed it in front of her. Carrie didn't hesitate to guzzle down as much of the liquid as she could. \"That's better.\" Carrie sighed before a burp flew from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie found her arm diving into the nacho bucket to discover it completely empty. Then the candy bar basket was empty. \"Man. I got kinda crazy. But that food was kinda good. Gotta admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free Sample! Fried Butter Balls.\" A man dropped a basket of ten powder sugar coated butter balls. Carrie nearly picked the basket up and threw it at his head when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate coated bacon on a stick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donut burgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ultra Cheese Curds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie found her table being piled with foods she wasn't asking for. These carnie folk were practically tossing what they cooked in front of her. As much as she wanted to deny the free food, something kept her from leaving the table. Instead, her hands became greedy, grabbing as much food as they could hold and pressed them into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seconds later, Carrie could feel her stomach getting tight and strangely enough the clothes she wore felt a tad snug too. Something in her mind had forgotten her regard for herself and kept shoveling food into her mouth. \"If I don't do something quick. I'm gonna be in a world of hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of it was real, this was all in her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly gurgled, and she unleashed a horrendously loud, wet belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed;. Someone heard her?! <br>\r\nShe turned around to see a chubby redhead stare back. No, not just chubby. Stuffed, bloated, like she'd been eating a <i>lot</i>...<br>\r\nThe girl was grinning wildly at Carrie, mostly at Carrie's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing, hiding over here with all that beautiful belly? C'mon, let's get some corn dogs or somethin'!\" The girl spoke with a light southern accent.<br>\r\nCarrie just stared, a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Where'r my manners? I'm Clara!\" she said through a mouthful of greasy chicken. \"Isn't this place great? I've been eatin' for at least three hou<b>-PHHHRRRRRRT!-</b>\"<br>\r\nThe girl blushed lightly, but not out of embarrasment. She seemed proud. \"S'cuse me!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Clara?\" Carrie managed. She was in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! C'mon, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aren't you embarrassed? You-You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fat and gassy?\" Clara chirped happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara frowned. \"Why should I be? In fact, the question is, why are <i>you</i> embarrassed?\" Clara poked Carrie's belly, Carrie let out a loud fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Follow me!\" Clara laughed, grabbing Carrie's hand. \"I'll show you how to have a good time at the fair!\"</span></div></div>",

She saw no need for restraint in any sense of the word; if she needed to belch or fart, she let it out almost <i>triumphantly</i>. Along with her awe, Carrie was a bit afraid... mostly at Clara's sudden interest at Carrie's own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've barely eaten a thing!\" Clara said, raising a burrito up to Carrie's mouth, promptly shoving it in. \"Enjoy yourself! You're making <i>me</i> feel restrained!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Mmmph!\"</b><br>\r\nCarrie swallowed, nearly choking on the enormous burrito. \"I-I'm just not hungry like you are!

St-stoppit!\" Carrie muffled through a mouthful of corn dog. A seam burst on her poor, stretched shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara frowned.<br>\r\n\"You've got the hardest case of self-denial I've ever seen. You're a fat girl at heart, but you've tricked yourself in believing otherwise... I know what'll help that!\"<br>\r\nShe bounded off through the crowd, Carrie standing in bloated wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo THAT'S why she was dragging Carrie along?

She was fine as she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, a hand reached over to Carrie's mouth and shoved in the sloppiest, greasiest, <b>biggest</b> corn dog Carrie had ever eaten or seen in her life. As she swallowed, the corn dog seemed to hit her belly like a weight, and she swore her stomach swelled three inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"-HHHHHHHHHRRRRRAAAAAP!-\" </b></i> Carrie roared, her stomach suddenly downright <i>full</i> of gas. She behind to see the cheery face of Clara beaming back at her, holding a now-empty corn dog stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... What was that... What was that for?\" Carrie attempted to groan, but was interrupted by a second loud, wet belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara giggled. \"The Heavy Hitter corn dog, this fair's most famous food item! Man, it's working wonders on you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! A corn dog?!

Her mind felt... clouded somehow. She couldn't think straight at all. At first, her gas made her as embarrassed as she'd ever been, but as only a few seconds passed... she didn't care. In fact, all she could notice was a slight... hunger, small at first, but increasing with every moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara?

Her belly was the size of a beach ball, hanging over her unbuckled belt, proudly displaying her pale white skin for the world to see. Her ass had split her pants down the seam, showing her striped panties every time she moved. Her breasts had snapped her bra a few minutes ago, her cleavage now seemingly endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was becoming something of a show of the other fairgoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a few other young women, the fair food hadn't had nearly the same effect on the other fairgoers as it had for poor Carrie. The amount of food she was putting away was downright incredible, and thus a crowd had begun to form around her, some of the onlookers even getting food for her. Every time she cleared another large plateful, they cheered, some even betting when she'd quit and finally be full. Obviously, no one had won any bets yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished off a few fried chicken legs when a fair worker walked up to her.

The first was a small, twentysomething <br>\r\nyear old girl, dressed in overalls and covered head to toe in dirt. She ran a hand through her rough cut hair as she <br>\r\nwatched the small television screen in front of her. \"Damn,\" she said, \"It doesn't look like nobody's comin' in today.\" The <br>\r\nTV was hooked to a camera trained on the entrance of the fair, and no one was on screen. \"Thass bad,\" The girl continued, <br>\r\n\"Today ain't gonna be no fun if we don't have anyone to play around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of the four spoke up. \"Scum, what does that even mean? It's like you're not even speaking English.\" The second <br>\r\nperson was a handsome young man in pressed dress clothes, half taking a nap off in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know!\" Scum said, \"People come 'round and we feed 'em and play! It ain't a tough idea. 'Sides, I haven't gotten a <br>\r\nnice, thin girl to fatten up in a long time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third of the four turned his attention from the TV screen. A bald man in his mid thirties, about the size and shape of <br>\r\na full grown grizzly bear, and clad in white clothes and a stained apron. He spoke in a deep but quiet voice, \"Scum, you <br>\r\nhad a girl come two days ago when you were manning the ferris wheel. As I remember, you did well, she was really waddling <br>\r\nwhen she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh,\" Scum said, \"It wasn't me. I called her, yeah, but Joshua stole her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man spoke up again, opening his eyes so he could locate Scum and deliver a smug grin her way. \"Hey, it's not my <br>\r\nfault, she came to me. Had her eating out of my hands... both figuratively and literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Scum started, but she was stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scum, it's not like you're the only one who's short.\" The large man said, \"We're all struggling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Scum yelled, \"You ain't strugglin', Bruce, you got other stuff to worry about.\" She waved her hand in the vague <br>\r\ndirection of the fourth person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth person looked up from what she was doing. Namely, gorging herself on a giant, greasy plate of deep-fried oreos. <br>\r\nShe was a thin, statuesque hispanic woman, three hundred and fifty pounds ago. Now, she took up the space of two people on <br>\r\nthe bench she was sitting on, that creaked in protest as she shifted all her weight. She was wearing a tight tank top that <br>\r\nexposed the rolls of doughy, tan skin that sat in her generous lap and pressed up against the table. She licked some grease <br>\r\noff her fingers and spoke. \"Mi hijo, Bruce doesn't have to worry about me, I can feed myself well.\" She patted her belly to <br>\r\nemphasize that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScum snorted. \"Yeah, but eat so much, while Bruce is busy feedin' some teeny girl, his wife is wastin' away to nothin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce turned to his wife. \"Dulce, I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce raised a hand to cut him off. \"Don't let her get in your head, Mi Amor. Go call some nice girl, and teach her the joy <br>\r\nof gluttony,\" She took another bite of her greasy carnival food. \"That is, unless I call her first. I've been looking for <br>\r\nan eating buddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScum coughed and laughed. \"It's down to skill, then! Who ever sees anyone first, call them. No cheatin', Joshua.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua stood up and walked over to where the other three were talking. \"Fine, I won't steal anyone's girl. It's been a <br>\r\nwhile since I've won one fair and square, anyway. Those are the hard-earned pounds, you get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Bruce said, \"Now all we need is someone to come in...\"<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nWho sees the girl first?</div></div>",

The stand is fairly small compared to others, taking up half as much space as a barbecue stand not too far off, and it has a red and white stripe pattern running across it, like a candy cane.  Curiously though, you find that the stand has four flavors listed on the front, a far cry from what you are used to seeing; most places have at least ten.  The only options presented are vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or Neapolitan, the tasty combination of all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debate whether or not to get some, but the fair is so hot and you are still, surprisingly enough, hungry.  Perhaps some ice cream could tide you over; it would certainly help to beat the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a slow, awkward trek to the stand, as you have to walk around in clothes and weight you are not used to, but you eventually make it over to the stand.  When you arrive, you smile at the plump girl working the stand while you try your hardest to rid yourself of the wedgie your panties have made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" the chipper girl greets you. \"What can I do for you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see...\"</span></div></div>",
