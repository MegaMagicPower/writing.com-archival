My head... Where am I- AND WHAT IS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING IN MY ASS!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Takes off her pants*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I in a shoulder wedgie!? WHO DID THIS TO ME she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter question yet, what the hell happened here, how did I end up here, why am I alone, WHAT ARE THESE CLOTHES!? I need answers.. Nothing's gonna change if I just stand here... BUT FIRST LEMME PICK THIS WEDGIE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Walks to a nearby window after fixing her white granny panties*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shi-..... What in the hell happened? It's like there was a war or something... Actually, if there was a war, why aren't there any dead bodies on the ground even though there's blood everywhere? Is there anyone alive in this place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tracy picks up a backpack lying in the corner*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... It's empty.. But I guess it'll come in handy... All right, time to haul ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Runs out the door in search of anyone or anything that she may find useful*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It's a medical facility, right? There's gotta be SOME kind of light that I can use.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*After a few minutes of wandering, she reaches the reception table and manages to get a flashlight and a whole bunch of batteries to go with it*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSWEET! LIGHTS AND BATTERIES! Okay. Now I just gotta find out which floor I'm on, which side of the building I'm on, where the cafeteria is and WHERE IS THE GODDAMN DIRECTO- oh, found it hehe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so this is the center of the first floor and the cafeteria is on the east end of the building... Okay. Now I know where I'm going<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A sudden rummage sound frightens her*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAHHHHHHHHH WHAT WAS THAT!? Hello? Is anyone there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Her flashlight shines on a woman squatting on the floor with her back facing Tracy*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my f*cking god thank goodness you're here! my name's Tracy, are you all right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The woman turns around revealing herself to be a zombie with glowing yellow eyes*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT THE F- ma'am? Are yo- I.. Can't move.... What's going on.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The zombie walks up to Tracy ready to tear her to pieces*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAI- I.. Somebody...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RAAAH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Another girl pops up from behind, beheading the zombie, to Tracy's surprise, there was little to no blood gushing out of the zombie*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH, MY GOOOOOOOD, YOU JUST KILLED THAT LADY! WHO ARE YOU!? Actually, better question, WHY ARE YOUR PANTIES PULLED OVER YOUR EYES!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this atomic wedgie? It's to prevent me from ending up like you. I'm Amelia (White 18 years old, 5ft 6 120lbs, blonde hair, blue eyes, c cup, blue and white striped panties), and you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nME!? I'M TRACY BUT FOR SOME REASON, I CAN'T MOVE! Do you know what happened to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that's simple. You looked into the eyes of what we call the Glares. If you haven't already figured out, she's a zombie with some kind of weird brainwaves released from her eyes that paralyzes people who look into them directly. Doesn't work if you have something obstructing your vision, like this atomic wedgie here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see.. Isn't it uncomfortable? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, not really? Kinda feels good to be honest. I love wedgies. And you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI.. I.. Er... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHu hu hu... You look so cute paralyzed.. I wonder if I should give you a wedgie..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH, MY GOD, PLEASE NO! I HATE WEDGIES!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRela~x I was just kidding. Close your eyes for a minute. It'll relief some of that paralysis enough for you to move..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A minute later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh.. That feels a little better... So anyway, you gave yourself an atomic wedgie JUST to counter the effects of.. What were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Glares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. Glares. So... That means I have to get an atomic wedgie, too, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tracy turns around and bends over*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? For real? Don't you hate wedgies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do... But I don't want to end up paralyzed again.. Or be helpless again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean... You're about to feel helplessly wedgied in a moment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's okay.. You saved me and I trust you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay.. You asked for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Amelia grabs Tracy's white granny panties*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATOMIC... WEDGIE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAAAAARRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaand there. Right over your face. Now, what were you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up and started looking for some food and water. I don't remember or know what happened before that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see.. Well the cafeteria is this way. Let's go meet up with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah.. You did use the pronoun \"we\" during our conversation.. How many people are in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, including you, 5 of us. There's me, Sara, Shauna, Chloe and you. Come on, let's go meet them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeya everyone. Look what I found!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe (Asian, 17 years old, 4ft 6 99lbs, black hair, black eyes, b cup, yellow panties) A new girl? And an atomic wedgie in white granny panties? Y'know, for someone wearing military clothes, you wouldn't expect them to be such a big closet nerd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: Hey.. What are you guys wearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara (Brazilian 18 years old 5ft 8 130lbs, black hair, brown eyes, c cup, skyblue panties): Oh, these? These are special goggles that I made to counter the Glares. Unfortunately for Amelia, her's got damaged during our trip here so she settled for an atomic wedgie. And since she loves wedgies, it's a bonus for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia: HELL YEAH! WOO HOO! WEDGIES RULEEE!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: No... They're uncomfortable....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna: Ahahahaha. Lemme guess what happened. You looked into a Glare's eyes and got paralyzed so Amelia gave you an atomic wedgie? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: Mm-hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: Amelia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia: What? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna: Amelia, there's an extra set of goggles in your bag, remember!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia: OH, RIGHT! I FORGOT THOSE WERE IN THERE!! SORRY, TRACY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: ..... OH, MY GOD WHY DID I EVEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS ATOMIC WEDGIE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: HAHAHAHAA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tracy undoes her wedgie and after a while of gathering supplies and introductions, they filled Tracy in on what is going on and the details of some of the Zombies that they knew of*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: Wow.. It sounds like you guys have been dealing with those zombies for a while, now.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna: Yeah.. It's been like 2 weeks now since the world went to shit. But hey, at least we're all alive, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: Yeah, you're right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe: All right, we're done here. We're going back to back now. Tracy, you don't happen to have anything you can fight with on you, do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: No.. You don't happen to have enough space for 1 more person, do you? Is the base far from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara: Sure we do. Our base is big like a mansion. And no, it's actually pretty near. About 3 blocks away in a barricaded bunker. But here, you can use this machete to protect yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: Thank you.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe: All right, Tracy, welcome to the team. You may have some form of memory loss, but seeing as you're wearing military clothes, you should have gotten some form of training before all this.. So hopefully those will come in handy in a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy: I hope so... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe: All right, girls! We're going home!</span></div></div>",
