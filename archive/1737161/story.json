It was a Thursday and you were no longer protected. Since you were now 18 there was no one to protect you. At your height you knew this could only mean trouble. You slowly made your way out of bed, it was a handmade bed suited for your size. Mona couldn\u2019t wait to get her hands on you now that your protection has expired. Though you didn\u2019t think anything would happen, unprovoked, you didn\u2019t want to risk it. Eventually you were fully awake and could think clearly.

Even though you were only three inches tall, you were still able to get an education at the local technical college. You were practicing to become a chef. The college was aware of your situation and assured safety. With everyone still asleep, you made your way to the college. By the time you got there it was eight twenty and class was about to begin. You hurried to your cooking class and was greeted by Miss Harris, the teacher. She was 30 years old and had medium brown hair, cool green eyes, the body of a goddess, and a strict attitude. With a gentle hand she picked you up and introduced herself to you and introduced you to the class. It was a small class, only about six students including you. The rest of the class was all female. <br>\r\n     After the introductions, Miss Harris placed you at your workspace, which was between a good looking brunet with blue eyes and a tall black haired beauty with an attitude both appeared around 19. Miss Harris then began class by asking the students to create a dish, any dish, to use as a benchmark. As usual, you were at a disadvantage with your height. You tried to assemble a dish but as time expired you had nothing. \u201cWell, Sam,\u201d Miss Harris said, \u201cit looks like you failed to put together anything. I hope you can improve.\u201d You tired to assure her you could but she didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cI need to make a statement that failure isn\u2019t an option.\u201d She continued, \u201cDo you know what I am going to do?\u201d You had no idea but you knew it wasn\u2019t good as Miss Harris picked you up and brought you to face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she have in mind?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn\u2019t believe you were being treated like this. As Miss Harris continued with class you were placed in between Nora\u2019s bulbous breasts. If was quite comfortable and you soon yourself asleep. You figured it wasn\u2019t all bad. A few hours later you were awoken as Nora gently grabbed you and placed you on the plastic topped table. \u201cListen, my little pet.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m in charge and what I say goes.\u201d You looked around and noticed that there was no one in sight. \u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d Nora asked. You shook your head no, and then watched in fear as she ate her food. She had purchased a pack of sushi and a vegetarian foot long sub. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter,\u201d Nora inquired as she noticed you staring at her food, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d You nodded and Nora looked sympathetic. \u201cI could share, I guess. What would you like?\u201d You thought about. The dining hall was cavernous and catered to many different tastes but you were able to narrow it down to two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About 30 minutes later, the two of you had finished lunch and Nora asked if you wanted some ice cream. You said yes, and so Nora carries you over to the ice cream machine, grabbed a cone, filled the cone with vanilla, then stuck you in the center of the ice cream. Before you could protest at this blindside, you were covered in chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, whipped cream, and a cherry was placed on your head. \"What are you doing?\" you yelled at her. \"You are just so sweet, I couldn't resist.\" Nora responded with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Nora playing?</span></div></div>",

You turned and found that you were level with Nora's belly which was just barely covered by her shirt. It was making the growling sounds of a belly that was still hungry. You looked up and saw a smile spread across her face as she stared at you, the top piece of bread in her left hand. You saw her take her right hand and nudge you forward towards the sandwich with her pointer finger.  \"What are you doing,\" you asked as you turned to face the sandwich because the nudge nearly made you lose balance and you had to turn to keep from falling. You then felt her finger flick you hard in the back and you fell forward and onto the sandwich, and heard her giggle, \"Well, I decided to help make you a sandwich, but my hungry belly has made me think of having one more thing for lunch, you.\" You felt as she covered you with the top slice of bread, patted it down to pin you in, and placed the plate on a tray. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I did help make you a sandwich, but not one for you to eat, but as part of one for me to gobble up,\" Nora said. Nora then got some cherry soda from the drink dispenser and headed back to the cashier. She was charged for a drink and a standard sandwich. The cashier had no idea that Nora had made a sandwich that was anything but standard, because you were still situated right in the middle, barely able to move. You started to wiggle your way through the sandwich to one end as Nora went and sat down. You finally made it to where you could poke your head and shoulders out of the end, and you came face to face with Nora, who had brought the sandwich up close to her mouth. \"The professor, she did tell me that she was letting me have you as my pet, but I think you will be much more useful as lunch,\" Nora said and then opened her mouth and started moving your section straight towards it. You got closer and closer and saw her tongue salivating in anticipation. You realized this was it for you; your lovely classmate was going to devour you for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did it happen?</span></div></div>",

It happened fairly often after all, it just wasn\u2019t normal she\u2019d discuss punishments. That was what worried you. You let out a nervous chuckle, \u201cHeh, well it looks like class is over Ms. Harris. I better get going before I\u2019m late. Could you please set me down an-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be going anywhere Mr. Johnson.\u201d You shirked into your shirt as Ms. Harris stared at you strictly; Ms. Harris was mad, that was never a good thing. \u201cDo you realize how many times you\u2019ve failed to make a dish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026a few times\u2026?\u201d You didn\u2019t want to even place a number on it, you just stared at the teacher\u2019s open cleavage for some mild comfort as the lecture began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry 32 times. I can understand not finishing a few times, but you\u2019re doing nothing but fail.\u201d She continued to stare you down with those menacing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But that\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019m tiny. I can\u2019t just cook something fancy when I can\u2019t even hold a spoon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Harris did not like your explanation, \u201cExcuses! I never expected a fancy dish from you. I\u2019m not some sort of monster Mr. Johnson. I wanted small things from you, perhaps an appetizer sample, even a cracker with some cheese. Anything is better than nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts! I didn\u2019t want to have to do this Mr. Johnson but you\u2019ve honestly left me with no choice. For the next few days you\u2019ll be my personal slave. If you haven\u2019t learned by the end of it, not only will you fail my class, but the position will become permanent. Do I make myself clear?\u201d Her imposing figure loomed over you, a face big enough to engulf you in its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation wasn\u2019t even close to fair though, and you were going to explain that. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair Ms. Harris! I can\u2019t help I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate slackers Mr. Johnson! Whether you like it or not you are my slave for now. In fact, it would be better if you disliked it; maybe the lesson will be learned.\u201d Her increasingly loud tone silenced you with its power; you cowered in her mere presence. \u201cGood, maybe now you can learn. Let me set a few ground rules. Never speak unless I tell you to; you are to always refer to me as Goddess Sarah (First Name) or Goddess Harris. Whichever name you prefer. And lastly, you will do everything I say without question. Is that clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Ye-\u201cYou cut yourself off as Ms. Harris squeezed her fingers together, making you scream in pain. \u201cWhat did I <i>just</i> say slave?!\u201d You remembered the first rule and nodded weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026now we have a few minutes before the students will arrive so I\u2019ll give you a brief task to start you off.\u201d She gestured to a spilt egg on the floor, \u201cOne of my students dropped that and never cleaned it up. That will be your job.\u201d She set you on the floor beside it, keeping herself right there to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you looked back to your temporary Goddess, face to face with her heels. Following them up you soon saw the black nylons, the cooking apron over a skirt, and a busty blouse. Goddess Sarah was certainly a beauty; you couldn\u2019t believe she just so suddenly made you a slave. It seemed so\u2026<i>wrong</i>. Then again women seemed to love doing that around you, you sighed sadly. The Goddess before you stomped a foot, \u201cI\u2019d start if I were you. Otherwise my foot might wind up on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn\u2019t need any more persuasion; you ran up the egg half your size and motioned to pick it up. Ms. Harris interrupted again, \u201cNot that way slave! You\u2019re supposed to eat it! That student put hard work into his dish, the least you can do is appreciate his effort.\u201d You sighed, but it wasn\u2019t anything that new in your life. You started eating the egg off the floor. Thankfully it was a small one, and the floors weren\u2019t that dirty; you finished relatively quickly. Right as students were heard outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d The woman lifted you up again. \u201cBut it seems you still don\u2019t appreciate food, at least not the way it should be. That might be why you\u2019re such a slacker in my class.\u201d You rolled your eyes; smart enough to only do that and not speak back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026I\u2019ve figured out a good way for you to appreciate food and those who prepare it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your aunt lives with you for your \u201csafety\u201d, you attend part-time technical college, and you have a job at the local bakery. You feel safe. Everyone, from your sisters, to your girlfriend, to your coworkers has expressed intentions to devour or enslave you. Now that you are eighteen, you are no longer protected as you once were, and must try to survive by yourself as you try to make it on your own.<br>\r\nNotable Females:<br>\r\n\tMona: She is your sister, one part in a twin tandem.
