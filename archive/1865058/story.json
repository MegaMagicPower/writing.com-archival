It had taken some wheeling and dealing, and a small photo-op with a few local politicians and businessmen, but she and her friends were finally relaxing on Coco Beach. Of course, to keep the locals, and the money-spending tourists, happy, she and her friends were about half a mile away from the normal place that most people went to, and hidden from view by some cliffs- or at least, most of them were- there was no way that Butterflysaurus could keep his 250 foot height away from view. Also, Link was busy chasing some co-eds, and making up for twenty thousand, plus fifty, years of lost time- well, trying to. B.O.B., well, he wasn't causing much trouble, except for thinking that other peoples thoughts were his own, and being a little too much of a hugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope those two are staying out of trouble,\" she said, as she looked at her other friend, Dr. Cockroach. Of course, the half-man half-cockroach scientist was tinkering away with something, as usual. \"What are you working on this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that Gallaxhar was able to shrink you down to normal size right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I remember that quite well,\" Susan said as she turned on her side, so that she could look at her friend more easily, and tan more evenly. \"He extracted the quantonium that was within my body to do it. Only problem was that my hair didn't go back to brown, plus he used the quantonium to produce clones of himself to try and take over the world. Got the element, and my abilities, back when I let the orb fall on me after I destroyed the statue that was holding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you know, General Monger had his men gather the wreckage, so that the scientists back at the Base can study it, and perhaps build defenses against other potential alien threats,\" Dr. Cockroach said with a grin. \"The good General has allowed me to work with the scientists, though I do have to let them in on anything I find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, what have you found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out how he managed to extract the quantonium, and I've managed to replicate the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you replicate the process? You haven't shrunk me yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I did use one of the hairs that get pulled out when you brush your hair,\" Dr. Cockroach said, as he pulled a foot long piece of hair from one of the pockets in his lab coat. Susan leaned closer to take a better look at it- it was brown, her original hair color- that hadn't happened when Gallaxhar had shrunk her. \"There is no trace of quantonium at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just incredible,\" Susan said with a smile. \"Of course, you do realize that I'm alright with my size now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and that's why I'm making some modifications to Gallaxhar's process,\" Dr. Cockroach said. \"Muhaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, right. Still working on that,\" Dr. Cockroach chuckled slightly. \"Like I said, I've made some modifications- instead of extracting the quantonium, this machine will instead concentrate it, so that you will be able to shrink yourself to normal-size, or even smaller, say the size of a fly, and so that you will be able to grow to the size of Butterflysaurus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, why would you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the extra size would make you stronger. The smaller size would help you with small places,\" Dr. Cockroach said with a smile. \"After all, spending time with your parents would be more easier if you were more normal sized, like me, Link, and B.O.B..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that it would be,\" Susan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it will help you to get a new boyfriend more easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blushed- her size had indeed put off plenty of men, though the military detail that had been with her on the few times she had had a date had done a number to a few as well, as had the sight of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that would be a help there to,\" she said. \"I mean, it's true that there are indeed those who are into big women, even those interested in giant-sized women, like macrophilias, but when they see the real thing, they tend to want to leave, and be with someone more their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, a young woman such as yourself has certain <i>needs</i> and <i>wants</i>,\" the Doctor chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, sometimes you long for a certain type of intimacy, but you're afraid of hurting someone due to your size, and I don't mean just giving someone a hug and a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, there is that,\" Susan said with a slight chuckle. \"Been a while since I've done that, at least a few weeks before I was turned into a giantess. It was fun when me and Derick did it- though he always made sure that we both used protection. He didn't want someone to get wind of some scandal involving him- though we were engaged at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever feel the need, there is someone who'd be more than able to assist you with that issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about Link? He has been hitting on me more often lately, though he's been doing that with most of the other women at the base under the age of thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not Link, though if you wanted him I'm sure he'd be more more than willing, and able, to help you out with that. Actually, I was referring to someone else.\" The half-cockroach half-man then turned back to his machine, and started tinkering with it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean, you're interested in me in that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else,\" Dr. Cockroach chuckled. \"B.O.B.'s got the mind of a child, and it's not like there's any other humanoid male monsters at the base besides me and Link- and while Link sees you as a good friend, he doesn't know if it could be possible that way between you and him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that you are old enough to be my grandfather, and then some, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true that I'm almost eighty years old- however, thanks to my cockroach DNA, I have the body of a thirty year old man, and I'll be honest, it does have certain urges, beyond the need to eat garbage,\" Dr. Cockroach turned to face Susan again. \"Besides, as I've said before, and as you know for yourself, from when we first met, you can't crush a Cockroach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to think about that,\" Susan said. She then kissed one of her fingers and touched the Doctor's lips with it. \"Thanks for the offer though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" the Doctor said, turning back to his tinkering, trying to hide his shuffling feet by moving around the device. <i>It wasn't a kiss,</i> he thought. <i>But, considering her size, it will do for now.</i> He then licked his lips, as if he was busy thinking about something. <i>Her saliva has an interesting taste- like a mixture of roses and slightly over-ripened apples, but even better than that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, besides this shrinking device, are you working on anything else?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am working on one that can turn my body into that of a human, and allow me to change into this one if need be,\" the Doctor said. \"It would make things more easier- I wouldn't get chased out of a place that was worried they'd be fined for health violations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that would be good,\" Susan said as she laid down on her front. \"Especially if you and I ever went out on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled.  \"Very true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then-</span></div></div>",

Is is lobsters? I'm quite partial to those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No luck on the overgrown crayfish, but there is a 20-foot great white shark with your name on it,\" the General chuckled. \"The thing was menacing some of the female surfers, so I decided to wrestle it- I would have won but Link swam in front of it- gave the poor thing a heart attack. Needless to say, that's the main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not into shark meat much,\" Susan chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem- more for me and the others then,\" Monger laughed. \"I'll have a chat with one of the fishing boats- yellowfin tuna school around here, and I know very well you don't mind eating tuna- I'll see that it's cooked several different ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General then ran towards the water and dived in, swimming away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it has been a while since I've had shark meat,\" Dr. Cockroach said. \"One had died at a nearby sea life aquarium. Monger had his contacts buy the body for 'scientific testing', though it was really to be Link's meal- he was partial to that type of shark at the time. Problem was, when it had been delivered to the base, it had aged a bit. As a result, I got to eat it- it was interesting to say the least, lots of flavors, plus there was several different objects in its stomach, like this one leather boot- very tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan chuckled. \"How about you get to work on your machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cockroach smiled.</span></div></div>",

Just like the general had said, there was a twenty-foot long Great White shark being cooked over several fires. It had been cut up for easier management, and was being cooked in several ways. There was also plenty of tuna being cooked, also in a variety of ways. There was fish being grilled, fried, baked, stewed, poached, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food looks quite lovely,\" Dr. Cockroach said as the two of them walked around. \"And the shark looks exquisite- wouldn't be too surprised if Monger and Link posed with it before they had it cut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen the movie <i>Jaws</i> before, and a few of it's sequels,\" Susan said, shuddering as she looked at the shark's head, which the General and Link were standing by, and having their picture taken. \"I couldn't go swimming for a few months, not even in the creek near my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt you'd have much to worry from them anyways,\" Dr. Cockroach said. \"They don't normally bother humans, and prefer seals and large fish, like tuna. Most attacks on humans are believed to be a result of mistaken identification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've studied sharks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much to do at the base beyond reading and watching movies,\" the doctor said. \"I'd probably hold more than a few degrees in various fields of biology, robotics, and more, if I were to take tests for their equivalency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've also tried to use what you know to escape,\" the general said, as he walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, don't mention it,\" the doctor chuckled. \"I mean, it wasn't easy to get some of the needed items. Even then, it didn't work out the way I wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doc accidentally gave B.O.B. the ability to read minds,\" Monger said, with a chuckle. \"Certainly made that Tuesday interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but sadly, the isotope was dissolved by him,\" the doctor said with a nervous chuckle. \"None of us got our freedom that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you had been able to make it, you wouldn't have met me, and we wouldn't have saved the world,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cockroach smiled. \"There is that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something going on between the two of you?\" Monger asked, looking at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Dr. Cockroach said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sort of starting to work on it,\" Susan blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regulations frown upon certain types of relationships between fellow soldiers, especially sexual ones,\" Monger said. Then he chuckled. \"But you're not soldiers, and that regulation wouldn't be for you anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave you the idea we were going to do something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonger chuckled. \"I'm ninety years old- I know plenty of things. Just be careful when you do it- I don't want to hire a gynecologist to help you out if something happens during the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time,\" the general said, as he walked over to a communications officer, who was beckoning him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get to having some fun,\" Dr. Cockroach said with a chuckle.</span></div></div>",

I'll make you guys my Best Men, though Susan can be my Best Lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll think about that,\" Dr. Cockroach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked closely at the picture. \"Wait a minute- that's Molly Vinta, heir to the Vintage Winery fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Derek chuckled. \"And half of it will be mine when her parents die- hopefully of natural causes of course. Five hundred million dollars has a nice ring to it- though one does have to account for future inflation, and further acquisitions. Probably be worth at least seven hundred fifty million in a few decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cockroach scoffed. \"Susan gets two billion per year to use for her needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two billion?\" Susan asked. \"How come I've never seen this money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've been managing it,\" said Monger. \"How do you think I've manage to get you the food and clothing you need during your stay? It's not like we use Food Stamps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said Link. \"We've been talking to him into seeing about getting us some Walking Around money to use when we're out in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully that will come from the money they used to use to keep us locked up at the Base,\" said Dr. Cockroach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've been working on that with the bean counters,\" said Monger. \"They are worse at giving out money than the IRS- won't even think about giving any without thirty forms signed in triplicate on each of their respective desks, and another five hundred per person to finalize the details, and a bunch more to actually hand out the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that matters,\" said Derek. \"At least I don't need to worry about her destroying the church on our wedding day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan groaned. No one would live that day down.</span></div></div>",

It vanished from view as it landed a few blocks away, hidden by the USA-style skyscrapers. \"<u>There'd better be at least a dozen soldiers in that thing.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, he saw a military-looking man sticking their head out from behind the corner of an office building. \"<u>Looks like you've got a dozen men trained on you,</u>\" came the man's voice. \"<u>We'll get you and the hostages out of there in just a moment.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>How many men do you have with you?</u>\" Rico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>With the exception of my pilot, and including myself, you've got five friendlies with you,</u>\" the man said. \"<u>Had to leave the really big guy behind.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Your men had better be very good at their jobs then,</u>\" Rico shouted. \"<u>There's at least fifteen of them, along with over a dozen hostages, and throw in the fact that I'm almost out of ammo.</u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the man took off running towards him, bullets hitting just behind him. \"Ye Ha!\" the man shouted as he skidded to a stop beside Rico. \"That's the most lead I've seen fly by me since my days of storming beaches in the Pacific!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Don't even bother translating,</u>\" Rico muttered. \"<u>Stupid American.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>It wasn't stupid,</u>\" said the man. \"<u>That was Phase One of my plan- Initial Distraction. While we're busy jawing, and getting shot at, Phase Two is underway- Through the Sewers- three of my men are using them to get to the restroom of that bank. Once they get into position, they'll contact me, and that's when Phase Three comes into play- Big Distraction- you might say my final man, or should I say woman, has a tank- forces our friends in there to shoot at her. While that's underway, the others will come through the bathroom, and take those bastards by surprise.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Are you sure your plan will work?</u>\" Rico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed. \"<u>I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it could work- might not work out the way I'd like it, but that's why I also formulated a backup plan- just in case.</u>\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After saving the Earth from an alien invasion, not to mention some nasty vegetables, the Monsters, Susan Murphy/Ginormica, the Missing Link, B.O.B., and Dr. Cockroach, (as well as Butterflysaurus) decide to take a break and have some fun on a beach someplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan is wearing an extra-extra-extra large sized bikini- courtesy of a certain top secret section of the military run by General W.R. Monger, and is catching up on her tan. Wouldn't mind getting herself a new boyfriend, but, in spite of her friendly disposition, her large size, and her strange friends, tend to put most men off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink is currently in the ocean, chasing after some co-eds who are water skiing, or was that a pretty mermaid he mentioned he'd be chasing? It was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.O.B., well, he's being B.O.B., thinking that other peoples' thoughts are his own, and probably causing some trouble with the local chemical plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cockroach is currently working on a few machines, one that can transform him between his cockroach form and a human one, and another that can cause Susan to change her size, so that she can be a normal-sized person when she wants to and a giantess when greater strength is needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterflysaurus is well, being an oversized butterfly, and is probably causing problems hovering around a nearby power plant, or a stadium with bright lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their vacation gets cut short when General W.R. Monger shows up with some big news- he has another mission for them. This mission could range from a rogue monster attacking a city, Gallaxhar showing up for revenge, a natural/unnatural disaster affecting some city, or some lame photo-shoot being held to make sure that Area 50-(whatever it's called) gets its funding from Congress, or anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules:<br>\r\n1.  Try to keep the characters in character- as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The level is to be 13+, so if the Monsters get into a fight with someone, little to no gore, and try to make deaths ambiguous- (meaning that there is a chance that the person actually survived), or not shown- such as when the giant robot attacked the US military or when the spaceship blew up- there had to be some deaths but they weren't shown, with the exception of a couple of alien clones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Comedy and humor (plus some mild crude humor) is recommended- this is based off of a DreamWorks movie after all, and they are well known for being comedies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The other monsters that the Monsters encounter might be friendly, but be either pranksters or accident-prone, or they might be evil, or someplace in-between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Spelling and Grammar are a must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Story is to be told in 3rd person point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Wikipedia link see <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_vs._Aliens\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_vs._Aliens</a> <br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://monstersvsaliens.wikia.com/wiki/Monsters_Vs._Aliens_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://monstersvsaliens.wikia.com/wiki/Monsters_Vs._Aliens_Wiki</a></td>",
