The area around you densely forested with various pines and you remain hidden with the other 14 men in your black attire. Knowing what must be done you prepare your defensive spells for the coming attack. <i>'O.K., mainly fire users and must protect from physical attack... water, earth and iron should work for this, good thing they taught me these spells or I'd be useless... now they where... Stagnum Tholus, Terrestris Maceria, and Strictura Callum... yes, those should keep everyone alive.</i> Since you are a recruit wizard from the small trading town of Parcel, they have you forced in the back of the group to cast protection spells on the attacking militia, the spells which were forced into your mind quite harshly. The other soldiers\u2019 fantastic tales of slaughtering dragons did not help to sway your mood either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you approach the target, the entire group moving quickly, yet without noise. They all were apparently well trained with no aid from a minor Illusion spell as you were. <i>'Any mage in his right mind should know this, bastard captain... not like I ever trained to be a wizard.\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, over here' Captain James Tumald signaled as he motioned over toward an entrance. You did not like this man; in fact, you would kill him if it would not condemn yourself for treason. This \"Captain\" is the one who forced you and your best friend, Felix Brombard, away to join this unholy war. You were the only two in your town to hold any reasonable potential for magical ability. Since the War began, it has become an increasingly difficult skill to find in the populace, as they were mostly involved with the war. You had nothing against dragons. They never hurt you, your family, or anyone you knew for that matter. They were honorable enough to keep their massacres of humans away from citizens and toward attacking soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it is not to say the dragons did not have losses of their own. The better wizards in the army's made sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you creep slowly toward a cave, you could not help but begin to feel uneasy about the attack. Not only had you sneaked far behind enemy lines to get to this location, but also there were not any dragons on watch, on the ground or in the air. Not a single flying beast. The feeling only increases as the Captain gave more hand signals and the entire group slowly surrounded the entrance, all with weapons at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, you heard a large crack on the ground. At first you quickly jerked away, frightened the captain would here, but he only kept moving <i>'duh... the spell, need to stop spooking myself'</i>. Relieved you looked down to find what it was that cracked. It was a hard almost rock like substance with a beautiful orange glow that made it shine in contrast to the moonlight. It looked as if it had been recently broken as pieces were scattered around a 6-foot diameter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn all too chilling realization crept into your mind. <i>'This is an eggshell... A DRAGON eggshell!\u2019 </i> You knew instantly from various books you read about their livelihood. However, if this was here than this is no military base... <i>'This was a nest!\u2019 </i> You stopped in your tracks breathless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though this was war, you could not sink so low as to help in the slaughter that was about to happen this day, but if you defied the orders of your leader you would be tried for treason and expelled from the army into poverty along with your family and maybe even exiled. Running could be possible to, but the consequences were even more severe if you were caught doing that. A decision had to be made, and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A.N. Stagnum Tholus means standing water dome, Terrestris Maceria means earthen wall and Strictura Callum means Mass of Iron Skin literally translated from Latin)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It went against everything you thought right, but you could not go against them with the threat they held on your family present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step you take into the cave you grow more and more anxious to a point where sweat is rippling down your back in large pools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tread deeper in the cavern until finally you end up at what you figure to be the back of the cave, though it being pitch black other than small flickering torches, you could not tell. There sat a lone egg, it looked completely black, but since there was not enough light you thought nothing of it. Just then, as you approached the egg, suddenly intrigued, a loud ear-shattering roar penetrated your ears. It was the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously protecting their young, two dragons appeared from the darkness of the cave. Both black in color just like the stone but much dimmer and one slightly larger than the other, most likely the male. They charged in for the attack directly at you. You stumble back in a freight and scramble to the back once again. The Captain turns quickly and yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Trent, get your head out of your ass, and cast the protection spells. Or do you think you could kill them yourself!\" The idea horrified you. Killing this family of dragons was not right. They have done nothing to you or the rest of the human world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, could you go up against the captains wishes and not cast your spells. If you cast them, you would spell certain doom for the unprepared family of dragons. These spells were the perfect counter for dragons... they would not stand a chance. However, if you do not, many men would die. Though none were too close to you, they were still fellow humans. Not to mention your family could also be in jeopardy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

God forgive me for this.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting little time, You began delving into your mind for the magical link all humans possessed but few were aware of. Grasping it within a few seconds you cross your arms with palms faced outward to easily channel the magic across a large area. Concentrating on your 14 fellow soldiers, you speak the necessary words to finalize the direction and form the magic would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STRICTURA CALLUM!\" Within seconds every soldier around you groaned in displeasure as your spell took effect. Starting from their feet and quickly working its way up their body's, the 'iron' solidified around them. Luckily they have practiced this once before and would not panic like in the first attempt. That did not completely calm them as the effect continued upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons reared their heads back in preparation to below their flames toward your group. Quickly delving back into your magical link you nearly scream the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TERRESTRIS MACERIA!\" As the flames leaped from the dragon's maw's, the earth in front of them suddenly rose with intense speed. Though it was a thin wall, that in combination with your first spell nearly drained you as you began to wobble in your stance. The rock wall that was created began to glow red and then white hot as the dragons continued to belch fire into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you do NOT break that black stone in the center. DO YOU HEAR ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir!\" everyone screamed in unison. <i>'Black stone?... Does he mean the egg? But why is that to be protected when we destroy everything else.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, after finishing your mental thought the wall crumbled in molten shards as the dragons charged through. As they were closing in they began to rear their heads back for a second volley of flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAGNUM THOLUS!\" you screamed. Water from the small pools around you quickly formed into a giant ball of water between your group and the dragons. The dragons halted slightly and ceased building their flames to stare directly at you. You felt something stab into your mind and heard a great booming pair of voices inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You have come...? We have waited long for you rider. Our only request is that you treat our son well.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?... How... who is this? What is a rider? What's going on?!'</i> The strange presence left your mind at that instant and the dragons finally released their flames into the water. Steam quickly billowed through the tunnel and blocked any sight that the already dim cave offered. You heard screaming as human and dragon alike traded blow after blow. You could not decipher who had the upper hand however as your vision blurred. The drain from the spells cast seemed to be to much to bear adding on the strange presence that entered your mind left you disorientated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally losing your balance, you fell hard on the rocky floor striking your head on the ground. All around you was blackness but the screams continued. They never ceased until one last garbled cry and then blissful silence.</span></div></div>",

You yelp and back away furiously until you can back away no more, up against the wall and still too weak to cast any magic. You prepare to meet death as the dragon lumbers up toward you. Your eyes close tightly and you hold your breath. Nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes again and see the dragon still staring at you. The dragon is smaller than normal, and seems calm, almost tranquil. The voice in your minds echoes through your thoughts. <i>'Awake, have you? Good. Sorry my poor human speech, it has been foreign to me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" You say. You feel like a rabbit under a hound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'My son cries to you, human. Take him up to guide you, you do.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What my mate means is that our son is to accompany you on travels,'</i> a rumbling voice behind you says. You turn your head and see the dragon that you guarded against in the tunnel. You shrink away from the huge beast. <i>'Fear not, little one. We know your heart and your reasons for defending the humans. We are sorry for your predicament. Be at peace.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice in your head agrees. 'Chosen you our son.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son? The egg?\" Both dragon's heads dip in very long nods. \"Chose me?\" More nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The war against the humans drags on. All of the dragons wish for an end, but the human royalty wants to eradicate us. You though, have the power to end this struggle'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean? How could I do that?\" You ask. You then realize that it'll be hard to deny these huge beasts their request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'We will not make you, but it is in your best interest,'</i> The big dragon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you says that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'We know of Human culture. If you return without finishing your task, you will be branded a traitor and executed.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'To finish task, kill us you'd doing,'</i> the voice in your mind says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" You say. The big dragon drops the egg upon the ground near you, and then moves to allow you to exit unhampered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make your choice, human. We will hold nothing against you. Choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your head, you hear a tiny squeak. It sounds like a baby bird.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk forwards to touch the egg, shining innocently in the background, slowly. It seems to be causing all these conflicting emotions. When have humans ever trusted Dragons? What would happen if you returned to base now with an egg? What would happen to your family if this mission, your first mission, was incomplete? And what would happen to you if you failed on the first task they gave you, would they kick you out and leave you - or execute you for knowing too much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this however, took a back seat in your mind as you edged ever closer, one shaking foot following the other. Instinct working against your better judgment and hand stretched out to touch the strange surface of the shell. It looked less fragile than other shells you'd seen, hard and shiny black. Like the dragons eyes. Looking dark and pensive as though you could dive into them and never reach the bottom or the truth, as if depth was all that made them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, you could see your shimmering reflection peering out at the dark shell. Your own bright eyes staring back at you nervously, but beneath the fear was grit, and a steadily hardening determination as your bring out your courage. At this image the squeak sounded again, louder and more excited this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached forward to close the last inches between your fingertips and the surface of the egg. Instinctively you retracted from the cool touch and looked around at the two larger dragons who's faces seemed almost kind if you could prevent yourself from seeing the generations of burnt in imagery of angry dragons and fierce talons. The smaller of the two nodded.<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, he wont hurt you.\" she smiled and her black eyes warmed with a flush of emotion. Reassured you turned and placed your full palm on the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your first thought. The egg was smooth and solid, but beneath it you could feel the hollow echos and reverberations of movement. The squeaking began again, fast and flurried that told you of an excited fervor. One which you could empathize with well, as you too felt the cool sensation on your palm you could feel a small pull in your mind, and placed your other hand on it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hand felt warm and a tingling sensation ran up your arm with the heat as it spread, the surface here was so warm in comparison to the other that you almost fell backwards in shock, but for some reason - you couldn't quite bring yourself to remove your palms. The pull of the sensation was too strong as the contrasting heats traveled up your limbs, filling you up with the characteristics of hot and cold, serene calm on one hand, (literally) and fiery excitement on the other. As the two feelings neared each other you began to sense the edges of them and realized that you could bend the force, if you wished you could push it out of you, or you could let it collide. Knowing what you had to do because of the pull you allowed them to inch further and further together before they met in your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was unexplainable, shots of heat spiked through your cold right side, and shots of cold through the left. Layer upon layer of ice and fire replaced your organs, your skin, your body and you felt merely like two forces magnetized together. Body shaking but hands glued resolutely to the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long you stood there convulsing small vibrations you do not know, but when you opened your eyes the two elder dragons had left, and you were led on the floor, your hands still tingling from the aftereffects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shell was cracked and broken. It must have hatched during whatever happened. You realized quickly that with the parents gone you were now left alone in a cave with a new born dragon, probably hungry, and definitely dangerous. But what could you do? His parents had gone, they said you were his rider, and your connection through and outside the shell had been so strong that you were sure there was some truth in his \"choice\" of you. All of the thoughts and worries you had were still there, Where had the rest of the team gone? Would they think him dead? What would they do with his parents if that was the case? Yet they were overshadowed by one thought. Here, in this cave, was a baby with no mother. No caretaker. Totally alone.<br>\r\nAnd with that thought there was a hopeful squeak in his mind.</span></div></div>",

With much effort, you open your eyes and see the captain glaring at you. This is not the first thing you want to see when you wake up, but you have no choice, so you push yourself into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogers and Clavic were killed by those monsters because of your weakness. Why they sent a boy for this job I'll never know, but there lives are still on your head. Think of that while we head to camp for your punishment.\", the captain says to you, \"When we reach camp, you will know what will be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the surviving soldiers- you never bothered to learn their names- haul you up by your arms and, without looking at you, march forward. The rest of the group won't meet your eyes as they march forward out the cave. You are now the last one still in the cave and you can tell the rest of the group doesn't care if you follow or not. For a few minutes, you consider just staying until more dragons come to kill you, but your will to live is too strong. Slowly, feeling ashamed and confused, you make your way to the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get out of the cave, you're tackled from behind. You hear a snarl next to your right ear. You freeze as you hear a furious sound in your mind. Turning towards it, startled, you see a smaller version of the two dragons that were killed charging toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that warning, the mind rips into your own and overwhelming rage and grief pour over you. Without the dragon telling you, you know that this is only half of what it is feeling. Then you feel a hesitation. The dragon suddenly tries to pull out of your mind, but it's too late. You can tell it's trying to fight something, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this must be what the group was after, a large amount of grief swamps over you. Feeling you owe it an explination, even if it can't understand, you bring up your memories of being drafted, of trying to stop the captain from the slaughter, the young dragon's parents' last words. Finally you try and speak to it mentally much like it's parents did to you. <i>\"My name is Trent Godfrey.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you recounted the memories to it, the dragon slowly began to calm down, though refused to meet your gaze. At the end, it nodded. Assuming that meant it believed you, it then began to walk toward you, finally lifting it's gaze to your eyes. Never before have you seen such an amazing shade of black. They seemed to hold vast knowledge beyond what it should have been capable of. Suddenly it flared it's small wings outward and jumped for your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, you wonder what that means before a pain explodes on the back of your neck as it makes contact and for the second time, you black out.<br>\r\n***********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you wake up on your own and find that you are not in the cave any more, because you can see the stars. Before you can even wonder where you are, The dragonling's makes its presence known in your mind by showing you pictures of where you have been. You assumed you were close to camp by now. It seems you were right in assuming what your group was after. Though why was still a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you find yourself inside a carriage being carried, no doubt, by the militia. Thinking of what to do next, you decide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though unnerved by this action, you had little time to ponder why as the captain noticed your newest action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRAITOR! You son of a bitch i knew you would only be trouble! Men forget the dragons and the stone, Kill the wizard boy before that spell completes!\" While giving his latest speech your spell began it's work up your body. the \"metal\" that weaved it's way up felt mildly like grating rocks moving perfectly along the contours of your skin. Just as the first man came at you to swing his sword down on your torso, the spell completed and when the swing came, a resounding ting and blunt pain in your side was all that followed it as the sword broke in half. The man who swung obviously did not expect this and the amount of force he used was to great as the sword broke in half sending the broken shaft from his hands into the face of another. \"Damn it! Forget him focus on the dragons, he can't attack anyway. Defense is all he's good for. Focus on the dragons and we will deal with him later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis plan did not go well however as it seemed that the captain missed the fact that you also cast the spell on the dragons. The first sword struck with the same resounding ting as the one that hit you but this soldier held onto his blade long enough to be severed in two by the large dragon he foolishly attacked. The men did not have a chance. One struck down right after the other as the captain stood back looking for an opening in this new defense. Seeing him watching his own men die without a flinch sent a new found rage inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Tumald!\" he quickly glance over toward you with a rage you have never seen before. It seemed as if everything about this man focused on his goal and once it could not be reached he lost control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... I should have killed you the moment he made me take you. Curse his damn stories of old, I will kill you now like i should have earlier.\" He began to scream a battle charge as he ran toward you. the crazed hateful look in his eye only building as he came closer. You however, had other plans. rubbing your side slightly where the first sword struck, you speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you Captain,\" You lifted your left arm to face your palm directed toward his feet. \"defensive magic is not used for just defense as you hoped...\" delving into your magical link once more you scream the words that have wanted to for so long to end this mans existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TERRISTRIS MACERIA!\" The captain continued to run, undaunted by your threat. he raised his sword arm high in the air to bring it down with enough force to cut through a tree. But before he could complete the swing, the earth shifted beneath him and rose in a pillar directly between his legs. Unleashing a guttural scream he flew upwards with the wall being slammed into the ceiling and finally being split in two from the force of the collision. Even through all that he never released his sword and the crazed look never left his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last exertion tool quite a lot out of you however. Terristris Maceria was meant to be spread out to create a wall not a pillar and condensing magical energy to do this was no easy feet. Your previous \"metallic\" spell faded with your strength. The two remaining soldiers saw this and sprinted toward you with new found conviction. Looking toward them you knew the end was near and fell backward on the stone as you watched them come in for the final slash. As they neared however, You heard a large roar and the men faltered slightly and looked in it's direction. The smaller of the two dragons leaped out and crushed the first under it's talons. The second fell backward and attempted to run but was instead greeted by the second dragon giving him a parting gift of flames directly into his helmet. He was not even able to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your vision blur you laughed at the irony of it all. The dragons that you saved would more than likely kill you as well. As they neared you knew it to be true as they lowered their heads toward you. You closed your eyes and awaited the end. Instead you were forced up on your feet by their snouts which felt as if it had five or so snake skins overlapped onto it. Throwing them a confused look you only received a feeling of vertigo as the larger one picked you up and moved you toward the inside of the cave. Panicking slightly you started to flail around in his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Calm yourself rider, we mean you no harm.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What... wh... who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You may call me Ramses and my mate here is known as Drasna.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is happening? Where are you taking me? How are you speaking to me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To many questions to answer now, for now you must sleep.

Curious at the quick change of attitude from the giant, you listen closely to what he would say next. It seemed the tiny deep orange dragon had other plans however. The 2 foot tall baby dragon still staring at you pounces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt it takes you down to the ground settling on top of you.

You are acutely aware of the huge head inches from your own, the scales as black as the deepest pit. His jaws parted slightly to reveal wickedly sharp teeth as long as your middle finger.  Fear should have risen within you but you had no doubt in your mind that this creature would cause you no harm. His breath warmed your face as he spoke. <i> \"And that is why you are a rider.\" </i> He said softly. <i> \"You could not go against what you knew to be right. Any other would have aided his fellow man, even though it repelled him, for I sense that the consequenses of doing otherwise would be dire indeed. Yet, you did not. That, little human, is rare.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamses pulled back and gazed at you from twin dark pools of eyes. <i> \"There is honour in what you did and a respect that is not begrudged. For the first time in a thousand years dragonkind offers you, a human, this choice for I tell you now, you are dragon kin indeed.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you felt a tension build, a yearning for action, a need to be complete. You feel a power rising around you, pulsing to a strange beat. The power is almost palpable, barely held in check by something outwith your field of knowledge. You know within yourself that whatever decision you make will have momentous consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"I will tell you what it means to be a rider. It means that you bond to a dragon. From that moment forward, your lives are entwined and only death will sever that link. You will grow together, strengthen one another, become something stronger, smarter and more capable than either of you could have been alone. Together, you are greater than the sum of your parts. Together you are one of the most powerful forces to move upon the face of this world. Together you may be able to stop this terrible slaughter. I offer you this great honour at the time of our greatest need for if something is not done soon, this world will tear itself apart. Only one with the highest moral calibre can be considered. Only one who would do 'what is right' no matter what the consequenses.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge dragon turned it's head from you and sighed deeply. <i> \"You have my word that if you turn this offer down, you may walk free from this place without persecution.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A decision that proved impossible weighed before you. As the fighting began, you could only watch in horror as your group of fourteen men went into battle with the two lone dragons, without your protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, Damn it all! men, forget orders and destroy all you see. Forget about the damn stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What? Stone... do they mean the egg?\u2019 </i> Not much time to ponder the question, the dragon pair soon ran down upon your group. The dragons obviously had much more strength than the humans did and because they were protecting their little one, they were all the more dangerous. The humans however had numbers on their side however much it helped against two full-grown dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the dragons seemed to be winning with their sheer power as they slashed through the first two victims in one fell swipe. The tides quickly turned however, to your surprise, and the last attack left them open at the rear that which quickly did five men flank. <i>'They are more skilled than i thought...'</i> The family seeing this attempted to hit them with their tails but only struck three as the others jumped to their backs and tried to slash at their spines. A quick jump jarred the attackers off and the fight resumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realized that through the chaos, the egg was completely vulnerable and nearly crushed more than you would have wanted. Knowing that if you could save someone, it would have to be the young, you quickly readied your most powerful defensive spell, Strictura Callum. However, this would not be the case as when you delved into the magical energy you felt a strange presence enter your mind. Having no time to ponder what was happening you threw your arms palm outward toward the egg and nearly screamed out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INVIUS OBMOLIOR!\" A dim, rainbow colored impenetrable orb soon circled around it and protected it just before one of the men fell right onto it by the power of the dragons. The dragon gave you the slightest glance than quickly went back to the fight. Though it was strange that they did this, it was not you concern now. The egg had to be protected at all costs, even if it was the \"enemy.\" For some reason you could not bear to see it be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the men were losing numbers, the dragons were tiring with many gashes and cuts in their wings, head, and abdomen. Of the fourteen men, only three remained, including the Captain to your dismay. Surprisingly their moral had not faltered in the least even though more than three quarters of the group rested eternally on the cave floor. The dragons, in their weakened state, gave the men a small advantage. The two others quickly overtook the female and while she unleashed a powerful blast of flame onto one, rendering him no more than a pile of ash, the other rushed in and sliced through her neck, severing the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male seeing this became mad with rage and quickly bit the killer in half, but in his blind rage, he left himself open and the Captain stabbed him in the heart through a week spot above his shoulder. With his last moments in life, he quickly turned to his own killer and opened his giant maw. Before he bit into the flesh, the captain seemed to sigh outward. \"I never should have trusted that bastard...\" And the dragon bit him directly in half, throwing both halves aside. The Dragon then gave a glance at his young, the egg, and then looked at you with sorrowful eyes. A voice then ran through your head. <i>\"Though you are a human, you still protected our young even as we tried to kill your fellow companions, I thank you... \"</i> 'It was the Dragon! But... but how?' <i>\"I am no longer able to protect him so I put him in your caring hands... rider...\"</i> and with that he took his last breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaffled by the dragon speaking in your thoughts and even more so he entrusted you, a human, with his young, you took the time to gaze at the carnage around you. This was a complete slaughter. No one left alive, save yourself. You could not save anyone, human or dragon. The emotions running through you were too vast to control. Hate, sorrow, pity, but worst of all, weakness. Overcome with emotion, you could do nothing but stare. It did not take long for the smell of burnt flesh to have an effect and you curled over and threw the remains of your pre-battle meal over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a period and your stomach drained its contents, you looked at the egg that you protected and thought of what the Father had said. <i>Why did he call me rider? </i> You thought for an answer but found none. Throwing it off to dragon custom, you set your mind and returned to the previous topic. If you took the egg you would be fulfilling the last wish of its father, but taking it and then raising it... could prove to be a worse fate than your draft into the army. You could not parade around human villages with a dragon. It would only get you and the dragon executed. It would be self-exile. If you did go back with it, you would have to turn to hiding, but you would eventually be found out. Things this big always have nasty habits of grabbing attention in some way or another. Nevertheless, leaving it there would only make you feel even worse. Not only had you aided in the killing of its parents to an extent, you would leave the egg their all alone only for it to hatch at the sight of the carnage before you now. <i>'It would not survive a week...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to choose...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't perceive where this thought could have came from, but you did not care anymore as the egg was far more precious than anything in the world to you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the egg, you were relieved to see that the strange spell had worked perfectly. Not even a speck of dust had grazed the beautiful shell, which while you played it off to the darkness of the cave, was in fact black. No that was to simple of a word for the color you were witnessing. It shined in the moonlight with such a beautiful glow, it could easily pass off as a incredibly large opal stone. <i>'I wonder what happened back there... Those words I said...

You started walking more cautiously than before and again heard the squeaking.<i>''What the hell is that? It sounds so close yet I don't see anything.'</i> you wondered, setting the egg down trying to get a better look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the squeak came but this time so did another noise. Rocks moving around the ground, very close to you. Quickly turning toward the noise you notice the egg wobbling slightly.<i> 'No... it can't be this close to hatching already can it? What am I supposed to do if it hatches? It could attack me!'</i> Just then the squeak came louder and you noticed a crack in the shell. Fearing the worst you stumbled backward and began crawling slowly away extremely cautious of the emerging creature. Soon the crack bobbed up and down as if on a top and finally fell to the ground revealing a opal nose matching that of the shell. It did not take long for the rest of the shell to come off the small creature. It stumbled along the ground looking weakly at its surroundings. You had a slight twinge of fear but that was rapidly vanishing as you stared at the small dragon-ling. Having finished its first look around the beginning of the cave it looks toward you and quickly locks with your eyes once you are in its sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could something so beautiful be as dangerous as people say. They are intelligent enough to speak and even hold their own royal family in the deep recesses of Sulu. This reason made you wonder how the war was even started, but you quickly withdrew that from your mind as you once again concentrated on the majesty that stood before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly moved your hand toward it, not wanting to frighten it, it moved it's head toward you, Almost eagerly. As you got closer you felt something strange. Like a continuous breeze of cool air on your face, It put you at ease. When you finally touched it's forehead, You were completely immersed<br>\r\n in this feeling from head to toe. As you moved your hand away the feeling receded only slightly. <i>'What was that? It felt good... I wonder if it has to do with this dragon... seems like the only thing it could be.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your thoughts, the little one began getting excited bobbing its little head up and down and swinging its tail around. You can only chuckle slightly at the newborns antics, that is until he leaped onto your lap and began lapping at your chin with a warm tongue, making you let out a small yelp in surprise.<i>'Damn It looked like it was going for my neck! He may be just born but im sure those teeth are still pretty damn sharp.'</i> Again as if hearing you in your thoughts the dragon stopped its licking and looked at you with sorrowful eyes shaking its head quickly and giving you what could only be described as a frown. <i>'Odd... I wonder if he can somehow read my expressions or something... he reacts to everything I do and think... wait think?! sigh... given the circumstances I don't think it would be wrong to think I'm completely insane.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain responding to your train of thought it rams you in the side waking you from your mind struggle. It looks at you roughly and you begin to see thoughts that aren't your own flow into your mind. Some confusion, but mainly happiness and a strange reassurance that this really was happening. <i>'Maybe... yes... I don't know what it is, but this little guy really is growing on me.'</i> Suddenly satisfied the newborn curls up onto your chest and slowly drifts into his first sleep outside his first home. Feeling the rhythm of his tiny heart you as well are soon lulled to sleep.   </span></div></div>",

Somehow, it knew what was happening, but you could not figure out how. The same Anxiety flew through your mind at that time and a wild thought came to you. <i>Was this emotion from the dragon?</i> You quickly brushed off the idea knowing it was insane but still kept the thought at the edge of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Reineer?\" you asked in a joking tone not expecting an answer. Though the dragon did not give you one verbally, he did shake his head quite strongly. <i>Wow, it understood me. Even at birth dragons can comprehend so much!</i> A rush then enveloped your mind, completely enveloping you. Instead of retreating or fighting back, you welcomed it. This feeling was calm and reassuring, as if the presence had the same feelings that you held for the dragon youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you bathed in the feeling in your mind, a crazy idea came to mind. <i>What if this was the dragon's doing, sending me these soothing images to calm me down.</i> Almost immediately after the thought vanished a wave of confirmation drove itself into your mind. \"You are indeed something special little one. Now back to your name,\" thinking hard only one name stuck for this Opal beauty. \"How about Thanatos?\" The wave of assurance entered your mind and the dragon jumped toward your face licking vigorously, obviously happy that it had a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then knew that you had to leave the cave and head somewhere safe to raise Thanatos well, and keep you both safe from harm. Your defensive spells may have been strong, but you had no training in attacking with them. Using unknown spells is something you knew not to try. Unless you knew exactly what to do with the spell, It could have random effects, worst of all backfiring in your face. You had to leave to somewhere safe but in your situation where could you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you went back home, the militia would question what happened at the cave unless you avoided them and if you did for long enough they would consider you a deserter and throw your family in prison as a way of paying for your deed. Also, Thanatos would most definitely grow at an alarming rate and would only make it more difficult to hide his presence. No this option was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other two both required you to leave the Human Territory and into the Dragons. You could travel To the Jupin wood across the Xanthen river. Once there, hope you are not seen so you could raise Thanatos peacefully. Also you could attempt to confront some dragons and request their aid. If they saw that you were unarmed, they would not kill you and you knew that Thanatos would be there to help out the situation also.</span></div></div>",

You began traveling West toward a nesting site you learned of on the point where Jupin wood and Sulu mountains meet. Though you might have to cross the Xanthen river, you knew there was no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled directly through the mountains as to avoid the border struggles that were all to common near this area. As you walked, you held Thanatos in your arms, ready to shield him from harm if there was any. He welcomed the protection and nuzzled your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger soon crept into your stomach and your thoughts. <i>Thanatos must be hungry to.</i> You may not have known strong attack spells, but you could still kill medium sized game. You picked up a couple stones about marble sized for ammunition and went stalking for game, setting Thanatos in a safe clearing. You tried to tell him to stay through your mind and after sending him images of his catch and him staying, he seemed to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you lived a mild city life, Your father still took you hunting, so if you ever needed to you would know how. Thanking your father's memory, you spotted a group of elk. Bigger than anything you had hoped to find, but welcomed your luck none the less. You grabbed one stone and grabbed the right spell from your mind. Once ready you cast it, \"Calx Missus!\", and the stone jumped from your hand and barreled toward your target. It struck it right through the heart and it did not get more than 10 feet before collapsing dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called Thanatos over to your location using your mind. Though doing this was knew to you, it was extremely simple and would only make your love for Thanatos stronger as you now relished every thought that came to his immature mind. He came quicker than expected and upon seeing the animal, dug his face into the meat and feasted. While he ate you started a fire and took a pan from your rucksack. <i>good thing the militia forces you to bring these.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished cooking your own meal, Thanatos finished his own feast. You were surprised at how much he could eat. A noise then startled you to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you Trent.\"</i> You knew where the noise came from. It had the same feeling as Thanatos's thoughts. You were surprised that he had learned so fast. Though he couldn't have a conversation with you yet, you would try to teach him until he could. Them meal done, you stripped the animal of what ever meat was left and preserved it in your sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled further West for 2 weeks hunting whenever necessary and finally came to the mouth of the river. To your good fortune you did not even have to cross the river, you could literally go around it. It seemed that the river began from a small spring here. It amazed you that the largest river in Shoven could start in such a small form. Relieved at your luck you began heading Southwest out of the mountains towards your destination. Hunting every other day, you never ran out of food and teaching Thanatos to speak proved to be easier than expected. In time, you could hold a conversation with him only pausing a few times to explain a certain difficult word. It took 9 more days to see the forest in the distance were the mountains ended. You decided to camp there and head to the forest tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A.N. Calx Missus translated literally means Stone shot.)</span></div></div>",

What should have been fear turned out to be joy. This would make contacting the dragons that much easier if they came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gem-like dragon swooped down in front of you with teeth bared. It would not attack you as you were unarmed, but it was happy to threaten you. Startled, Thanatos quickly jumped in between you and the dragon baring his own teeth in a feeble attempt to scare the mightier beast. Yet feeble as it was, the dragon stepped back obviously surprised to see a dragon defend a human. Voices then rang in your head, one you recognized as Thanatos, the other you assumed was the green dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why do you protect this human little one?! He would have you slaughtered in an instant!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wrong! Trent wouldn't hurt me or Dragons. He is a nice man and I love him. You will not hurt Trent.\"</i> The green dragon then lowered his stance and calmed down at the little ones words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you with a new awe, eyes wide as dinner plates, and his maw slightly open as if he had now looked at a god. It unsettled you slightly but you did not come here to be questioned. You needed to find a place to raise Thanatos properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you spoke up. \"I am Trent Godfrey of the Human city Parcel. I admit I was in the militia but not of my own free will. I was forced to join the ranks of a team sent to slaughter a family of dragons.\" You paused for a moment thinking how Thanatos would react to the truth, but he had to know someday. And now seemed to be as good a time as any. \"I am a defensive wizard and followed the group I was with defend them, not knowing their was a family inside.\" Thanatos eying you confused. \"Once I had realized it was a family cave, it was to late. The men began to attack but because I refused to be apart of the fight, I did not help. The dragon pair were outnumbered and there was a bloody fight. It was then I spotted a black egg and I just had to protect it from any harm.\" Thanatos, now realizing what you meant, had a grave look in his eyes but seemed to understand. It pained you when you saw him like that, yet you had to continue. \"The battle raged on and in the end the only survivors of the whole conflict were me, the egg, and it's father, but the latter only barely. In his last words, He told me to take the egg in as my own and care for it with all my heart. Shortly after...\" you choked on your words slightly \"Thanatos hatched and I have kept my word.\" At hearing this Thanatos was in shock. His parents were killed by a group that his new protector traveled with. Seeing this you could not help but feel torn inside, afraid that he would reject you and you would be alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is this true Trent?\" Thanatos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I am sorry I made you wait so long to hear the truth but know that I love you with all my heart and will never allow such a slaughter to take place ever again.\"</i> Thanatos did not speak again and the silence was the most painful thing you have ever felt in your life. Thanatos finally lifted his head toward you and said...</span></div></div>",

You could never harm a dragon again even without having said the oath.

You would take him back by force if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos quickly eased your mind from those thoughts reassuringly, <i>\"Don't worry Trent, They will believe you once I tell them what you did for me!.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enthusiastic voice put your mind at ease and, after Fenrir instructed you to pad your seating, he took off toward the forest.</span></div></div>",

The only thing that stopped them from chewing you in half was Fenrir's obvious status in the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What have you done Fenrir?! This creature has killed our young ones and yours if I am not mistaken! Why would you foul your family and bring them to our land!!!\"</i> This dragon, though moderately smaller than Fenrir, held power in the land probably equal to or just under him, or so you thought. His scales were bright red, so much so that they appeared to be blazing in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Leave Trent alone!\"</i> yelped Thanatos. It warmed your heart to see the lengths you both would go to for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Fenrir's voice <i>\"Listen to the little one Flamming, We must not cause any harm for the first rider in more than a millennium.\"</i> All were caught off guard as they heard these words, muttering to themselves in thought speech. Rider... you heard this somewhere before and whatever it was these dragons were not buying it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wait, the dragon in the cave called me that as well, what does it mean? What is a rider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please, there will be time for your questions later, right now I have a promise to keep.\" </i>replied Fenrir, now averting his attention to the dragons. <i>\"These two shall be staying with us until The little one has grown to a proper age of maturity. Give them quarters to stay in and treat BOTH of them as one of our own. Do I make myself clear?\"</i> A mixture of both rage and mild contempt came from their thoughts as they plodded off to meet their leaders demands. All except the red one, Flamming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed you down with relentless suspicion, smoke flaring from his nostrils. It seemed that no matter what you or Fenrir say will ease his hate for humans. Though he would comply to his wishes, for how long, you could not tell. Flamming seemed like a loose-cannon, ready to defy a higher-ups orders at any moment. The way Fenrir eyed him only confirmed that your assumption was true. You would have to watch him for awhile. Your thoughts went unnoticed by little Thanatos who could only eye the little bundle riding on Flamming's back as he stalked away. The small bundle was slightly larger than Thanatos was and was returning the curious gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of dragons came back relaying that they had the accommodations ready and with that took off quickly into the looming twilight. Fenrir guided you to your new home, It was basic at best with only one bed and a tub, both dragon sized and seemed to be molded seamlessly into the floor.<i> Well it may not be the most luxurious place to live, but I still have Thanatos for company and I would take that over anything.</i> As you lay on the bed, Thanatos crept in beside you and the two of you drifted into sleep.</span></div></div>",

You grimaced at the pain then moved your hands toward the pain to try to ease it. You let out a startled yelp when you realize your shoulder didn't hurt, it was the two hard stumps that newly came out of your back. Inspecting the bumps further you notice they are not covered in skin but instead thick scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more amazing is that the scales matched Thanatos's perfectly, the same dazzling opal color and shine. <i>Is this scaly substance going to cover me completely!</i> You sunk at the thought of never being able to appear before your family again. They would never accept you again, nor could you blame them. You looked closer and to your slight relief, they were not spreading but instead, growing outward, as if these objects had been inside you all along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think their cool looking.\"</i> Thanatos blurted. At least he would always accept you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough even with Thanatos's encouragement, you still needed answers. What were these stumps growing out of your back, and more importantly, what was a rider? Asking Fenrir was the only logical choice and besides, Thanatos was ready to explore the area and you would be hard pressed to try and keep him cooped up in the cave all day.

If they tried anything you could always defend yourself with spells until Fenrir came to break it up. Thanatos really wanted to explore the forest anyway and who were you to tell him he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped outside, you noticed that the cave you were just in was not a cave at all. It was the base of a mighty tree hundreds of feet high that had bulged at the bottom, creating a perfect space for a dragon home. You couldn't believe your eyes; these \"caves\" ware on almost every tree at every hight, as if they knew where to grow out for the dragons. Thanatos was just as bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How do the trees know where to grow?!\"</i> he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do I look like I know? I am as baffald as you little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that, It is getting annoying being called this instead of my true name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you can't blame them. To them you are pretty small.\"</i> He turned his head away irritated, and you had to stop yourself from bursting into a fit of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved from tree to tree in search of Fenrir, Thanatos flying above to check the higher dwellings, you heard the loud beating of dragon wings overhead. When you looked up to check for Fenrir, you only saw what looked like a burst of fire as Flamming landed next to you, teeth bared and followed by who you assumed to be his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that for?!!\" you screamed, falling backwards onto your new stubs, renewing the pain in them. Thanatos quickly flew in between you and Flamming with his own teeth bared, not seeming to notice the vast size difference. <i>\"Why do you protect this man!? Was he not the one who killed your parents!?\"</i> The accusation infuriated both you and to your surprise, Thanatos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Trent did not kill my parents!!! He protected me as my parents fought off the other men! My father trusted him with me in his last breath and I shall do the same. He has saved me once and I shall return the favor time and time again!\" The foreign dragon ling seemed awed by Thanatos's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then you are no better than him and therefor, no dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad Don't do it!\"</i> The little red dragon cried out to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stay out of this Blaze! Go home NOW!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened, the little one now known as Blaze quickly retreated a small distance but never left the scene dreading what his father was about to do. Flamming, recovering quickly from the family struggle, tilted his neck back, the flames on his scales shimmering even brighter. He was going to attack Thanatos! Did he hate Humans so much that he would go through his own kind to kill one? But there was no time to think about his reasoning. you had to do something </span></div></div>",

Quickly rushing in, you cast a basic spell to at least try to keep yourself alive and throw yourself in front of the coming flame, \"Parvus Pelta!\" pushing Thanatos out of the way in the progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fire erupted from Flamming's maw, you screamed in agony as the fire came upon your shield. Though you stopped the flames from reaching you, the heat could not be halted and your clothing soon burst into flames. You expected to burn to death but as soon as the fire rushed out of his mouth, Flamming stopped it immediately. You were still badly burned and soon blacked out from the pain. The last thing you saw was Thanatos standing over you, tears rushing down his tiny face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally came to, you were lying in a bed of soft leaves. Not much remained of your clothing as it had burned off in the heat and the stumps on your back were clearly showing. The burns were the worst pain you had ever felt in your life. The fire might as well have been still there. Looking closer you thanked the heavens that they were no worse than second degree but cursed them for the pain they still caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soothing liquid began pouring onto the burns,  removing much of the pain and healed all the burns to a small degree. The worst that were minor burns and blisters. You looked up to see the healer and it was none other than Fenrir holding a barrel in his maw tilting it to let some liquid heal the remainder of your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rose from bed, startling him. <i>\"Where is Thanatos?!?! Is he OK?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry rider, He is waiting for you outside.\" relieved you remembered why you came to see him in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fenrir, You keep calling me 'rider'. What is a rider anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose your people would not remember. Our peoples were once allies many years ago Trent. These alliances were only formed because of our pact with the riders of old, The Rector Draco, or Drecs as some called them. Ever since a betrayal within the Drecs, No rider has since then been seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, 'Drecs'? There is no such thing. Not even in legend is there any recollection of Rect... whatever they were called!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As there wouldn't be. The Betrayal took place over one thousand years ago.\"</i> Shocked at the last statement, you knew it could be nothing other than false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then what about now. Why are there no new 'Drecs' in the world. There are plenty of both races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the Betrayal the humans and dragons parted ways for all eternity and left These lands, or so we planned. They made a mistake and after leaving, never told anyone about what happened between the two races. All was fine until some 300 years ago when our races met again. Fearing the presence of these dangerous creatures, the humans where always wary of our presence. It only took one small mistake to break out this great 20 year war. Since the time of our separation, no new Rector Draco pact was made for what the humans have caused. Until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't be a Drec, I am only raising Thanatos, I am not controlling him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I both know that the connection you share with Thanatos is more than just friendly. Besides the proof is easily recognizable. Those 'wings' on your back will soon be full-size and look just like Thanatos's, as were all Dragoon pairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Wings?! I am going to grow wings?! And how could you know all this? You said yourself it happened over a thousand years ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is only one of the changes you will undergo. Your other questions must wait however. Sleep now, you have been through much and need to recover.\"</i> As he finished your mind seemed to obey his command as you could not keep your eyes open any longer and drifted into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A.N.

He thought it immensely fun to prod your stubby wings and unfortunately nothing would seem to shake him off from his 'fun'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard sound of wings soon erupted from outside. Knowing who it was you sat as upright as you could to better greet Fenrir. Only it wasn't Fenrir, but instead the once beautiful fire, now to you it looked as if the blaze would soon dissipate and die. Flamming had indeed looked better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos quickly jumped in between when Fenrir came in behind Flamming, gesturing toward your friend to move aside. He agreed, albeit reluctantly. Flamming eyed you with none of the fury he once had. Only shame filled his eyes now. His speech only emphasized his shame further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I acted as a fool. Blind in my rage toward your kind, I almost killed one of my own... I thank you for saving him and am sorry for my actions. What I have done is unforgivable...\"</i> He spoke in a hushed tone, nearly a ghost of his former self. More than likely because he had been relayed your so called \"Drec\" status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll forgive you. You were only thinking of your own people and their safety. Thanatos however is not as easy to convince. You will need to prove it with him I am afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaring his teeth slightly, he spoke up once again, \"Whatever I can do to make up for my travesty, I will do for you Thanatos, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see,</i> The young one stated bluntly, <i>\"We shall see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\"</i> and he began to stalk toward the doorway. Before he made it out however, his little one flew in through the window and began to speak, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry for what my dad did, he can be a bit aggressive sometimes but you get used...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLAZE! Get home before i take you there myself! Harshly!\"</i> Flamming roared nearly reclaiming his lost fury. With a quick yelp he flew back out the window but not before throwing a friendly nod toward Thanatos's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit stunned by this, you returned your gaze to Thanatos who held what you would suspect as the same expression as yours.</span></div></div>",

Either if it was out of respect of your rider status, that you risked your life to protect a fellow dragon, or for fear of what Fenrir would do to them if they tried something, you couldn't say. All in all you were relieved that you didn't have to worry about becoming flame broiled from behind anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken some time to get used to your winglets, especially when putting your clothing on. Thanatos still laughed at the thought of your expression when you found you could flap and flex them. <i>Well how was I supposed to know they worked, I thought them only for show.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been about a month and a half since you had rescued Thanatos and once again you noticed just how big he had gotten. Sure you heard stories about their quick growth, but this was insane! In less than half a year he had become nearly half your size. No doubt he would grow bigger seeing all the other dragons in the area. Fenrir explained that in their first year of life, a dragon undergoes a large growth spurt in which he will become about 9 feet tall in height. This lasts until his second year of life. The speed of growth then slows to about a foot a year then around the age of ten slows again to a foot every five years. Though the process continually slows with age, dragons continue to grow until the day they die. Judging Fenrir's hight at about 42 feet, according to him he would be about 100 years old, but probably even older since he said the process continues to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity you blurt out, \"So how old are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have passed 573 summers little one. How else would I hold such knowledge of the days of old.\"</i> Staggering back slightly you could not help but believe him. He knew to much about the past and his eyes looked as if they had seen much more than any could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if dragons can live that long, then will Thanatos be all alone when I'm gone...?\" You felt a shiver run down your spine that was not yours alone, but also from Thanatos's reaction to the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir let out a soft chuckle then turned to you both reassuringly and said, <i>\"No, no, you shall both be together as long as you both live, for a dragon gives his rider many gifts, a few being a dragon's worth of a lifetime and of coarse the wings you now have on your back.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you sighed a relief then comforted each other in your thoughts which was now second nature, almost along the lines of breathing. You couldn't live without air and you couldn't live without Thanatos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day talking with the local dragons and spending time with your life long friend.</span></div></div>",

Only a couple feet shorter than you. You raised Thanatos the best you could, with the help of Fenrir of coarse. After the scuffle with Flamming, Blaze began to visit quite often. At first this annoyed Thanatos to no end but after some time, they became quite friendly with each other. Though even with his new friendship, He never left your side for a second. He followed you everywhere and you did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day when you were practicing your magic, which seemed much easier since the... attack, you were pulled away by Thanatos, curiosity obviously brimming from his look. <i>\"I've been wondering Trent, can I use this... magic stuff?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared, amused by his curiosity, then said, <i>\"Well, why don't we find out shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find out?

NOW!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos's eyes shut hard, he was obviously concentrating on the leaf.

How are you supposed to protect yourself when you are casting a spell, hmmm? the enemy would see an opening and you would be easy prey!\"</i> You only shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So if you learned magic you could protect me then hmmm? What about yourself? You would also be an open target for them, and most likely you would be their main target anyways.

I made a promise with his father to protect him and that is what i will do.

Thanatos quietly nuzzled your arm which gave you the strength to continue the conversation.<i>\"And that is why I'm am now asking for your help. Will you train me Fenrir? I am not sure if you can but right now you are my best bet heh heh.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to mull over this, Fenrir lifted his gaze up toward the ceiling and pulled his right claw up to his upturned chin. Then, apparently done thinking, he turned and began out the doorway. You and Thanatos were struck down. <i>'what will we do now...'</i> you thought simultaneously. As you slumped in your chair, Fenrir used this moment to turn his head slightly and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Meet me in the open field in the center of the forest at noon tomarow. Make sure you eat a good meal, you'll need the energy. Both of you.\"</i> And he quickly took off leaving you and Thanatos sitting in a daze.

Dragons never seemed the type to be cooped up indoors all the time so it did make some sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismayed at the lack of food you went to wake your partner. This did not take much time since the little guy apparently slept lightly when excited.

Thanatos was obviously suffering to Fenrir standing outside but a more noticeable figure blocked your view. Thanatos was also startled by the new presence and came in between you and the newcomer. Never did you expect the man who stood there. More importantly was that it was a MAN who stood there. <i>'How did he get into the forest without Fenrir seeing him?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'He didn't.'</i> came Fenrir's all to powerful voice from outside. <i>'You would be surprised at how close both of your stories are in comparison. Only difference being he did not bond.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the truth, you looked the man over carefully. Something seemed oddly familiar about this man. \"What, you don't even recognize your old pal Trent?\" Realization struck you so hard you nearly fell backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix? Felix Brombard?! How the hell did you get here?!\" Felix was your old friend from Parcel. You both could use magic, though he was what they called an attack mage. Had a nearly frightening love for fire type magic as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when we were taken from Parcel to join the army, I was sent off to a militia to destroy an enemy base, or say they told me. Once I arrived I found out it was a family cave.\" Fenrir was right. Your stories were very similar. \"I couldn't do it Trent, not to a helpless family. When they all attacked, I could only watch helplessly. Almost every one of the men were killed and the entire family went with them. Even the children... It was a massacre...\" A shudder going up your spine, <i>That could have been Thanatos if it wasn't for me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they killed the last dragon... I just lost it. I don't remember anything that happened during that time except when I came to all of them were dead...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir then stepped in, <i>\"That was my doing. I heard the dragons cries and rushed in as fast as I could, but I was too late to save them. I would have killed young Felix here as well, but he reminded me to much of you... A wizard that refused to kill. He did not lay a hand on one dragon but also did not help the ones in need.\"</i> Felix flinched at this statement as if just realizing it himself. <i>\"He didn't even speak when I attempted to communicate. In fact he only just started talking a couple days ago.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? how long ago did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just over a month ago. He has been kept away from everyone for his protection.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why the hell didn't you tell me he was here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And how was I to know that he was your friend hmm? I may be a dragon but I do not stoop to reading minds no matter the case and as I said before he has kept silent until a few days ago. Once he mentioned Parcel I realized you might have known him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He speaks the truth Trent.\" Came Felix's voice to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can understand him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess, Why? Aren't you able too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but, I thought it was because of Thanatos's and my... connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connection? What are you talking about?\" Looking toward Fenrir, and then to Thanatos, they both give a nod of approval. You release a long sigh and begin to retell your own adventure from being taken from parcel all the way to where you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... And I thought I went through hell. This would be hard to take in if were anyone else but you, I can trust old fre.. fre...\" He started looking off behind you stuttering all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What the hell are you staring at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if your voice brought him back to reality, he jumped and pointed a long finger toward your new wings and screamed, \"WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I almost forgot. Felix this is my dragon, Thanatos,\" Thanatos bowed in a greeting, \"and well, gods how do I explain this. Well since me and him have... bonded I guess you could call it, I have grown these. Trust me, I don't know much more about it than you. Fenrir behind you is the one who has been telling me what's going on so he would be the one to ask.\" Looking toward Fenrir he nodded slowly still in a mild shock. Thanatos took this opportunity to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice to meet you Felix. I've heard many things about you from Trent.\"</i> He began retelling some tales excitedly and Felix just stared on with a slightly perplexed gaze. Thanatos would not relent so it seemed you had to go and relieve your friend of your talkative companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, alright Than, leave him alone for a bit. He has enough to think about besides reminiscing about the past.\" Showing some relief at the small dragon relenting and taking his place beside you again, Felix relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this 'bond' mean? What are you just friends with him or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say a bit more, but it's difficult to explain why. All I know is if he was gone I don't think I could go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Same here Trent.\"</i> This only seemed to confuse him even more as he stepped backward rubbing his temple as if he had a large headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I believe that questions should be saved for a later time. I think your friend would like some time alone to think through everything that he has been told.\"</i> Both you and Felix nod and Fenrir leads him out the door toward his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well that was unexpected, wouldn't you say Than?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really need to ask? He looked as if he was thrown into another realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in a way he was, but all that matters is he is safe. I can't believe I was able to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to play some of our ga-\"</i> Before he was able to finish you both heard Blaze calling from just outside your home. He just came into view after rounding a tree and was sprinting toward you. Felix and Fenrir had not left yet slightly startled by the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thanatos! You ready to explore some more around the edges of the forest? I found so-\"</i> He stopped mid-sentence once he spotted Felix. He craned his neck upward as his eyes enlarged. It even looked as if his scales shimmered with an even more vivid red than usual. Felix was in the same stupor with eyes wide gazing at Blaze. As if rehearsed before hand, they both blurt out in sync,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze?\"<br>\r\n<i>\"Felix?\"</i><br>\r\n\"How did you know my...\"<br>\r\n<i>\"How did you know my...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Thanatos and Fenrir all came to a realization at that point,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Things just became a lot more complicated.</i></span></div></div>",

But two new riders? Why are things happening so fast and why must his son be involved? He owed a great debt to Thanatos and was determined to prove himself to the Little One. Even though Trent forgave him he still felt as though he owed the human a debt as well. But this was his son who was in the beginning stages of bonding with a complete human stranger and it made Flamming a little nervous for Blaze\u2019s safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack claws dug into the earth and he spread his wings from the concealed, hidden spot and with one powerful pump of his wings he leapt into the air and glided over to the scene. He positioned himself in between the line of sight of Felix and Blaze, landing with a steady stance and angled his triangular head so that his large eyes pierced into Felix\u2019s vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stammered backwards a few steps. He had to crane his head upwards to take in the majesty of this full-grown dragon. He thought that Blaze was beautiful with those shimmering red scales, but this larger dragon was red as well and his scales danced like gems in the raging flames of fire. Felix was swept away in emotions of awe and had no time to feel frightened of Flammings presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Thanatos, however, both felt your muscles tense up at Flammings entrance. You had both witnessed the fury of this dragon before and started to reminisce those memories. You began to prepare for a protection spell in case something dangerous happened, and hopefully you will have enough time to weave together one of adequate strength to prevent any burns. But although Flamming had abruptly burst into the scene, he did not carry those threatening signs of attack. His wings folded up completely and teeth were kept hidden behind those lizard-like lips and his massive muscles seemed relaxed enough to never indicate a violent strike was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlammings thoughts boomed into everyone who could hear, <i>\u201cBlaze, go home.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut daddy I want to talk to Felix!\u201d</i> The tiny creature started to shift his feet so that he could step around the looming presence of his dad and view the intriguing human once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI said go home! You have played enough today. You better mind me or I will remind you what it is like to disobey your father!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was clearly upset, but the little dragon seemed to hesitate even farther not wanting to leave the presence of Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou cannot stop the inevitable from happening Flamming.\u201d</i> Fenrir\u2019s voice came wise and gentle. Even though Blaze and Felix may not understand the hidden meaning, the rest of them knew that Fenrir was indicating to the bond that was beginning to take shape between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw how Flamming\u2019s tale whipped in reflex from the agitated emotions it was experiencing only to land still near the form of his child. He craned his neck upwards even straighter and rested his bottle-like orbs upon Fenrir, <i>\u201cHow can you trust a human you hardly know? Felix may harbor evil in his heart and turn my son into a dragon for the worse. You know as good as I that the hearts of red dragons are easily swayed to either good or evil. I will not take the chance of my son becoming evil.\u201d</i> Then, Flamming turned his head to see his son once again, <i>\u201cI said go home. I will not say it again.\u201d</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Felix is different than Trent and I have to know why.\"</i> Blaze stood there resiliently, however his body was quivering slightly. You assumed he had never stood up to his father before and who were you to blame him. Flamming had quite a commanding aura about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamming's eyes widened slightly at his sons remark. This must be the first time he has ever disobeyed him. A staring match insued between father and son for another ten minutes. No words spoken, no sound made, no movement save for Blaze's slight shivering under his father's weathering gaze. Soon however, his gaze softened ever so slightly. Lowering his stance he lets out a defeated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the second time you saw his scales lose their beautiful glow. Only his eyes continued to shimmer as he finally spoke to his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If this is what you want Blaze my boy, fine I wont stop you.\"</i> Curling his lip slightly at the end and finalizing it with a nod, Blaze beemed at his father's acceptance. As quickly as it had left though, his scales flared to life once again with the angry fury you remembered. His gaze locked with a panic stricken Felix. They remained like that for another few minutes and only stopped when Felix gulped down harshly and nodded weakly. <i>I... guess that was a warning. Man I wouldn't want to be Felix right now heh heh...</i> you mention to Thanatos. Unable to fully understand, he only weekly nods, his gaze following the red giant out the door. His head lowered more than usual, even since he attacked you. Feeling a need to say something to him, you speak up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Flamming. So you know, I'll make sure to keep Felix in line. He wont do anything to hurt any of us. I've known him as long as I can remember.\" Finally getting his voice as well, Thanatos joins you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah that's right, and even if he did we will protect Blaze with our lives. Right Trent?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it buddy.\" Smiling once again at your small partner's ever cheerful attitude. It seemed to work however, as Flamming nodded and spoke once more before finally exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You have done much for us rider. I will take that to heart. One day I will repay this debt I owe you that seems to continue to grow each time I encounter you.\"</i> Stating the last bit with a hint of sarcasm, he disappears into the leaves. Looking back over toward Blaze and Felix they seemed to be continuing there stare contest with new vigor. Fenrir just waited patiently to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well Than, what should we do? Want to interupt whatever there talking about and make sure this is true or you want to talk with Fenrir?\"</i></span></div></div>",

After a length he witnessed calm but curious demeanor's settle into the muscles of their friends and he was certain that they should let the two have their moment of privacy. The black dragon looked back towards you with his silver eyes brimming in questions of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if your mind was one with Thanatos\u2019 you immediately knew the answer without needing to hear a response. Like individual branches of a tree, both you and Thanatos were linked in such a way that you could easily dip into the main trunk and know what the other was thinking. And as every day flew by in the protected shelter of the nesting grounds it became easier and easier to do such a thing. You gave your dragonling a nod\u2026understanding that the both of you had questions that only Fenrir could answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning with the opal dragon on your heels, you both end up in front of that older dragon who had taken you under his wing. Fenrir was a shade of forest green; scales dancing in the various greenish-hues of the color spectrum to complete a facade of warm life. This gentle warmth though could be quickly misleading as you had discovered the first day you met him. The three rows of spines running along his impressive back from head to tail were daringly sharp and his wings were nothing but extraordinary symbols of his strength and vigor. You suddenly realized that you admired him as both a friend and mentor and you were glad that he was on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Fenrir,</i>\u201d you exclaimed, \u201c<i>another dragon rider! It has been so long since dragon riders have flourished in existence and now there are two of us! It is happening so fast! For this to happen now... it seems so unreal. What does this mean?</i>\u201d You asked the question that was boiling inside of both you and Thanatos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir cocked his head downwards to gaze upon your form. His words filtered into your mind in a manner like your friends back home would converse with you out in the open. \u201c<i>It means both wonderful and terrible things are going to happen, Rider. It foretells the coming of awesome events that will shake the foundations of Shoven.</i>\u201d The triangular shaped head of Fenrir lowered to gaze more intently upon you and Thanatos at eye level. \u201c<i>Make sure you adhere to your training and learn all you can learn about each other. Know each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and know how powerful you are when combined together. You will need this knowledge for the near future because it may mean a matter of life and death for the both of you. There will come times of great sadness that you both must endure but take heart, it is only fleeting, because you will experience and taste a life of happiness as well. Great responsibility will be thrust upon your shoulders but together you can, and must, overcome any obstacle that presents itself. Trent, you and Felix mark the beginning of a new era and quite possibly the fate of Shoven will rest upon the backs of you Riders.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly aware of the many blinks your eyelids took in action over your eyes. You were not expecting an answer like this. It excited and scared you at the same time and no doubt Thanatos felt the same way as you. Apparently, there was room for more reality to settle into your awareness of how important you and Felix had become in the thrall of political and powerful factions across the known land. Fenrir was convinced that you, a common trader's son, would rise to these spoken words that seemed like prophecies and already you have felt the thrust of fate pulling you along this very course even when nothing of the sort has ever happened. You were left speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming content with his speech, Fenrir left you both to ponder his words for the night. He may have answered your first question, but his answer left you with infinite possibilities for the future. However, it was just that, the future, and no questions he gave could be answered about that unpredictable train of thought. No more to do than to sleep on it and that is just what you and the little one did.</span></div></div>",

Once finished it wasn't long before the little one was awoken by the smell and you both feasted on the morning meal with nary a word between you. Once finished, you both made your way to the training area that Fenrir specified. It was a very quiet treck to the grounds. Thanatos and you both having a lot on your minds kept any words between you to yourselves. The feelings playing across your mental link was enough to show the other what they were thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving neither of you were surprised to see Felix and Blaze their as well. Thanatos was actually anticipating this so training wouldn't be so boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it that Fenrir has you training here as well eh Felix?\" you said with a playful mock to your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you call it. I know he can teach the dragon's some things, but how is he supposed to teach us anything? He's a dragon. Last I checked they didn't use magic.\" This made a lot of sense. How was Fenrir supposed to teach you magic. He said himself dragons were unable to use it so why would he say he would teach it. <i>'Well he hasn't lied to us yet, no reason not to trust him. I wonder how he will do it though.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he said he will, he will. If any dragon could do it i'm pretty sure he could. It's as if he has knoledge that even he does not know of. Did you see his eyes? I've never seen that shade of silver before.\" You and Than had always been mystified by his eyes. They seemed to have so much depth yet all was perfectly hidden behind the beautiful color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really paid it any mind. A person's, or rather beings, actions always tell more about them then any eye could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It doesn't really matter anyway. Were all here now so let's just make the most of it.\"</i>Blaze chimed in with a mischivious glint in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know that look. It's one of my favorites. What are you planning this time eh?\"</i> Thanatos spoke, finally bringing his voice to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you guys, I already had to have my entire life reversed in under one week and on top of that you woke me up early. Can't you give me a break today?\" Felix said, obviously not amused at this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you take Felix's side and stop their plot before they get the entire forest after them, or should you just let it play out. It's not like thier \"evil\" plots ever hurt anyone before.</span></div></div>",

When you were sleeping I found an interesting clearing in the forest, it had what looked like scorch marks on the ground.\"</i> Thanatos suggested. You have to admit that is a bit strange, a clearing with scorch marks on the ground. Could it be a battle ground, and If so for who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it sounds interesting, lets go have a look.\" You push yourself off the ground as Thanatos trots behind you quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk out the door and into the fresh forest air. Stretching your back, you look over to Thanatos, \"So, which way is the clearing?\" he nods in the direction that leads off onto the forest. <i>\"This way, come on, hurry!\"</i> He trots off down the path. You smile to yourself, <i>he's always full of energy</i>, then jog off after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, talking through your mental link about this and that, Thanatos suddenly stops <i>\"Whats wrong Than?\"</i> <br>\r\n\"The clearing is just around that corner,\"<i> he nods ahead where the path takes a sharp turn. <i>\"but i think we should sneak through the forest,\"</i> he says nodding towards the forest. <i>\"you know, so we don't scare anyone off.\"</i> He shows some of his teeth and starts to jump slightly from the ground, this is like a game of hide and seek for him.<i>\"Sure, good idea.\" If only I knew a spell to mask noise. I should ask Fenrir about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon notice the trees start to thin out then come to an abrupt halt, they both creep up behind a large bush which defines the edge of the clearing. As you look through the branches you see that Thanatos was right, the are many odd, crescent shaped scorch marks opposed to the usual teardrop shape usually seen with a dragons fire and several large ditches scar the otherwise pristine clearing, and large gouges cover the surrounding trees. <i>\"Your right Thanatos, there was definately a battle here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like more is about to occur.\"</i> he states back pointing a wing towards the edges of the clearing. You move a branch aside to reveal a familiar looking red dragon, and another unfamiliar silver dragon squaring off in the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shouldn't we stop them from fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? By jumping between them and using some small spell again? I wont let you. Besides, I think this is just sparring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh, looks like the little guy is growing up protecting me like that. We'll make a great team. Wait, did he say sparring? THIS is sparring!?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look again at the grounds with a cautious eye. Flamming had looked better. His once blazing scales had dimmed considerably and many were scraped or cut with dirt lining the entirety of his body. Pushing any reasoning for this in the back of your mind until later, he and the new dragon begin to circle each other before the silver dragon begins to speak. Either they didn't care to be private or did not know that others were present<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Flamming-elda, what would you like to work on next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>Flamming visibly sighs, <i>\"Please Jirda, that title never fits me and you know it, especially now. We have been friends since we were small and still you name me as you would your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but as a guardian I cannot change our customs... Flamming-elda\"</i> You notice his name was spoken with some amusement from the now named Jirda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why you... fine, just a basic spar. And before you say something I wont use my fire, honestly every time you ask and every time you will receive the same answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be fun.\"</i> Thanatos states to you slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap, what's he up to now?</i></i></span></div></div>",

Begin on three.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201cUh oh, Thanatos you\u2019re going to have to use your claws to scratch him.

Though it is good that you have been looking into the note that the militia gave you to practice spells. Recently you have been able to learn three more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles. Flexing his claws <i> \u201cIf you can keep his attention on you for a few seconds and I should be able to give him a nice scar\"</i> <br>\r\n\u201cThanatos,\" you warn, \u201cbe careful that you don't do something you'll regret later. \u201c <br>\r\n<i> \"Three!\u201d </i> Flamming calls. Oops, you did not even notice him start counting. At three Flamming starts running straight towards you. His footsteps booming throughout the clearing, you wait until he is only a few feet away. Then you raise your hands and yell \"Terra Culmen\" suddenly a large tower of earth shoots up from the ground in front of Flamming. Surprising him and causing him to take a few steps back. Only to be hit from the side by Thanatos as he jumped at him, attempting to gain purchase on his side and dig his claws in. Nevertheless, Flamming managed to shake than loose and propel himself backwards with a few beats of his powerful wings, the blast of wind nearly knocking you off your feet. Thanatos being a fair bit heavier than you was not bothered much by the wind. When Flamming lands he is several meters away from you. He looks from you to Thanatos and back again, more wary now. Waiting for us to make the first move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear Thanatos whisper <i> \"Trent I can't get through his hide. It is way too tough for my claws. Do you have any ideas?\u201d </i> <br>\r\nYou do not think you have the accuracy to use a serious cutting attack like \"Ventus Vesica.\u201d You need something else, something more precise. You get a flash of inspiration, your water bottle. You should be able to make some sort of small non-lethal weapons out of them. <i> \"Thanatos I need you to jump at Flamming, but try to get away from him as soon as possible.\" </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances at you and nods. I hope his trust in me is warranted. \"When you\u2019re ready Than.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamming looks about ready to take another shot when Thanatos leaps forward using his wings to gain a bit of extra speed. Flamming plants his claws and holds his ground. As Thanatos makes a flying charge at Flamming, you open your water bottle, draw the water out, and call \"glacies postulo\" shaping the water into several thin shapes, freezing them. Then sending them flying towards Flamming at high speed. Flamming saw Thanatos charge at him and countered by turning slightly and bringing his tail around to swipe at Thanatos. Who manages to jump over the blow and ram into Flamming open flank. At impact Thanatos shoves off and pushing Flamming off balance while sending himself in the other direction. Flamming stumbles to the side only to be hit in the other side by a flurry of small ice crystals. Many of which shatter harmlessly against his tough scales but one or two manage to penetrate, drawing the winning blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamming reaches up and brushes his side knocking the needles out. He straightens up and bows to you both. Panting you look to each other a pair of wide grins creeps onto your faces. You turn back to Flamming and bow in return. Then your observer Jirada breaks the silence with a load resounding applause. <i> \u201cVery good. Very good. So the legends about the riders are true. You, a young mage, and an even younger dragon actually beat Flamming. A bit of a close thing but still a victory. Aye Flamming?\" </i>  Jirada proclaimed joyfully. Strangely happy to see Flamming beaten. Flamming looked at Jirada ruefully. Then replied <i> \u201cYes, yes, you won. Congratulations. It seems like your very in tune and have a lot of potential. However, we are out of time and must take our leave. Good bye.\" </i> And with a curt nod, he turns and leaves along a path out of the clearing. Jirada nods to you as well then follows. Chuckling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Thanatos look at each other again then burst out laughing. Thanatos rolls to the ground while you walk over to a tree and drop down in its shade. <i> \"Did you see Flamming's face when I dodged over his tail. He thought for sure he had gotten me. Then when those ice things hit him, He was sure annoyed!\" </i> Thanatos cried happily. \"Well we certainly did well. Considering this is our first fight. Hope he doesn\u2019t stay angry with us though.\" You reply also quite pleased with your performance. Neither of you could have taken on a full-grown dragon but you managed to beat him as a team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos gets up and trots over to you. Lying down on the grass next to you. Then you both hear a loud grumbling. <i> \"Was that you or me?\" </i> asked Thanatos \"Both I think. That fight was kind of taxing. Want to head home after we get something to eat? We can ask Fenrir about combat and magic training next time we see him.\" You reply. You are actually starving. You had not had a decent meal for a while. There should be a river somewhere nearby. <i> \"Sure c'mon I also found a lake nearby. It's where the dragons get their water and fish.\" </i> He gets up and points towards the edge of the clearing, roughly south. You climb to you feet and follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, you reach the lake. Moreover, it is one of the most beautiful places you have seen. The water is a sparkling crystal blue and is backed by a series of tall snow capped mountains. All of which is surrounded by a thick green forest. \"Wow.\" You gasp. <i> \u201cI know it's huge isn\u2019t it.\u201d </i>  Thanatos says. You chuckle yourself wondering at what age kids finally get the whole scenery thing. \"Yeah it's pretty big. Must be a least a mile and a half wide. Do you want to build a fire while I try to catch some fish?\" You ask Thanatos while rummaging around for the hooks and string you always keep in your rucksack. Another piece of survival gear from the militia. As Than goes off into the forest to look for wood you break off a suitable branch, attach the string, and hook to it. What to use for bait though? Wait you still had some preserved dear from you trip here. A bit old now but should make good bait. As you tear it into bits and hook one on the line, you hear Thanatos return. Dragging two large branches one in his mouth the other with his tail. He drops them on the ground and walks over to you. <i> \u201cIs that enough?\u201d </i> He asks. \"Yeah, Looks like it should be plenty. Could you please dig a small hole and fill it with broken bits of those two logs?\" you reply casting the hook into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of waiting, you get a bite and pull in a large fish. As you place it on the ground next to you Thanatos wanders over, having finished making the fire pit. <i> \u201cHey, Nice catch.\u201d </i> He comments prodding the fish with his claw. \"Yeah, The fish here seem to be pretty big.\" You reply putting another bit of meat on the hook and throwing it back in. \"Hey Thanatos. Can you breathe fire?\u201d You ask, looking over at him lying on the bank. He tilts his head and thinks. <i> \u201cI don't know. I have not tried before. Might as well give it a shot.\u201d </i> He rears back his head taking a deep breath then gives a strong exhalation. Surprisingly on the first try, a small plume of fire bursts from his lips. You put the rod in the crook of your arm and clap your hands. \"Amazing on the first try too. Was it easy? How did it feel?\" He blushes a bit. Well you think he did. \"Yeah it was pretty easy. It almost felt natural. Doesn\u2019t feel hot though. This is kind of surprising really.\" Suddenly the rod jerks. Nearly gets out of your grip. As you pull it in, you glance over at Thanatos and ask, \"Do you want two? Or would you be happy with one?\" It is another large fish. You place it next to the first. <i>\"If you could catch a third that would be great. I am pretty hungry. I'll go \"light\" the fire.\"</i> He says. Walking over to the fire and using his breath to create a nice blaze. You put the last of the meat on the hook and throw it in again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you are both sitting by the fire waiting for the fish to cook. Then Thanatos sits up and asks you. <i> \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, The riders they haven\u2019t been round for hundreds of year\u2019s right?\u201d </i> You nod. <i> \u201cAnd you\u2019re first in a long time right?\u201d </i> Another nod. <i> \u201cSo what does that mean? Do we have some special job to do?\u201d </i> you shrug, \"I've been thinking the same thing and I have no idea. I we all have our part to play in life. Nevertheless, we do not know what it is until the time comes. But, I guess Fenrir might be able to give us some clues, he seems knowledgeable in those kinds of things. Any way the fish it ready.\" You take the spit you rigged up from sticks and break it so that two fish are on one part and one on the other. Passing the one with two fish to Thanatos, he grabs it with both claws and starts munching away at them. You take a bite out of your own and look out over the lake. Wondering, what is in store for the pair of you?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nspells (earthen pillar = terra culmen) (wind blades = Ventus Vesica) (steel spikes = chalybs spikes) (ice needles = glacies postulo)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanatos stretched his legs then got up and walked over to the lake and drank deeply. When he'd had his fill of water he came back over and looked at the sunset <i>\"C'mon Trent it's getting late, lets go home.\"</i> You nod and push yourself up \"Sure. We probably should get home before dark.\" You both walk in the direction of the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Hey. Trent.\" </i> Thanatos said. You glance over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Thanatos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Why do you cook your food? I mean it tastes fine how it is. And cooking it just wastes time.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. I think it's because uncooked meat makes us sick. We cant handle it. I guess Dragons are just more robust in that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach your tree/cave Thanatos stops <i>\"So does that mean that humans are weaker that dragons?\"</i> <i>Uh oh. How do I get out of this one. It was that kind of were better than you are attitude that starts conflicts</i> \"Well. You know how humans can use magic?\" Than nods. \"And dragons can't.\" another nod. \"Its like that. There are things dragons can do that humans can't and there are things humans can do that dragons can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos just nods wisely. <i>\"So you mean that just because a dragon can fly and stuff dosn't mean he is any better than a human that can't?\"</i>  <br>\r\nYou sigh inwardly seems like he accepts the idea \"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk inside. You drop your rucksack by the door and take off you shoes. \"I'm beat. I think I'll go to bed. Good night Thanatos.\" Thanatos has walked over to the window. Well the small hole in the wall across the room from the door. And was staring up at the night sky. You walk up next to him. \"Pretty beautiful isn't it.\" The sky is clear and the stars are sparkling like a million gems. <i>\"Yeah I wonder What those shiny things are?\"</i> <br>\r\n\"Heh. Their called stars. Their like the sun only further away.\" <i> Wow I guess your going to have to tell him all about the world. Heck you don't even know that much about the world.</i> \"But hey we have plenty of time to learn about that kind of thing. For know though. I'm getting some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the bed. a kind of raised area of wood covered with a layer of straw . It was originally meant for a full size dragon so you and Thanatos easily fit on it. <i>\"Good night Trent.\"</i> Thanatos calls \"G'night.\" You yawn back. Stretching out on the bed were one end or another of a full grown dragon might lay. Almost as soon as your head touches the hay your out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly next morning you wake up with Thanatos curled next to you. Carefully so as to not wake him up you get off the bed and put you shoes on. then quietly walk over to the door way. Watching the dragons go about their morning business. A few nod to you in acknowledgment but most seem to be to busy to notice you. You hear a soft rustling behind you. Sounds like Thanatos is awake. you walk back inside to get some berries and fruit out of you rucksack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos had just rolled onto his back and was still asleep. You sit up against the wall eat some odd orange berries you found in the forest and an apple. After you'd finished them Thanatos had still shown no signs of waking so you decided to go get some meat for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to walk a few minutes before you got to a area that was populated by animals. You come across a small glen which seems to be the home for a large number of rabbits. You pick up a small pebble from the ground and whisper \"calx offa.\" The stone flew from you hand and hit a rabbit in the head knocking it to the ground and killing it outright. The other rabbits scatter at the sudden movement. Hopping quickly to the safety of nearby bushes. You walk out into the glen and pick up the dead rabbit. Probably won't fill Thanatos up but should make a decent snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue you feel a rush of worry and hear Thanatos's voice call out <i>\"Trent. Were are you?\"</i> You start walking back in the direction you came holding the rabbit by its back legs. <i>\"Sorry Than. I just went out to the forest to get you some meat.\"</i>  You feel slightly ashamed at getting him so worried but at the same time feel a flush of affection. He really did care about you. <i>\"I'm coming back now. I should be there in a minute or two.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back home and pass the rabbit to Thanatos. <i>\"Next time wake me please.\"</i> He said as he began eating the rabbit. In a few bites it was gone and Thanatos was licking his maw. He gets up and trots over to the entrance. <i>\"So what should we do today?\"</i>  He asks you. \"Hmmm. Good question\" you reply. \"What should we do today?\"<br>\r\n(calx offa = stone shot)</span></div></div>",

Fenrir just began to regain his footing and padded toward your group. It seemed his interest in you and Thanatos had vanished and he was now completely focused on this new visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see shall we?\" Silver said as he threw his blade to you. It was a very ornate scimitar with jewels encrusted along it's blade and hilt. The blade of pure silver and the hilt was a dark mahogany wood with a solid gold wrist guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I meant to do with this?\" you asked, still gazing at the beauty of the sword you held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack me.\" This statement made you forget the blade entirely and gawk at Silver.

Use the blade or if you prefer use your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...\" You stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it or I kill your dragon.\"<br>\r\nThis hardened your heart instantly. No one would take Thanatos away from you. If he threatened him he forfeit his life. You decide to make sure this kid never threatened your partner. Delving into your magic you decide to break a well known rule of wizards to come up with an attack that you thought nothing could escape. Experimenting. Deciding what to do, you take action. You connect to your mental link to magic and notice another presence connected to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let's take him out together Trent!\"</i> It seemed that you would not be doing this alone and felt a surge of energy rush through you. You doubted you would break a sweat after you finished the combination you were thinking of. Finally ready, you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TERRESTRIS MECERIA!\" Four earth walls sprouted up around Silver no more than a foot from him on all sides. This spell required no experimentation as you already knew it and with Thanatos's help you barely felt any drain. Not finished yet you continued. Rushing forward, you stab the scimitar strait through the stone toward where Silver would be standing. Once embedded all the way through you recite your next spell, \"GLADIUS LUPATUS!\" The sword shook slightly and Iron spikes Splintered through the hard earthen wall. This spell was your first experimentation and you were glad to see it went as you had hoped even though it was based off another spell you already knew, Strictura Callum. Coming upon the final piece of this elaborate attack, you finally recite the end. \"OBLIDO!\" The surrounding walls rushed inward with unheard of speed and struck each other with a resounding thud. You quickly stepped away, satisfied with your work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir stood not far away from the site. He looked at you with a slight amount of interest, but not what you would expect after he had just seen you kill the man who help him with a single hand. It was then a hard fatigue crept into your being and brought you to your knees. It seemed as if creating new spells without the proper training was very taxing. You would do well to take care in the future. You looked up to your handy-work and saw only dust around the site. Waiting for it to clear, you squinted looking for the body. Instead you found a very intact and looking as if nothing happened, Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference was a slightly dirtied cape and the eye-patch seemed to be shorn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eye that had been covered was silver in color. As well as a slanted pupil. The eye of a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you would like an explination?\" Silver says coldly.</span></div></div>",

My mother was a human, and my father a dragon. A doomed relationship from the start but they cared for one another. My mother unfortunately, died during the birth of me and my sister, Argent. We were twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister, however, was blamed for my mothers death because of her other, more draconian features. She had human shape but dragon skin, eyes and wings which were blamed on the cause of our mothers death. Me, well I had 1 eye of a dragon so I was accepted. It also helped that I came first. Our father shunned her for our mother's death and she grew up cold and merciless. My sister left our home at 14 and I followed after her, to track her down. I knew she would only cause trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 75 years of searching I found her... She was threatening to kill a family of dragons if they did not reveal the location of our father, who had hidden himself in grief. I intervened and we fought. I defeated her and she retreated. I have heard she went to a place she called the Nether but I have heard of no such place from any other source. I became a rider after that to my dragon Slyder. Once I bonded with him, I renewed my search for my sister argent with a brand new vigor and intensity. During this time I learned that the riders on the council betrayed one another and ultimately killed each other in a brutal battle. I was the last rider of the old age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe search lead me to our father 100 years later, After the humans fled the lands.He was mad at this point. Being in solitude for all this time with only himself for company. The moment I stepped into his den, he lashed out with a animal like fury. It was a hard battle, but in the end I killed him. During the battle my dragon, Slyder died.... Struck in the throat by my own fathers talon.\"</span></div></div>",

Regardless of the fact that he tried to kill you. Also there would be dragons so Thanatos would have company of his own race and you would have the help you wanted to raise him. Besides you knew it was always safer to travel in a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Silver was determined to train you quickly however, you decided not to ride atop Fenrir, much to his anger. He still journeyed with you however which puzzled you. When you questioned him though, you received only a irritated grunt and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver had begun training you right away. Mainly teaching you ancient words of power and their translation so that you would expand your magical vocabulary. Many of the words he taught you were foreign. None of the books from the Library in Parcel had the words that he spoke of and he refused to divulge the information on how he acquired them. After a full day of spell recital you finally became fed up with this word practice and where ready for some more \"hands on\" attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be best instead of reciting these damn words I actually attempted some spells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking toward you he spoke, \"First you must memorize the words before they will be any help for you, but you do have a point. Maybe some use will help speed the memorization process.\" After finishing he tossed the scimitar once again toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets begin.\" Silver told you. \"Use whatever you wish to attack me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had planned out this move as carefully as you could. Charging forward as if to attack, you sidestepped to get behind Silver. You got to your spot easily and slashed down, shouting \"LUPATUS!\" Out the sharpened edge of the sword grew three equally sharp spikes. The sword hit its mark with a sickening \"CRACK\" slashing his clothes at the back, and to your surprise chipping two of the three spikes that were formed on the blade. No skin was broken and Silver never cried out in pain as you expected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but enough for today.\" Silver told you, \"We will continue tomorrow. You seem tired. I realize that the magic you use is taxing, but becoming that worn after only a couple spells will be dangerous in the future. You need to either work on your endurance or find another magic. You don't seem like the type to give in to a challenge though so I will help build your endurance for the next few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill slightly shocked, you spoke to Thanatos about your battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Did you see that, I thought I got Silver good. Oh well, next time eh?\"</i> You laughed to Thanatos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something is wrong Trent...{/i{ Thanatos said clearly worried about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you mean?\"</i> You said Concern on your voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't think he is normal? When you tried to cut him, I felt something.</i> Thanatos said trembling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Felt what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he wasn't their... Dead... I don't know what Silver is, but I know he doesn't tell the truth</i> Thanatos replied with worry and a small amount of anger in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Silver left camp claiming he was going to repair his clothes. You and Thanatos followed him silently. After about 5 minutes you and Thanatos come to a small clearing with a pool of water in the center. Noticing something move in the clearing you and Thanatos quickly hid from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Silver kneeling by the pool, he removed his hood and upper garments...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Thanatos gasped. Silver must have been ancient. His skin around his ribs and back was degrading, badly. Pale as the moon and some peeling off. In some areas even the bone could be seen through the skin. You couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out.\" Silver told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled and a bit fearful, you step out as Silver set his garments onto the ground. After doing so he held a whithred palm toward the clothing and whispered \"Attexo Gramen.\" In an instant the grass and other plantlife wove into the cuts of the fabric and created a seamless repair leaving it's green coloring as a stark highlight on the black cloak. This just went to show he knew his stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you alive? It looks as if you have been decaying over a century...\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver laughed, \"Well how about you? How is it that you are alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused by this question. How did he expect you to answer? You where saved from your dilemma  when Thanatos butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How old are you? And don't lie this time.\"</i> Thanatos demanded with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have lived to see 10 millenia, young dragon, and If you are wondering why. I will tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.N.(Attexo Gramen means to weave plant life and Lupatus means iron spikes)</i></span></div></div>",

Before he was killed, he was able to suspend my moment of death. In his last breath he gave me 1 gift, but also my curse. I cannot die unless I take my own life... but I will not die until I have found Argent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically instead of living in solitude for 200 years, I have lived in solitude for 9000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Thanatos where shocked. How did he not go insane? Why did he feel the need to say his dragon was colored white? And how could someone so old look so young?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver as if sensing your barrage of questions said \"I will not say anymore, return to camp when you are ready, we should reach Jupin tomorrow. And I doubt that me or you will arrive to a warm welcome. Fenrir will make sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more confused than before you approached him, Silver walked toward the camp, leaving you in the clearing alone with Thanatos.</span></div></div>",

Looking to the side you saw the disturbance but could not believe your eyes. There before you stood a woman, 12 feet high and with such an inhuman smile it made you cringe at its very sight. Panicking you look for Thanatos in an attempt to shield him from this new foe but could not find him. The giant began cackling in a deceptively high pitched voice all the while stepping toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done with him!!\" You screamed back at her, your fear being completely bellied by your somewhat paternal instinct toward Thanatos. It seemed a bit put off by another name but did not answer, nor did her hellish features change as she continued approaching. Thinking quickly, you rolled to the side searching for the spell that could bring this human/beast down. That was what you wanted to do but quickly found it was impossible to move. Something rooted you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Stuck are we? You will not escape my wrath today demon half-breed!\" The beast said in it's unnervingly high voice. It was as if a young woman was speaking for it. It's voice betrayed it's features. Panic returning to you full force, your limbs went slack but still refused to move as you stared into it's large black eyes, teeth bared in a menacing grin. <i>'It thinks I'm Silver!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all seemed lost, the creature lost it's expression momentarily as it continued forward and took on the one of a young woman. It only lasted a split second but it seemed to be enough for it to notice the change itself. The grin instantly vanishing it had barely time to inquire what happened as it doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling in a heap, you caught a glimpse of what happened. Thanatos had it's maw latched directly into the leg of a surprised young woman. She barely had time to react to the new attack as Silver quickly appeared and struck your visitor in the temple. Her eyes locked on to him for one quick moment before she finally fell backward unconscious and mouth agape in apparent surprise. It seemed that Thanatos was unwilling to let go of your new acquaintance and unable to maintain consciousness, you were unable to see if he finally relented his grasp.</span></div></div>",

No, changeling was not what she was. Thanatos disappeared and then reappeared upon this woman's leg as if from thin air. Only one thing could have caused that and it was connected with your sense of sight. This woman was an illusionist. Why she chose to attack you, was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanatos did not take long to join you in awaking and quickly bombarded you with questions trying to make sure you were all right. You assured him all was well and strolled over to Fenrir, keeping your distance from the still unconscious woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was I out?\" You said to Fenrir<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For the night. It is only just after dawn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your o.k. Trent?\"</i> Thanatos asked, still unbelieving of your current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes for the fourth time I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Than why didn't you move when she appeared? She came walking toward you with a sword in hand and you just stood there with your eyes closed.

She was a fierce giant in my eyes.\" He still seemed a bit sceptical, but believed you for the time being. \"What are we going to do with her? And where is Silver?\" Silver was nowhere to be seen but from the looks of it, made sure your prisoner could not escape with many layers of rope and even a blindfold over her eyes. Her hands and legs were both tied to each other in front of her to hinder movement even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Silver left for some business and decided to leave that choice up to you. He seems to be discarding all logic with his choices lately but I do not have the power to disagree with him.\"</i> Though curious as to why he couldn't, you let it be for now. No use trying to get information from him, he tried to kill me to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed, however, that Silver had given you the choice to decide the fate of your own attacker. His logic confused as much as it seemed to everyone else. 'Why would he leave this choice to me?' No time to mull over why, you needed to make a decision as she already began to stir awake.</span></div></div>",

You did not have long to think on this as burning flames spewed out of their maws and the heat extended toward you. You ducked towards the closest impression in the cave and hid. In the distance you could hear a few men scream and the bellow of a dragons roar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You will not succeed this night!'</i> A distant, mysterious voice unlike your own rolled through your thoughts. Gulping, you lost control of your stomach. Relieving yourself of your meager lunch, you toppled over like a weak tree and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke some time later when the screams of the soldiers eventually died out and almost instantly were slapped with regret and fear. <i>Where was the Captain? Is everyone dead?</i> Across from you was the burnt body of a solider that attempted to crawl his way to freedom and was quickly denied by the large beasts. The smell of the dead body tossed you further into reality and you stood up. Quickly regretting that action, you nearly fell back down from the soreness throughout your body. Recovering to the best of your ability, you slowly made your way closer to the inner caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharred remains of Weapons and armor littered the grounds. Throughout the area you found a gruesome sight. It appeared that none of the group you were in made it out alive. All fourteen men, were either charred, broken or split open. This, to your slight relief, also included that sadistic captain. <i>'Serves you right you wretch.'</i> Figuring the dragons had won the battle, you sighed with relief. Your actions at least were able to spare an innocent family during this damned war. Leaning against the rock wall of the cave, you smelled the air. Only the copper smell of blood and burnt flesh entered your nostrils and you nearly vomited again. Looking behind your rest area you try head out but see a large dragon standing watch outside the entrance. Freezing in place, you try to think of what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright, these creatures either spared my life, didn't notice me, or thought i was dead... alright scratch that last thought, dead to them seems to be maimed beyond recognition. I could try to speak with the one out there, but how am I to know they didn't just miss me in the assault?

Then the rocking and noise stopped and it simply sat there, innocent black shell staring innocently at you. As if it's tantalizing humming and rustling had merely meant to draw you inside the cave without letting you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared around the cave from the mouth, not quite sure if you wanted to enter in case there were any, less friendly Dragons still lurking. When you were sure that nothing lurked inside but the shiny black egg only a few yards away you skirt over the border and close the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cave it was sweltering. You could feel sweat forming on your face and your breath dampening the air as you walked. The humid atmosphere bothered you slightly. The egg was now in front of you, non intrusive, just clean and black. A great shining dark enigma perched in the middle of a circle of rocks and some straw.... hang on... was the straw smoking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn closer inspection you saw that indeed, small plumes of smoke were rolling from beneath the egg, and as you looked closer you saw the charred remains of old straw beneath it. A few embers even still remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'were they cooking the egg?!'</i> you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as you laid one hand on the egg it felt cool to the touch, smooth and glass like, and rapidly becoming colder. You felt a small shiver beneath your palm and realized the egg was vibrating slightly, convulsively. Sharp realization hit you - It needs to be kept hot!<br>\r\nyou rushed out of the cave to the nearest tree and began to carve splinters out of it with your small knife, when you had enough you rushed back into the cave, placed them beneath the egg and called your last bit of energy you could form with your adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flammo\" you murmered softly. The warm crackling flames of a fire burning for hours appeared at the base, lapping happily at the egg and adding smoke, decreasing oxygen from the cave. Still you stood there watching as again, the egg began to stop vibrating and continued its placid humming. <br>\r\nSlowly, it rocked back and forth, back and forth, the metronome again, gradually picking up speed as it did so. You were transfixed watching the fire dance as the shadow of the egg engorged on the back wall with each movement. The fire got bigger and bigger, lapping up the sides of the black shell as it did so, hungrily working it's way to engulf the egg as it did so. You still could not move as the eggs momentum reached top speeds, and the fire thoroughly concealed it's color you watched almost helplessly as the egg burned alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ominous noise startled you to your senses, it was hatching! You have no idea what baby dragons are like, or what havoc they can cause. You have no idea how to care for one, if they're lethal at birth, or if the mother was coming back for it. All you know is that this dragon is hatching NOW, and it's family isn't here.. It's all alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWary of any unknown spell but curious as the dead cat you decide to try it out but you take precautions. You tap the power and say \u201cObex ut vox\u201d weaving a warding around yourself that would prevent anything born of your power passing beyond it. This way should something go wrong you could at least be sure of not starting a forest fire, something you didn't think of in your earlier rage. The thought burns your cheeks, you were never prone to angry outbursts, not to mention never used magic in one of the few and certainly never woven fire for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWeaving shields against magic was usually effective against yourself, but situations where that is useful are rare. For that matter shielding is rarely useful, against another you need nearly four times the power to block an action of theirs. Much better to block the result than the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNone the less it had it's function here. Then touching the power you incant \u201clux lucis of incendia\u201d As you speak you catch sight of the baby dragon, a shifting of colors slightly askew of those behind it. It's eyes catch yours and then they vanish as you complete the incantation, you step back in surprise and your own hand at the edge of your vision vanishes as well. Bringing it in front of your eyes does nothing to reestablish it's existence. If you couldn't feel it you would have been sure it was gone, your legs and torso as well, you can only assume about the head. That feather on your consciousness is back, like another mind just touching. You are sure this time that it is the dragon, you feel as if you could point to it, even though it was now completely invisible. You think of the firestorm again, still wondering how you controlled it and to your shock suddenly you burst into flames, the dragon too, it's skin glowing like hot iron as flames leapt as much as a meter above the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSurprisingly the dragon seemed unfazed, and equally surprising you could not feel anything either. The flames were touching the trees surrounding you but the trees did not catch, then you notice, the flames do not curl around the branch, they pass right through it. Then they vanish and you are standing there with the dragon pup, no longer the orange of the night before, nor the red hot iron color but a deep crimson with a few patches of polished brass or copper. \u201cExpello vox\u201d The shield and lux lucis of incendia stop pulling from your power and you finally release it. The dragon instantly vanishes again, only visible by the slight distortion as it's chest expands and contracts as it breathes and the eyes that seem to look out of nowhere. That brush against the mind came again. \u201cFire's Light, Hide, Safe.\u201d and again the sense of being able to point to the dragon without looking. Hide, Safe. Of course! The spell is of illusions, but that was fire magic you drew on, not illusion. Light not the mind. Maybe it would even fool illusionists, who could sense normal illusions and even see right through them if they were strong. Then another thing hit you, you've been channeling all morning, if there were any other mages present within a mile they would know what had passed. Running and still somehow knowing that the dragon was following close behind like a lizard streaking across the ground, and completely ignorant of the direction you are taking you just know that you must get away, you touch the power and call out \u201cVelieris nos, Velieris vox,\u201d You feel the shields around you and the dragon form, and almost trip for not seeing your feet, the power felt distant now, as it always is when you shield it from others. You keep running, night sets in, the second night in a row you have run, the second night in a row you feared to be set upon by humans as much or more than the noble dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou run through the next morning as well, and as you do you begin to recover your senses you feel a thread of the power fueling your muscles and almost trip again for the shock, you had heard some things could be done with the power without incantations, most concerning your own body and all taking the direst of desperation or the greatest of wills to achieve. It was like the illusions, but they were only partially guided by the mind and they had shifted erratically. Even knowing this you keep running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompendium of Spells in this chapter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlux lucis of incendia - Light of the fire - An ambiguous spell that allows the user to bend light through the fire element. The illusion itself is controlled by the mind of the caster and can easily shift from one thing to another for example thinking of hiding brings invisibility and the thought of the firestorm created illusionary flames. These illusions are relatively easy to break, even a hand passing through them will cause the illusion to vanish altogether (Though the fool who sticks his hand in the fire, illusionary or otherwise probably deserves a burnt hand to prevent a repeat performance)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObex ut vox - Shield the power - This spell shields the power, think circuit breaker, if a spell cast by the user draws to much power he or she will be instantly cut off for an instant (the shield loses power too therefore power is regained but all active spells are cut off). Shields can also be used to block other mages but almost four times the power being blocked is required to maintain the shield, therefore it can only be used if the power difference between you and your opponent is extremely significant, even then both of you are now wide open to other mages or even simple soldiers. It is regarded as far better to simply fight the result, e.g. put out the fire or ground the lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpello Vox - Dispell the power - Regarded as the proper way to end your spells, simply dropping the power off the spell sometimes has explosive results as the tail end of the power has no stopper. This spell actually forces the power to the void, unlike a shield which cuts the user off from the power, though the buffering effects are similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelieris nos - Hide us - A less ambiguous invisibility spell, the target us is defined by the mind at the initiation of the spell and is more stable than the first spell. This is another spell unconsciously gleaned through a link to the dragon. Desperation drove this spell which would normally need incredible concentration to maintain a wide enough spell focus to touch both Trent and his draconic partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelieris Vox - Hide the power - Does what it says, prevents another mage from feeling the power used by the caster or the inherent talent in the caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe title \"Vox of incendia lux lucis\" means; The power of Fire's Light</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most people would feel shame fleeing unknown foes two nights in a row but you've always remembered what you were taught by the defensive mages. \"A skilled defensive mage can take any hit with impunity, a master knows not to be there when the hit lands\" and so you ran seeking shelter in any form. Something in which to collect, think things through and plan. Another brush against the conciousness, an ostrich feather to a sparrows of the ones before. \u201cTwo-leg seen-ones, They will see-smell-hear us, Defendo officio odoratus et sonor\u201d This time you did trip. To your mind the pictures the dragon sent seemed to fit those words and that last was just a strong feeling of lack of smells or sounds, but those words seem to fit it so well somehow. Already touching the power you say the words, you can't tell if anything has changed but you try to make a whistling sound and nothing comes out, you speak and nothing again. You pick yourself up off the ground and take off in another direction. Branches snap and leaves shift as you run but no sound seems to come from anything caused by you and the dragon. The dragons presence is almost palpable now, you know exactly where it is behind you, sometimes beside, but never ahead. Every now and then another image passes through your consciousness. \u201cNo two-leg seen-ones.\u201d \u201cSky-fire low, sore legs soon rest.\u201d \u201cRock-roof ahead\u201d The last was a cave, the picture from the dragon showed you exactly how to get there. The route was fairly circuitous it seemed unlikely anything would be in the cave. Briefly you wonder how the dragon could have known that, it certainly wasn't in anybodies line of sight until they are right on top of it. \u201cCurvo inlustris visus\u201d Another spell, how did the dragon know these. The dragons spells had all been pretty harmless, you shield, \u201cObex ut vox\u201d and speak the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are almost blinded. Everything around you is now visible, on all sides. Everything for almost a mile by your estimation, it's hard to tell really. You reduce the flow of power to the spell and the radius reduces, a bit easier to process. Amazing, it's better than one of those lenses that some commanders use. It's disorienting but you can see the cave now, every facet of it's entrance inside and out, at least until there is no more light to see. You cut power to the spell with a quick \u201cTerminus,\u201d you doubt you could walk and maintain that particular spell simultaneously. You proceed to the cave at a slower place, there was no immediate danger within a mile, and take notice of the forest. Still within dragon held lands there was no signs of human habitation, a truly beautiful and tranquil place, your spells mean that some of the shyer wildlife come a great deal closer to you than ever before. Reaching the cave a sense of relief washes over you. You drop the shields with another \u201cTerminus\u201d leaving only the warding against the detection of the power. Instead you turn to the mouth of the cave and turn your mind to the creation of appropriate defensive wardings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContego porta quod nos ex foris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an afterthought you say \u201cIncendia vacuus fomitis\u201d Having to then reduce the power tenfold as the fire flared up far beyond what it should with the amount of power supplied. The dragon curled up by the fire, invisible though it was you were sure of it, just not sure of why you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach makes it's presence known and you realize that you have not eaten for a whole day. You leave the cave, the dragon does not follow you this time, and head a short way into the forest. There you snare several rabbits with the most humane methods you can think of and return to the cave. You drop two of the rabbits in front of the dragon, and put the rest into the fire with a crude kabob. A good meal later your lie down on the hard rock and release all hold on the power but for the wards and a smaller version of the fire. No longer fueling your limbs with the power they hang limp and you fall almost immediately to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRousing In the morning without incident, you make plans. No matter what you do you want to learn more about this dragon and this bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Spell Information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefendo officio odoratus et sonor - ward against smell and sound - neutralizes any sound or smell produced by the spells target, by nature an air spell but not particularly difficult for anybody to wield. Another spell instinctively used by illusionist dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurvo inlustris visus - Bend light to my sight - In the same way illusions bend light around the target this spell redirects light towards the eyes of the caster allowing them to see as if from the point from which the light was bent. This spell can be refined to target light at a specific location with practice instead of redirecting all light within range of the caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerminus - End - Can be used to cut off ongoing spells, many variations of this spell exist and some are typically favoured in different institutions but some people just use what comes to mind at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContego porta quod nos ex foris. - Shield the entrance from us and outsiders. - A constructed defensive warding designed to block anything of the casters from leaving, and any outsiders from entering. If the spell fails, the drain of energy it will cause the caster to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nincendia vacuus fomitis - Fire without fuel - A spell which creates a flame of variable size (Variable is based on the power supplied and the strength in the fire element) Does not consume air, wood or oil in it's burning and is useful in situations where little air is present such as in a cave. it is also useful in combat with wielders of air who would seek to remove fires fuel from the field in an attempt to extinguish the flame.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe very next day you made the decision to proceed into the dragon lands, for all you knew they might hold information on bonds between humans and dragons, certainly humans didn't seem to and if they did it was buried so far that your bound to be caught before you get it. For all you knew warrants for your arrest and your description were being distributed to any and all settlements. The dragons certainly seemed the safer option for the moment. That was two weeks ago anyway, and now your wondering why you chose a slog through Jumpin wood instead of civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThose weeks had been constant walking, hunting, and sleeping. The black suit from the raid long worn and tattered, the hunting had seen to that. Your hunting has also improved, the illusions really help hunting prey, if they cannot see, smell or hear you they aren't likely to run away unless they happen to bump into you. You suppose it's a bit unfair for the animals. You don't even give them a chance to feel fear. The weeks have also given you a chance to think. You think there is a link between the eclipse's color and the increase in fire magic. You woke up that first morning to find the dragon sleeping unscathed, in the fire you had created the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little dragon was the main reason for the problems you encounter on this journey. His mind is now in constant contact with yours and over the weeks of this growing connection he has become more fluent, originally the messages were still pictures, then the same overlaid with a word and now he just sounds like a child of their fifth year of life. Anything he said about himself was accompanied by a picture of the sun moving across the sky to the moon moving the opposite way until they crossed and the moon blotted out the sun except for a ring of fire burning brightly where the moon couldn't cover the whole sun. The image seemed to translate to Eclipse of the burning shadow and you just started calling him Eclipse. He had a name for you as well, two-leg shadow walker. You think you'll persist with Trent though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThroughout all this, you continued to practice your magic. Every night you spend one hour reviewing defensive magic, fortifying the camp site, preparing trap/wards using spells such as \u201cvoco terra parietis\u201d and \u201cTriggered terra vorago\u201d a wall of earth and a trap which will become a hole in the ground the moment someone steps on it, respectively. Traps were good because it took only a small flow of the power to maintain them until the trap is triggered, a better gamble than to put a hole in the ground and cover it up every night. Another hour was spent practicing elemental magics, sometimes it is necessary to know that what you have wrought will not continue to exist. A third hour went into practicing the illusion spells that passed through the link, you've already managed to control the illusions more precisely and even some others that don't shift when your mind chooses something else to look at. The spell that extends sight also has been tamed so that you can choose to see from only one point as if you were standing there. Most of the illusions drew from fire but some drew from air, lightning and water as well. Many in fact were combinations of two elements working in concert. Fire to weave light and air to produce sensation were prevalent amongst the more complex spells that came across the bond. One spell that you haven't tried yet for fear of discovery is \u201cdivum lux lucis\u201d which by careful analysis of the flow of magic it drew seemed to involve throwing a mass of light into the air and having it shatter into tiny multicolored fragments. What use this might have evades you for the moment but you suppose it could be used in signaling, except that anybody in a hundred miles would be able to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tToday is a morning like any other and the first thing you do is mutter \u201cSinus lux lucis ut meus os\u201d Wincing in the moment of disorientation as your sight shifts to a point several hundred feet above the ground, definitely somewhere your sight shouldn't be naturally. You look down and a sense of cold dread. There is a black mass moving through the forest and others moving towards it. It takes a moment to realize that the first is a unit similar to the one you were assigned to and the others are shadows. There is no hope to run. That many dragons and that large an army, the battle will spread miles. Both sides wouldn't hesitate to take you down, least ways you think they wouldn't to the dragons your another human in a black suit and to the humans your a deserter and possibly they might even know by now you are traveling with Eclipse. Eclipse's eyes are beside yours, somehow you already know he doesn't channel magic but somehow he still twists light, You feel his mind next to yours as well. \u201cPrepare friend for today we lead the dance of light.\u201d A flood of possible illusion and defensive spells wash into you from the dragon. Since when did Eclipse have defensive spells to give, most of them still linked to the creation of light, but they would be almost impossible to dispel outright because they were no longer sustained by power. Returning your sight to your body you stand next to Eclipse and say \u201cpermissum nos exsisto turpis quod incuratus, quod voco leviter vesica\u201d You feel a weight in your invisible hand and you grip it tightly, you feel a thread of the power moving to it, to maintain it's lightlessness and another to you and another to Eclipse. Another still moves in your arms and your legs strengthening them so that you can run or fight faster and longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpell descriptions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nvoco terra parietis - summon earth wall - Defensive magic, manipulates target earth into a wall-like structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriggered terra vorago - Triggered earth hole - prepares to create a hole in the ground when the trigger is met, Defensive warding magic, useful in that it only draws significant energy when triggered which saves repeated use when the hole will not necessarily be needed<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndivum lux lucis - Sky Lights - Essensially magical fireworks, can be used as a flare to alert forces miles away or amuse children to great effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\npermissum nos exsisto turpis quod incuratus, quod voco leviter vesica - let us be unseen and unheard, and summon the lightless blade - Three spell inclusive construct, nulifies any light or sound produced or reflected by the caster and summons an invisible sword through defensive magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitle - ut vicis goes per - As time goes by.</span></div></div>",

The humans are now within half a mile and you drop the spell. In your fortifications you wait until you hear some of the men approaching, talking as they marched even with the imminent danger of a skirmish with dragons. \u201cAll this for a deserter, even a mage. Why are we doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA second voice replies \u201cIt's orders, anyway would you want your companies mage to go running off to leave a whole squad to die? It's got to be a lesson same as any deserter is hanged. The trackers say he was with a dragon, albeit a small one. He's a traitor too.\u201d One of the men pointed to your hiding place. \u201cThere, the trackers say that was the last place the trail leads to, can't say I see where he might be, the whole place is out in the open even if it is fortified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe men spread out trying to encircle your outcropping of rock, one steps on your pitfall trap and the ring of earth around the fortification collapses, throwing more than twenty men into the pit which then collapsed in on itself leaving rough ground and crushing the men. You wince at that thought but it had to be done, especially after what they just said. You bring up the sword as a cry of \u201cundermine calx , teres calx\u201d from at least three different sources collapses your walls and then flattens the rubble to a clear road. Leaving you standing atop the hill, you feel Eclipse beside you straighten and somehow you know he is readying a flame, his teeth are bared and the red inside of his mouth just visible. The men falter however, you hear them asking where you are, \u201cHow can he have escaped?\u201d \u201cHe must be here somewhere.\u201d \u201cDispel.\u201d \u201cDispel\u201d You feel the power push against your illusions but they remain inviolate. \u201cHow, such power.\u201d Keeping your voice low you draw fire and say \u201cSpeculum\u201d and a number of reverse Trent's appear randomly on the hill wielding flaming swords. They charge the men. The mages continue shouting \u201cDispel\u201d until one has the idea to try attacking directly, \u201cIncendium Flagellum\u201d The cry is repeated by the other mages of whom five have now arrived. The fire whips cut through the charging illusions and they dissipated but others appeared to take their place, the swordsmen were even less effective, engaged in duels against foes who are infinitely flexible and fast, but who would do no returned harm. With a word \u201cincendium\u201d the flames of the swords became real and suddenly each man who dueled an illusion was falling down screaming at the burns while the illusions moved on to a new target, becoming dancing nightmares. \u201c\u201d The whips of fire held by the mages became water and again the whips sliced through the men and dissipating the swords. Still in the half minute it had taken the mages to react to tactics they had never seen before a good fifty soldiers had been downed and several more were barely walking. Eclipse let loose a firestorm that engulfed nearly the whole attacking force however you could see through it, men fled with terror at the illusionary flames and only a few were caught in the actual flame. Eclipse beat his wings and leapt off the ground. His first flight, how timely you thought. Still invisible three dragons of different colors appeared around him, all apparently dodging the mages whips of fire, water and even one of thunder. Meanwhile you put a hand to the ground and say \u201cBake terra\u201d Cracks run through the ground and steam rises while the men leap from foot to foot trying to get off the burning earth. They try to charge you again and this time the illusions who face them are not simple humans but flaming demons with horns and poleaxes, the flames and the axes were real and that was enough. More than a few of the men broke and fled at the sight of them, over the scorched earth and at the expense of the soles of their feet. The rest perished as the demons charged them, setting alight any they touched and any who evaded them met the sharp blade of the summoned poleaxes. The mages still to preoccupied with the illusionary dragons under the command of Eclipse to save the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe final stroke was the spell \u201cdivum lux lucis\u201d The ball of light in the form of a fireball seemed to explode from the top of the hill and shoot high into the air before shattering and falling in a rain of fire. The soldiers routed and were off the field before the first flame fell, the mages routed too, overwhelmed by being unable to tell the illusions from the realities, still wielding their whips they fled with a total lack of decorum, trying to keep an eye on the illusionary dragons of eclipse as well as the now nearer real dragons. The dragons are in fact doing something quite unusual, they are waiting. The humans now retreating there was no honour in attacking. A second later you realize that was not your thought but Eclipses. You too are content to let the humans flee, interesting that you think of them as humans now not people. Certainly they are still people but it is almost as if your no longer one of them.<br>\r\nYou settle down as the last of the illusionary flames settle into the ground. Hopefully the dragons will turn back now, given that the fight is no longer going to happen. You don't think you can fight dragons too, somehow your power with fire has significantly increased and illusions don't take all that much power but so much fire and so many illusions, easy enough to overwhelm five reasonably weak mages, which was probably why there were five, none of them were trained defensively. But it was not power enough for anything to spare. You tuck the invisible sword into a sheath taken from one of the perished soldiers and tie it to your belt. To your relief the dragons turn away and begin flying east. Relief until you notice four of them remaining anyway, low flying they came to a landing off over the scorched earth of the hill. Two dull grey like iron, and one as burnished silver with one scarlet dragon circling overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Silver dragon spoke. As it did you notice it's tongue is the same color as it's scales. \u201cYou have been accused of the abduction of a child and the possible murder of the same child. You will submit to the court of twelve dragons. Come.\u201d Whatever force decided this dragons tongue should be silver had an immense sense of humor. \u201cStep forward and be taken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompendium of spells:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nundermine calx , teres calx \u2013 undermine stone smooth stone \u2013 collapses the ground beneath stone then  makes the rubble smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeculum \u2013 mirror \u2013 Illusionary spell which creates a number of mirror images of the caster, these images are granted relative autonomy to achieve the purpose of their creation, they vanish when power is removed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cI submit.\u201d You say, surely Eclipse is enough evidence. He followed you, not that his company isn't welcome. Not to mention he was most definitely alive, hovering overhead and slightly behind you. Then you realize that the other dragons might not know he was there. In face, almost certainly not or they wouldn't have accused you of murder at least. You touched that overlap between your thoughts and thought to Eclipse, \u201cCan you drop the illusion?\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d comes a reply. \u201cHow do you normally do it?\u201d \u201cBy needing to do it, I want to but unless it's my life it's not a need. Sorry. You can do it though, if you can get a spell out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou touch the power and Whisper \u201cRectus Lux Lucis\u201d Two things happen simultaneously the first is what you expected, Eclipse appears, Shining polished copper scales surrounding darker bronze as they had been for the last week when they had stopped changing. The other probably should have been expected, the silver dragon roared \u201cHe's incanting!\u201d and leaped onto you pinning you to the ground with a claw. The iron dragons moved to either side of the silver and the reds swooped before one of them saw Eclipse and told the others. You try to say \u201cSee he's alive,\u201d try because the silver dragons claw is still weighing heavily on your chest. The silver dragon's claw eases up a bit, Just a bit though, enough to say \u201cI really do submit, I've done nothing wrong.\u201d Low growls emit from all of the dragons and the silver dragon tightens it's claws again. You feel a flash of fear as the dragons wings beat hard and lift it off the ground, leaving you hanging in it's claws nothing but the sight of it's belly, wings and the occasional flash of sky. And of course the ever present sense of Eclipse back at the camp. Through his ears you hear the female red dragon saying. \u201cCome with us child. You shall be cared for. You must learn child not to run away.\u201d The red dragons take off and then the grey ones. Eclipse follows after but he says to you \u201cI'm following for you not for them. I'm not a child!\u201d The distance increasing you cut the spell to keep Eclipse visible. A sense of amusement comes through the link as the dragons immediately start to look around for him. You chuckle too but it is hard to be amused when the wind feels like it is going to tear your hair out and the silver dragons claws definitely needed to loosen up a bit. Your going to be very bruised at the end of this journey. That is if you manage to avoid any broken bones. The journey only takes a few hours. You don't know where you are or how far you've traveled and Eclipse doesn't yet have much practice in figuring out how far or in what direction. All he could tell you is \u201cit's hard to keep up, we're going fast.\u201d So when you descended all you knew is that you had gone west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA few feet from the ground the silver dragon drops you and the iron dragons swoop into take a positions beside you. Aching you raise yourself to your feet, taking three tries to do so. The silver dragon lands and directs you to a cave entrance and down a semi-lit passageway with several pathways  off to the side. The silver dragon points you to one of them and says \u201cYou are a guest here unless you are deemed guilty, you will be provided with food and water, but remember that while you are a guest you may not leave until you have faced the court of twelve dragons.\u201d the words seemed formal, like a watchman reading the rights to a man about to be arrested. The next had less of a ritual tone but were still formal. \u201cYou are human and a mage. You are permitted to practice magic, or perform any other action you desire so long as that action does not negatively affect any dragon nor in any way cause you to be at or to affect a location outside of the bounds of this cave. You will be watched and sent for when the court is ready to sit. Remember, there is a war on and time may not be found for a criminal against an army for a long time.\u201d The ritual tone came back. \u201cI leave you now and give you time to contemplate your role in this crime. Prepare your words wisely.\u201d The silver dragon left, followed by one of the iron ones, the other settled down to watch and the reds were nowhere to be found but you would have bet a ton to a pound that they were still with Eclipse. Who was somewhere further away from you than he had ever been in his life. Though your quite sure he is still in the complex somewhere, worrying but in pleasant surroundings by the impression of the bond. He still doesn't talk all that much and probably has his own problems to worry about just at the moment so his lack of communication is acceptable. You look around, there wasn't much to the cave, it was large enough for a young dragon, about fifteen feet by fifteen feet, though hardly square, and the roof about twenty feet high. A few small stalactites and stalagmites but none more than a foot long. The majority of the floor was covered in hay and that about counts for everything. At least your not running anymore you think and settle down to wait. Implementing defensive magic to create bedding using a complicated little spell that created a bubble of water and increased the surface tensile strength with the essence of the nearby earth so that it formed a pillow and a sort of thin mattress. Then you go for a look around the caves using \u201cSinus lux lucis ut meus os.\u201d You can only figure out so much by sight, sound is to difficult to carry with air over such distance and around corners, light only works because it is not physical and is a manipulation of pure energy. None the less you are pretty sure that this place is a nursery much larger than the nest you were going to attack earlier. You cut the spell when you hear someone approaching. The silver dragon returned with a small red dragon maybe halfway through it's first year growth spurt. The silver dragon spoke again in a ritual tone. \u201cYou have remained our guest this hour, you have shown that you may be trusted and so I must ask your word of honour not to try to escape. Do you give your word of honour?\u201d You thought of Eclipse and even if you did escape, could he, from what you were getting through the bond he seemed almost as restricted as you were, even if for different reasons, whatever they might be. \u201cI give my word of honour and seal myself to lux lucis quod estus of flamma.\u201d Where had that last bit come from. The silver dragon seemed a little taken aback too, only a little. \u201cThen your word is taken and the guard shall be relieved, a child instead will watch for chance that another might seek to break your word in your stead.\u201d The ritual ended he said \u201cYou know of the flame oath, how?\u201d \u201cI don't, is that what it is called, what is it, I just said it.\u201d you reply. The silver dragon almost seemed to smile. \u201cIt is the most binding oath of a fire dragon. I may visit you, you know of dragons and steal a child but you do not seem to be cruel like most of those we face, and in fact you are barely on the cusp of those we leave, though you didn't it seems so perhaps this is a repayance of sorts.\u201d Okay that was odd, he seems to be convinced of your guilt but interested too. For that matter he is interesting to you as well, Eclipse doesn't know much of what dragons do. He was only born the day he met you. Perhaps you could learn why the dragons started this war and why they leave villages and any other non-combatants alone. Certainly it seems as if the silver tongue may have been a part of his character, not a twisted sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe, relatively, small dragon settled himself, your not sure how you could tell but your sure of it, down to watch, obviously expecting to have a long boring watch of the human. Well maybe it was but you still wanted to practice illusion. Drawing power and saying \u201clux lucis of flamma\u201d you create three different colored balls of light and try to juggle them, all the while making sure that each stayed the same color as it had started. Gradually you increased the speed and number of balls until you had seven balls of light, each one color of the rainbow, no longer being juggled but spinning around in a complex pattern of light similar to that some illusionists entertained crowds with at the fair. The difference is that these are real light while the others are pictured in the persons mind, depending on the skill of the illusionist there may even be variation between what one person saw to the next even if it was similar. This way everyone saw the same thing. The young dragon was staring, obviously no longer bored. You laugh and create some more complex light shows before switching to changing the environment, forcing you to use a more complex spell, it is impossible to imagine a whole environment in much detail and maintain it in that detail for the duration of the spell. \u201cvultus lux lucis ut meus mos\u201d will do. You create a lush forest grove and then a desert oasis then the back alley of a city street. Then you were standing in open sky with no ground visible. Even your own imagination it probably would have made you flinch if you had not been using Sinus lux lucis ut meus os every morning. The only thing you did not do was become invisible. You thought it would be safer that way. The young dragon was practically leaping from toe to toe now, obviously it had been told not to speak to you, it seemed to be bursting to now. You say hello to it and say \u201cany requests\u201d You almost burst out laughing as it obviously struggles between the desire to do as it was instructed and the desire to make a request. For several hours you practice before another young dragon arrives with a carcass and a skin of water. It lays both at the entrance and says to the the other dragon \u201cI've got the next watch of the human, matron says you should hurry to the dinner hall before the others eat the whole lot by themselves. The hunters brought in lots of deer today, even the human gets a whole one.\u201d The other dragon says \u201cThanks I'm starved\u201d and runs off up the hall. You pull the venison over on magical solid and summon a fire beneath it, leaving it to cook rotating slowly you tie the spell off so that you don't need to think about it.<br>\r\nThen you lie down on the bedding you made earlier. Even though the bubble doesn't break it still feels weird with a bed made out of water, it sloshed when you rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter the meat was cooked you ate some and left the rest encased in magical solid to preserve it until tomorrow. Shortly after several young dragons including that first red show up and say to the watching dragon that they had come to help relieve a bit of the boredom. They all clustered around the cave entrance looking nothing so much as a group of children trying to spy on something they were not supposed to see through a small window. A thing you yourself had been caught at and punished for a number of times as a child. Chuckling to yourself you heard one of them say \u201cYou lied Reodrad, he's boring.\u201d another said \u201cShush Theran, I think he's asleep. Anyway if he was doing what Reodrad said he probably couldn't do it all day long.\u201d This voice was definitely female and reminded Trent again of a little girl telling the little boys off thinking she was three years older. Trent had had one of those back home too, later he had quite liked that girl as he remembered. \u201cIf it's anything like your breathing fire he probably cant do it for more than thirty seconds at once Theran.\u201d That brought a bunch of giggling, an odd sound to hear from dragons even if they were children. You quietly say the words first to alter your point of vision so that to you it seemed like you were standing in front of them, even though that was only what your eyes were telling you, your back was still comfortably on the water bed. Then you drew light of the flame again. Creating an orb of light that floated white in front of the dragons. Several pulled back then leaned forward eagerly, you hadn't done anything that they could see so it must have come as a shock to see something. You make the ball split into seven different orbs of the colors of the rainbow again, you make them spin in a complex spherical pattern until you throw them all back into the middle where they collided in an explosion of multicolored sparks. You figure that entertaining these child dragons is as good a way to practice illusion as anything. It would be nice if they would talk to you though, if that silver dragon comes back maybe you'll ask about that and about seeing Eclipse again of course. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tIt was an exhilarating feeling, flying. Free even from predators, though for a dragon not many of them existed for dragons. Except humans. But their numbers made up for that lack. The only one you can trust is Trent. Only Trent. You felt him in the back of your mind, pain passed through the bond. Too much pain. That silver needs to let go a bit. Why couldn't he ride on you anyway. You had thought to offer but thought better of it seeing the red female and thinking of the attitude Trent could remember Dragons showing humans. You doubt that to allow one on your back would be regarded as sane by that dragon. She already thought you were a child, no need to add nuts to the mix. Mixed nuts, rumbling laughter came from your throat. Trent had had some in the pack he carried, there weren't many but they had tasted good. Another rumble of laughter at the thought change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThough the link you felt the power Trent draws from waning and knew that soon he would vanish into the shadows. The silver dragon was getting too far away, the spell takes more effort when affecting something further away. It was an alarming drain of power. You think at Trent \u201cI'm following you not them.\u201d You keep flying, working hard to keep up with the bigger dragons. Trent finally cuts the spell. You laugh again as the red female twists to find you, looking everywhere. You call out \u201cI'm here.\u201d The red dragon looks at you annoyed, you wonder if she should be paying more attention to where she is flying, \u201cReveal yourself this instant!\u201d You look at her, \u201cI can't, Trent revealed me and he's too far away now.\u201d She growls but turns back to her path. Still having some trouble keeping up you tell Trent so because you want to communicate but just after that he becomes rater distracted and the pain reaches a peak. You figure he is probably landing. By the comparative speed you would say maybe another hour of flying before you land. The hour passed, slowly. As you landed you felt relief, your wings had been stretched out far to long. You fold them at your sides with satisfaction and follow the beckoning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe leads you through a series of caves, the main passageway over a hundred feet tall and some of the side passages were the same. She led you to an enormous cave filled with young dragons, most were red of one shade or another. Four were green, three blue, three yellow and one black. The black was the smallest of all of them, probably no older than yourself. \u201cGo and meet your kin, little one. And try not to get stepped on, remember we can't see you.\u201d The red female turned to leave and one of the red dragons piped up, \u201cArgam came through earlier, he took Reodrad with him to watch one of the caves Matron and he ordered Reasa to watch the moment she is finished with her meal. Matron what are they watching?\u201d The matron, your guessing that it is the red female, replied with \u201cnever you mind Theran. Show this child a bed, then introduce him to the others. He is not to leave the youngling's  coup\u201d Theran looked around and you open your mouth so that he can see something. He backs away and you realize that seeing something was in fact seeing the inside of a mouth suspended in midair. You closed it again and said \u201cHi,\u201d it's what Trent always said to new people in his memories. Theran just stares, though what he's staring at your not sure, as he can't see you. \u201cHe's an illusionist, you've studied them in your lessons now stop gawking and do as I have said.\u201d The matron obviously thought that saying jump meant jump now. Theran said \u201cFollow me\u201d and scurried off into the crowd of young dragons. You followed and were led to a series of caves which were small enough that only first year dragons could possibly fit. Theran directed you to one of these and said \u201cHere's yours.\u201d You remember where it is then you set off with Theran. He leads you back to the hall and calls out over the din. \u201cEverybody. We have a new dragon with us.\u201d The other dragons are looking at him funny, at least you think they are, you haven't had much experience with reading expressions. \u201cWhere.\u201d One of them calls out. \u201cHere, he's an illusionist.\u201d The other dragons are starting to turn away, obviously thinking he's  stringing them on. Theran looks at you and hisses, \u201cOpen you mouth, that'll show them.\u201d You open you mouth and the whispers start amongst the children. Then at the right moment. So much so that you almost doubt that it was a coincidence you feel the light around you shift and you are visible. A touch from your link tells you that the timing was coincidence but he will help you stay like that. You know that he is practicing magic again but don't know what. The words he thinks mean nothing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTheran moves away to talk to others. You move through the crowd but none of the others seem to want to talk to you. In the end you find another who seems to be alone. The small black dragon. Up close you notice that it's wing on the left side is deformed. It probably will never fly. After your own first attempt your not sure if this is a blessing or a curse but somehow you know that it is the latter. You have a choice to fly or not at least. None the less your own wings still ache. \u201cHi,\u201d you say to it. \u201cHi,\u201d it replies, \u201cWhat is an illusionist dragon? I haven't started my lessons yet I don't know anything.\u201d You reply \u201cI don't know myself. I'm only two weeks old and this is the first thing I've said to a dragon. I think it might have something to do with the fact that normally no-one sees me. Trent's always going on about illusions and that's when he goes invisible too so I think thats right.\u201d The other dragon looked at you and said \u201cI thought you said you hadn't talked to a dragon before.\u201d \u201cTrent's not a dragon. He's a human, the only one I can trust. He saved me from the other humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore you knew it the black dragon has leapt onto you crying out and trying to claw you, screaming \u201cHUMAN'S KILLED MY PARENTS. THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED ME TOO IF THEIR MAGE HADN'T RUN AWAY. I'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN, NEVER FLY ALL BECAUSE OF HUMANS, AND THEY SHOULD DIE. ALL OF THEM. ONE TO TRUST, MY PARENTS TOLD ME THAT, AS THEY DIED SLOWLY\u201d You manage to get out from under him and your need pulls the illusions from Trent and you vanish, at the same time three other Yous jumped out and formed a circle in front of the black dragon. The black dragon tore at them as more appeared and surrounded him \u201cTHERE WILL BE ONE TO TRUST THEY SAID, WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS THEY TRUSTED WAS PROBABLY THE ONE THAT KILLED THEM.\u201d \u201cThanatos that is enough!\u201d The matron bellowed as she entered the hall to see the confrontation. You notice for the first time that every other dragon in the room had surrounded you and Thanatos. The illusions fade and you become visible again. The matron crosses the hall \u201cThat crack damaged your wing not your head. Now leave. Remain in your cave until you are summoned.\u201d Your not sure anybody else heard it but your sure Thanatos said under his breath, \u201cYou will love and you need the bond to temper you. I'll show them temper.\u201d Before storming off to the caves. The matron looks at you. \u201cThere will be no brawling amongst the children, Again and you shall be sent off like Thanatos here.\u201d Then she walks off. The other dragons are looking at you. Some come up and talk to you, you continue the conversation. By the time the hunters arrive with a ridiculous number of deer you are firm friends with one green dragon named Feran, two male reds called Thuras and Dacha and one female red called Riallin. When only a few deer were left, though how even this many young dragons got through that much meat eludes you, another child dragon entered the hall, practically bouncing up and down if not literally. He ran to his friends who happened to be Feran, Thuras, Dacha and Riallin as well as Theran, the dragon from earlier. You heard him tell them about the human he was guarding, probably Trent, and how he was making the room change with magic, definitely Trent. The rest of them were skeptical and agreed to follow him after he had eaten. Then he notices you, and says \u201cWho's this? He new here.\u201d Your introduced and introduced in turn, his name is Reodrad. You explain what you are, and how you got here, Reodrad nearly hit the roof when you said you had arrived with the human. After dinner you started to follow them but Theran said, \u201cThe matron said you don't leave here, I'm sorry.\u201d They left and you went to the cave to rest, allowing invisibility to retake you so that you didn't run into Thanatos again. That was easy now, to shift in and out of that illusion. Something had been fixed in that fight with Thanatos. Resting you settle down and watch the show Trent is putting on through his own eyes.</span></div></div>",

Finding it, you ran into the entrance of the cave and screamed the only spell that could hold them at bay for a time. \"TERRESTRIS MACERIA!\" finally noticing your motives, the captain yells out for all to attack but it was to late, your spell took effect and the earth in front of the cave quickly rose toward the ceiling, temporarily sealing it shut. Grunting from the toll of this spell, It was the most powerful therefor the most draining, you start toward the interior of the cave. Hopefully the dragons wouldn\u2019t char grill you straight away. Creeping forwards you try to not look scared, but also try to look respectful. You didn\u2019t have to walk far before you encountered the first dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the roof it fell into sight, It's black hide shining in the darkness, wings raised into an aggressive stance, teeth bared and roaring at the top of its voice. Forget trying to stay brave, you had to force yourself not to turn tail and run for the hills. \u201cP-please! I come in peace!\u201d You stutter hoping it\u2019ll hear you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Then why, human, is there an army outside? You sink so low to attack a family that has done nothing to you?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly startled at his speech inside your mind, you continue \u201cNo! I have sealed the entrance shut. I couldn\u2019t let them just slaughter your family for the hell of it!\u201d The dragon at this point seemed to lower its wings once hearing the reason the soldiers weren\u2019t moving. It then lowered it\u2019s head down so close to your face, its eye took your entire field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If you are lying to me human, I will personally see to it that you and every human following you experiences unimaginable pain until you beg for death.'</i> You nod, hands shaking slightly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear it to be true. I don\u2019t agree with the war, so to help an innocent family would be an honor.\u201d Hoping flattery would calm him, you take a step back and make an elegant bow which is usually reserved for a king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stood up to full height, eying you carefully, it seemed to be deciding whether to trust you or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it came back down to your level and muttered; <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surprised at how simple it is, your mind begins to wonder. Though you kept note of some important facts to keep the hatchling well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Be gentle when handling the egg. <br>\r\n2. Keep on your person at all times.<br>\r\n3. When moving carry firmly.<br>\r\n4. Keep warm at all times.<br>\r\n5. Once hatched feed him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... Why are you doing this. Isn't this your son? Shouldn't you be the ones taking care of him? Why in the world are you letting me, who need I remind you was part of a group who was going to kill your family, raise him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For one, you told us yourself that you were not harming my family,\"</i> said the smaller female. <i>\"Am I to think that you lied to us?\"</i> Quickly shaking your head in the negative, she continued. <i>\"We do this because it is to be. Few of our kind know of the rider's ways and fewer still know of the bond they shared. We know this because the rider's are in our blood. Our son's blood. Your blood. The bond that a rider shares with their dragon is unlike any other. We only want the best for our son. Stealing this chance from him will be as if we killed him ourselves. Now you must hurry. These men were more than likely asked to report to a superior once the mission was completed and I doubt they will not investigate why they did not return. You must head West toward the Jupin wood. There you will find our homeland. Remove a scale from my hide and show it to the dragons there. You will be safe.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you? If they find you here-\" The dragonness held up an opal claw to silence you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do not worry. We will follow shortly. Do not think that just because you will be bonded with our son means that we will not continue to be his parents. We will continue watching the both of you for as long as we are able.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, though still baffled by the events, you agreed and removed a scale and began to prepare to leave. After gathering provisions that the family gratefully provided, you head off into the mountains. You wonder where exactly to go. Jupin wood was quite the walk and, though you weren't sure, there should be a rather large river you would be required to cross. No matter though, you would get there. You began setting off holding the egg, which was quite large, very firmly.</span></div></div>",

Something was about to happen, and something was about to happen quick. One hand firmly upon the soft, leather pouch containing the valuable scale, you started a brisk jog toward a nearby tree. The fragile leaves and sturdy branches seemed to provide a firm support for some sort of ascent. As you neared the trunk, a cry of many humans reached upon your ears, and another massive din, obviously louder than the one you heard before, echoed through the boughs and branches of the tree above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill determined, you began the stealthy ascent. Having a sense that you might be watched, you made quick, silent movements, all the while being concealed by the shadows of leaves. Your view was constantly obstructed by the emerald foliage, but manage to find an opening few feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a muffled grunt, you heaved yourself up into the opening. Sunlight streamed past the emerald leaves, creating an ambient, jade glow. You looked to the direction of the noise to find a sight that left you very frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mass of men, all garbed in black armor from head to tow were marching in the opposite direction from you. Headed directly toward the dragon cave, <i>'Just like she said...'</i> Each man was mounted on his own horse. This was no small militia group, this was an attack force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay hidden, knowing what would happen if you were captured, but what of the dragons? Did they have enough time?

But I did not want to have to kill an ally.  Even though their intentions are wrong they were still humans. They may not have been the friendliest to you, but to kill your own kind just wasn't right.  Doing this would throw their slight trust in you away for probably the same amount of trust in a dragon.

Knowing that you only have about half of your magic left after your Terrestris Maceria spell, you decide to use the smallest amount possible. Focusing again on on the magic, you say the words of power. \"IMPELLO TERRA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell activates, and you focus it into pushing out the boulders at the bottom of the pile. The rocks on the top roll out of the cave's mouth, and down a steep hill, opening a gap at the top easily wide enough for you to slip out of. Feeling very proud of yourself for only using a very low level spell to accomplish your goal, you climb over the remaining pile of stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust clears and you are able to see again, you see something that makes you feel very sick indeed.

You yank of the helmet to come face to face with an older man with dark brown hair and a bushy mustache.

Suddenly the blackness grows eyes and looks directly at you. Realizing what it is, you back away startled just in time for the shell to explode into tiny shards. What lay before you quite possibly could be the most beautiful creature you have ever seen. and it's attention was solely on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting the moment short, however, A noise caught your attention.

You didn't like the idea of perishing as a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised when the dragon slowly and quietly spoke in your mind, <i>'We'll see, human... You seem sincere, but I need time to trust you.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted your gaze, quite relieved since the dragon apparently wasn't going to kill you immediately, yet still nervous since the giant clearly wasn't fully trusting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time?\" you said in a trembling voice. \"Do you mean I may stay here for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" he answered in a cold voice. \"You MUST stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in fear, realizing what the colossal being was meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon confirmed your fears, <i>'Nobody, dragon or not, is allowed to come here and survive unless they are a friend. I won't kill you now because I don't know if you're an enemy, but I can't let you go because I don't know if you're a friend so, you're going to be my captive, until I make my decision about it. I'll examine you and interrogate you... if you behave, no harm will come to you during your captivity, and if i eventually find out you're trustworthy, you'll be set free and will be considered a friend of my family. But if you give me the slightest motive of suspicion...'</i> the dragon bared his teeth and ground his talons in the rocky floor, <i>'I'll give you a slow and painful death, even worse than the death your companions are going to get from us. Got it?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow scared to death, you nodded: obeying was the only way of surviving! The dragon grunted and lowered a massive paw toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, you crouched and covered yourself with your arms, fearing of being slashed or crushed; instead, you were just grabbed by the collar of your jacket and lifted into the air like a small kitten, while your captor walked, carrying you deeper and deeper into the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling helplessly from the dragon's paw, you still felt terrified, unsure of what was going to happen to you, yet you couldn't avoid to notice how beautiful that place looked, the stone walls being nicely carved and light was given by crude torches.<br>\r\nThe dragons were quite civilized, you thought, also noticing that several carvings showen dragons and humans being friendly together. That comforted you a bit. The dragons clearly could accept humans as friends. At least these could. His statement of no one is welcome here, dragon or not, rung in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the dragon came to an opening and carried you into a huge room, where you saw...</span></div></div>",

The gentle movements creating swirling black currents to flow over the surface and the way in which the dragon was stroking the egg made it appear to be polishing the gleaming shell. Then with graceful movements it adjusts the egg to a new resting position and curls its self about it. With a deep sigh and a flip of its graceful wings the egg was gone, wrapped in its parents embrace and blending with the scales that were mirrored so flawlessly by the offspring.<br>\r\nOnce in a comfortable position the dragon again looks toward you its eyes glimmering in the dark had an amused look in them and you hear a soft melodious voice cooing in your mind and almost, your heart.<br>\r\n\u201cA human.

I realize this will take a great GREAT amount of time to even come close to completing and for those of you who have actually been paying attention to the story i was writing i apologize. But since this story is considered an interactive, I am going to attempt to make it so. To do so I am now upping the quality i require for additions to this interactive. Possible writers to this can either write to the guidelines i have set or write what they want and I will edit as necessary. I realize that this does not send the message that gets people to write but for this to be the story that i am envisioning I cannot let it stray to far from the main points in the story. This does not mean that I do not want people to write their side to this, on the contrary. it only means that there are now higher standers to the writing quality and the fact that a few things must happen in each storyline to make sure that there is consistency. e.g. I can't have Trent see only 2 dragons in a cave when in another thread he spots 12 in the very same cave. I know this will deter some possible writers from adding on to this story, but think about what can be done with this. A completely fictional story only loosely based off of others that has the possibility to go on infinitely. This is now a life goal of mine to see this through. May god help me and have mercy on my soul.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany complaints have been given in reviews that the branch I am writing is better suited as a novel and I am finally taking that to heart. A prologue is being written by <b><a href=\"/main/authors.php?action=search&amp;search_for=ruduen\" target=\"_blank\">ruduen</a></b> with my supervision and will be posted once completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions have come in regarding the size a dragon can become. This can vary due to the Race/color of dragon but you will see in this quote from the interactive what the base scale for growth is in dragons.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"> \"Fenrir explained that in their first year of life, a dragon undergoes a large growth spurt in which he will become about 9 feet tall in height. This lasts until his second year of life. The speed of growth then slows to about a foot a year then around the age of ten slows again to a foot every five years. Though the process continually slows with age, dragons continue to grow until the day they die. Judging Fenrir's hight at about 42 feet, according to him he would be about 100 years old, but probably even older since he said the process continues to slow.\"<br>\r\n</span> <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few last rules before you get started<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">1. No Vore, Shrinking, enlargement or any other sort of this kind of writing<br>\r\n2. put some thought in it, no one liner chapters<br>\r\n3. Always be as creative as possible, this story should be very open ended</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">IMPORTANT!!!</span><br>\r\nGuidelines for the story line to avoid confusion:<br>\r\n1. Anyone that writes a chapter will be sent a map of the world in which the story is set.<br>\r\n2. Trent's Parents are named Sheila and Thomas. (Can't have everyone make up their own. Description of them will be done by the first person to put them in the story.)<br>\r\n3. Magic in this world is described in my addition \"Magic in A wizard and his dragon\" I am open to ideas but for the most part, use this guide to know how the magic works in this story. If you do not I will edit as necessary.<br>\r\n4. As Trent becomes a rider he inherits dragon like characteristics. For example, he obtains wings and additional magical powers from the bond with his dragon. The wings are the color of the dragon that he bonds with and will also pick up some characteristics of that race of dragon. i.e. magic with the corresponding element increases and. Example:: If Trent bonds with a Fire dragon, it will strengthen his fire spells and will be able to use fire in the same manner as dragons, and a water dragon will strengthen water spells and allow Trent to breath underwater. <br>\r\n5. If you would like to create an original charecter, know that this since all threads in this story back up, that charecter will either be in every thread or be deleted from the story completely. I'm sorry but I have to make sure all things that happen in this story are caused by the main charecter Trent or those around him, not by outside forces such as the author of the chapter or a charecter in the story he has never met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI encourage everyone to review and add to this story so that it may become what i know it can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for writing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription:<br>\r\nBe prepared to begin a journey never like none other. You are about to be thrown into the life of Trent Godfrey, A young wizard in training on a journey unbeknown to him to become a Dragon Rider. Every choice you make will effect the outcome of the story, be it good or bad. One man may be a friend with one choice and an enemy with the other. Good, Evil, none of this matters when the choice is before you. No choice is right or wrong. Only the outcome matters and the only way to find out is to plunge inside and take the risk. Only one moment will remain the same, the beginning. And the rest is all up to a fate you yourself will create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are a young wizard named Trent Godfrey, a 16 year old boy with short brown curly hair and a very calming demeanor. Stripped from your hometown Parcel to be newly enlisted in the human militia which is at war with dragon kind, because of your abilities with the fabled \"Defensive\" magic, you were suddenly sent on an assassination mission with a small band of men. A war has been going on for nearly 20 years in the land of Shoven between the humans and dragons.
