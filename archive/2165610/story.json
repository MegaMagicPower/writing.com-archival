He is an only child and was about to enter college. He had no friends and no girlfriend, so he was basically alone. The only thing he loved so much was Pok\u00e9mon. He loved playing it in his Nintendo and Gameboy. He had pokemon giantess dreams and liked every second of it. \"I wish I can be in the pokemon world and not be in this place so that I can have my fun\" he muttered to himself one day while he was playing. That same night, while he was sleeping, a small yellow and white orb came to his room. While he was sleeping the orb was on top of him and saw his sleeping form. \"I will make your wish come true\" the orb giggles causing him to start to disappear. When he was finished the orb disappeared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mark wakes up to the feeling of dirt on his back. He gets up and noticed that he wasn't at his house. He looks around and realized that everything was big, VERY big. He starts to walk while looking around when the ground started to shake in a sort rhythm. He heard a bush rustling and when he looked at the bush, He saw......</font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark didn't have that much time to get used to his surroundings or this situation that he was in. The thumping was getting louder, and the ground beneath him began shaking more and more. Just then, a large shadow got between Mark and the sun, leaving Mark surprised and in this sudden shade. Out of reaction, he looked upwards. In front of him was a pair of black, furry legs that connected to what looked like to be some bipedal fox. However, Mark knew right away that it was a Braixen! The yellow body fur, the white neck fur, the branch sticking out of it's tail, the orange fur coming out it's ears, it was definitely a Braixen alright!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the towering fire fox up and down, Mark couldn't help but look between the legs of the fire type, since he was curious of what the gender would be of this Pokemon. A bright blush formed on his face when he saw the large slit between there. But now was not the time for that. He quickly shook the blush off and snapped back into reality. Right, he was somehow shrunken down to a very small size, and in front of a Pokemon that was approaching him closer every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough focusing on the beautiful female genital, he thought to himself, this Pokemon was getting closer and closer. However, the Braixen seemed that it wasn't aware that there was a shrunken human in her path. She was stretching out, her arms straight up, looking like she had just woken up almost. Her left paw thumped down, creating a tremble large enough for the micro human to be thrown off his feet and onto his butt. Quickly scrambling back up, Mark watched in awe as the Briaxen was almost right over him, but by sheer luck it would seem that she would miss stomping him by a few normal sized inches, which to Mark, was easily quite some feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the quick split second, he ran towards the paw that was closer to him, hoping he could hitch a ride. Right as the paw came down, Mark took a large leap, and grabbed onto the side of the paw. Luckily it was quite easy to grab onto because of all the fur, and Mark was able to hold onto the black fur as the paw raised up and came down again, which caused lots of shaking for the human. Hoping to be on a flatter surface, Mark began climbing up the side of the paw until he was on top, holding onto the fur for support and to not be flung off by the walking fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed with relief as he relaxed. Alright, he completed phase one of his plan, get onto the Braixen. But now he needed to grab the attention of her. But for now, he just wanted to relax in this amazingly soft fur. Sure he was the size of a bug, but the feeling of the soft fur all over his body was bliss. After a few minutes of resting, Mark sat back up. The Briaxen seemed to have stopped walking at this point, and curious Mark wondered why, and had his question answered when he saw...</span></div></div>",

He decides to get up from the strand of furs that was surrounding and start moving up while the Braxien enjoying her little snack from her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was climbing up her legs little by little by hanging to her fur that was like tree branches and he wonder how far he has to go since he was the size of a bug or should say flea since everything is pretty massive. He climb up and up making some progress on the gigantic pokemon who is still unaware of his presence and that she is still eating the berries from the branches. You can hear the chewing up above her head as she takes a huge bite into the berry and that some of the juices fall down to the ground making it splat. You hope that it doesn't hit you since those berries are pretty huge to you and probably like 3 or 4 times your size. Also, you not only you have to watch for the berries that could fall down from her mouth, but also her tiny movements of her legs as she can get restless and make you fall right to the ground or right back at her paws where you started from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were climbing up and making good progress despite your size.

Mark barely had time to wonder what is causing the world to shake before he caught a massive silhouette that stands high into the heavens. Before he could react, he sees that the silhouette grow closer until he could make out some details, and he was surprise to see what he saw. The silhouette belongs to a Absol, a very massive one, and its walking towards Mark's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Down here!\" Mark tries to shout out to the massive pokemon, but the pokemon shows no signs that it heard him. Before Mark knew it, one of its paws starts to hover above him. Mark panics as the paw hover over him, covering the whole sky to him. Very soon the paw descends and crash down. Thankfully for Mark, the Paw missed him by a few miles...to him. For the blissfully unaware Absol, the pokemon missed Mark by a centimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark struggle to catch his breathe before the tremors continue again as Absol lift its paw again, which only means that one of the rear paw was going to make its way towards Mark. Mark saw the incoming paw and ran as fast as he could before the furry landmass makes contact again. Mark was able to avoid being crush again and notice that Absol doesn't seem to be moving at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took the time to brush himself before looking up to wonder how in the world he is going to get this indescrible size pokemon to notice him. Well, he wonder that thought first before something caught his attention that made him blush. High above, he could see what looks like a pink slit that is absolutely massive to him. This Absol is a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark couldn't help but be distracted by the size of the slit.

For Mark, this meant a great cacophony.  A celestial voice beats down upon the microbe, forcing him to submit to the will of the godly being and writhe upon the ground, clutching his poor overwhelmed ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ringing ears, Mark opens his eyes to find that the previous display had been magnified!  The dark lips seem ready to engulf the entire Earth, the pink tunnel seemingly able to contain oceans of liquid, and white hooded clitoris a despairingly enormous planet buster all on its own...  This new view of a frequently observed Pokemon to him makes Mark shriek in utter fright, shortly before...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KABOOOOM!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was prone, the Absol knew she had chosen the right spot to rest.  Her horn gives off a slight tingle as she stretches her paws, cooing lightly and letting her tail drop to the ground while she brings her forearms under her head.  One last grind of her back end upon the ground, and the quadruped Pokemon is ready to rest, unwittingly bringing a new disaster for her captive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrops of some fluid hit the ground, the sound of which inspires Mark to open his eyes and see that he is in a dark cave.  Light trickles through from somewhere, revealing that the walls are oddly pink, but more importantly...  \"I'm... I'm not dead!\"  Mark proclaims to no one in particular and follows up with a relieved laugh.  He attempts to push himself up...  only to have his hands slip on the slick surface he finds himself on.  Where did he end up?  A strong tremor causes Mark to abandon this thought path, making him dig his fingers into the spongy ground as his world is shook up.  His fingers are pried from their grasp and the tiny man is tossed to and fro as the entire cave is rocked by some unseen force, he sinks into soft crevasses and is thrown out into open space just as quickly.  Finally, the intense quakes stop and Mark is left rolling upon the damp ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few quick breaths, Mark feels for a dry patch of ground before getting up.  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone, which helpfully states that it is 4:51 PM, and turns on its flashlight function.  The walls are most definitely pink.  And moist.  Maybe he was...  launched into the Absol's vulva when she laid down...?  If that's true, and he's inside the giant Pokemon's vagina, then he's at the mercy of her movements.  He could probably be sent flying again with any slight movement on her part!  Mark puts a hand to his mouth, and tries to ignore the sweet taste of whatever liquid he had picked up from the floor as he continues his thoughts.  So...  he could try to find where that light's coming from and get out that way... or find a place deeper inside the Absol's depths to hole up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark decides to...      </span></div></div>",

Absol was able to make what felt like a apocalyptic like event just from her walking. The world shook and practically drops within her footsteps, and she is only walking in what looks like a leisure stroll. Mark can only imagine what it would be like should he encounter another pokemon, probably bigger and is in a fight. Mark would never survive as he nothing more than a mere microbe to most, if not all, pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrifyied of what might be in store for him should he leaves, Mark looks at the other direction that leads deeper within Absol's vagina and decides to take shelter deeper within the unaware pokemon. After what felt like forever, Mark has been traveling deeper and deeper within the fleshy cavern. The cavern can be felt giving a gentle pulse from the pokemon's breathing, ocean size drops of fluid can be seen in what looks like the dozens, and once in a while Absol can be felt stirring her sleep, though thankfully not enough to cause Mark to bounce around. The light of the exit was now long gone as the microbe human continues to head further inside. Mark decides to take a break by going near one of the thousands of folds he has past since his decision to take shelter in the sleeping pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sits down on the warm spongy ground and tries to catch his breath.

He swiftly turns and bolts away, wet feet squelching with every squishy step while the rising whirlpool chases its prey.  Up he goes, feet sinking into the fleshy slope, threatening to trip him up.  A loud, piercing moan rumbles throughout the cavern, knocking Mark off balance and sending him, once more, face first onto the pink, spongy floor!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harbinger of oncoming events, the Absol's voice meant...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ground kept shaking beneath an utterly confused and scared Mark, who was trying to figure out just what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was everything so big? Was it because of that weird dream he had? But most importantly, where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even try to find an answer to his questions, something happened: out of the bush he was staring at came something big and brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a paw of some kind, but it couldn't be... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark suddenly remembered what predicament he was in, and watched as a slim, brown figure followed the paw out of the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes widened: brown fur, long ears, bushy tail... an Eevee! One of his favourite pokemon was walking right before his eyes... and it was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-Wha...?\" he muttered to himself. Pokemon didn't exist! Just what was happening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if this all had something to do with his dream. He remembered that sphere and its words, \u2018I will make your wish come true.\u2019 It wasn't a dream, was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled but amazed at the same time, Mark stared at the Eevee as it walked. Mercifully, he didn't get to meet its paws up close; instead, as its large abdomen came into view, Mark caught a glimpse of the Eevee's sex... and blushed massively as he looked at the cavernous slit that hovered above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotally a female Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quake made Mark snap back to reality as he realized that the pokemon giantess didn't even notice him, and was walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgently, he remembered that he was shrunken and in a foreign world. This could have been his only chance to get help... and from one of his favourite pokemon too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, without even thinking twice, he sprinted towards one of the large legs. Luckily, the Eevee was walking rather slowly, so he had no problem catching up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he only had to figure out how to get her attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Down here!\" Mark shouted, hoping that his tiny voice could be detected by the big ears of the Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she gave no sign of having heard the shrunken human that was chasing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tried several other times to call out for her, but the Eevee didn't hear him. Either his voice was too faint or she was lost in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, Mark thought fast, his brain activity increased by the fear of being left alone and helpless in this giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if there were other pokemon too... if there were, some of them were going to be very very dangerous. He only imagined what would have happened if he ran into a Primeape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, Mark hastily figured that, to get her attention, he had to climb the brown titan he was chasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he sped up, towards one of the pillar of brown fur that walked away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sprinted towards one of the Eevee's hind legs and jumped, almost immediately feeling the soft fur under his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasped some of the thick strands; the Eevee didn't appear to have noticed him as she kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping her ankle, Mark tried to climb up, but the constant movement of the paw made the task ahead of him hard. It was a miracle if he was managing to hang on without falling on the ground, where he would surely be crushed by one the giant paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Mark began climbing slowly, the strands of fur brushing against his whole body as he did; a single strand was as tall as he was, maybe even taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, he thought as he struggled to keep climbing, he had an idea of how small he truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed, minutes even, but for Mark felt like an eternity since he started climbing this gigantic pokemon who, unaware of the tiny human climbing her, kept walking towards an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after nearly an hour, Mark finally managed to reach her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was panting heavily, and was now struggling to keep his grip on the thick, brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the initial scare finally subsided, Mark looked up:  he was almost there, he had almost reached the Eevee's back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, his gaze traveled down, past her leg... again, he blushed as the giantess' uncovered sex came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was, clinging to one of his favourite pokemon. Mark realized that he had an unique opportunity to have some fun with this Eevee, who seemed unaware of him... but at the same time, he also had to get her attention and help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was living one of his most secret fantasies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he feeling brave enough to explore the Eevee's nether regions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" he said as he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He could still feel the titanic and massive pokemon moving, but he fell down into her plush fur and just laid there, his entire body sweating and aching from his grueling climb up her simple leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so fucking weird...\" Mark muttered as his world shook to the rhythm of Eevee's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, she was quite content to keep walking, a smile on her face as she explored about, taking in the sights. She was blissfully unaware of her tiny little passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark allowed himself a bit more of a rest before he sat up, looking around to see her face in the vast distance of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a ways to go...\" Mark sighed as he got up and started walking. At least it'd be a hell of a lot easier than climbing her...though her movement made Mark have to struggle to keep his balance at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis goal...her large ears.

Sadly, such temptation, like the one of paying Eevee's nethers a visit, was canceled from Mark himself as he remembered what he was supposed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back on his feet and started walking through the brown forest once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee seemed to be feeling none of his movements, and was still walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust where was she heading, Mark thought to himself as he finally reached a cream colored spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in relief: that was the back of Eevee's neck, covered in creamy fur. Mark looked up - the large ears were close. He just had to climb up onto her head, and he would finally be able to get the attention of this oblivious Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet stepped onto the thick creamy fur as he placed his hands on a vertical, round wall: Eevee's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark placed his foot onto the head as well as he began climbing once again, his hands gripping the brown fur, leaving the veritable jungle behind as he climbed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark discovered that he had an easier time climbing up Eevee's head than he had when he climbed up her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he managed to reach the top of the brown hill and stepped onto Eevee's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, much to the human's relief, the towering ears loomed above him, crafting two large shadows across the pokemon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping some sweat away, Mark moved up to one of the big ears and sat down by it, back against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finally done it, now he could get Eevee's attention! If only he wasn't feeling exhausted right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur was so soft, like a bed, surrounding him from every angle, while the large ear behind his head acted like a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time, Mark felt the temptation to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, he didn't fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness claimed his brain as he fell asleep right there, onto the Eevee's head, after having accomplished his primary objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes opened as he stared, once again, at a yellow and white sphere of light floating in front of him, surrounded by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stared at it in silence for several minutes as the sphere lazily floated in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt giggled after several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Enjoying your new predicament?</span>\" it asked in a feminine voice, startling Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully stepped back, fearing he could fall into void if he took a wrong step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" he asked, staring at the sphere intently as it giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I'm the one who made your wish come true! You're here because of me!</span>\" it chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... w-why?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphere laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">You were alone and your parents hated you! You wanted this, didn't you?</span>\" it asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark remained silent. To be honest, this WAS what he wanted, but he didn't know that it could actually happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that old say is true after all, \u2018Careful what you wish for, you never know who might be listening\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Who are you?\" he repeated, now curious more than scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphere giggled again, and began to assume a shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Mark's surroundings began shaking as the shape started fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...!\" Mark shouted as the sphere disappeared, leaving him alone in darkness, in the middle of a veritable earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes shot open, his upper body darted upwards as he looked forward startled, noticing a brown forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, very very slowly, he turned his head back, noticing that he had been laying against a brown pillar... the Eevee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that wasn't a dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark jumped to his feet as he looked around... things had stopped shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee he had been resting on appeared to be laying beneath a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked to the very edge of the giantess' head, noticing that the Eevee had emulated him: she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what he had to do, Mark turned back to look at the identical ears standing tall in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Mark traveled back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, feeling much safer now - he simply couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind went back to his dream - that sphere of light had made his dream come true, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was right about something - he could also enjoy this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a hand on the soft fur and started petting. Eevee was one of his favourite pokemon after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ear and its twin counterpart twitched at his touch, and the Eevee's whole body shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the giantess woke up sooner than Mark had anticipated, because the human suddenly found his location shifted from the top of her head to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee had thrown him off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tried to turn around, but wasn't able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short flight, Mark landed on a mercifully soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn accurate examination told Mark that he had landed...</span></div></div>",

Pokemon didn't exist!... Well, not that he had heard of shrunken humans before though... did he somehow end up in another world? This seemed so surreal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon before him was quadruped, its body covered by black fur; it had red eyes and long ears which, along with its ankles, tail and forehead, had yellow rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Umbreon indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his own world of admiration, Mark was roughly called back to reality when a giant paw landed beside him, causing the ground to shake and him to fall on his rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon was walking away, unaware of the human it had just almost crushed beneath its paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked up, watching as the Umbreon above him walked, its large abdomen slid out of his eyesight to fill it with something else: her sex, a cavernous opening in between her legs. The pink slit was not very unnoticeable on the Umbreon's black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere sight of it made a blush spread across Mark's face, before that too disappeared; Mark caught a glimpse of her butt and tail, before he had to turn his head in order to see the Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her leave, but quickly figured out that he couldn't stay there, tiny, lost and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without thinking, he sprinted towards the giant Umbreon and quickly caught up; hastily, he walked towards her left leg, running in order to keep up with the walking legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked up at the Umbreon's face, but she was looking forward and didn't notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hey! I need help!\" he exclaimed, unsure if the Umbreon could hear him or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the second though, because her ears didn't even twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Mark tried again, but the Umbreon still didn't hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human felt the air leaving him as he had to run to keep up and shout out for the giantess at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he decided, he had to get on her first. It was going to be much easier to get the Umbreon's attention if he managed to found a perch anywhere on her body... he blushed. Maybe not <i>certain places</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Mark hastily ran towards her landing paw; the pad made contact with the ground and he was quick to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Mark was able to grab onto the smooth, dark fur that surrounded the whole creature and sighed... before the sudden arising of the paw threw his sigh back down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that his current position was dangerous, Mark quickly climbed onto the Umbreon's paw, sitting on top of her three-toed paw; his fingers sank deep into the black fur and gripped it as Mark hung on, fearing the the Umbreon might have actually thrown him off her paw by merely walking. He found himself in a leafless black forest, the strands of fur were almost twice his height; he was surrounded by it and, whole it provided him with a soft, warm seat, it did also made it hard for the Umbreon to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was looking at her paw anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess didn't feel Mark on her paw and kept walking towards an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that the Umbreon wasn't going to pay him any mind while she walked, Mark decided to wait for her to stop to attempt to contact her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he got used to the rising-and-falling of the paw; he also quickly discovered that there was no need for him to hang on: he was practically tangled in black fur, which impeded him to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly relieved, Mark leaned back and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Umbreon went on for a while, without stopping; the human on her paw relaxed and closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation that the surprisingly smooth fur have him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoothed, Mark started stroking the Umbreon mindlessly while she kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, abruptly, the paw Mark was resting on landed with a bit more strength than he had gotten accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis marked the end of Umbreon's walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... did the Umbreon feel him petting her paw and was checking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Mark opened his eyes and looked up, past the black, leafless trees that towered above him; he stared up at the Umbreon's huge face.</span></div></div>",

Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a rush of air as he was lifted upwards towards the Umbreon's face, but unfortunately the forces of gravity caused him to start to slide down between two of her toes. Mark let out an involuntary yelp as he desperately tried to grab onto her fur and tried to pull himself up again. At this size, the short distance her paw was hovering over the ground might as well be a ten-story jump for the shrunken human so the last thing he wanted was to fall off her paw. Pushing him self up a bit he managed to stabilize himself and his head was just poking out of Umbreon's black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes were still trained on him and Mark moved around a bit as he called out to her again. The movement caused her ear to twitch which he assumed was a good sign, but he was feeling uncertain when he felt the paw moving again even closer to her face. That and the fact he wasn't being moved towards her eyes so she can see him or her ears so she can hear him, but rather toward her mouth. Mark screamed in a panic as great ivory pillars began to bore down into the fur around him. Holding on for dear life her teeth gently nipped all over her paw, giving Mark a few near misses. They were close enough he could have reached out and touched them, but he wasn't that keen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly dawned on him that maybe the Umbreon didn't actually see him. She merely mistook Mark for an itch and was trying to get rid of it! Thankfully the teeth stopped biting around him and he gave as sigh of relief... Only for him to start panicking as a large pink tongue started dragging along the paw. The wet organ dragged along his face leaving him a bit dazed as he tried to recover. The Umbreon had other ideas. She continued her licking assault and each pass of the huge tongue was gradually pulling him out from his hiding spot between her two toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting slapped multiple times by a huge, warm and wet tongue seemed to have the effect of completely stunning the small human. Any more licks and he might get swept up into her mouth!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark watched the bush in from of him shaking as out of it came a giant figure that was fluttering above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature had creamy fur, orange hands and feet; for its height, it had incredibly long ears of the same color as its hands and had big, blue eyes, black nose and a small mouth, two pointy teeth peeking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took a step back. This was a pokemon! But not any ordinary pokemon, it was a legendary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the giant in shock as it landed right in front of him. It didn't seem to have noticed the shrunken human by its feet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the legendary closed its eyes, stretched and flew over a nearby tree, sitting down at its foot. The Victini leaned back against the trunk, hands behind its head and legs spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stared at it - did that legendary just go to take a nap without even noticing him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that Victini was one of the smallest legendaries. Something that gave an idea of how small he was, given that the pokemon towered above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully approached the pokemon - it was supposed to be harmless, despite the power Mark knew it possessed. Victini was supposed to be cheerful and gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mark needed help right now, no matter if it was a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the sleeping giant, immediately noticing three things: one, it had already fallen asleep, he could tell by the almost imperceptible snoring of the titan and the rising and falling of its chest; two, it seemed to be way warmer around this legendary (no wonder from a fire-type); three, this giant was actually a giantess, he noticed by the large slit in between her spread legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blushed, and looked away from it. He had to focus on how to get the attention of this sleeping titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem so hard - how could a legendary with such big ears not hear him? That seemed improbable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the Victini was asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor good measure, Mark moved in front of one of the towering orange feet and poked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! I need help!\" he shouted, hoping that the Victini would wake up. The muscles of the sole twitched lightly, and the Victini gave a slight giggle in her sleep, but she didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Victini! Please wake up!\" he called, again poking the large foot of the pokemon, receiving the same response as earlier: a twitch and a giggle, but no signs of the giantess waking up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... wake up!\" Mark continued, sliding his hand along the length of the warm foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he obtained a different answer: a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave him an idea: he started rubbing the foot with both hands, causing Victini to moan more loudly in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot twitched under his palms, but Victini still didn't show any signs of wanting to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mark's arms felt sore, and he had to stop rubbing; Victini was wearing a pleased smile on her sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...\" Mark whispered as the giantess relaxed, her foot flailing weakly, almost as if it missed the attention of the hands of the shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do now to wake the sleeping titaness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at her... maybe, he could have climbed up to her ears to get her attention... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, wondering for how long he would have to climb... his gaze landed once again on the Victini's sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, but... maybe it wasn't necessary to climb, he figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could please that sensible area of the Victini, she would have woken up much faster, without the risk of Mark falling from her body and onto the ground, where he could end up seriously injured... or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... if the Victini woke up and spotted a tiny human rubbing her crotch, what would have happened then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she be angry? Mischievous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a legendary, a creature with immense power, how could Mark face her wrath if she was angry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Mark's mind told him that he had better chances if he attempted to climb the Victini instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled back from the foot and approached the giant body of the legendary, deciding what should he have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he had to get her attention.</span></div></div>",

Was she thinking about masturbating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded his head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, was that what the giantess wanted?

Or was he tiny? And, most importantly, where he even was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the shaking bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, something came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Mark didn't see it too well; but then, a figure came forward, hovering in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mark recognized it - it was Celebi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody of two shades of green, round feet, long and slender arms, wings, blue eyes with dark eyelids and antennas on top of its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it was definitely the legendary, time-traveling pokemon Celebi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large shadow was casted over the shrunken human as the legendary hovered forward, not even noticing Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she flew past him, Mark caught a glimpse of something that made him go red as a pepper: the Celebi's sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was a girl, judging by the pink slit being one of the few color differences on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind unable to process what was going on, Mark watched as the time-traveler flew forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, reality struck him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone, in a world he didn't know. But that was obviously a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere there other humans as well in this world, Mark wondered, were they tiny like him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly discovered that he really didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever he was or not the only human in this world, he had to get the attention of the Celebi right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike this, he currently has no chance of survival. And, he had to get the attention of the green fairy - who was notoriously a docile and kind pokemon despite the power he knew she possessed; if Mark could obtain her help, it'd be simply great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if not her help, at least her protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe protection of a legendary. And one of his favourite too. Just looking at the green giantess, who was unaware of him, made Mark's pants feel tight all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focused on the fairy, finding her busily searching for something in a bush, giving him a clear visual of her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken human blushed brightly, before shaking his head and moving towards Celebi; if he waited too long, she would leave and he'd be doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Mark sped towards the fairy, who finally pulled back from the bush, triumphantly holding a tiny, round berry, which Mark identified as a Cheri Berry. The bush seemed to be full of those, he noted by the several red spots on the green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly, Celebi started eating the berry; then, she ate another, and another. She seemed to like that kind of berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that just kept her glued to the bush, giving you a chance to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stood beneath the floating pokemon, suddenly aware a few sweet scents, presumably coming from Celebi herself, he could tell by the strong smell of mint and grass he was smelling by merely standing under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the almost sickeningly sweet scent, before taking a few steps, admiring the towering fairy as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find a way to get to her attention, but what could he do? Celebi was hovering, he couldn't even reach her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked around, hoping to find something that would help him out. He saw the berry bush Celebi was eating from, the grass, which wasn't of any help, a small log...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Celebi again - her foot was right in front of the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he only could climb to the top, he would be able to jump on top of her foot, and from there climb up to her face!... Or maybe, take a little \u2018break\u2019 near her nethers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Mark decided that it was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved towards the log and placed his hands onto the wood, his fingers gripping it as he began scaling the fallen log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found that the task wasn't particularly easy, as each two inches he progressed, he slid back down one inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, finally, the shrunken human was able to climb up to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to find his balance and took a minute to catch his breath, again inhaling that wonderful smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA satisfied sigh coming from above made him choke on his last breath; the Celebi was done eating, she was rubbing her belly with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's gaze couldn't help but travel down, lingering on her sex once again - it was surely big enough for him to fit completely inside... maybe he WAS going to stop there when he started climbing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shook his head as he noticed the Celebi stretching her arms, before she started flying forward, away from the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark noticed on the very last second and remembered to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green platform that was her foot was getting away from him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Mark extended his hands as he hovered towards the leaving foot, grabbing a hold of its edge and dangling from it like it was a cliff, an ocean of green under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi seemed to have felt nothing as she kept flying, unaware of the presence on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to keep his grip, Mark placed his own feet against the side of Celebi's foot and grabbed as much of it as he could with his hands as he lifted himself onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green skin was incredibly soft and warm, he noticed, and for a moment, he felt tempted to rest, once again enjoying the smell of grass that Celebi emanated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new doubt distracted Mark - maybe Celebi had felt and noticed him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up.</span></div></div>",

He also remembered that he was alone and lost right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, judging by the fact that the mouse was several times his height, he was also shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" he shouted as he started running behind the Rattata. He wasn't sure what help a mouse could give him, but it was better than nothing, he figured as he sprinted after the purple mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, by the time Mark reached a grassy field, the Rattata was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed - what was he supposed to do now? Sit down, recollect his thoughts and wait for someone to find him? If there was a pokemon, there were more, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should he have searched for someone by himself? That seemed a poor choice, he didn't know if there were humans as well in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, it was clear, Mark wasn't in his world anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always dreamed of meeting pokemon, he had always dreamed of meeting GIANT pokemon, but he didn't think it could have happened for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, he couldn't stay there forever, he had to at least find a shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on an entrance in a stone wall - a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect, he thought as he started walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mark almost an hour to reach the giant cave in his reduced state, but he eventually managed to step inside, immediately getting assaulted by cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering a bit, he made his was deeper inside, wondering if there was someone in this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that case, either he tried to get the attention of whoever it was or he left the cave as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt depended on the pokemon/human he found in there, he decided. If there was an Ursaring waiting for him in this cave, the choice was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Mark kept walking in silence, his steps on the stone floor being the only noise that could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he eventually reached the end of the cavern, he could tell by the large walls forming a circular, closed space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something else jumped out as well: a large, circular rock was placed right at the end of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't have been nothing out of ordinary, if it wasn't for the pokemon laying on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt his breath being cut short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was no ordinary pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a white face, and a yellow, star-shaped head; its body was apparently yellow, but Mark knew that those were the tail of the pokemon, which had in reality a white body with a third eye placed on its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was staring at Jirachi, a wish-granting legendary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, he approached the sleeping pokemon - he always liked the adorable little pokemon. He had it in his team in one of his games, and he loved how the now not-so-little legendary always won battles with Doom Desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, there it was, Jirachi, a giant sleeping before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Mark placed his hands on the rock started climbing it, wanting to admire the cute titan up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to pokemon legends, Jirachi slept for a whole millennia before waking up for <i>one</i> week. For a moment, Mark stopped: was he going to have to wait a millennia to get help?! That wasn't even possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. Probably, it was a simple legend, he thought as he resumed climbing. Plus, Jirachi was supposed to envelop itself in a cocoon when it slept for a thousand years, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Mark was about to reach the top though, Jirachi suddenly stretched, its two tails unwrapping from its body as it extended its arms and raised its head, before it fell back down as the creature relaxed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had almost woken up, Mark thought with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, either it was its millennial week of being awake or the legend was false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Mark climbed up onto the rock that was Jirachi's perch and admired its white body - he couldn't be taller than one of the giant's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity overtook Mark - now he needed to know something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn games, like most of the legendaries, Jirachi was asexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mark felt curious to know, and traveled to the legendary's legs... he blushed, noticing that the titan was actually a <i>titaness </i>, he could tell by the pink slit on the endless white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Jirachi was a female, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled - he had no clue of how he ended up here, but getting to meet his favourite pokemon up close was an opportunity he'd-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stopped for a moment, memories coming back to his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, a person doesn't often remember what dream they were having during sleep, but Mark remembered that a sphere of white and yellow light was floating right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt told: \u2018I will make your dream come true...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi's colors matched the one of the sphere... and the legendary was supposed to be able to grant wishes... and the voice in his dream was a feminine one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my... God...\" Mark mumbled as he regarded the sleeping giantess, who seemed to be smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi granted his wish?! How did that even happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the legendary, not sure if to feel blissful or shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shook his head as he remembered that he was here because he had to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, his gaze traveled to the Jirachi's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed... but, after all, Jirachi was his favourite pokemon, and she was asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he risk having some fun with her, even in this dire situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Putting his lewd thoughts aside for a moment, Mark urgently recalled what his current situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrunken, in a foreign world and, if he failed to get attention, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he decided, his priority was to get the attention of the Jirachi. The same pokemon that apparently was the cause of all his current problems (and the same pokemon that made all his most intimate dreams come true though).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he went back to Jirachi's hip area and stared up for several seconds, wondering how could he wake up such titan with the mere help of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she even be able to hear him even when she woke up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hey!\" Mark screamed, uncertain. Predictably, Jirachi totally didn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the shrunken human by her side shouted, a bit more convinced: again, Jirachi didn't seem to have heard him, though her breathing paused briefly, as if she was sensing an annoyance in her sleep, before her breathing resumed regularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I need your help, please!\" he tried again but, again, he got the same response: silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn frustration, Mark punched the side of the giantess; immediately afterwards, a sound erupted around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mark several moments of blinking in confusion to realize that Jirachi had just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at the titaness, then at his fist while his mind put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mark pulled his hand back and punched the soft wall in front of him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grinned to himself. So this was what he had to do, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the unfortunate human drove his fist into Jirachi again, then his other fist joined in, the whole process followed by Mark's knee colliding with the side of the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't feel too bad - Jirachi was probably feeling nothing but a tickle, he judged by the incessant stream of giggles that escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle she didn't still wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark kept going until something finally happened: Jirachi was starting to move! He had done it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Mark took a step back and watched as the titaness fidgeted in her sleep before she... simply rolled onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had less than a split second to realize what was happening, before he found an immense pressure falling on him as he disappeared beneath Jirachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped between the hard, cold, grey stone and the soft, warm, white skin, Mark could do literally nothing but squirm helplessly, feeling the giant Jirachi pressing him deep into the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get out from under here, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was: how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Mark did the first thing he could think of and started tried to push back the immense Jirachi; an obviously futile attempt that could be compared to him trying to lift a mountain. Or the moon, given what pokemon it was, he thought with a sour smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat assaulted the trapped human as his arms went limp. He had to think of something better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about squirming out, but then his mind told him that, thanks to the rock beneath him, he was going to end up skinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same voice in his head told him that it was a wider move to wait until Jirachi shifted on her back again, and hope she was quick doing so... before she either crushed him or he ran out of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laid there for what had to be an eternity (he couldn't really keep track of time while trapped beneath a literal mountain), but kept still, using the least amount of air to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, after a while, Jirachi readjusted and rolled onto her back, freeing the poor human, who inhaled deeply as the gigantic white pokemon left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sore, Mark stood back up onto shaky legs and glanced at the sleeping form of Jirachi, wondering if he still had to get her attention or climb back down,leave this cave to never return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... That would be a stupid move, he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, his brain thought of a new way to awaken the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, he moved up to her side again, dug his hands into the white skin and began scaling the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after nearly an hour, panting, sweating, exhausted, Mark managed to climb on top of Jirachi's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mythical pokemon kept sleeping throughout the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stood on top of the stomach, feeling it vibrating softly under his feet: Jirachi was going to be hungry whenever she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark studied his surroundings, immediately spotting something right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit weirded out, Mark recalled that Jirachi had a third eye on her stomach, and that eye was apparently her main one. And this beside him was right its closed eyelid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new idea got to him... this was going to be weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked in circles around the eye (which was roughly twice his height), then knelt, beginning to rub the eyelid with one hand, glancing at Jirachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Jirachi's sleep became suddenly agitated; her arms fidgeted, her legs shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, finally, the legendary opened a pair of water-blue eyes, her head rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark watched as Jirachi rubbed her eyes with two stubby paws, before said eyes fell on her... eye.</span></div></div>",

It seemed to have an effect on the giantess, because her has shifted once more as she felt an itch on her belly, where her true eye was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, standing on top of her stomach, Jirachi spotted the cause of her awakening: a small bug, right on her third eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo tired to check it out, Jirachi decided to simply dispose of it; she moved a paw in Mark's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken human felt relieved when he saw her gaze fixed on him and her paw approaching him, but his relief was short-lived; and it was when the three stubby fingers slapped him that he realized that Jirachi must have mistaken him for a bug or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark made a short flight into the air, watching as the paw that removed him from his perch rose again, ready to return to its original place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took the opportunity and, desperately trying to control his flight, he landed straight on top of the back of Jirachi's hand, before starting to stomp on her knuckle furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the giantess noticed the sensation and, opening the eyes she had closed once again, she discovered that the same bug was now on the back of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, the legendary shook her paw to get rid of it, but Mark, having sensed the incoming threat of becoming paste on the stone floor or on one of the stone walls, hastily knelt and clinged to Jirachi's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sick as the paw shook back and forth, but he stubbornly hung on until the shaking ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzily, he looked back at the legendary with blurry eyes; it was with great surprise that Jirachi noted the bug still on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer tired, and having taken a major interest in the little guy, the legendary brought her paw to her face, right in front of her huge blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark signed in relief, while Jirachi took notice of something odd: the bug she had been trying to get rid of was no bug at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a human!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even for Jirachi, this was unusual. As she often did when confronted by the unexpected, she shifted her eyes to the side where a cyan tag hung off the side of her head. Something was written there, and it was not in the usual hiragana or kanji. In refined english writing, it read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><i>I wish I was smaller</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi quickly turned her gaze back to the human in her hand, staring in disbelief. Again, this was no common occurrence. The process of deciding which wish to grant always came to Jirachi during or soon after waking up, a time when all her mental faculties weren't in place. People would wish for good fortune and perhaps something nice would come to them. Why not? Others would wish for more outrageous things, and she would subconsciously skip over them during her hibernation. Wouldn't want to give some jerk world domination by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet here he was. A tiny, tiny human in the palm of her hand. He seemed too stunned to speak up. Had this been a monkey's paw scenario? Had he maybe wished to fit into a smaller pair of pants and she had interpreted it as shrinking him down into a flightless fly? She couldn't remember. All she remembered wanting to make someone's dreams come true. Surely being reduced to this size couldn't be his real wish, could it? She had to force herself to keep steady enough just so he wouldn't fall down to his death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she realized her other wish tag had been altered as well. This wish was made in a different, slightly slurry handwriting, yet its contents were still intelligible,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><i>I wish for love</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being ever-so slightly shorter than the previous sentence, Jirachi stared at this one a lot longer. Trying to interpret it. Had she also put this human under a love spell? Unlikely, seeing the look of surprise more present than attraction on his expression. Had someone else come to love this human? Perhaps a different person? Perhaps even a Pok\u00e9mon? Or perhaps-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to finish her own thought as she felt her cheeks redden. Aha. In her sleep-addled state she had decided the most practical solution for this wish would be to offer herself as the bringer of love. She WAS a very lovable creature after all, or at least that's what she had heard. There was little time to second-guess this decision as her mind was soon flooded with rose-tinted memories of this human. How she had watched him from afar, desperately longing to speak with him, to be with him, yet kept worlds apart by cruel fate, only able to share her feelings and desires in dreams. All fake memories, of course. Or were they? Regardless, he was starting to look really cute. The effect that had been so faint at first came crashing down upon her as she was overcome by the urge to get a lot more involved with this small human. Whatever the third wish upon her head was could wait until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mark noticed a shift in atmosphere. The giantess had gone from sleeping to sleepy to alert, and now back to lidding her eyes again. Yet somehow her gaze appeared to be focusing more intently on him. If this was a good or a bad thing he was unsure, but finding himself in the palm of a normally pint-sized yet now mountain of a genie meant he would probably soon find out.</span></div></div>",
