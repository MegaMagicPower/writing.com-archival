You judge your size to be about half an inch tall. Just then you hear foot steps. A gigantic female figure enters the room. You realise its Rikku one of the heroes that defeated Sin and saved Spira! She makes her way into the room. \"Hmmm this ones free I guess...\" she says as she closes the door behind her. Her giant boots begin to make their way towards you. You quickly run and hide under the bed. She walks over and sits down on the bed and takes her boots off. You see two enormous heals drop down infront of you. A slight odur comming from them....</span></div></div>",

Just as you make it about half way across the room you hear loud movement behind you. You turn around and see Rikku has stood up and is walking around the room as if she is looking for something.

Rikku must have done alot of walking today for her socks to smell like this. Suddenly... THUMP THUMP! You look around and one of Rikku's feet is right outside the sock. You are thrown of your feet and the sock violently moves all over the place. You notice Rikku's left foot is entering the sock you try to move but you can as the sock is still moving. Her big toe hits you and you fly to end of the sock, then all her toes fall ontop of you. You struggle to move. Her toes wiggle and you end up caught between her big and second biggest toes. Rikku walks around the room with you in her sock. Her feet start to warm. They already smell but now they are beggining to sweat. Eventually everything stops moving. She wiggles her toes a few more times and you end up under her toes again....</span></div></div>",

Rikku's foot mostly blocks your view, but streams of light manage to work their way around and into your view, and you realize she's taking the sock off. Her foot pulls away, and you're left in the sock with a view of Rikku's massive face, her hands keeping the sock rolled up around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is that what I think it is?\" She asks. \"What do you think it is?\" You respond.
