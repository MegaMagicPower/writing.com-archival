There's nothing going on this week, so you figure you should go to your friend Ethan's house for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to turn on the light, out of the corner of your eye you notice something shiny... no, glowing. Looking directly at it, you notice a ring with a note attached to it. It reads, \"Put in on, and say, '6 feet'\". You were confused, but you did as it were told. You almost drop the ring just as you put it on your finger. You whisper, \"6 feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body freezes, then starts to expand. A pulse rushes through your body as you grow, along with your clothes, to exactly 6 feet tall. You were amazed at the change, and immediately rush downstairs to tell your mom. Unfortunately, you weren't used to your new body yet, and you fall 5 steps down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob, how many times have I told you to be careful on the stairs?\" yells your mother from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you yell back, in a voice slightly deeper than normal. \"You've got to see what this new ring does!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your glowing ring? You've had that for years,\" explains your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mom, I just got it, and look at me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom sighs as she walks towards the staircase where you lay. She examines you up and down with a confused look on her face. \"Is there something wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mom, that ring must have made me grow somehow. I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's eyebrows narrow. \"You've always been 6 feet tall, Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't, I put the ring on and said, '6 feet', and then I grew to be this size. Watch.\" You look at the ring. \"8 feet,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same feeling resumes, and your body stretches higher and higher, until you stand at exactly 8 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably lie down. You don't sound very well,\" says your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Ethan I'll be over shortly,\" you object. \"Just need to get dressed.\" You head back upstairs, being careful not to trip again. Maybe Ethan will be impressed at my new height, you think. Would you like to stay at 8 feet tall or grow taller?</span></div></div>",

As a quick test you look at the ring and say \"six feet\" upon shrinking down the formerly big things such as the chair have changed too. Therefore it's safe to say that no matter how big you grow the world adjusts for you, or at least your house. Also you reason that those who know you will think it was normal that you were as tall as you were. \"Eight feet.\" you say again going back to your former height. Once again the house adjusts. You head outside, Ethan's house isn't too far but with your new size you make it with ease. You find Ethan outside waiting for ya. \"Hey there Jake!\" He calls out to you. This was a good time to test out your ring, or you could just go about your day with Ethan.</span></div></div>",

I know that you want to be a giant, and that if you were a giant, you would want to destroy as much as possible.  That is why I have decided to give you the ability of being able to change your own size.  You just have to say that you wish you were a certain height, and you will grow to that height. Grow and wreak havoc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up from the dream and got dressed.  You put on a shirt and shorts, along with your favorite pair of Seattle skyline socks. You've always imagined the buildings on your socks as big as the ones in real life, but now you won't have to imagine it anymore.  You went downstairs, put your shoes on, then said, \"I wish I was 10' tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after you said your wish, you started inching upward toward the ceiling.  Everything around you started getting smaller. You stopped growing when your head hit the ceiling.  You realize that the door is too small to fit through, and you don't want to shrink down, so you decide to grow out of the house.  You say, \"I wish I was 50' tall.\"  You immediately start growing once again.  Your head broke through the ceiling, then only moments later, the roof, as well.  Once you stopped growing, the house collapsed on itself.  Good thing your family was at your neighbor's house, otherwise, they would have been killed by the house falling on them. Since you hadn't had breakfast yet, you picked up the pile of rubble that was your house and ate it.  You thought it tasted really good, and wanted to have some more.  You couldn't decide if you should terrorize the neighborhood or grow more, so you decided to ask your older brother. You looked around and saw the neighbor's house that your family was at.  You walked over to the house and ripped the roof off of the house.  You picked your brother out of the house, then crushed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Kyle. How does it feel being the 'little' bro now?  As you can probably tell, I now have the ability to grow at will.  Should I grow some more or should I play with the neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't do either, Jacob . It's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tightened the grip you had on Kyle. \"If you don't tell me to grow or play with the neighborhood right now, I will crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to-,\" Kyle muttered before you crushed him to death with your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've told me to grow or play with the neighborhood,\" you said to your now dead brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now decide to...</span></div></div>",

He then noticed something tiny holding to one of his fingers, so he sat up and lifted his hand.

Few children keep this desire when it was granted, allowing them to enjoy themselves. The greatest example of this is Jacob Jones, a 10 year old from the suburbs of San Francisco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could explain how it happened, they only know what happened. It was a normal summer morning, as Jacob walked to the kitchen for breakfast. As he walked, he noticed the ground seemed to go farther and farther away. The table next to him climbed lower next to his leg. Everything around him seemed to shrink. He paused in awe as he watched the world change, his clothes eventually ripped clean off his body, leaving him with only his extra-elastic underwear. He snapped out of his trance when his head hit the ceiling and had to bend down until he stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jacob transformed from four foot six to twelve foot three.

Nobody is even the size of his toes. \"You guys can start by massaging your new king's feet.\" Almost everyone obeys, climbing ontop of one another to massage and worship the young feet.

The big place is important because Jacob is hyperactive and loves to run. This is a bit dangerous to others because a person has no chance against a foot that is over 350 feet long. But at least the rhythmic earthquakes warn the man when the boy is approaching. But that doesn't mean Jacob won't leave the house. He often helps on construction sites, in difficult terrain cargo handling and all he can do. He even helped with film-making a couple of times. (Camera from high, cars flying in real life, earthquakes on command.) He loved to help.<br>\r\nAlthough he regretted not being in a vehicle.

Little did Jasmine account for no place to hide so she sat on the table grabbing the Orange that was on it and hoping somehow she wouldn't get spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just at least run this test this morning\" said the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker agreed and the 2 so busily set to work so used to the task by now they didn't even look at the caked monitor to notice Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jasmine noticed a big gun looking device pointed at her the table and the Orange. There was no reaction time or warning for anyone though when Dr.Parker assuming everything to be good to go pressed the firing button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful laser fired and hit Jasmine enveloping her and the piece of fruit. Oddly the laser didn't hurt a bit but Jasmine could feel an odd feeling. Energy was building within her. She somehow felt stronger, more energized, more full of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 60 seconds into firing that the scientists finally noticed their error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god doctor quick stop the laser\" panicked the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker was about to question why when perhaps 1 of worst fears were realized. There on the table holding the Orange and in her panties only no less was Jasmine her likely soon to be not so \"little\" girl in front of the laser of the Growth Ray for 75 seconds and counting now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking it took another 12 ish seconds to deactivate the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the test room Jasmine was yet unaware she was noticed as she watched the lasers intensity start to decrease then suddenly it stopped completely. The feelings the laser brought faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greatful at least that the laser didn't hurt and she didn't really feel any different than she had 5 minutes ago except feeling as tho she had gotten a lifetime of beauty sleep or at least as though she had awaken from the best sleep of her young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine did notice however her creamy white skin felt smoother, her brown hair had more of a sheen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next Jasmine dreaded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a speaker system the lab had came her moms voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine don't you dare move young lady\" said her mom in a tone that even a child like her could understand as not good. She didn't dare move from the table. However a change happened that was small enough to go unnoticed for now. Jamsmine went from 3\"10 in height to 4 foot even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom spoke again in a different tone. A mix of concern and professionalism like a doctor to her patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen honey I know you're worried about being in trouble but right now there are more important concerns. I need to ask you some things and you need to answer as clear and honest as you can ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure her mom could hear but in fear she replied meekly \"Y-yes mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok good. Now I don't want to scare you but that thing that just shot at you was something mommy has been expriementing with. We don't know yet how it will affect people but your body will probably go through some changes. 1st question do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. No not really I mean my skin feels smoother, my hair feels like it has been cared for better and I feel like I just had the bestest night of sleep ever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm interesting. Ok next question can you describe how the laser felt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh well it uhh kinda felt tingly at 1st then the entire time I felt weird, like I had tons of energy and like I was somehow stronger than usual. I can't really splain it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker was about to explain things to Jasmine when she noticed her acting strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine began to feel a different weird feeling. Her body tingled and vibrated and pulsated. She looked at herself in curiousity as she felt something building within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she began to grow the Orange and oddly yet thankfully her pink panties growing with her. Her green eyes full of mixed emotions as her body swelled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4\"6 .. 5\" ... 5\"6 ... 6\".. 7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and taller she grew her body maintaining perfect proportionate growth all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10\" ... 12\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 15 foot tall her head bumped the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom what's happening to me\" asked the still growin 7 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt crushed the wooden table as she was forced to grow ever larger. Her mom and her mothers assistant decided it best to retreat to safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 20 foot child was filing the room her feet brushed up against the laser activating it manually. The growing child got another dose of the Growth Ray much to her retreating mothers dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs then snaked around the laser that was now firing at her panties right between the legs. She was forced into a crouched sitting position holding the Orange to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs burst thru the wall into the lab meanwhile Jasmine could crouch no further and the ceiling gave into the 30 foot growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head and soon after her shoulders busted thru to the 2nd then 3rd floor of their estate while her legs punched thru serveral walls and rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she felt something press again her girl parts thru her panties. It was none other than the tip of the laser still firing on her. She inched back a tiny bit but with her growing form it was short lived as she found it pressing again \"that spot\" again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more it pressed as she grew still firing full blast on its target. Soon her growing body dislodged the Growth Ray from the ceiling. The Ray was still firing and pressing up against the spot until her growing body pressed it against the wall and started to crush it like a tin can. 5 seconds of vice like pressure and the laser stopped as parts were either flattened or scattered off in busted pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jasmine's legs busted thru the front of their mansion while her head busted thru the roof. Her left arm punched thru a wall to outside while her right was occupying the 4th floor corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jasmine stopped growing for now at a height of 60 Feet tall.<br>\r\nDr.Parker was in awe among other mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still she knew this wasn't over. She was certain her daughter would grow bigger eventually though how big was anyone's guess at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st things 1st however  </span></div></div>",

And right then she felt something in her grip. She looked at her hand and was delighted to realize that she was holding an ice-cream. Exactly the chocolate ice-cream she last had, which she had pictured in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile appeared in her face. She was surprised, but not really shocked. At her young age magic stuff didn't feel implausible to her. She looked at the room's boring white walls, and wished to make them light blue, which was her favorite color because that's how the sky was outside. It immediately happened, and then she had the sun, a rainbow and several clouds appear, way better drawn than she could possibly do by hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty excited, but before trying more things she wanted to enjoy her ice-cream, so after admiring her work she walked to the corridor, where she tore the packaging, pulled it into her short trousers' pocket and started munching it. There she was noticed by Mr. Hogdson, the grumpiest employee in the whole orphanage, who frowned even more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get that ice-cream?\" he said sternly, getting there in a few strides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Jasmine would have been frightened, but right now she was pretty confident about her newfound magic, so she sticked out her tongue. Mr. Hodgson wasn't amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you dare?\" he said. </span></div></div>",

He still retained his human mind, and looked around in confusion at the floor just below him, then up at the little girl. He tried to talk, but he could only yip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute now!\" Jasmine exclaimed, throwing herself on him. She started petting him, scrubbing his fur and rubbing him against the floor. Mr. Hodgson struggled desperately until he managed to free himself and ran through the corridor panicked. Then Jasmine turned him back into a human, and finding himself running on all fours he instantly lost balance and fell down spectacularly, bruising his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Jasmine laugh, and looking back he saw her floating in the air, near the ceiling. Terrified, he jumped on his feet and ran away from her, which Jasmine found even more hilarious. It was the first time she had been able to tease one of those severe, grumbling grown-ups around her, and it felt great. Would they punish her for it? Not if she didn't allow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H- How can you-\" muttered one of the astonished kids in the hallway, a couple years older than Jasmine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, huh? Wanna try?\" she smiled at him from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer the child was floating up at a height of over two meters. Unlike Jasmine he wasn't in charge, so he flapped his arms and legs trying to get in a vertical position, without attaining much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charge!\", Jasmine suddenly shouted as she launched herself against him and pushed him away as if they were in a space rocket with the gravity turned off. As the classmate that was with him tried in vain to lower him to the ground, she lied back in the air with her hands crossed behind her head and an ankle on her other knee, smiling happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that one of the things she had enjoyed the most about Mr. Hodgson's predicament was looking at him from above, and that he probably felt as she had been feeling all this time. That's when she tought that actually being that taller than them would be a lot of fun. Or maybe becoming outright gigantic!</span></div></div>",

She was also arguably 1 of the craziest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor nearly 3 years straight she had been experimenting with manipulating the size of things. Working herself to the brink of exhaustion many times. Finally her best project had come to fruition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA functioning Growth Ray. She had been testing it a few months now on various things and on some small living animals and insects in varied small doses on varied settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was ready for human trials but who?<br>\r\nShe had no desires to be bigger plus if she got too big or suffered adverse effects she might not be able to continue her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker did have a 7 year old daughter named Jasmine who was snobbish and demanding at times but otherwise gentle and harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women shook her head. No she couldn't possibly use her own daughter it would be immoral. Plus who knows what a giant child even a gentle one would be like. There was also the what if factor when it came to adverse effects! No using Jasmine was an absolute no no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker and her part time assistant left the lab to mull over their options. Meanwhile Jasmine snuck into the lab it was after all part of their mansion. Jasmine had just woken up a short time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had forgotten that it was the maids day off when she went to look for her clothes. Failing to find them since she was a bit odd when it came to modesty she decided this morning would be one of her Panty mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was Jasmine in nothing but her silk pink panties with tiny pink bows along the waistline. Jasmine snuck her way over to the computer this time the computer for the Growth Ray and played around with various buttons. Little did Jasmine realize she altered the settings to Max Power output, max exposure , set the interval functions quite high ( controls number of growth spurts ) and even locked the system to be permenent and irreversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jasmine heard footsteps and voices.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr.Parker was 1 of the richest and best scientists in the world. She was also arguably 1 of the craziest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor nearly 3 years straight she had been experimenting with manipulating the size of things. Working herself to the brink of exhaustion many times. Finally her best project had come to fruition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA functioning Growth Ray. She had been testing it a few months now on various things and on some small living animals and insects in varied small doses on varied settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was ready for human trials but who?<br>\r\nShe had no desires to be bigger plus if she got too big or suffered adverse effects she might not be able to continue her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker did have a 7 year old daughter named Jasmine who was snobbish and demanding at times but otherwise gentle and harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women shook her head. No she couldn't possibly use her own daughter it would be immoral. Plus who knows what a giant child even a gentle one would be like. There was also the what if factor when it came to adverse effects! No using Jasmine was an absolute no no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker and her part time assistant left the lab to mull over their options. Meanwhile Jasmine snuck into the lab it was after all part of their mansion. Jasmine had just woken up a short time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had forgotten that it was the maids day off when she went to look for her clothes. Failing to find them since she was a bit odd when it came to modesty she decided this morning would be one of her Panty mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was Jasmine in nothing but her silk pink panties with tiny pink bows along the waistline. Jasmine snuck her way over to the computer this time the computer for the Growth Ray and played around with various buttons. Little did Jasmine realize she altered the settings to Max Power output, max exposure , set the interval functions quite high ( controls number of growth spurts ) and even locked the system to be permenent and irreversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jasmine heard footsteps and voices. Panicking she rushed to hide inadvertently going into the testing room the door locking behind her. Little did Jasmine account for no place to hide so she sat on the table grabbing the Orange that was on it and hoping somehow she wouldn't get spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just at least run this test this morning\" said the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker agreed and the 2 so busily set to work so used to the task by now they didn't even look at the caked monitor to notice Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jasmine noticed a big gun looking device pointed at her the table and the Orange. There was no reaction time or warning for anyone though when Dr.Parker assuming everything to be good to go pressed the firing button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful laser fired and hit Jasmine enveloping her and the piece of fruit. Oddly the laser didn't hurt a bit but Jasmine could feel an odd feeling. Energy was building within her. She somehow felt stronger, more energized, more full of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 60 seconds into firing that the scientists finally noticed their error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god doctor quick stop the laser\" panicked the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker was about to question why when perhaps 1 of worst fears were realized. There on the table holding the Orange and in her panties only no less was Jasmine her likely soon to be not so \"little\" girl in front of the laser of the Growth Ray for 75 seconds and counting now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking it took another 12 ish seconds to deactivate the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the test room Jasmine was yet unaware she was noticed as she watched the lasers intensity start to decrease then suddenly it stopped completely. The feelings the laser brought faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greatful at least that the laser didn't hurt and she didn't really feel any different than she had 5 minutes ago except feeling as tho she had gotten a lifetime of beauty sleep or at least as though she had awaken from the best sleep of her young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine did notice however her creamy white skin felt smoother, her brown hair had more of a sheen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next Jasmine dreaded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a speaker system the lab had came her moms voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine don't you dare move young lady\" said her mom in a tone that even a child like her could understand as not good. She didn't dare move from the table. However a change happened that was small enough to go unnoticed for now. Jamsmine went from 3\"10 in height to 4 foot even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom spoke again in a different tone. A mix of concern and professionalism like a doctor to her patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen honey I know you're worried about being in trouble but right now there are more important concerns. I need to ask you some things and you need to answer as clear and honest as you can ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure her mom could hear but in fear she replied meekly \"Y-yes mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok good. Now I don't want to scare you but that thing that just shot at you was something mommy has been expriementing with. We don't know yet how it will affect people but your body will probably go through some changes. 1st question do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. No not really I mean my skin feels smoother, my hair feels like it has been cared for better and I feel like I just had the bestest night of sleep ever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm interesting. Ok next question can you describe how the laser felt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh well it uhh kinda felt tingly at 1st then the entire time I felt weird, like I had tons of energy and like I was somehow stronger than usual. I can't really splain it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Parker was about to explain things to Jasmine when she noticed her acting strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine began to feel a different weird feeling. Her body tingled and vibrated and pulsated. She looked at herself in curiousity as she felt something building within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she began to grow the Orange and oddly yet thankfully her pink panties growing with her. Her green eyes full of mixed emotions as her body swelled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4\"6 .. 5\" ... 5\"6 ... 6\".. 7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and taller she grew her body maintaining perfect proportionate growth all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10\" ... 12\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 15 foot tall her head bumped the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom what's happening to me\" asked the still growin 7 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt crushed the wooden table as she was forced to grow ever larger. Her mom and her mothers assistant decided it best to retreat to safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 20 foot child was filing the room her feet brushed up against the laser activating it manually. The growing child got another dose of the Growth Ray much to her retreating mothers dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs then snaked around the laser that was now firing at her panties right between the legs. She was forced into a crouched sitting position holding the Orange to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs burst thru the wall into the lab meanwhile Jasmine could crouch no further and the ceiling gave into the 30 foot growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head and soon after her shoulders busted thru to the 2nd then 3rd floor of their estate while her legs punched thru serveral walls and rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she felt something press again her girl parts thru her panties. It was none other than the tip of the laser still firing on her. She inched back a tiny bit but with her growing form it was short lived as she found it pressing again \"that spot\" again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more it pressed as she grew still firing full blast on its target. Soon her growing body dislodged the Growth Ray from the ceiling. The Ray was still firing and pressing up against the spot until her growing body pressed it against the wall and started to crush it like a tin can. 5 seconds of vice like pressure and the laser stopped as parts were either flattened or scattered off in busted pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jasmine's legs busted thru the front of their mansion while her head busted thru the roof. Her left arm punched thru a wall to outside while her right was occupying the 4th floor corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jasmine stopped growing for now at a height of 60 Feet tall.<br>\r\nDr.Parker was in awe among other mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still she knew this wasn't over. She was certain her daughter would grow bigger eventually though how big was anyone's guess at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st things 1st however  </span></div></div>",

It was the first day of second grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike! Come downstairs for breakfast!\" yelled his mother. Michael hurriedly ran down the stairs to see that his mother was making blueberry pancakes, a tradition on the first day of school. Unfortunately, his two older brothers, Tony and Percy, were still finishing theirs. Upon seeing Michael, Tony, the oldest brother at age 17, walked up to Michael, put him in a headlock, and gave him a noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Shorts,\" he taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShorts was the nickname he was given by his brothers. Michael was only 6 years old, standing at a measly three foot seven, more than two feet behind his older brothers. He hated being reminded of his stature and wished his brothers were the ones he could call \"Shorts\", not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of breakfast went by smoothly. While Tony and Percy investigated any classes they shared, Michael discussed with his mother his nervousness about entering second grade. She told him it will be fun and Michael would rarely be bullied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it was 7:40, and it was time for Michael to go to school. How does he travel there?</span></div></div>",

Oh, you don't need your backpack today. I'll see you after school! Bye, honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Michael began his half-mile walk. He has walked this route many times last year, so he has no problem walking it again. This trip, however, seemed different. With every step, a small vibration traveled up his leg and across his body. He froze, and the vibrations stopped. Figuring it was nothing, the vibrations started again as Michael continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he arrived at school. It was 7:54 when he arrived, and school starts at 8:00, so he hurriedly went to his new classroom and sat down. The teacher, Mrs. Putz, introduced herself in front of the class and began to take roll. Naturally, Michael came last, with his last name beginning with Y.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mrs. Putz called out Michael's name, she looked at him and said in a confused tone, \"What have your parents been feeding you?\" Then she started giving instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, recess came, and Michael went and hid himself. He was nervous despite his mother's solace, especially since the weird vibrations came every step he took. He doesn't know this, but the vibrations he feels makes him taller. He is now four foot one, a full six inches from this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day came by quickly, and Michael, who is expecting his friend over at his house when he comes home, breaks into a run. As his speed increases, the vibrations increase more. At this point Michael tried his best to ignore them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael opened the unlocked door, only to see his brother Percy waiting for him. \"What's up, Shorts?\" he taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Percy freezes, then turns around. \"Dude!\" he yells. \"Looks like Shorts isn't that short anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael became confused, as Tony yells, \"Whoa! Tell him to measure up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measure up,\" Percy commands, as he grabs Michael and pushes him to the measuring ruler. Michael finally understood the vibrations.

What was even more unexpected was how it ended. Witnesses say a humongous being with the body of a grade-schooler walked into the city, crushed all of the planes before they could drop any more bombs, and threw them as far as he could out of the city. A rumor like this has never been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirdest part was that the rumor was true. After the crisis was finished, Michael left the city, being careful not to step on any buildings. Ever since the genie granted his wish of him becoming \"huge\" he enjoyed being dominant over nearly everything. However, he knew that even at his size, more than 200 feet tall, he was still vulnerable, hence he cannot destroy everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael walked back to the mountains, where no one but him visits, and waited. He was exiled by a secret government organization in an effort to \"keep the peace\". But that doesn't stop him from escaping. Michael felt the need to help the city as soon as he saw the planes drop bombs, and felt the government would be fine if he saved the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Michael felt a tapping on his shoe. He turned around, and saw a boy so small Michael could crush him if he wanted to. The boy had dirty black hair, wore a plaid jacket, and carried a backpack. \"Hello,\" he said to the boy. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are YOU?\" the boy responded in an excited tone. \"I mean, you're tall and strong and awesome!

Ashley was one such person, on her way to school. She sat at the back of the bus, her bag occupying the seat next to her so nobody could sit there. She pulled her hat down, the rim covering her eyes. She gazed out of the window, longing to see the sprawling countryside, to go to a place where she'd be able to relax, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes would be drawn to the large buildings whenever she passed them by, architecture could be considered her passion, the thing she wished to work in when she was older. The way such enormous buildings were made fascinated her. Zoning out now, the girl's foot began to absently tap against the floor of the bus. Her imagination filled with arches and her own design for buildings as she remained distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were paying attention, Ashley would've noticed the brief green flash in her eyes, the result of an experimental 'growth ray' misfiring. She remained distracted as her body began to grow, the only thing that got her attention being the creaking of the bus as her body quickly became too big to fit in it. Her blue eyes went wide as she observed the rapidly shrinking world, a rather large crashing noise being audible as she burst out of the back of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley landed on her butt, which began to take up the entire road as she grew and grew. Her increasing mass sent cracks cascading through the tarmac, a large crater being left in her rear's wake. Quickly standing, the girl was amazed to see the surrounding buildings also shrinking. She payed no attention to the ground anymore as one of the tall buildings she was marveling at only a minute ago caught her vision. She walked over to it, her steps leaving large footprints, the holes getting slightly larger with each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the girl stopped growing, her new eye level being near the top of the previously towering buildings. She stood at 400 feet in height, rivaling even the taller buildings in the city. Ashley tried to contain her shock, a hand covering her mouth as she peered around at her surroundings. Her cheeks went red as she looked to the floor, noticing an enormous presence of small things grouped around her shoes. She didn't need to guess what they were, she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were humans, people just like her. Just like she used to be. No doubt staring up at her, the amount of attention they gave made her nervous. This was an entirely new situation to the now gigantic girl, and she didn't know if she could take it. Her knees began to shake a little as she placed a 'dainty' hand upon a skyscraper for balance. As her fingers tightened around it, just a little, she could feel the material buckling under her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes darted around the city streets beneath her, she acted, the girl.....</span></div></div>",

It had happened before she'd even realized it, cracks ran out from the spot of impact, and the mass began to retreat, moving like a swarm of bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she'd done hit her at this, she'd killed people, lots of people. Her eyes widened further, it was quite a shock to take in. Ashley was about to try and apologize, before another realization hit, just how easy it was. It wasn't like they could do much to her, or that she needed to really apologize. They'd still be running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes followed one crowd as they slowly surged down the thin road, moving around cars that lay abandoned on the road. She seemed to have caused quite a panic. A smile subconsciously spread across her face as she slowly removed her hand from the building she'd held, she wasn't exactly nervous anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the building, the twelve year-old turned her attention towards it, squinting in order to try and see through the windows. Lo and behold, she could see tiny people inside. Her smile widened into a semi-guilty smirk as she pushed her hand into the building once more, applying more force. The building fell rather easily, clouds of dust swirling around her feet as the rubble spread out. She could hear faint screams, which only further made her feel powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, she decided to stomp on the rubble, her foot sinking through it and onto the ground. The sinking felt rather nice, though as she turned her attention to the skies once more, she saw things, helicopters, planes. They were still tiny, but thoughts of the military crept into her mind. Could they hurt her? Did she want to find out?</span></div></div>",

With another shrug of her shoulders, she crouched down, grabbing up a lump of the building like it was a chunk of a destroyed sand castle. With no more hesitation, she turned and threw it through another building, a large hole being formed in the skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed on at the destruction caused to the building. The twinge of guilt she'd felt for destroying what was such an expensive building faded within seconds, it just looked like a model to her now. Seeing that it hadn't been knocked over, Ashley shook her head, tutting a little. Deciding that the job was unfinished, she casually kicked the building, her shoe effortlessly cutting through the lower levels of the building. It collapsed onto the roof of her foot, more dust being released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the girl, a news helicopter was circling just above her head, feeding live footage to the broadcasters. By now, everyone in the city knew of her growth, and most were beyond themselves with panic. All but one person, another kid who was actually one of Ashley's most close friends. She didn't have many, but the one or two she did have were very close to her. He'd immediately recognized her as the colossal girl on the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his phone out, he called her, seeing if she'd respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack where Ashley was, she'd just finished grinding the rubble of the latest building to dust, when she felt her phone vibrating in her pocket. It too had grown, along with everything that was on her at the time. Taking her phone out, she saw that it was Ben calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to think: Did she bother answering, or was he just another one of these weak, defenseless people now, did he matter to her still?</span></div></div>",

The streets get crushed under her massive weight and she smiles at the damage she's done with such little effort. \"Be there in a few, try not to get stepped on.\" She says casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can hangup though Ben tries to speak again. \"W-W-Wait! Can you... Er well... maybe... do one more thing?\" He asks nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stops and waits. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley couldn't see it, but Ben's face was lighting up red, he was so embarassed just thinking about what he was going to ask that he could barely make out the words. \"Well... I um....\" He started slowly. \"Could you take off your shoes and socks?\" He quietly finishes expecting her to just hangup and threaten to squish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley heard the request and just shrugged. \"Ummm alright, I guess it'd be easier on the tiny people that I'm stepping on if they get squished by my feet instead of my shoe.\" Ashley says as she pulls off her sneakers and finds a bit of a surprise. Her socks were drenched in sweat. \"Oh wow, my feet are sooooo sweaty!\" She says with a half smile. She throws her shoes aside without really thinking about the impact they would have on the tiny folk, they crushed cars and people alike and from the openings came a powerful sweaty preteen aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben heard what his giantess of a friend was saying he couldn't be happier. He didn't really understand why, being so young, but he loved the idea of his friend Ashley being so big and sweaty. \"W-Well just make sure to find me!\" He said trying to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm yeah yeah\" Ashley said as she held her phone to her ear with her shoulder. She bent down to peel off her socks. There was something enjoyable about her feet being so covered in sweat, she didn't understand it much, usually this would be gross. Maybe it was because she knew that the scent would be so much worse for the tiny people on the ground than for her? She set her foot down and removed the other sock. Wigging her toes she tosses the sweat drenched socks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProving that fate hated the smaller folk around Ashley, the socks landed on a group of people trying to run from her. The wet cotton weighed the group down and it became clear to them as the miasma of preteen sweat filled their lungs that this would be their world now. They quickly found that they couldn't move, they were stuck to Ashley's socks because of the adhesion of her sweat. They cried out but their pleas only managed to get sweat in their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was completely oblivious to this as she proceeded to go find her friend. She was enjoying being a giantess so much more than she could ever have imagined! What could make this better? Maybe if she was bigger, but she was satisfied with this... for now. She began walking towards her friend's house leaving the dense city when she saw another group of children a few years older than her. This is the type of group that would've made fun of her for having sweaty feet, well... they would have if she was still small! She walked by them and thought about what she should do... </span></div></div>",

She then proceeded to then respond the words. \u201cSorry Ben, I got bigger plans now.\u201d She smirked with an evil smile just as she pressed on the screen to decline the phone call from him, and then she proceeded to throw her phone onto the ground, crushing anyone unluckily enough to be in the debris of the huge falling phone.

Numerous large pits would be made in the road as her shoes smashed into it, cars falling from her soles as she lifted them. Everything in her path was crushed, all while she was flustered about the large crowd staring up at her. The girl reached the suburbs of the city, near it's outskirts. There were much less people here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a relieved breath, slowly sitting down to regain herself. To her, this was just some time to think, but to the three or four homes she flattened beneath her, it was instant death for anyone inside. The girl's cheeks flushed red as she felt something beneath her, but she ignored it, not wanting to face the embarrassment any longer. Ashley fidgeted a little as she pondered her predicament, it was rather unique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few minutes, she came to a decision: ____</span></div></div>",

The police searched for weeks, but had no success either. The parents had nothing to do by weep over the loss of their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, in the middle of nowhere, a 12-year old girl lay in the sun. The rays of the sun woke her up. There was nothing to do out here. She could only think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, she didn't even need to eat or drink, nor was she ever noticed for the past few weeks after she ran away from her parents. From what she remembered, the house became too tight over the night and she had to escape... The memory was fuzzy. She's been in the same field for so long, she barely remembers her name. But in the back of her head she'd find it: Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and looked around. Sure enough, she was still in the same field, lined with grass and unchanged for weeks, she actually liked being alone. Another day, a day of waiting. The sun turned into clouds, who soon hovered low above her. She reached up and put her hand in one. It was almost magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was magic about the incident is that Ashley ran away from all civilization before she can turn into a monster. She can no longer remember when she was only a normal 12-year old girl. She became enormous, nearly 600 feet tall. And she was still never noticed. Until this day.</span></div></div>",

She assumed she had crushed him so hard he was gone! The young titaness decided to skip away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex quickly began to feel moist, almost like he was sweating, but he wasn't moving. It was very hot and still smelled completely like Ashley's feet. He felt a massive glob of sweat drip down his face and realized what happened. When Ashley stomped on the tiny man, she succeeded in crushing him, but for some reason he didn't die... Instead his body was fused to the massive child's toe! Helpless, he stayed as a little and barely distinguishable mark on Ashley's giant toe. He tried to struggle but all he accomplished was causing the toe he was a part of to sweat a little more. He unfortunately still had his senses, taste and smell being the strongest. He could taste every salty drop of sweat that dripped past his surface and had to constantly \"breathe\" in Ashley's awful foot stench. Her skipping didn't help either, making her sweatier and hotter. Soon the giant girl was leaving small lakes of sweat in her footprints on the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh... My toe feels nice...\" Ashley said as she started to become aware of Alex's position. She looked down at her foot and noticed the little mark that was Alex's body. \"Hah! The bad man decided to become part of my toe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wanted to curse at her and tell her that he hated this. He wanted to hit her, make her feel the pain he felt right now. But he was helpless. The universe chose this young girl to become this giant creature and him to just be helplessly and probably permanently attached to her sweaty toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I wonder if I squish more people under my sweaty feet... Maybe they'll get stuck to my feet like this guy!\" Ashley says excitedly. She smiled and thought about what to do. \"I think I'll....\"</span></div></div>",

Roger Livingston is both the ringmaster, and the man in charger running the business.  He had a wife named Sarah, who deals with the animal tricks, his daughter Kelly, who is sixteen, and she\u2019s performing acrobatics, and then his son named Bruce.  He\u2019s nine years old, and he\u2019s a bit too young to perform at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce is more like a helper by any means, which he doesn\u2019t seem to mind of it, since he can basically looking up to his family and other performers, and learn everything from them at this early stage.  It was going to be another usual day, which he was there at the tent to set everything up for the next show.  That was until he was wanted by his father, Roger, and greeted with that wide smile to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey son!  Do you mind if I can talk to you for a bit?\u201d  Roger wondered with that smile to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Dad, what is it?\u201d  Bruce wondered with a nod, and listened to what his Dad is asking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I\u2019m glad you wanted to help, since you\u2019re a bit young to perform for our circus, but I\u2019ve just recently had a performer taken ill, and I was wondering if you would like to take its place, and see how you get on?\u201d  Roger asked, since he needed someone to fill in its space to get the show going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Bruce looked surprised with his face been lifted up widely.  \u201cYou want me to perform in front of the audience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Bruce!  I really do!  In fact, I\u2019ve got an act just for you to come in as.\u201d  Roger says, as he already found some talent his son could do something with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that will be great!  But what part am I in?\u201d  Roger asked with wide smile and was curious as to what his Dad has got for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Roger had something in mind is that he doesn\u2019t have an act that does freak-shows or people with extraordinary things.  Of course there was one thing that\u2019s never been done before that is being a giant at 20 feet tall.  He knew his nine year old son is a good fit to fill in that role, as he\u2019s only stood at 4\u20197, so he\u2019ll be hoping if Bruce will enjoy this, as much as he wants to keep this a secret until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll surprise you my boy, which is why I wanna...</span></div></div>",

Every time Molly, in her pink swimsuit, gets out of school for the weekend she asks her parents to go to the beach, to which they usually respond, \"Ask Tanya to take you this Saturday.\" Tanya usually says no at first, to which Molly starts punching her until she agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about this, Tanya lost focus, and she swerves the car off the road. A sudden drop damaged the steering wheel, which later broke due bumpy terrain not suitable for a sedan. Tanya quickly slammed on the brakes, but it didn't do much due to the downhill terrain. She turns on the parking brake, which only made it worse, as the car started tumbling down the road. Before she could get crushed, Tanya quickly opened the driver-side door and exited, leaving Molly behind in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya quickly ran to her sister's help, but to no avail, as the car crashes into a nuclear power plant. She wanted to rescue her, but \"No Trespassing\" and \"Caution: Radioactivity\" signs dotted the barb-wire fence that the car cut through. No sign of Molly. Tanya quickly finds the nearest official she could find and tells her the news. \"We're already working on it,\" the official said, \"but I think your sister won't be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later workers came out of the power plant with Molly on a gurney, unconscious. Tanya was shocked. \"She miraculously survived the crash,\" Tanya was told. \"We treated her for radioactivity, but there may be... side-effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya didn't care. She was happy Molly was safe, yet to wake up. Molly looked fine but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was relieved that her little sister was okay, but something seemed off about Molly. She seemed... Bigger. Tanya zoned out as she looked down at Molly, who was still sleeping. Molly twitched slightly, and Tanya swallowed as she slowly blew up another inch or so, everyone else too engrossed in the conversation to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes or so later Tanya notices Molly Twitch again.<br>\r\nTo Tanya's shock but confirming what she had seen earlier Molly swelled another 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm where am I? What happened big sis and why are you looking at me like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick doctor come here something is happening to my sister<br>\r\nTanya finally gets their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good she's regained consciousness. What seems to be the problem then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor I'm not sure how but she's growing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at Tanya like she was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she's growing she is still a child after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dolt I mean actually growing as in something straight out of a movie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll humor you just to prove a point\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he helped Molly up and had her get on a combination digital scale and height checker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results shocked every nurse and doctor on Molly's case plus her sister.<br>\r\nAs the doctor sat the level on her forehead he was went from the chart to the readout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-there must be some mistake the readings put her at 4 foot 5 and 60 pounds<br>\r\nBut her medical records indicate she should be 3 foot 8 and 50 pounds\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I told you\" huffed Tanya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait are you saying I got taller\" said Molly excited.<br>\r\n\"Huh I feel strange\" added Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical staff then watched in shock as Molly grew again.<br>\r\nHer bodies proportions stayed mostly the same as she swelled.<br>\r\nThe measurer on her head was pushed up inch by inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly crept larger over the next minute till her height read 4 foot 10 and her weight reading went up <br>\r\nto 64.6 pounds. Oddly her only clothes growing with her was her pink skirt and her Sky Blue panties.<br>\r\nHer hospital gown was starting to become too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness this is insane!

Wanna explain why, then here it goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg is a major supervillian fan and always wanted to be whatever age can bring and superpowers he gets.  It was last night however made a boy's dream come true when he had spotted a shooting star across the sky.  He knew whatever by making a wish makes it all happen.  So he made a huge sigh before he makes his wish he needed as quickly as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I'm gonna be a supervillian and have superpowers!\"  He wished before the shooting star was disappeared straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was feeling tired soon-after and soon head to bed and lie down on a pillow to get some sleep and hoping his wish would be possible to make that happening for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the next morning came, he got up just as much he was struggling to get up so at this time, but something was not right as far as he was concerned.  That's when he realized he was wearing his supervillian costume, not replicas but real leather of his own.  Greg was shocked by seeing things but excited with a smile at the same time and got up to have a look at the mirror to take a look at his new costume he got on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis costume had a full red suit with black briefs, cape, and boots, and it had a logo on his chest which has a letter G, signifying as the beginning of his first name.  He loved it so far at this stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never thought I can have something like this, but what is my superpowers anyway?\"  Greg wondered and that's what he had to find out for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in case if he damages the house inside, Greg took the advantage and went outside for try it for himself.  He stood outside in the middle of the street and takes his deep breath before he starts to think through his mind to start up his powers.  That's when it all revealed when suddenly, he was growing taller, but much bigger in fast rate than any persons or even anything in site.  It was hard to believe this was his superpowers he's got, but this was best he's ever seen in his life and loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on growing bigger and bigger until it came to a stop, and Greg stands at 500 feet tall.  That makes him a giant supervillian at only eight years of age and a giggle says it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, this is awesome!  It's just what I always wanted!\"  He says echoing his high pitched voice and looked down to the streets on how tiny it is compare to himself right now, and he's in control to add a fun to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had never thought of an idea from what he's gonna start the fun first of all, but looking around the places he can see from his point of view, made him want to start on doing in his first assignment, but which place was it he starts off with?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a girly playful like monster roar was then emitted and no one even screamed at all. Soon, the figure came into appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArising from the view of the buildings and such was a 200ft tall 10 year old with brown hair and blue eyes, wearing nothing but a blue bra and underwear just as she was stomping through the city, careful not to crush anything. She was seen placing her foot around one of the city subdivision streets as if she was trying to navigate around. She then saw all of the people looking up at the giant girl, and many people seem to take pictures of her with their phones or record her little cute monster poses just as she makes them for her fans. This girl's name is Haruka Shizuka, and she was wide-eyed and grinning as the people take photos and videos of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is easily the most popular and most talked about girl in the entire city and even the entire world for that matter, and that is mainly due to her Godzilla like height at 200ft tall. Many people wonder how the giant girl came to be, but one thing was for certain, everyone seems to adore her. She smiled just as she emits a cute little monster like roar for her fans before she stomps out of view, careful not to crush anything at all. The reason she is adored, well because she is not only a super star, but also a really cool here, keeping Japan (mainly) and the world safe from any monsters or invaders, and even helping out in assisting the United Nations of conflicting nations where she goes in an rampages their base like a giant monster. Why she is a giant monster, well because of her dream was to hope to be as big as the giant monsters so she can do great things. Now that obviously happened, but how is a mystery, but it seemed to also given her some other abilties as well, because of her love for monster movies and her immense size and power, she is usually called to the public Harukazilla, and she likes that name enough that she doesn't mind being called that all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is Harukazilla doing today?</span></div></div>",

This simply would not do, and taking a couple steps back, she swiped the dock where it met with the land, crushing countless people against her hand and totally severing any means of escape for those on the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smiled at the terror on their faces as they all stood frozen in fear, staring up at the enormous giantess.

Suddenly, a great idea crossed her mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what would happen if I...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, the giantess slowly began to lower her rear-end down on top of the dock. Many chose to dive into the water in hopes of evading her massive behind, but they would soon find that it would do them no good. As she settled down, she loved the way the people exploded underneath her butt, and she especially savored the way the dock crunched to red-stained splinters beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had settled down, she ground her hips into the water, furthering the last few crunches and silencing the last of the screams.

Looking back at the destroyed pier which she caused tons of deaths, Haruka gives her blue bikini top a once-over before she started to stomp further into the water, and after she gets to a far enough distance, she then begins to dive straight underwater so she can scare the crap out of the passengers when she reaches those boats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is going to be so much fun, now I will show them what a real monster can do. Luckily I can breathe underwater.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the boats begun to panic as several of them started to abandon ship, getting onto lifeboats and started heading to the shore to get away from the giant girl who is now underwater, who can strike at anytime. Just as one lifeboat begins to head to shore, somehow a giant hand begins appears right in front of it and she slams it right onto the boat, breaking it and killing the people who was on it with her hands. She then sees another ship trying to make it out, and for that one she decided to go underwater once more, and this time she opens her mouth wide open. She then goes right under the ship trying to escape, and then she ends up eating the ship and its people right then and there. She then proceeds to repeat this process with the various lifeboats on the boat, and after a few, she started to get bored with those boats, but then one boat caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a giant curise like boat that has like a few thousand people right on it, and they were all in horror and shock that they saw the giant girl just devour and destroy all those smaller boats with her body. Then suddenly, the giantess turned with a smirk in her eye and a evil smile, and then the people started to get really scared as the giantess started to swim towards their boat. Soon, everyone was in a frenzy just as Haruka suddenly grabs one end of the curise line with left hand, and then soon the other one, and then she pulls herself right into the terrified people's face, and then she gives out one truly monstrous roar after she takes her breath in. The roar that the girl emitted was an incredibly strong roar, as it was almost Godzilla like in tone, but also sounded girly as well. The roar surely deafen tons of ears from the people, but it also shattered windows all through the curise line, and then she begun to speak to the terrified people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Harukagon, and I am here to bring ruin to your city and rule this world, no one shall dare confront my power, so any last words before I destroy you all!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people were just too terrified to answer and so Haruka begins to....</span></div></div>",

Plus, his belly is very noticeably fat also that it hanged over his sweatpants and his shirt riding up, looking awfully tight as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott is a binge eater, taking lots of junk food, and having great flavours which makes him want to eat more and more.  He wasn\u2019t very keen being so fat as first, since he basically enjoyed the food from a young age.  That was until about six months ago, when he had to look at the mirror to check how fat he had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have shocked him at first, but with few jiggles in some areas made him able to chuckle, and decides being so fat is so cool, and that\u2019s he reason why he wanted to eat more junk food as it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t enjoy the most is with people that mistreated him badly.  Simply because of how massive he is, and he would get laugh at by everyone, due to being so obese, and they\u2019re all slimmer by any means.  Even his older brother is the worst, he would ditched the couch Scott would be sitting and steal some channels for him to watch.  The only solution he had been ordered is go outside and get some exercise, according to his older brother\u2019s cheekiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it happens again, when Scott can be seen rather annoyed when storming outside to have a fresh air or some sort.  He would kick a little stone and would moaning and talking to himself in a frustrating mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come I\u2019ve been treated so badly, just because I\u2019m so far?

It wasn\u2019t something was in pain or that, but even when he see\u2019s something changed, but he couldn\u2019t figure it out why.  However, it would take a while until he see\u2019s his house looking a bit smaller than usual.  That\u2019s when Scott was fully surprised and realised he had just grown taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking like a giant, taller than anybody around him.

She has a great look with her blonde hair and orange eyes, and has a nice and slim body with some decent-sized breasts for a girl her age, but well... that is just one part of her. Another big part of her life is surely... her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was just a young baby, she has a rare disease that causes her to have some massive growth spurs over her young years. When she was just 3 years old, she was at the roof's height inside her house, and then a few years afterwards, she was as big as a house easily for sure. At age 11 as she is currently, she stands at 50 feet tall, easily towering the suburbs, but still small compared to many buildings around her, but still, it doesn't stop her from growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of these growths, scientists and her parents made a tent her size by the park to where she sleeps. Her clothes were all tailored made by various companies for the giant girl, scientists came up with some ways to make food bigger so she can eat and still feel full when she eats, and many other things. But let's just say that living 50 feet high can be tough, but it also does has its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie became really active in Los Angeles on the movie and modeling scene because of her gigantism, and she made huge amounts of money because of it to afford her lifestyle of fame. She is also seen as a hero, stopping crimes all over the city with her giant height, and rescuing people as well as needed. She is also extremely popular among her peers at her school by both the boys and the girls, and Debbie talks to them a lot. To say that Debbie's life is perfect... well... we get into that yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how to start the story off?</span></div></div>",

The young girl looked around, eyes widening in confusion as she couldn't pinpoint where the ground was. In fact, there didn't seem to be a ground.

Dislikes having to wear swimsuits as her only clothes and what not. (If evil, perhaps she just doesn't go overboard with destruction, just conquering is enough.) Soya is the polar opposite of that, she loves being a giant and have lots of fun. She doesn't mind wearing the swimsuits, and loves her famous stats.

She was born in Tokyo, Japan, but sadly she never had much of a true life as she could have hoped, and it was all thanks to a very strange illness. You see, when she was very young, she was infected with a virus that not even the scientist across the world could find a cure. The virus was a horrible one, as it gave her a difficult time breathing, had much seizures, and many other effects. Her parents thought that it would be the end of her, but then the Japanese military came in, and was at the time experimenting with a serum that would make soldiers giant and even give them abilities that only people could ever dreamed about. They said that it could probably cure her, so they gave it a go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did, but at a terrible cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, she grew to immense height over the years, so she wouldn't be able to live in the city at all, and had to be set to an island. That was the start of her problems, then she was rendered unable to speak at all, making her quiet permanently, and making her roar and grunt a lot for her voices. It was also undo able, making her parents mad at the general for allowing this. In spite of it though, there was still hope for her, and they still loved her like their daughter, just as she does. Her other abilities lets her shoot lasers from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all of it, and the fact that she would end up being used as a giant monster weapon, Japan and the world all came together and strive to give her the best of a life that she could have. She was so grateful, and she ended up happily accepting it. They would end up making a growth Ray that would let her test out new foods to see if she would like them. They would play music for her so she would be always in a good mood, and at times she would interact with children and her parents. They still make her play like a monster from time to time, making tokusatsu like cities for her to destroy with her abilties and lasers. Btw her appearance is a two-piece dark blue swimsuit, Inspite of dark past, she is still having hope for the future that her voice can be found. She is a mostly quite person, since she cannot talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It still has the elements, new music so, tasting new foods, and quiet. Wanted to make this into the best story I could.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She is very responsible, and even with her size, she is very reserved on how people view her and such. If she is good, she helps in any way she can for her city. If evil, she won't alright destroy or the pleasures of enjoyment from mindless killing, but instead just rule with an iron fist and use it for her own needs. Neutral can go either way. Also, her body developed for her age quite early, so C-Cup breasts.<br>\r\nAppearance: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/509020\" target=\"_blank\">https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/509020</a> (only the name Chihiro and appearance I am using, also no shirt, just her bikini)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna use her?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>UPDATE: Classes have been updated, and some chapters have been rearranged. If a chapter is out of sync with its respective class, shoot me an e-mail.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreate your own child and make him taller and taller! But before your kid becomes massive, I'll need to know three things; his/her description, height as a giant, and his/her alignment (explained below). Here's a sample child below; follow the description format given:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jacob Jones<br>\r\nAge: 10 (Note: Age must be in between 5 and 12)<br>\r\nNormal Height: 4'6\"<br>\r\nNormal Weight: 62 lbs.<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nDescription: Hyperactive; loves to run. Clumsy with handling objects, and likes cars, trains, or anything that moves fast (relative to him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen adding a chapter with sample children, please include a \"More\" choice so that other authors can create theirs. Failure to comply may result in the removal of one of your children you created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Height</b>: I have divided giants into 5 groups for different heights your child can grow to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass A: 7-20 feet tall<br>\r\nChildren in this class are better known as Amazons. Perfect for children whose dreams come true by outgrowing their siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass B: 50-500 feet tall<br>\r\nThese kids can outgrow Godzilla. Taller than many buildings, and impervious to most bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass C: 2000 feet-5 miles tall<br>\r\nA kid this size can challenge many mountains. Unfortunately his/her footsteps cause earthquakes, and he/she can't see other humans well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass D: 10-50 miles tall<br>\r\nAt this height the child can travel around the world by foot in hours, or even minutes. He/she can also resist nuclear weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass E: 100+ miles tall<br>\r\nRelatively few match a kid this size in all of existence. Impervious to nearly anything, the giant is free to do whatever he/she likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen adding a chapter asking for the child's height, ask what class he/she is in, not a specific height. <b>Specific heights are left to the discretion of the author of the first chapter with storyline.</b> Also, that height is the child's final height, so slow growth spurts are accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alignment:</b> Be sure to add a chapter asking what alignment the child resides as a giant (Gentle, Evil, Neutral)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle: Normally tries not to do harm, and aids the people in any way he/she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil: Normally tries to do harm, and his/her goal is to cause as much destruction as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeutral: Uses his/her size only for personal goals. Can also be temporarily Gentle or Evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Last-Minute Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Write in any POV you like, as long as the focus is on the giant kid<br>\r\n-Other children in between 5 and 12 years of age can be giant, but the main kid must be dominantly taller. (At least twice as tall as everyone else except if he/she is less than 20 feet tall)<br>\r\n-No drug, alcohol, or sexual scenes<br>\r\n-No adult situations<br>\r\n-No gay, bi, or lesbian characters or situations<br>\r\n-No nudity. Everyone must have some form of clothes<br>\r\n-Don't make too many references to one's breasts<br>\r\n-No extreme swearing or vore. This is rated 13+<br>\r\n-No killing any main character. Anyone else is fine as long as it isn't gory<br>\r\n-No furries. Only human children can be massive<br>\r\n-No shrinking. This isn't the place for that<br>\r\n-Only I can end the story<br>\r\n-Don't have the characters be overly OOC. Read the description of the child before making a chapter<br>\r\n-250+ characters to every storyline chapter<br>\r\n-<b>I claim the right to edit or delete any chapter for any reason mentioned above or for poor quality.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are you waiting for? From the top of your head, think of a kid you'd like to see huge, and make that possible on paper!</td>",
