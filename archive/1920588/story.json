He looked at the old rusty sword resting on the shelf, it was a gift from his father a valiant warrior who died protecting his hometown. William looked at the sword again and tried to think how fun should be the adventuring life. But he was weak, so he didn\u00a1t want to get killed or something. The desire of coming out from that place was great but he was too afraid of going. After thinking over and over again, he decided to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he was ready, he was holding his sword in one hand and got a wooden stick in the other. He knew he wasnt equipped with the best weapons but at least he felt secure with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam began to walk to the Hill outside the city thinking where should he start his journey...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William decided to go to the Slimy  Woods, a forest well-known because of the tiny slime monsters who lived in it.<br>\r\nHoping not to find something dangerous, William went deeper and deeper in the forest... And he heard a scream!<br>\r\nFollowing the sounds William rushed through the trees , trying to find out who was screaming and why. He knew the forest was actually dangerous -not as the fields but it still was dangerous- . <br>\r\nQuickly tried to remember his old man`s tips about the Slimy Forest and the two most important tips popped in his head: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Stay away of Slimes the tend to go inside you, filling you so much that you actually might explode<br>\r\n2)Don't get close to the Syrup Vines, they trap you and  feed you until you burst<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind William reached a clear and in the middle of it, a rabbit girl about his age, being force-fed by a Syrup Vine. The girl was actually cute, she was a chubby blondie with a normal height and some beautiful almond eyes.But now her belly was getting bigger and bigger over the time and she was turning into a Syrup filled balloon. Her arms and legs where sinking in her rounding body and it seems she was... liking it? She was blushing and there was that little smile in her face... yeah, she WAS enjoying it.  And Will thought she was actually looking hot like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut William didn't know what to do... if he tries to save her he might get trapped by the vine and that was the end for his Adventure but in the other he could just watch, let the girl explode and steal whatever she was carrying...</span></div></div>",

Those second he spent deciding were a big lost and the girls body kept growing, it was almost spherical now. Her cheeks were really puffed and her swollen arms and legs were sinking in her growing belly. William heard a groan. The girl looked at him, she looked scared but she was enjoying it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox began to run , another groan was heard, and he jumped, trying to reach the girl\u00b4s head  and the tentacle like plant. Another groan, stretchmarks appeared in the girl\u00b4s overinflated belly. William pulled out the sword. The girls cheeks began to inflate a bit more, meaning there wasn't much more space in her body. William swinged the sword. The wine itself grew a bit, like a tied hose. And then in the last second... the rusty sword thrusted into the plant , cutting the wine and freeing the almost-bursting girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Whoa, nice move boy!- the girl said. -The name`s is Polly by the way.-<br>\r\n-Thanks!- William chuckled. -I'm William and  i'm having a little adventure. You\u00b4re  kinda lucky i was here-<br>\r\n-Getting cocky already? . Well for you to know I'm a Witch and I could save myself whenever I want- Polly said with pride<br>\r\n-Aren't you too young for being a Witch?. And well you were kinda liking it, right?-<br>\r\n-That's because the Syrup's properties!- Polly said in a blush- You got me, i'm a witch's apprentice but I do know the basics-<br>\r\n-Hey- William said changing the topic- Are you... fine? How do you feel? -<br>\r\n-Yeah, I'm fine. It's only a bit painful 'cause i overdid it but at least I'm still alive-<br>\r\n-Well, I can't leave alone being like this- Will poked Polly's overinflated belly causing it to jiggle some minutes<br>\r\n-Check my belt there is a blue potion there, it's effect will deflate instantly-<br>\r\nWilliam searched in the broken belt and he eventually found the potion, it was in Polly's back, near her blubbering butt.   William took it, and he looked at witchie's ass finding it one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen.<br>\r\nPolly drank the potion and   her body slowly deflated . William looked at the girl's original body for a second before a thick layer of fat appeared on Polly's belly, Slowly , she began to get fatter until she passed from her original skinny self to a very fat one.  Her belly was poking out a bit and her muffin tops were really sexy, Her flatty chest was pretty filled now and the normal sized booty was big and wide. William looked surprised by the change.<br>\r\n-It's the potion effect. It made me digest all the syrup i was inflated by. But this syrup is actually made of pure sugar so when i absorbed all that sugar i gained a lot of weight- Polly explained.-I know this isn't very magical but witchraft itself it's knowing how to manipule the materia and that stuff...- she began to divague with a explanation of magicks and \u201cscience\u201d while William began making a tent with Polly's stuff<br>\r\n-Hey fox, thanks for making the tent, the night is close, so, you wanna stay with me?- Polly offered</span></div></div>",

William gave her a thankfully look and the rabbit girl began casting some a spell. - I invoked some mag -ic servants, they will feed you well- Polly said winking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small spirit-like bunny appeared with a cake in his hands. The spirit quickly  divided the cake in portions a gave some to the adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Whoa! This is great! I've never eaten something so tasty! - William happily said taking anoter portion.  He didn't knew it but Polly had casted a spell over the ake making it something delicious but extremely fattening. She knew she didn't have to eat too muh of it but she eventually gave up and digged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPortion after portion, cake after cake, the servants brought more and more desserts until the fox finally stopped eating. His belly was huge after the stuffing and he didn't want to move because of the belly ache. He decided to sleep right there and the magic spirits began to massage his belly.<br>\r\nPolly recosted by his side, she was stuffed too and she knew her already plump body was going to get really chubby in the morning. She moved closer to Will and whispered a little spell. The tent became invisible and  the stars shined upon their heads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Do you like this night? It's really starred- Polly comented<br>\r\n-Yeah, its really beautiful. This is the first time I actually pay atention to them- He said<br>\r\n-You know, I'm kinda liking you- Polly confessed -In a friendly way- quickly added. Her cheeks became red<br>\r\n-Haha  you're nice too. So this means you're going to be my magic \u201cfriend\u201d?- William said. <br>\r\n-You really mean friends or \u201cfriends\u201d?- Polly asked. She was definitively blushing now<br>\r\n-Whatever you want.  I have just met you but I'm having this weird feeling about you- the fox said. His cheeks became a bit red after that.<br>\r\nPolly moved closer to him and hugged him. Will blushed and Polly jiggled. She moved closer and he felted the touch of her body in his back . Polly's warm belly was really soft and the contact of her cream coloured fur felt really nice. William turned around and looked and her. Their faces were really close and their bellies were touching each other. He hugged her and the she whispered.<br>\r\n-Thank you for saving me. I was reckless, I Knew that I wouldn't be able to defeat the wine but I attacked it . I really , really need to defeat that plant. The core of it, the Syrupy Bulb is one of the most rare magic items and I would do anything to get it. Please, please help me! -Polly moved her head putting her lips really close to William's. The fox blushed and a warm feeling was building inside of him. He wanted to help. He was actually attracted by the rabbit girl and he was doing whatever he could to help her. - I know you will help me- Polly whispered. And then she rested her head in William's chest. The fox felt asleep too, with his face all red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

William tried to do a somersault to stand up but he couldn't. His body felt awkwardly heavy , really heavy. The fox opened his eyes and found a new thick layer of fat on his body<br>\r\nWhooa! What's up with this!!! - the fox screamed with surprise. Polly woke up and raised her head a bit, not even trying to stand. - Sorry- she said quietly - The food we ate last night was magical and this was bound to happen- she continued. The fox turned around to saw her. There was no hint of the petite rabbit he knew last day. She had a huge and soft-looking double belly, and her rolls spilled at her sides. Her arms and legs where thick as trunks and although her butt was hidden behind her belly, William could only fantasize about how big has it gotten. But what he could definitely see was her chest. Polly's breast had really swollen a lot and where overflowing a bit from her bra -WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT!- the girl screamed - You pervert! Now , I'll make you pay for this!- she said while trying to stand up. <br>\r\nHey, don't overdo it cutie!- Will said while trying to help her stand<br>\r\nThanks- she said coldly - I'll still make you pay for that though- and then she went all over the fox, grabbing his rolls and belly. William started laughing and fought back with tickles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of fat playing the adventurers looked into each other and nodded. The time had come<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how do you have a plan to get the bulb? I mean other than just chugging the vine up until exploding...-Willi asked <br>\r\nIndeed, handsome. Take a look at this!- the rabbit said while pulling a fruit from her bag - It's a Stretchy Fruit. It's magical properties lets your body expand a lot further than you'd normally do, combining it with a amplifying spell I may empower it's magic and let the bodies expand even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool! So, who will do the dirty work? Do you want me to take it or you prefer to do it yourself? - the fox asked<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I was hoping you could do it...\" Polly said shyly.<br>\r\nWilliam simply stared at her for a bit. He was a bit conscious about his frame. Never wanting to be a \"hefty\" guy he always made sure to exercise and eat healthy. But looking down at his potbelly he was already having trouble imagining how big he would be. But something in Polly's eyes told him it was going to be all right. William didnt want to push any farther so he decided to just say yes.<br>\r\n\"Ill do it.\" William said.<br>\r\nWilliam stared at Polly as her face erupted with a bright wide grin spreading from one chubby cheek to another. She hugged William tightly and he could feel her soft plush belly up against his as her boobs pushed up to his chin. Polly backed up and then handed William the fruit. William looked at the fruit and couldnt help but notice that it looked much like a balloon. Eating the fruit, Polly started to chant out the words to the spell and casted it on William. After the spell was finished, William felt a lot lighter. <br>\r\n\"Ok, im ready to go!\" <br>\r\nWilliam and Polly started to move up the trail where they first met. The syrup vine had already regenerated its limbs and William felt a bit nervous.<br>\r\n\"Wait, how are you going to get the bulb?\" William asked. <br>\r\n\"Easy, you run in and cut as many vines as you can with your sword before they get a hold of you. Once they have a hold of you, ill sneak in from behind and cut out the bulb. Itll kill the plant and then I can use a deflation potion on you. Or I could roll you to my place.\" Responded Polly winking after the last line.<br>\r\nWilliam blushed thinking about how it would be like to have himself inflated with syrup and rolled home by Polly. <br>\r\n\"Ok, here we go.\"<br>\r\nWilliam ran up to the vines with a mighty battle cry. Raising his sword he managed to cut down about 3 vines before his foot got snagged by one of the vines. Lifting him up into the air, another grabbed his arms and another grabbed his other leg. Pulling his limbs so he looked like an X the final vine plugged itself into Williams mouth. William felt the thick sugary syrup start to pump into his mouth as he moaned a bit in pleasure. His belly started stretching to accommodate the new size and soon it looked like an overinflated beach ball. Soon the syrup started to fatten up his ass as it started to expand in his pants tearing his pants and pushing the seams to their limit. Williams moobs began to grow as more syrup was forced down his muzzle. Struggling to gulp it all down, His belly surged out from beneath his shirt as his pants exploded releasing his fat ass. His ass jiggled madly while more syrup was being pumped into him. His moobs started to get constrained by his shirt as his belly began to inflate bigger and bigger. The vines holding him started to slowly lower him as his weight started to become too much. His belly rested on the ground as his ass wobbled. His shirt finally exploded until the vine suddenly stopped pumping syrup into him. Spitting out the vine, William let out a burp now fully inflated from the vine. Polly walked over to him, bulb in hand, as she stared at William. Staring at him, she decided to....</span></div></div>",

I can deal with it again.\" Polly said. \"Beside, I'm still a little bigger than you are, so I can handle it better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly was right. After dealing with the syrup and the cake, she was defientily a bit fatter than William. Will was silent for a few seconds before saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy it, do you?\" Will said with a sly look.<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point.\" Polly said blushing. \"You're are a better fighter than me. So you should be able to handle the vines with your sword.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess your right.\" Will said agreeing.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, can you get your sword out, please?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n\"Uhh....sure.\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his sword and then Polly casted a spell on the sword. It went from rusty to looking shiny and brand new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOOOOOOAAAAAA!\" William shouted. \"My.....my sword!\"<br>\r\n\"You like? I noticed that you sword was pretty rusty.\" Polly said. \"You can't go off fighting monsters with that. Lucky for you, I knew an anti-rust spell and was able to restore your blade. Bet you're glad you met me, are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Big time. Thanks!\" William said happily.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now let's focus on the plan.\" Polly said.<br>\r\n\"Right. You handle the vines while I'll cut him down.\" Will said. \"Uhhhh....you said that you can use a magic spell to increase the effects of the Stretchy fruit, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Polly said. \"I also have a empty stomach so I'll be ready for the syrup vines. I even have another potion to help me digest all the syrup again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill then took all of those and added them all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...hold on. Your current size plus an empty stomach plus the Stretchy fruit and your magic plus the syrup you may take in plus the digesting potion equals.......\" Will though how big Polly could become after this. \"Jeez! How big are you planning to get?\"<br>\r\n\"What? Don't you like big girls?\" Polly said winking at William.<br>\r\n\"That's...none of your concern.\" Will said blushing. \"Let's just find a syrup vine and collect the bulb.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Polly said agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly then cast a spell on the Stretchy Fruit to increase it's effects. She then ate the fruit and felt it's magical effects inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

Once again, she was getting inflated by the syrup. But with three vines, her belly was inflating three times as fast. The Stretchy fruit and her magic spell helped her handle the syrup in her belly. But it wouldn't last with the rate it was going. Polly belly bloated up more and more. Even in her situation, she was kinda enjoying it again. William was noticing, but he still had to act fast. He got out his sword and started to take on the vines. He went to the main part of the vines and cut up one of the vines. His new reformed sword made it easier to cut them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. My sword works like a charm now.\" William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went for the second vine and cut it down. Two vines down, but Polly was still bloating up by the last vine. Her belly was really getting massive. Even with fruits effect, it was only a matter of time til it was about to reach it's limits. Will then cut down the last vine. Polly was free now. But now she had the belly bigger than a large beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, handsome.\"  Polly said.<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Will said. \"BUT LOOK AT YOUR STOMACH!!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh. Guess it has grown quite a bit from the vines.\" Polly stated.<br>\r\n\"Your stomach looks like it could hold three whole people.\" Will stated.<br>\r\n\"Well when it goes to my body, I'm gonna be pretty large.\" Polly said. \"Mind getting the potion?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm....sure.\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill went to the back of her belt and got another one of her potions. He also got a look at her big butt again. He then handed the potion to Polly. Polly then starts to drink it. Will already knew what would happen next. First her body deflated and she was skinny for a second, then she went to being really really fat. She was at least three times the size she was when she last used the potion. Everything was larger. Expectly the belly and her boobs. Will was actually like what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm far from skinny now.\" Polly said. \"Oh well. I'll just have to get use to the extra weight.\"<br>\r\n\"You still beautiful.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"Awwww. Sweet.\" Polly said blushing. \"Wait. The Syrupy bulb!\"<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Will's right hand, he was holding the syrupy bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got one. Thank you so much.\" Polly said before hugging Will. All that flab Polly gain made her hug feel soft and warm. Will was blushing mad. Then he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...Polly. Now that we got the bulb, can we get out of this forest?\" Will suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Sorry.\" Polly said stopping her hugging. \"Let's find our way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill couldn't agree more. So him and newly wider Polly headed out to try and find the exit and leave the forest.

The see a very large wolf in front of them. He had black fur with a white muzzle. White fur was also on his chest. The think about him was he was very fat. Even fatter than Will and Polly. He did had some muscular arms, but that was the only muscular part abot him. His face was fairly chubby and his cheeks were quite puffy with a triple chin. His gut was really wide, but most flabby with a few fold of fat. His butt was pretty big too. As wide as his gut. His legs were thicker than tree trucks. He only wore dark blue vest and dark green pants. He did had a belt that hold a few things like a sack of coins and a healing potion or two. Strapped to his back was a huge axe. He look liked he had to weight at least 900 lbs or so and he was in his mid 30's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...hello.\" Will said. \"This guy looks pretty strong. Not to mention he's bigger than Polly is.\" William thought.<br>\r\n\"What did you want to talk about?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm actually came here to this town to look for some help.\" The wolf said.<br>\r\n\"Some help?\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"My name is Tyson.\" The wolf said. \"I'm a bounty hunter.\"<br>\r\n\"Bounty hunter?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Tyson said. \"Ever heard about the Slimy Forest?\"<br>\r\n\"The two of us actually just came from there.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"They say that deep in ths forest, they is a witch that lives there.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"A witch you say?\" William said looking at Polly.<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me. I don't live there and I'm only an apprentice.\" Polly said.<br>\r\n\"The witch in the forest is pretty evil.\" Tyson said. \"She lures people in with sweets and stuffs them to the brim with cake and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looks at Polly again since he did stuff him with cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, it's not me.\" Polly said in a fit.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's not her.\" Tyson said. \"The witch not only stuff travelers to the brim, afterwords....she eats them whole herself.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!?!?\" William and Polly said shocked.<br>\r\n\"That's why I came here. I'm looking for a few people to help me take her out.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"Ummm...hate to say it, but I'm still not that tough yet.\" William said.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...looking at you, you don't have much of an stomach yet either.\" Tyson said. He then looked at Polly. \"You girlfriend here seems to be on the right path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the word \"girlfriend\" made both Will and Polly blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl...GIRLFRIEND?!?!?\" William and Polly shouted out with red cheeks.<br>\r\n\"What? You two aren't that far yet?\" Tyson asked.<br>\r\n\"How could we? We actually just met yesterday.\" William said.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Tyson said. \"Anyway, you don't have to decide anything yet. I'm gonna stay in town a bit longer. If you two decide anything, meet me at the training grounds tommorow morning at 10:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big wolf, Tyson then threw a sack of coins to Will. He catches the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Will asked.<br>\r\n\"A few coins to help you out.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looked in the sack and was pretty surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! There is like 200 coins here.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"Looking at you, you can uss them.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"But...I didn't even decided if I wanted to help or not.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"I know. Just consider it a bit of charity.\" Tyson said. \"I'm off. Remember to train not just your body, but your stomach too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson then said his goodbye to William and Polly and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Train not just your body, but your stomach too?\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"He's right. With slimes, syrup vines, fruit dryads, and other creatures out there, you need a large and strong stomach.\" Polly said. \"I think we should help him. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"He said to meet him at the training grounds tomorrow, so it can wait.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"Okay. So what do you want to do now?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gold coins Will got from Tyson, he had some mad money right now. He could stock up on supplies. Then again, he was getting pretty hungry. What to do?</span></div></div>",

At first, Tyson looked around 900 pounds. But now he was looking around 1500 pounds. His belly was bigger and close to touching the ground. He must have done a lot of eating since he came into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Tyson!\" Will shouted at him.<br>\r\n\"Well well. Will and Polly, right? Looks like you two came after all.\" Tyson said as he stopped swinging his ax. \"Oh. And it looks like you two took my advice.\" <br>\r\n\"Kinda.\" Will said. \"But look at you. Your stomach was not that large yesterday.\"<br>\r\n\"I did some eating.\" Tyson said. \"I went to a diner and had the \"Way too much food\" meal.\"<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" Will said shocked. \"That's like everything on the menu. Most people who eat all that end up in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not most people.\" Tyson stated. \"My stomach is quite strong. Like I told you, train you body and stomach as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Will said nodding.<br>\r\n\"So, you said you need our help to fight this evil witch from stuffing people and eating them?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes. The witch has been causing a lot of trouble for travelers.\" Tyson said. \"I want to bring that to an end. Oh and the reward money isn't too bad either. 9,000 gold.\"<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" William and Polly said surprised.<br>\r\n\"That's some pretty good amount of cash.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"I could buy soooooo much with that.\" Polly stated.<br>\r\n\"Help me out and I'll split the money with you.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"For that amount, I'm in.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Polly said.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Tyson said smiling. \"Now, the forest is treacherous with it's slime creatures, syrup vines and other creatures. Do you have everything you need? If so, we can go now. But if you need some more stuff, it can wait tell then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Will needed to decide. Did they have everything they needed or should they get a few more things with the little bit of cash they had left.</span></div></div>",

We each say a few things about each other here and now.\" Tyson suggested.<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll go first.\" Will said. \"Honestly... I never done any traveling before up until a few days ago. I lived in the village with my dad til he died protecting our village. The only weapon I have is a sword, which was pretty rusty. But thanks to Polly, it's far from rusty now. After recent events, I went from being skinny to having a lot more around the waist.\" Will said as he lifted his belly then dropped it as it plopped up and down. \"But I'm not complaining. I'm actually okay with the weight now.\"<br>\r\n\"Skinny is overrated anyway.\" Polly said. \"Now for me. As you already know, I'm an apprentice witch, but I know all the basic spells. I was trained with a few other students in the magic guild on the moutains. For a while, I just stayed at the guild and studied. Up until recently, I decided to go out and see the land for myself. I... was also curious about everything. You know... with food and junk. Guess it shows with all the weight I've been putting on.\" <br>\r\n\"Guess you weren't always on the heavy side either.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"Well what about you, Tyson?\" Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson finished off his turkey leg before he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, I wasn't always this massive wolf you see.\" Tyson said. \"About two months ago, I was mostly guess muscle. Like most of the people in my village. I didn't even plan to be a one ton wolf.\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't?\" William said looking surprised.<br>\r\n\"It happen when I started bounty hunting. After dealing with slime monsters, giant foods, heavy meals, meat monsters, and candy people.... the pounds just added on and on.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha! That figures.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"So you never tried to lose the weight?\" Polly asked.<br>\r\n\"I did at first, but after a while... being fat just made things easier.\" Tyson said. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Will asked.<br>\r\n\"Have you seen people lately? Hardly anyone is skinny anymore. Most of them are even fatter then we are.\" Tyson said. \"Also, being fat seems to be the best way to survive these days. Remember what I told you.\"<br>\r\n\"Train our bodies and our stomachs.\" Will answered.<br>\r\n\"Right. The stronger the stomach, the easier it will be to handle anything that comes your way. Also a lesser chance of popping.\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n\"Right. Cause I almost popped two times already.\" Polly admitted.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We're take your advice to heart.\" Will said.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Tyson said. \"Alright, it's late. Let's get some sleep so we can have plenty of energy to face the witch.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Will and Polly said while pumping their fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly put the fire out with a water spell and everyone went into the tent.

The witch launched cakes at William and the others, but Polly burn them to a crisp with a fire spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you.\" The witch said angrily.<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I hate ruining desserts.\" Polly said not really happy.<br>\r\n\"Cry about it later.\" Tyson said. \"Got a witch to defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson seem to have better control of his weight than Will and Polly. So moving wasn't much of a problem. He attack the witch with a strike from his ax, but the witch dodged it. She then stuffed Tyson's mouth with a piece of cake. Tyson was still fine. William then went in for an attack. He was able to get a few slashes in with his sword. But the witch was still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the way you want to play, huh?\" The witch asked. \"Very well. Once I'm done with you, I'll stuff you so much that you will be begging me to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch then conjured a large variety of sweets. From whole pies to high stacked cakes.

He went straight for the sweets, asking the baker to load up two whole cakes - round, double-layered and more than 18 inches across - as well as four fried chickens and a jug of wine. After this splurge, which cost him another 58 gold (still had 92, though!), he left the store, struggling to carry everything, until he found a quiet clearing in a back alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill started his feast by eating one of the fruits, immediately feeling his stomach gain a rubbery feeling that left him at first nauseous, then hungry. It was time to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge battle took nearly an hour, but with a few last gasps, Will managed to choke down the last piece of cake, having completed it, and two of the chickens, and half of the wine. His belly had grown massive during his eating binge, now hanging over his crossed legs a little bit, and he laid back, gasping with joy at the full sensation. Then with shock, as that situation grew critical. It seemed the fruit was wearing off, and the amount of food Will ate would burst his stomach if he ate it normally. He quickly grabbed the potion and chugged it down, then rubbed his aching gut before it suddenly began shrinking. It still held on to about three more inches of flab, but the rest of the food spread throughout his body, fattening his arms, legs, chest and even his neck - he knew he had a double-chin now. He'd probably gained close to 50 pounds just now, climbing up to 300 total.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a battle cry, he swings right to the other fox, only to hear a 'CLING' come from his weapon. Looking down, he saw his sword, which was stuck into a tree, the dryad missing from that spot. Turning around, he could see the fox gently swaying to the other side of him, not stopping her hymn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam clutched his tummy as he felt it gurgle and bubble, putting a hand over it, only to feel it push right back! The fox staggers back a little as he looks down in surprise at his swelling tummy, which was also starting to gain a blue tint as he looks at the dryad, \"You! Change me back!\" he commands, however the dryad did not respond with anything, staying in her hypnotic melody as William continues to bloat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pries his sword free, losing some precious time doing so, and gets ready to charge again. His valiant charge was soon turning into an awkward waddle as the juices inside of him slosh and multiply inside of him.

He continues to swing, at least trying to break her concentration before she opens her eyes and makes her tone more innocent. William felt himself freeze before swinging the creature, staring in her large eyes, before dropping his sword and falling forward onto his tummy, which continues to fill out like a water balloon...</span></div></div>",

The inflating continued inside of the fox, and he was lifted into the air by his gigantic, swollen gut. He looked around, but couldn't see the dryad anywhere. She had to be nearby, he knew, because his growth seemed to become faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His swollen limbs stuck out straight as they began diminishing into the large blue ball that peeked over the treetops. Will clenched his teeth. His skin was very tight, and had to give out eventually. His neck sunk into the ball, leaving the fox's final form a violet sphere with four divots along it and a tiny fox head on top. Trees were crushed under his mass, stabbing him with sharp, wooden sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Pain covered his entire body, and it slightly worsened when he felt a sudden pair of paws walking along his backside. The dryad, he assumed, then flopped across his flesh, adding more pressure to William. He could tell his head began to become absorbed when his ears were forced down, and a blue rim filled his vision. Tears streamed down his cheeks as the last of his sight was abruptly removed by the fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He met his demise when a quick, cold, steel blade stabbed his back. He exploded outwards, covering the forest in a tidal wave of blueberry juice. The dryad was nowhere to be seen as it all happened, and neither could William's belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The fox gasped and sat up, being greeted by the peaceful sight of the closest church. He exhaled, wiping sweat from his brow. He forgot that he would just respawn here after death. He looked over his naked body, knowing that he just lost his entire inventory, clothes and all. Laying back down, William groaned in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He went searching for his supplies again in the Forest, but couldn't find the dryad anywhere. Days went by, and the fox eventually gave up. His first fight was a failure, leaving him bare and unable to continue. If only you, the reader, could of chosen him a better fate, then maybe this wouldn't of happened. Good thing there's a thing called the back button!</span></div></div>",

Several feet away from him, searching through the exploded adventurer's satchel, was a fur. It was a hugely obese deer. The fur stood around six feet tall but easily weighed five hundred pounds. His white, furry belly stuck out far and hung down to his thunder thighs. Two pillowly pecs rested on the top of his gut and sagged down due to gravity. The deer's thighs were easily as big around as William's waist, yet the deer's calves were heavily muscled due, most likely, to having to carry around all that weight. The fur's behind was roughly the size of two basketballs, and in conjunction with his back rolls, the deer's fluffy tail was almost surrounded in adipose. It was at this moment that William realized the deer was nude, though the other fur's apron of a gut meant that he didn't need anything to cover up his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam saw the bloated deer pick through the pack and giggle to himself as he examined each item he found. The deer closed up the bag and started to waddle away with the loot that was so rightfully your's.</span></div></div>",

The runt of a fox is back up!\" the deer said. \"If you want this stuff, come get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam grabbed his sword off the ground and charged towards the wide deer. When he was feet away from the fur, the chunky deer tossed the satchel right at William's face. Caught off guard, the fox dropped his sword to catch the bag. He looked down in bewilderment at the sack only to look back up and see the deer charging at him. Before he could respond, the deer had used his massive weight to send William flying back several feet, knocking him senseless once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen William awoke, the fat deer was lying on top of him covering the slender fox's body entirely in flab. William struggled to get loose, but the useless flailing of his arms and legs only sent ripples through the deer's chubby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I won this round, foxy.\" the deer said smuggly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...off...me!\" William struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Not until you've had your surprise!\" The deer pulled from the satchel a glass vial. In it was a bright yellow fluid. \"This was the only thing in that girl's bag that I didn't know what it was. And, well, since I have you here...\" He pulled the cork from the vial. William clamped down this muzzle, but the deer held a thick paw over the deer's nose. A few moments later, William was forced to open his maw for air.

When the deer was a considerable distance away, our adventurer hopped back to his feet and followed the fatter fur making sure to keep far enough away from the deer so that if he were to make any noise he would be noticed yet close enough to track him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox followed the deer for a couple of hours. There were a few dicey moments where William was sure that he would be spotted, but the deer never turned around to look to see if anything was following him. Rather, the immense deer kept marching deeper and deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer entered clearing in the forest and, when he suddenly stopped, William dived into a shrub a hundred feet behind him. The fox spied on the deer, trying to see what had startled him. He watched as the chubby, white deer stood still for a few moments and then saw something out of William's range of sight. The deer bent down as well as his rotund belly would let him and he picked up a stone from the ground, reeled back his arm, and chucked the rock into the treeline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a lone Syrup Vine came charging towards the deer, who remained unmoved until the creature was inches away. With lightening speed, the deer grabbed the Vine by it's main stalk and twist and bent it's body in half. In a loud crunch, the Syrup Vine was defeated, brown thick liquid poured from where the deer snapped it in half. The deer then stuck the cracked body into his mouth and started sucking the juice from the Vine. A second Vine appeared from the bushed on the deer's right, charging towards him also. In another lightening quick attack, the deer broke its body in half as syrup dripped from its wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" The deer held out the second Syrup Vine in his hand. William dug himself in deeper into his shrub. Who was the deer talking to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer looked over his shoulder right in the direction where William was hiding. \"I said, are you hungry?\" he asked again. William didn't move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer turned around and starting waddling towards where William was hiding. Drops of syrup had fallen onto his hefty chest. \"Okay, you can stop hiding now. I can see you. You're an orange fox in a green bush. You don't exactly blend it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam pulled himself from the shrub, brushing a few leaves of his clothing. \"Did you know I was following you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You're not the most stealthy fox around.\" He held out his hand with the second broken Syrup Vine out to William. \"Go ahead, take it. They're delicious.\" William grabbed the defeated creature from the deer and stuck the broken part of its main vine into his mouth and started sucking. The taste of the Vine's syrup was divine. The fox closed his eyes, and just focused on sucking and tasting the heavenly liquid. Sweet, surgery fluid flowed down the fox's throat into in awaiting belly, putting him into a state of ecstasy that was only interrupted when the Vine had dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, that was great...\" said William, opening his eyes slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but don't move a muscle.\" the deer said. He was clearly looking at something over the fox's shoulder. William heard that particular rustling of leaves and root. Another Syrup Vine. He felt a vine grab his leg, and another grab his arm. The mass of vines and leaves pulled itself onto William's shoulder. A lone vine reached across William's face sticking it's tip into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother lightening quick move from the deer. William hardly saw him swiftly reach to the fox's shoulder and snap the Vine in half, killing it like that last two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, these things aren't too hard to kill if you know what you're doing. And if they're alone. If they're in a pack, you're screwed.\" Once again, he offered the Vine to you. \"You seem to really like these things! Go ahead and have it. I already had six of those for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam snatched the Vine out of the deer's plump fingers and sucked its syrup out. \"Thanks! You had six of these today? Do you live nearby here or something?\" the fox said between drinking out the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I live here. All over here.\" the deer broadly waved his bulky arm gesturing towards the entire woods. \"I just live out here in forest. Most furs live in the city, but I can't stand that life anymore. Wake up, eat, work, eat, sleep, repeat. I just so sick of it. So one day, I left my day, wandered into these woods, and I've been living here ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you like it?\" said William, his fox tail wagging happily thanks to the Syrup Vine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The years I've lived in these woods have been some of the best years of my life! I wake up when I want, eat what I want, go where I want to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And eat a dozen of these delicious vines everyday?\" William asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer laughed causing his flabby body to wobble. \"Well, I try not to eat that many a day. Those things are pretty fatty.\" William froze for a second, he had nearly finished the second vine. \"Oh, calm down. It's not like you'll look like me tomorrow. But if you go crazy with them, you will. I wasn't always this big, but for my first few weeks out here, I only eat those vines and, well...\" He placed a paw on his paunch. \"I guess this was bound to happen. Nearly all the wild food out here is very caloric. Not like I care. It's not like I'm trying to stay being a skinny deer or fit into tiny clothing anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or any clothing for that matter...\" William's eyes wandered towards the deer's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed again. \"Why bother? Everything down there is covered up by my belly. And nobody has complained about seeing my bubble butt. You hardly said anything and you were watching it for nearly two hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox blushed. He just finished the second vine. \"So, do you think you can show me cool tricks about how to survive out here? I'm trying to become an adventurer and learning how to survive out in the wilderness is something that would be really helpful to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer thought for a moment. \"Look, you're clearly a city fox. And the things I know can't be learned overnight. The only reason I know what I know is because my father was a survivalist and taught me what I know. So, yeah, I can teach you, but you'd have to live out here with me for a while. I don't mind the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun rose in the east, rising about the local treeline, rays of light soaked William's face and he was gently woken up. He had only been in the wilderness for a month and he loved waking up this way. It was far more peaceful and quite than being awoken by a loud, annoying cuckoo clock. The fox sat up in his hammock and stretched out his arms, swung his legs out, and got himself out of his makeshift bed. One of the first lessons Derrick had taught William was how to construct a hammock out of the tall grasses and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange fox continued to stretch his body out. Derrick had told him about this. If he started the day with stretches, he'll be limber all day long. He shook his arms loose, did some torso twists, warmed up his knees, and tried doing toe touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was becoming a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick wasn't lying about how fattening the local flora and fauna was. Syrup Vines aside, even things like berries and leaves were extremely caloric. But it was either fatty food or no food out here. As a result, William estimated that he had put on easily 75 pounds in the first month out in the wilderness. Most of the calories went to his belly, where it stuck out a foot and was soft and plush like a sack full of bread dough. It hung ever so slightly over itself and was starting to be effected by gravity. The rest of his body thickened up only slightly. His rump had also taken up a considerable amount of the new weight. William was more aware of its roundness and how much it now jiggled. Although this was mostly known to him from Derrick's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox looked back to his hammock and saw the leather article handing off of one of the ropes. It was a makeshift loincloth. Derrick didn't need one thanks to how low his gut hanged. But that wasn't the case for William. \"And it won't be,\" he had thought to himself. \"Once I'm out of there, all this weight will melt right off.\" Nevertheless, he didn't want to strut around in the nude, so he made something to cover this naughty areas. William wasn't self-conscious about about his rump though. If Derrick didn't mind the fox seeing his gigantic rump, then William didn't feel the need to cover his behind. And William didn't mind seeing that deer-butt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter donning the loincloth, William wandered over to a nearby fruit bush that Derrick had taught his bore nutritious, non-poisonous berries. Perhaps, berries is not the right word, being that each was the size of an apple but had the texture and color of a grape. \"A few of these will make a pretty good breakfast.\" Derrick had told him. William grabbed three and started to gobble them down. Just as he finished the last one, he heard the rustling of leaves behind him and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrup Vines. Two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't spotted William yet, so he was able to get a sneak attack in on them. He had snapped one of them in half before the other noticed. The second Vine started to wrap itself about the fox's right arm, but he was able to reach just the right spot on the vine (\"Always right below the major leaf formations,\" Derrick taught him) and snapped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with himself, William rolled onto his back and started sucking on both of the vines at the same time. Despite having easily drank the cores of a hundred Vines by now, each sip was just like the first, transporting him back to a state of pure ecstasy. He shut his eyes tight and let the syrup fill his belly with bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he sucked the vines dry, his belly felt close to bursting. That didn't bother William; it was worth it. His eyes opened and standing about him was Derrick in all his obese deer glory. These shared a moment awkward silence, but then they both begun to laugh out loud. The deer reached out a thick paw and helped up William to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two at a time, now?\" asked Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just bulking up for winter!\" joked William, giving his taunt belly a slow rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I used that excuse too,\" said Derrick. \"Four winters ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it just shows that I'm better at catching Syrup Vines that you!\" William stuck his tongue out at Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it. I could you into a full Syrup Vine nest and see how you'll do.\" joked Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syrup Vine...nests?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought I told you this. There are several major nests in the world that all Syrup Vines come from. You see, for a new Syrup Vine to form, it must first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, William just tuned out. \"There are NESTS of these things?\" he thought to himself. \"How many of them are there at any given nest? Dozens? Hundreds? ...thousands?\" He started fantasizing about being thrown into one. The poor, orange fox being swarmed by thousands of those creatures, each shoving a vine into his mouth, depositing their sickly sweet syrup into his mouth. \"They'd overwhelm me,\" William thought, \"I'll be surrounded by those things and all I could do in drink in that wonderful syrup of theirs...\" He thought about hundreds of Vines draining themselves into him. A few dozen of them alone would turn him into a completely spherical fox, limbs all swallowed up with fat. All the rest would just grow him even bigger, turning him into a massive, orange furry globe. A fox as big as a home, and just getting larger, stuffed full of more syrup, until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excited much?\" asked Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam snapped out of his trance. \"Huh? What do you mean?\" Derrick's eyes shot down briefly to the fox's loincloth, which now resembled a tent. William blushed a deep red and tried pulling down the small patch of leather covering his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick laughed at this. \"Oh, relax. We're both guys.\" The deer said. \"It's better to take care of that in the morning. You don't want to feel all worked up down there when you're being chased by a patch of direwolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam wanted to desperately change the subject. \"So, what's there to learn today?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

But it's probably useful to point out which of the few are. Also, I'll show you some of the other kinds of vegetation in the area. Some of them have rather...interesting properties. So, grab your things and we'll head out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam returned to his \"camp\". It's only a camp in name only since the fox hardly had any possessions these days. Derrick lives with hardly anything and he thrives out in the forest, and that was the experience William wanted. Apart from his hammock, there wasn't much aside from a small leather satchel he made out of his old clothes, the same clothes he crafted his loincloth from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox rejoined the deer, and the two starting hiking north along a dirt path that followed a nearby river. It took two hours of walking before getting to the part of the woods that Derrick said was crammed full of berry bushes. William was impressed with the deer's stamina. The fur was probably a quarter ton of fat, though he never specifically asked. He doubted that Derrick either knew or cared about the specific amount of pounds he was hauling. Yet he was able to hike the entire way without a single rest. William, on the other hand, had a harder time with the trip. Being a city fox, he was not used to the exercise. In conjunction with the pudgy gut he was now sporting, he found most physical activity more difficult than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo spent several hours in the berry-rich sector of the woods. There, Derrick taught William about all sorts of berries. There were the black ones with red speckles. \"Don't eat those. Very poisonous.\" There were the red ones with black speckles. \"Not poisonous, but you won't have fun for the next few hours after eating them.\" One bush bore round, bright green fruit. \"Tasty, but not as good as the ones back home.\" And so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough William was pleased with all of the knowledge about berries he acquired during the hike, he was getting exhausted and didn't even want to think about the two hour hike back. \"Hey Derrick, when can we rest? I really need a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" said Derrick, \"There's just one more bush to show you, then we'll rest.\" The fox followed the deer until they came across a short shrub with several dozen grape-sized berries on it. What immediately struck William was the marbled white and grey coloring on the berry. He had never seen a fruit like that in nature which such a beautiful color combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick plucked a single berry off of a branch with his pudgy fingers and tossed it to William. The fox popped it into his mouth and chomped down hard on it. Suddenly, William felt surge of water pressure in his mouth and he was force to open his muzzle as what looked to be about a gallon of clear, sweet-smelling fluid ran down his mouth, chest, and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer was doubled over in laughter. \"What the hell was that?\" yelled William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I just had to. You know how plants store energy in their berries. See, this one is super effective at doing so, and it's able to cram way more juice into a single berry than most plants. And with more juice, there are more nutriants. That's why I wanted to bring you here for our break. Just eating one of these babies will perk you right back up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said William, \"but how am I supposed to eat it if it explodes when I chew it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the same thing happened to me the first time I ate one. But it's a simple solution. All you need to do is swallow one whole like a pill.\" The deer plucked another fruit off a branch, popped it into his mouth, and swallowed. \"Delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam grabbed a berry for himself and tossed it into his awaiting mouth. The moment the berry arrived at his stomach, William felt a huge surge of pressure in his belly as if someone had shoved a water hose down his throat and turned it on full blast until the fox was full. He had seen his belly immediately swell up several inches, his gut sagging a bit more under the weight of the contents of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What happened?\" asked William, rubbing his bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the berry juice! It's surprising at first, but that's just the juice bursting out of the berry. But how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from bloated as hell, I feel surprising rejuvenated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer smiled. \"That's thanks to the juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how come you didn't swell up like I did when I ate one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. You just can't notice it until all this bulk.\" Derrick ran a paw along the curve of his massive, cream-colored belly. \"And now you're recharge, let head back.\" Derrick waddled past the fox back into the direction from where they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why aren't we taking a bunch of these?\" William posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't take many more. That shrub is very delicate: If you take too many, the poor thing will die. And it's a rare plant, so it dying is the last thing I want to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay,\" William replied. \"Hey, I'll catch up with you in a minute. I suddenly have to go to the bathroom because, well...\" William gave his enlarged guy a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer chuckled. \"Oh yeah, alright. I'll wait for you down the road.\" The rotund fur waddled down the road until he was out of sight. William turned to the bush, eyeing the amazing fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take a few,\" he thought. \"A few shouldn't hurt...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When his portly deer companion was out of sight, William grabbed a dozen berries off the bush. There were still plenty left over, so that shouldn't do any harm to the plant itself, right? The fox shoved them into his leather pouch and ran ahead to catch up with Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way back to their respective camps several hours later. It was already dusk when they arrived, so Derrick wished William off and headed back to his camp. William returned to his camp. When he got there, he collapsed onto his hammock. Although these berry were especially good with providing nutrients to the eater, it didn't help with the feeling of exhaustion that the fox felt after having hiked for several hours. He hoped onto his hammock and took off his leather satchel and loincloth, hanging them off of one of the hammock's support lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox closed his eyes and tried going to sleep. But as he tried to sleep, a rumbling came from his stomach. Because of his late return from the hike, William had forgotten to eat anything for dinner. He reached for his leather satchel and clawed through it for some edible berries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had pulled out two of the grey-white berries that he pocketed earlier in the day. \"Well, I don't want to eat a full meal right now, so these should do.\" He popped two berries into his mouth and swallowed them whole. Seconds later, his gut suddenly swollen up. This time, having eaten two berries, William's gut was easily a few feet in diameter. His skin groaned due to the pressure. William was shocked with how massive his gut suddenly gotten. His paws reached down and, after several minutes of careful massaging, the pain of his overstuffed belly started to fade, and William was able to relax into sleep with a full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he heard a rip. The hammock had split open under the weight of the fox, and William came crashing down to the ground. William tired getting up, but his massive gut prevented him from doing so. So the fox dragged himself to a nearby tree where he leaned up against it, his gut spreading his legs around. Yet again, he rubbed his swollen gut until he finally feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several days later and William had a new habit before bed. Each night, he would pop one or two of the special berries into his mouth and allow himself to be inflated with its berry juice. Then, he'd find a tree to lean against and sleep while his rubbed his swollen belly. His hammock no longer supported his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick had said that the fruit of the special bush was very nutritious, and William found that out firsthand. Thanks to his new habits, his weight swiftly increased. In the matter of a few weeks, the fox easily put on another fifty pounds which filled out his orange-colored belly as well as his buttocks. William was largely unaware of his weight gain aside from the new tightness of his loincloth around his waist. The thin leather strap of it reaching around his waist was starting to be covered with over-following flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, William awoke with Derrick, the obese deer, was standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that bush we visited last week? The one with those special berries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The grey and white ones? Yeah, what about it?\" asked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was around that area yesterday and noticed that the bush had a lot less berries than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did it?\" asked William, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, the wildlife could have started eating it, but that's usual. Did you take any berries from it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" lied William, \"I didn't! I don't want that plant to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll believe you. But I just want to ask because those berries have a nasty side effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? I ate one of those berries and you're now telling me that there are side effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The side effects don't take effect if you eat only one or two.\" Derrick said. \"It's when you eat a lot more of them that problems start to happen. Because if you eat too many...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll probably only be able to show you the ones that are best for healing cuts and wounds, but I can show you some of the other special herbs around here another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo spend the day hiking around the wilderness. Derrick pointed out flowering herbs and their properties. The white herb with light green leaves could be used to clean any cuts, William learned. The obese deer took a handful in his paw and tore open the leaves with his plump fingers. A clear, thick liquid poured out of them. It smelled like medicine. William found out that the bright pink leaves he frequently saw in the woods could be sucked on to help relieve indigestion. Munching on a few of them will aide any kind of stomach ache. And the light purple leaves, Derrick said, could be used to help with a headache. Rip open a few leaves, dab some of the fluid onto your muzzle, and the smell will sooth you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was starting to set off in the eat. \"We should head back soon.\" said Derrick. \"I'm not too familiar with these parts of the woods, so I don't want to be stuck out here at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed back to their familiar parts of the woods. It was only a few minutes into their hike back when William's legs began to burn and ache. He had been walking for hours all day and the fox was almost too exhausted to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Derrick,\" William said in between pants. \"Can we rest for a bit? I'm really tired from all the hiking we've done today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we can rest for a bit. But if we wait too long, then we'll be stuck out here and have to camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need a break.\" William started rubbing his bare thighs. \"My legs are on fire and I don't think I can take another step...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. But no more than fifteen minutes, okay?\" William slowly plodding over to a nearby fallen log and sat himself on the ground, his back leaning against it and his hefty gut now resting on his lap. The fox's legs immediately felt better and he sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese deer joined William by the log. Derrick slowly lower his massive bulk down to the ground, and when his rump finally landed on the ground, William swore that the ground shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do it?\" asked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the deer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like, what? Two or three times bigger than I am?\" The fox eyed the deer's gigantic gut which occupied nearly all of his lap reaching to his knees. Two pillow-sized moobs rested on top of the doughy mound. Derrick looked down at his gut and playfully gave it a slap sending a jiggle throughout. \"You're huge. But you have no problems getting around. But back in the cities, I've seen furs as big as you who can't go a few feet without breaking a sweat. What gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is all flab?\" the deer smirked. He flexed his bicep and held it up for William. \"Here, feel this.\" The fox pressed a paw into the deer's arm. It sunk down slightly, but William could feel rock hard muscle under it. \"I used to be a trim, muscular deer before I got out here. Solid muscle and not an ounce of fat on me. That was thanks to the job I had in the shipyards lifting cargo. But when I go out here, I cut loose. I ate what I want, whenever I wanted. Heck, I think I spent a solid week sucking on Syrup Vines. I seriously ballooned up. Less than a year of being out in the wilderness and all the fatty flora and fauna got me to the size I am today. One day, I realized that I needed to slow down. If I kept my eating up, half of the forest would be completely bare and I'd be two ton of deer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As opposed to the one ton of deer you are now?\" joked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick laughed. \"I don't think I'm one ton. I'm big and I know it. But I don't care how many pounds I am. There's nobody out here to call me out of being a fatass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for me, fatass.\" said William. This earned a quick jab in the belly from Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you looked in the mirror lately, big guy? I've noticed How much you've been swelling up, and I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I know it's freeing to be out here and eating whatever you want. But if you keep it up, you'll be a tubby fox too big to move, and I don't think I'll be able to help you then. And consider how easily you got fatigued today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll cut down, I promise.\" said William. \"Look, I know that you said it's dangerous to camp out here, but I'm still exhausted. I don't think I'll be able to make it back. Could we please camp out here?\"</span></div></div>",

I don't want to, but I also don't want to have to drag you back. You rest here. We'll need a fire in order to keep any creatures around away from us tonight. I'll grab some firewood and maybe something to eat also.\" The deer rolled himself into his large belly and pushed himself up, brushing dirt and grass off of his belly and rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Derrick.\" said William, still too tired to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" replied Derrick. The obese deer trudged off into the treeline as William was overcome by sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, William awoke. Dusk was already approaching and Derrick had built a fire near where the fox was resting. He was sitting next to the flames, eating from a giant mound of berries that lay beside him. The fox dragged himself over to the fire to join Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well?\" asked Derrick. He popped another handful of berries into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm still exhausted, but now I don't feel like I'm about to pass out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" muttered Derrick with a mouthful of the fruit in his mouth. \"I got you something to eat.\" He reached forward and grabbed a stick from the fire. On the end of it was a roasting gourd-like vegetable. It was as big as a pumpkin and it was bright red. Derrick pointed it towards William. \"Take it. It's only been cooking for a few minutes, so it shouldn't be that hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox pulled the vegetable off the stick. Derrick was right; it was warm but not too hot to handle. William took a hearty bite into it. It tastes exactly like a freshly baked cheery pie. \"Wow, this is amazing!\" said William, his muzzle covered in red juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you'd like it.\" said Derrick, smirking. The two ate in silence. William devoured the vegetable while Derrick demolished the pile of berries he gathered. Soon enough, William has consumed the entire thing. His gut was taunt, but he wasn't uncomfortably stuffed. Lazily rubbing a paw on his gut, he wiped away the red juice from his mouth, licking off his fingers. When Derrick swallowed the last of what had to be of the hundreds of berries, he let out a low, rumbling blech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, maybe dessert was a bad idea...\" moaned Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert? That was dessert for you? When did you have dinner?\" asked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were still napping. I got two of those things, one for me and one for you. I finished mine just before you woke up. But now I'm wishing I stopped there...\" The deer gently rubbed his visibly swollen gut with paws and he laid down on his back, the mass of cream colored fur making up his overstuffed gut sticking out several feet all around him. William could see that the deer's belly was far to large for him to rub the entire globe that was his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help...\" William scooted over to Derrick and sat himself down on the deer's plump thighs, Derrick's ballooned belly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing...\" moaned Derrick. But the moans of pain turned into moans of pleasure as his fox companion began rubbing his belly for him. The fox's paws made slow, gentle circles all over the deer's expanded gut, then long and deep caresses along the deer's flanks. William leaned forward to make sure he was also soothing the top of the deer's belly, the fox's own doughy belly pressing into Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick quietly accepted the gut rub from William, letting out a series of burps each time the fox pressed deeply into his stomach. The deer particularly enjoyed the sensation of the fox's guy pressed against his, and he moaned to himself when he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity for Derrick, William said \"That's for letting us stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" the deer said, a silly smile was on his face. \"Remind me to do what you say more often if it means I get more belly rubs.\" The deer yawned, closed his eyes, and in a moment was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam got off of the lap of his companion, rest his head against the deer's gut, and drifted off to sleep to the sounds of Derrick's meal digesting </span></div></div>",

This got the attention of the syrup vines and they rushed over to where the noise came from. William quickly got to his feet and ran. Although the vines were fairly quick, he was just a bit faster and managed to get a good distance from them. But he knew that he couldn't just keep running from the vines and needed to hide. He quickly surveyed his surroundings. To his left was a large boulder, easily big enough for him to hide behind. To his right was a pathway leading to a cave inside of a hill.

After a few moments, he heard the rustling of the vines skitter past. None of them got close to the boulder, and William heard them march off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting a few minutes to make sure he was safe, William got up and dusted himself off. He noted his luck finding such a large rock to shelter him. Or was it a rock? Now that he wasn't being pursued by creatures wanted to pump him full of sweet sap, William had a moment to look at this thing. It wasn't grey like most rocks but dark brown, almost like chocolate. And it's surface wasn't rough but rather covered in fur. He gently placed in hand on the mound and was shocked to discover that his hand was able to sink into the softness. He gave it a quick jab and the whole mound wobble uncontrollably for a few moments. Just then, William heard a loud muffled sound coming from the opposite side of the mound. Cautiously, he walked around the spheroid and, when he saw what was making that noise, he knew it wasn't a boulder after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to the soft, furry mound was the head of a dog. But the poor thing's cheeks were so puffed up that it couldn't move its muzzle to speak but rather could only make muffled grunts and whimpers. The dog's neck was a thick ring of fat making it impossible for him to move his head around. William surmised that this guy somehow got so massively big that his girth swallowed up his limps and reduced him to a massive, immobile pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog made eye-contact with William and gave off a soft whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" asked William. Another whimper. \"Okay, I'll try to help you out. Is there anything you think I can do to help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog's eyes shot off into the distance. William turned around and saw lying on the ground a dozen feet away was a large jeweled belt. He walked over the picked it up off the ground. The belt itself was at least three inches thick and made of black leather. It was encrusted with numerous jewels and gems along the strap itself. The buckle was a round, gold plate with even more gems on it in many intricate patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back over to the massive mutt. \"Is this what made you so huge?\" asked William. The hound whimpered again in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam knew he wasn't going to get a clear answer from this guy about how to help with the present situation. So what does William do with the belt?</span></div></div>",

After several strong strikes, the plate on the buckle shattered. And when it did, the rest of the belt dissolved into a cloud of fine particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the belt was destroyed, William turned around to see the body of the rotund hound begin to deflate rapidly and, after a few minutes, he could see the dog's limbs reemerge from the retreating mound of fat. Eventually, he had deflated enough to pick himself off of the ground and he brushed his coat of fur off as the last of the magic wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I am so glad to be moving around again!\" said the dog as he stretched out his arms and legs. In his now-deflated and no longer immobile form, William saw that he stood well over a foot taller than himself and was quite a handsome hound. What was most shocking to William was the dog's body. Rather than being a giant mound of soft pudge, the hound was very muscular with large, defined biceps and pecs, bulky thighs, and a plump yet firm rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam was shocked by this transformation. \"So, are you fine now?\" is all that he could bring himself to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Back to normal! And thanks to you!\" The hound walked over to William and embraced him in a tight hug. \"I had been stuck like that for the past several days. I tired to get some other strangers to help, but all they did was take my things and leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...no problem.\" gasped William since the hound was squeezing his body in his strong arms. \"Can you please...let me down now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opps! Sorry!\" He let William down and stuck out his paw. \"I'm Tucker, by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam shook his paw. \"And I'm William. So did that belt thing turn you into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant fat ass of a dog? Yeah.\" replied Tucker. \"I guess it serves me right. I found that belt and knew that it had some magical properties. I should have been more careful when trying it out rather than just using it out in the middle of the woods where nobody was around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, don't beat yourself too much over it,\" said William. \"But now that you're better, I ought to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" said Tucker. \"You really helped me out there.

But the dog was insistent on giving him a reward, so there was no point in further arguments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next four hours, Tucker lead William through the woods. During the trip, Tucker recanted William with stories of his many past adventures. And during the trip, William was able to sneak a few quick glances at Tucker's plump rump as it wobbled at they walked. Tucker caught him staring a few times but didn't say anything out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening approached on the land, and the duo reached a log cabin. \"Ah, home sweet home!\" said Tucker. He walked up to the door of the cabin and lifted up a rock on the ground beside it. Under the rock was a brass key that Tucker placed in the keyhole and unlocked the door. Tucker rushed into the building and lit a few lanterns. William saw that the cabin's interior was a large room, with a massive bed at the far end and a night stand. On the walls flanking the bed were shelves filled with an assortment of trinkets and books. In the area of the cabin closest to the door was a kitchenette with a cooking pot and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Tucker. \"William, come over here.\" He gestured to one of the shelves and William approached it. \"As a reward for saving me, I'll let you have any item on this shelf here. Anything you want! Go ahead! Pick one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam examined the shelves. There was many random odds and ends on it. They all looked quite exquisite and rare. Any of them would easily fetch a fair price in the markets. He had his eye on a particular item, a golden egg with hundreds of tiny gems embedded in it. He was about to reach for it when he felt a strong strike on his neck, and the fox blacked out as he landed on the floor with thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur aspiring adventure woke up several hours later on a bed in a dark room. The first thing that William noticed was a heavy metal cuff attached to his left leg. The cuff was connected to a rusty chain that to a metal loop embedded in the stone wall. All of the walls in this room were stone, William noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox slowly got off the bed, cradling his pained neck with his left hand. The room was largely empty. Only stone, chains, a bed, and stone staircase leading to a wooden door on the opposite side of the room. It was too far away from William to reach while attached to the chain. \"Tucker!\" cried William. \"Tucker, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the wooden door to William's cell swung open and Tucker sauntered in. \"Oh hey, you're awake!\" said Tucker. \"I hope I didn't hit you too hard there. I just wanted you out for a few minutes while I brought you down to your new quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, you jerk?\" asked William. \"Just give me my reward and let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucker chuckled to himself. \"Oh, there was never any reward. I just used that as an excuse to bring you here. Well, there is a reward if you consider being my experiment a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiment? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an adventurer too, William. And from my adventures, I've acquired many treasures. But a lot of them have magical properties, and these magical properties are only known when they are applied to an individual. So I don't really know the true power of what I find until I try it one someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that belt?\" asked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucker smirked. \"Just like that belt. I got impatient and tried it on myself. It was only a stroke of luck that you came along to help. Imagine, though, if I had someone to try it on for me first. Imagine if I had a fox like you to try it on. I'd know the powers of that belt without you smashing it up. Sure, I would have a massive fox to deal with, but I'd find some other uses for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to use me like a lab rat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lab FOX.\" Tucker replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a lab fox!\" yelled William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Because I could just bring you right back to those woods and let those Syrup Vines loose on you. And you'll regret your decision as you pop from all their syrup.\" Tucker got really close to William. \"They'll balloon you up. And when you beg for them to stop, they'll keep pumping you even bigger.\" He leaned into William's ear. \"And you'll beg to be my lab...fox again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam was stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only thing he could do was agree to be Tucker's lab rat until he found a way to escape his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...fine.\" William resigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Tucker marched back upstairs and, after a few minutes, came back down with something in each hand. \"You'll learn that I can be nice to you. And as a start, I'll let you pick the first thing to try on you!\" He held open both of his palms. In his left paw was something that looked like a large bee stinger. William heard of legends of massive bees building colonies in the distant plans, but he only thought of them as legends. In Tucker's right paw was a perfect green cube. The cube was translucent and William was able to see right through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does William pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as he turned around to run, a lone Syrup Vine surprise attacked William. It leaped onto his face, wrapping its vine body around the fox's head. William felt a loose vine force its way into his maw and toward his throat. The fox tried biting down hard onto the vine, but the root was too thick for him to gnaw through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs William tried to pry the Syrup Vine from his face, thick liquid began to fill his belly. Every second, the fox's flat stomach bloated out, stretching his tunic and wearing out the seams. The shirt started riding up his ballooning gut as William continued to try and rip the Syrup Vine off of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing that he did was working. Biting, clawing, nothing was hurting the Syrup Vine. His stomach was reaching its bursting point. The tunic was no longer bothered to cover the nearly two foot wide sphere of orange and white fur swelling on his midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was almost too much for William to handle. And none of his attacks were working against the Syrup Vine. The fox resigned himself to fate. He'll painfully blow up into a giant furry balloon until he popped in a massive explosion of syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when William felt like he was about to pop, the Syrup Vine suddenly let go. It pulled the vine from the fox's mouth, detached itself from William's face, and scurried away. The creature had run dry, clearly having emptied most of its liquid into the other unlucky traveler beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam glanced down at his poor, extended gut. Never before had he seen his stomach this large. It has also never been so full. Gently rubbing a paw along the tight skin of his stomach, the fox evaluated his situation. He needed to rest his inflated gut, but the area might not be completely safe. If he stayed and rested, more of the Syrup Vines might show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does William do?</span></div></div>",

The open fields were stalked by wild predators looking to find new meals to make themselves even fatter; strange mutations made some of the critters' claws contain a weight-gaining effect if they landed a scratch. The hills further south contained small villages with renowned eating festivals complete with contests. To the east, a mysterious village loomed. Few ventured to go there; rumors of curses abounded throughout the land.

The sword, however, was lounged deep into the wall of the cave. But from what William could make out, the blade of the sword was shiny and new. Clearly, it must be sharp enough to cut deep into whatever these cave walls were made of. The handle of the sword was gold and encrusted with large gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding this sword was a brilliant stroke of good luck for a new adventurer like William.

William gave it several more tried before concluding that getting that sword free would take something more than just elbow grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as William tried to step away from the sword, he realized that somehow his hands were stuck to the blade's handle. William began to panic as he realized his situation. He was no longer concerned about getting that sword and he was he was more focused on making sure he doesn't spend the rest of his life attached to that sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile William was desperately trying to free himself, something was approaching him from behind.

However, it didn't seem like the candybugs did anything that harmful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs several dozen candybugs crawled up his body, William did nothing to fight them off. Instead, he opened his maw and welcomed the critters. Five of the candybugs crawled into his mouth and he crunched down on them, an explosion of sweetness happened in his mouth. He eagerly picked off a few that were making their way up his chest and tossed them into his mouth, and William moaned because of the delicious taste. He kept popping more and more of them into his mouth, each tasting just as wonderful as the last. William got on his hands and knees and began eat the candybugs straight off the floor. They amassed in front of him waiting to be eaten by the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, William was picking off the last of the candybugs. Munching down on the last one in sight, he moaned and rubbed is swollen, distended belly. All the hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of candybugs bloated William's belly and made it look as if he had swallowed a beach ball. His normally flat midsection was now a pudgy sphere that was trying to digest the thousands of calories worth of candybugs he just ate. William had never been this full before, especially not with such sweet critters. Thanks to that, he found it hard to move around. He gently waddled over to one of the cave walls and sat down against it, letting his massive gut push apart his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam was softly rubbing his belly and his eyes were heavy with sleep. He thought that perhaps a quick nap would help him digest. But as William drifted off to sleep, he heard several incredibly loud thuds off in the distance. Worried, William tried getting himself back onto his feet, but his sizable paunch kept weighing him down. More loud thuds happened, and whatever was making them was getting closer to William, and this panicked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking several more failed attempted at getting back onto this feet, William knew that it was futile. Right in front of his was the Queen of the Candybugs.

The fox headed towards the sound, being particularly careful about where he was stepping. He didn't need a repeat of his last incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, William saw a raging river in front of him. As he approached it, he recognize two things. First, the river flowed much more slowly than any river he has seen before. It was as if the water was somehow thicker. The second thing that William noticed was the dark brown color of the water. It didn't look dirty, rather, the liquid had a consist light brown color, as if it was made out of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate?\" William asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox approached the river and knelt down. He sniffed the liquid and, sure enough, it had a distinct chocolate odor to it. After planting the torch into a secure position nearby, he returned to the river and knelt down again. Dipping a pawful into the liquid, he cupped out a bit of the river and raised it to his mouth. A cautious tongue drank in the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, this is chocolate milk.\" said William. \"And it's delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam brought his face to the river and began lapping up the liquid. Sweet chocolate goodness filled his mouth and then it filled his belly. The fox kept lapping up more and more of the chocolate river completely lost in the ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when his belly felt ready to burst that William stopped drinking the river up. He arose from the lake and noticed how much his gut stuck out, several inches larger than usual thanks to the chocolate milk that the fox had sucked up. The pain of his fullness suddenly set in, and the fox took a paw and rubbed his swollen gut. William's belly stretched his tunic tight, showing off the outline of his belly button. He moved around gently and swore he could he the sounds of sloshing in his gut followed by the sound of seams groaning under pressure. Despite the pain, he was hooked and wanted even more. But then again, another ounce more and the fox will surely burst.</span></div></div>",

Well, why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wades out into the verdant knee-high grass, taking care not to step on whatever might be hiding beneath the cover.  Whether it be a monster or a cow-pat, he doesn't want to step on either.  After a mile or so into the field without incident, he decides to let his guard down.  He's not seen any cows around...  Nor has he seen any monsters.  In fact, if there were any monsters, they'd probably be too large to hide amongst the grass blades.  The fox carries onward, just a bit more nonchalant, but still wary of his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being such a supposedly dangerous place, William's finding himself growing rather bored in the Fattening Fields.  It's been all of an hour since he'd set off on his aimless quest, and he's spent forty minutes of that hour milling about some empty plains.  The orange fox sighs in frustration, but keeps on walking.  Might as well, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hundred feet more reward William with a small \"island\" out in the middle of this sea of grass.  A small bit of raised land lies in front of him, simply made of dirt.  Atop this \"hill\" of three feet is a small boulder and what appears to be an oak tree.  He decides that this spot would probably be a good place to take a short break.  The fox perches himself atop the boulder and stares out into grassy expanse that he's yet to walk through.  He sees grass,,,  More grass...  A slightly-yellowed patch of grass...  Even more grass, and...  Hello, what's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the distance, William finally sees something vaguely interesting:  A pack of dire wolves chasing a deer.  The wolves were all quite large, both in terms of weight and overall size.  Each wolf appeared to stand about as tall as a horse, with a body length proportional to that...  But were also about as wide as they were tall, it seemed.  The deer was your standard-sized doe, of course, albeit with a few hundred more pounds of flesh added to its frame.  As William watched the spectacle, he noted that this \"chase\" wasn't much of a chase at all; both the wolves and deer were merely waddling along, getting slower as the seconds passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer eventually came to a stop as soon as it could no longer stand running, rolling over on its side and panting.  This, of course, spelled its doom, as the wolves began surrounding the helpless creature.  They each raised a claw into the air and struck the deer wherever they could, making it cry out in pain.  At this point, William noted that the wolves' claws were especially interesting:  Each paw was colored gold, with purple claws extending from the digits.  There were rather long claws, but that was to be expected of a dire wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam wondered if these were the \"mutant claws\" you'd been told about.  As the deer began to swell like bread-dough before the fox's eyes, this was confirmed.  The wolves kept jabbing the deer in the gut, and it kept fattening, it's neck becoming lost in rolls of fat along with all of its legs.  When the deer had become a giant beige blob, twice as tall as any of the wolves, they were satisfied.  William looked on with morbid fascination as the \"lead\" wolf set to work killing the deer as three others latched onto the deer's mammoth gut, pulling at it as it wobbled and quivered wildly like an overfull sack of gelatin.  The doe cried out in pain once more as the leader sank his teeth into her throat to land the killing blow...  But failed, as there was far too much fat to bite through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf kept trying and trying, but couldn't locate the doe's jugular.  He eventually gave up and joined the other dire-wolves, taking another section of jiggling, cream-colored belly-flesh and pulling in another direction.  The deer kicked her fat-addled legs feebly, but you could tell it was simply giving up as the wolves continued gnawing at her bloated gut, jostling it and jiggling it all about until it tore open bloodlessly.  The doe moaned one last time and went still, leaving the wolves to feast upon the vast stores of fat they'd made within her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to alert these vicious beasts to his presence, William stayed where he was, watching with a mixture of disgust, fear...  And hunger, as the wolves gorged themselves upon the deer's blubbery carcass.  As time went on, you could see the wolves themselves swelling with new fat.  After what seemed like an hour, the wolves slow in their feasting, each withdrawing from the half-eaten body and plodding a few feet away, where they all collapsed into the grass and fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" William said to himself.  \"I doubt they'll be bothering me, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam lowered himself from his boulder and got ready to set off into the fields once more.  Where to?  That's a good question.</span></div></div>",

Setting off in the opposite direction of the hunt, William made his way deeper into the grasslands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aspiring adventurer was able to travel through the plains for quite some time without any disturbances. Aside from spotting the occasional pack of rotund wild deer, there were not many other creatures around. In fact, there wasn't much of anything else in the area aside from tall, waist-high grass and the occasional barren tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, there wasn't much else until William stumbled upon a kind of oasis. There was a sizable lake of clear, crisp water. Surrounding the lake were various different bushes and tree, some of which had ripe, plump fruits hanging from the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam approached the oasis. A lone wild deer was drinking from the lake. It spotted him and waddled away, the deer's flabby flanks and rump wobbling violently as it trotted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the girth of the deer, William was struck with a thought: How did wildlife out here get so plump? The dire wolves clearly got huge from fattening up their prey and gorging themselves on its blubber. But deer only ate plants and drank water. So how was it that an herbivore blew up to be several hundred pounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good question, but William didn't want to waste time theorizing right now. Instead, he wanted to take advantage of the situation. He was feeling particular thirsty and hungry from the traveling he did, so it would serve William well to utilize the resources he just found. What does he do first?</span></div></div>",

He got down to his knees, took a pawful of water from the lake, and raised it to his muzzle. He tounged the liquid from his paw. It tasted cool and fresh. Although William knew of the risks of drinking raw water, he figured that the lake was pure enough that he wouldn't have to worry about getting sick or catching some disease from it. Getting down on all fours, he stuck his muzzle into the lake and began swallowing large mouthfuls of the fresh water, and the liquid started filling his empty belly.</span></div></div>",

William walked close to the wolf and approached it. Claw in hand William was ready for the little wolf pup to attack him, but nothing happened. William got so close that he could pick up the little wolf in his paws. William hefted the chubby ball of fur in his arms and began to scratch its belly. It began to relax on Mikes arms and William squeezed some of the tiny fat rolls that were forming on the feral dire wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William gently set the little wolf pup down on the ground and began on his plan to fatten up all of the dire wolfs till they explode. Willi again walked over to the dire wolfs and chose to return to the first dire wolf and thought that this would be you\u2019re first victim. William looked at the young wolf and had another idea and this one the young pup would have someone to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William took the claw and poked the dire wolfs belly again and it grew only slightly. William took a step back and looked at the now spherical dire wolf and grinned. William planned to leave the young wolf like this and burst the others and take this one back to his home so that he could use this one for its claws and the young pup could have someone to play with. William than looked at a few of the wolf's and began to set his plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William wants over to one of the female wolves and stuck the claw into her flabby belly. Immediately William saw the true effects of the claws as the female dire wolf had already taken a spherical shape. Even though there was little room for more flab to be deposited onto the wolf it found ways. Fat was put on places like the wolf's front paws, hind paws, and even the wolfs tail had gotten really thick with fat. A minute later and William heard the pelt of the dire wolf begin to strain with the amount of fat it was holding in. Then when William turned to the young wolfs he heard a soft slosh and there was nothing left of the dire wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William stood there in silence just in case any of the wolves woke up from the popping. But none of them woke up. William looked at the claw and was amazed with its power as only three pokes with it filled the dire wolf that fast with magical fat. William decided to speed the process up on everything by poking all of the wolves ten times. William then set his plan in motion as he moved from dire wolf to dire wolf poking each of them ten times. William watched in awe as the whole pack of dire wolves burst one by one and nothing was left but a few of the magical claws in which William picked up and put it in his back pack for his own personal use later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William then decided to head home since it was starting to get late in the afternoon and he didn\u2019t want to be stuck out here in the dark. William then had the little dire wolf pup follow him while he managed to roll the bloated and spherical dire wolf home with you. Since you lived a ways away from the town closer to here than you were the town it wasn\u2019t a long journey for you even if you had to roll an immobile dire wolf with you home.

William took the wolf out to the back yard and he walked over to the immobile wolf blob. William looked at the now awake dire wolf and noticed that it was also male And that put some more ideas in his head. William made a mental note to go to the towns library to find out more about dire wolves. William left the young dire wolf outside with the immobile dire wolf. William locked up his house and set for town. In his backpack were some of the claws that he collected from the dire wolves in his previous adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William walked into town and walked over to the mages guild and sold all of the claws for five thousand gold pieces.

The first gem on both of the collars was a blue one its purpose was to ensure the wearer of the collars did not burst. The second gem, a pink one it was to keep the wearer bound to the property of choice. and the last one which made the wearer more docile to the caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William then went to another shop and bought a bigger backpack and some food to last him a while.

William took out the little collar and placed it around the little wolf's neck. William then cautiously walked over to the much bigger and still immobile wolf. The larger wolf looked at him as William tried to placed  it around the larger wolfs neck but in the process William got scratched by one of the magical claws. William managed to get the collar over the large wolfs flabby neck right as the magic was taking place. William gained most of the fat on his belly making him look like he had just eaten a basketball. William  got up and looked at the dire wolf and saw that instead of growling the immobile ball of fat and fur looked at William and began to bark.  William  smiled as he knew the effects of the gem worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0William looked at the small wolf and tapped  the small  wolf with the claw from  the bigger wolf William  noticed immediately effects as the young wolf pup swell  with fat.

William walked inside the house and pulled out a few other things to fatten up the young male wolf  cub. the  first item was  a vie with a wired slime that was supposed to get bigger with water and listened to  his every command.  the second item was a spell that either enhanced the production or made bigger of whatever body part William chose, and it did not limit to just him he could also control both of the wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich item does William choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, with the dire wolf's claw in hand, approached the sleeping older wolves and one by one gave them gently pokes in the belly. The claw didn't have to go in deep. So long as it penetrated the skin it could send it's magic into it's victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each poke, the wobbling bellies of the obese wolves grew out, jiggling and gurgling as their fat expanded. William found it curious how the dire wolves' skin stretched to accommodate for the new fat. Rings of blubber wrapped around the necks of the feral beasts and their tails sunk into growing rears. By the time William was done, each wolf was too large to move their legs, let alone escape. From there, William took the claws from the immobilized wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the morbidly obese masterpieces he had left, it was no wonder to William that the kingdom had been riddled with massive obesity in the past few years. Between many seasons of rich crops, the recent mutation of the dire wolves, the use of particular magics learned from the nearby citadel's magic academy and the popular new form of battle adventurers had taken up, devouring your enemies whole, citizens and adventurers alike had a hard time living their day to day lives without earning a hefty frame. In fact, obesity was becoming a fad of sorts, as it represented a life full of adventure and success arguably just as much as a ripped muscular body. The main reason William had avoided this thus far was because his cottage was on the outskirts of the city and he tended to keep to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the no longer little wolf cub, William let out a sigh. He scooped up the blob of wobbling fur in his arms and, employing all his strength, wandered back to his house. Once he arrived to his cottage he opened the gate to his backyard. He set down his little wolf pet, who he decided to name Blubberfang as a testament to both the feisty attitude he had shown as he writhed about in William's arms and, of course, the thick padding of his blubber and the fat he could give to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam got to work, poking Blubberfang in the belly and butt with the claw, which was beginning to run out of juice. slowly Blubberfang's belly rose up beneath him, hoisting him into the air and splaying his legs to the sides, resting off the ground and on his stomach. His rear also grew into two perfectly round jiggling globes with a tail poking out of the crevasse in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam's tail swooshed side to side and he smiled as his new dire wolf pet calmed down. The soothing effects of jiggling fat on all his parts must have made him sleepy. William knew he'd have to keep Blubberfang fattened up from time to time. He wouldn't need to eat much since he was so big, but until the two had bound enough for the fox to call the dire wolf his companion he'd need to stay big enough that he wouldn't run away. Perhaps some day Blubberfang would be docile enough to be William's traveling/battle companion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell either way, now that William had Blubberfang safe at home, he started off into the city to see what supplies he could purchase with his claws. The trek to the city didn't take long, but once he got closer to the shopping district within the city's heart William found it harder and harder to move. The shopping district had some of the more wealthy homes of the city, and thus the citizens out and about on the streets became wider and wider as William headed in, some even taking up half the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam first decided to make a visit to the blacksmith's shop. The heat of the forge blasted William's fur as he entered the doorway. The blacksmith, Argus, was a tall bull with thick, beefy arms, and a large, round beer belly.. \"Aye, what can I getcha?\" Argus said, focusing his attention on the spearhead he was shaping. He then looked up at William, saw the rusty sword on his back and sighed. \"Ah, another perspective adventurer... Do yerself a favor and see yerself out. Trust me, things are getting wild around here and you don't look like the fightin' type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuffing out his chest, William stepped forward and approached the counter. \"Not the fighting type, huh?\" He opened up his sack of dire wolf claws and dumped it on the counter. Argus put down the hammer and eyed the claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dire wolf claws, eh? Well, paint me tusks and call me a daisy! Ye might just have the fighting spirit in you.\" Argus picked up one of the claws and weighed it in his hand. \"Yep, this seems like the real thing, but...\" He gave himself a sharp poke in the stomach with the claw. His firm belly rounded out, swelling in front of him to the size of a beach ball. Argus let out a hefty laugh as he slapped his massive gut. \"Haha, yes that's real alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam bartered with Argus and, in exchange for half of the claws, received a well fitted chain mail suit, a higher quality steel sword and a dagger handle fitted to hold the claws of dire wolves. William then went off to sell some more claws in exchange for some food supplies (a few apples, a box of donuts and a cake) and some potions, including a few healing potions and some \"deflater\" potions. William had heard of many creatures out in the wild, like the syrup vines to the northern woods or the various jelly slimes from the fields to the hills, that force fed themselves to their victims in battle. The deflater potions would speed up the digestive system, quickening recovery from a deadly stuffing, although whatever was consumed would still take it's toll on the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling ready for true adventure, William had to decide where to continue. He could go back south to the fields and hunt the wild beasts as well as wildlings, savage magic-wielding raiders who reject society in favor of a dangerous life. Perhaps the farm there would be in need of an adventurer such as himself? He had heard Ol' Farmer Buttermilk was having trouble keeping his herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also head north into the forest. In the forest he would likely come across syrup vines, thick plants who wrapped their vines around their victims and pumped them full of syrup until they were incapacitated (or worse), or perhaps a blueberry nymph, a forest sprite who's songs could lull an adventurer into a trance in which they swelled up with juices like a blueberry until they popped. Strange, mysterious events also took place in the forest, and one could never tell whether they'd encounter a pack of wild wolves or a house made out of candy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the east there was the citadel, another city centered around the school of magic. It would probably cost a hefty penny to earn the cash to study magic, however the inn there would be a great place to pick up quests and the hills nearby, while holding stronger creatures than the forest or fields and perhaps being too \"high level\", was home to various caves and who doesn't love adventures in caves? Farther off to the east were the mountains, where the most dangerous creatures lived. William knew he wouldn't be able to take on anything there yet, but perhaps once he had grown stronger he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the west there was another town by the beachside. There were also probably some quests there, and the relaxation of the sun, sand and very large coconuts sounded nice. Word was it the docks could take you to an island full of dangerous tribals, but again William doubted he was strong enough to adventure there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William decided to go where the questing was ripe, and a good place for that sounded like Ol' Farmer Buttermilk's farm to the southwest of the city. So the next day, supplies in tow and having fed Blubberfang to keep him plumped up, the young fox headed out on the western road and took the bend south back towards the fields. This time, however, instead of wandering blindly into the tall wavy grass, he stayed on the path until he encountered wooden fences leading the way to a barn, a few shacks and a country style house all huddled into a homey settlement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nearby corral were some of the largest cows he had ever seen, hugely round and fat with udders brushing the ground. They chewed and munched on the tall grass of the fields without a care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOl' Farmer Buttermilk was managing his milk stand. People came from all around to bring home his milk, some of the freshest and most definitely the creamiest around, but today there were no customers at the stand and the plump goat looked distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Buttermilk!\" William called over, waving his hand as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my... William? Little William, is that you in all that armor? Don't tell me you've decided to take after your father now...\" Ol' Farmer Buttermilk said, but through a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I have. And what better way to start my adventures than by helping out an important local business?\" William grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'm glad you're here. Your father would be proud.\" The old goat said. \"Actually, you've come at the right time. I could use a hand. Beasts have been picking off my cattle, and I ain't one to go picking a fight with a wild lion.\" Buttermilk shook his head in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lions?\" William asked. Lions weren't a usual predator to the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. There's lions in them fields! People say they came up north here fer the food, since eatin's been good the past decade or two. Now they're eatin' up some of the deer, even some wolves, and worst of all, my cattle! Rumor has it they ain't the only beasts out and about these days that don't belong here... But you know what I say?\" He paused for a moment, then put his hands on his pudgy sides impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... what do you say?\" William said, urging him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" The old goat continued as if he hadn't paused, \"I'd say something's urging them on. Wildlings. They've got some spooky shaman camped out somewhere and sometimes at night you can hear them chantin' strange things and see puffs of smoke in the distance. Ever since they got riled up we've been seeing all these beasts like lions and tigers and even an elephant wandering around! Do yerself a favor, boy. If you see a wildling, be careful. But I'll pay you a good price for any lion pelts you bring me! I'll even let you keep a few. Maybe you can make a cloak or something, I dunno what you adventurous types do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam nodded, having listened to everything the farmer had to say. \"Sounds like a deal. I'll do what I can, and if I see a wildling, who knows? Maybe I'll bring back it's head too!\" With that, he turned and headed off to the fields, Ol' Farmer Buttermilk calling behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky now, boy! There's trouble brewin'!\" His voice faded into the distance as William entered the fields.</span></div></div>",

William did come across a few grazing deer, their wide stomachs dragging against the ground, and even another pack of dire wolves who had been too large and tired to pose a threat unless provoked, but lions? How does one even go about hunting a lion? From what William had heard, lions are more often the type to stalk and not be stalked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWading through the waist high grass, William saw a lone tree in the endless field. Maybe if he climbed it the extra height could let him spy something worth hunting? That was his thought as he pushed his way forward through the grass. However, as he got closer he saw a shifting shape under the shade of the leafy branches. It blended in closely with the color of the grass but it's heavy frame had flattened the nearby grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam froze and unsheathed his sword, clutching it in both hands. He peered over the grass and, lo and behold, a male lion lay resting in the shade, awake yet lethargic. Although not a native creature to the area, whatever time he had spent in the area had clearly been successful as he was nearly as fattened as the other animals William had seen. As he laid down on his side, the lion's belly surged forward, spreading on the ground down to his knees. Blubber encased his neck, folding into several wobbling chins that jiggled as the beast yawned and licked his greasy chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion lifted his heavy head and turned to face William and fear shot down the fox's spine. Stealth wasn't going to be an option in this battle. William...</span></div></div>",

The lion, sensing the blood rushing through the fox's veins, lifted itself up and crouched, ready to strike. For a moment, time froze and the heat of the afternoon sun felt cold on William's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's eyes glimmered and in an instant time caught up to itself and the blubbery beast leapt at William, full force. However, the weight of the lion's stomach pulled him down, and the leap only brought him just in front of William, who took a step back and swung his blade towards the beast's side. The lion veered to William's left and swiped at his chest, claws raking at the chain mail vest. William was pushed back but otherwise the attack was blocked by the armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reeling back from his failed attack, the lion paced back and forth, breathing heavily. This gave William an idea. With agility not many beings in the kingdom knew, he darted behind the lion. The lion in turn whirled around as fast as he could, but William was swifter than this obese feline and stayed behind him. The two ran in circles around each other before the inevitable. The lion collapsed, panting and wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam took his place in hand and pierced it deep into the lion's neck, killing him instantly. He wiped his sword off on the grass and sheathed it before gutting and skinning his kill. William didn't know how much lion meat would go for in the market, but any slab of meat thick with fat was highly prized (as was any food high in fat content) lately. The hide itself was pretty large, and William was sure Ol' Farmer Buttermilk would have plenty of uses for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken all the loot from the fallen beast he could, William continued his hunt. By the time the sun began to set he had found and slain three more lions, totaling up to four kills and a lot of loot. William headed back towards the farm...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As William plodded through the tall grassy fields, grunting from the heavy load of meat and furs in his backpack, he heard a low grumble from somewhere nearby. Looking around, the fox's attention was caught by a patch of weeds that seemed... off. His tracking skills told him that something had been through there recently. Grabbing his sword by the hilt, he cautiously parted through the grass, following the trail back to the tree where he found the first lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, crouched over the corpse of the bloated beast was a wiry, sun-beaten anthro horse. The horse was the thinnest man William had seen in a long time. Each bone of his spine poked out, threatening to break through the tight skin which wrapped his body like a dry rubber band. His ribs showed and his stomach caved in. If the horse had eaten in the past few days it had been meagerly. In his right hand he clutched a sturdy looking walking cane of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of cutting a slice of spare meat from the lion's haunches (there was a lot of meat left), the horse stirred his hand in the exposed fat of the beast and let out strange slurred words. He scooped out a small amount of fat and smeared it across his face. Then, a green stone at the tip of the gnarled cane glowed softly. It shook for a moment, rattling the cane like a stiff breeze, and a green light the size of a golf ball sprung out of the stone like a spark from a flame. It hovered about the horse for a moment, floating like a lazy firefly. Then, without warning, it shot out, smacking William into the chest and vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frail horse leaped up with agile grace surpassing his age and he spun around, clutching his cane in both hands. Green fire blazed in his eyes. William understood that this horse was a wildling shaman, one of the dangerous tribals who fled into the wilderness, shunning society, looting and attacking civilians at random. Wildlings were unpredictable, and the shaman were their magic-wielding leaders. William dropped his backpack and brandished his sword. This was going to be one hell of a fight.</span></div></div>",

We watch over this land in earnest, keep it fertile and giving, and promote the growth of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing like what I've heard...\" William shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we aren't exactly a public presence,\" Barga said. \"Often our newer recruits get a little overzealous when dealing with poachers like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I found you, you were going around killing lions left and right, disturbing the balance. Not that it can be held against you, who knows so little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those lions were eating up the local cows,\" William retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cows were producing plenty of excess, and enough children to resupply their population several times over. Your farmer friend simply saw a loss of profit. What he did not see was the lions' need for food. Should the lions be deprived of cows, they will go after the wolves, and should the wolves begin to die out the smaller critters will grow out of control, devouring the plantlife with abandon. Then the forests themselves suffer.\" Barga closed his eyes and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I hadn't realized...\" William trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course you didn't. But you will.\" Just over the horizon William began to see tents made of various skins, dried and pulled taut. \"Welcome to The Garden, home of The Stewards.\" Barga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs William and Barga walked though the camp, William noted how many of The Stewards looked like average people. Generally, the population seemed less fattened, but there were a few chubby and even obese members of the community. Children ran around, mothers gathered by fires chatting, fathers tossed around stuffed skins in some sport. Some buildings were made of wood, some of stone, although none showed the grandiose of the city. The one thing that really stood out was a large stone statue in the village center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Barga said, gazing up at the statue, \"is the reason why we are here. This is Aminas, God of Life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue depicted a sprite-like being of ambiguous gender. It had a pair of wings, one like a bird and one like a bat, short wavy hair, a pointed chin, emerald eyes and long limbs. The most prominent feature of the statue was it's large, rotund frame. Aminas' belly distended down to it's knees, round and soft looking despite it's stone reality. The arms of the statue were thick with fat and the rear drooped in it's own overhang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animas, God of Life, is the one The Stewards are sworn to. Through Animas, we have made this land strong and good. Without Animas, there would be no life here. After just a few years, we have accomplished so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animas...\" William repeated. \"Just what have you accomplished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this, for one.\" Barga poked William in the belly. \"Fat, corpulence, adipose. It is all the physical manifestation of Animas' will. As life within the land grows, food and bounty becomes more and more plentiful. In turn, the creatures of the land grow fatter. Just think, in the past few years the kingdom has grown fatter practically overnight! All without changing the composition of the wildlife or the crops grown. The fields simply produce more. It is the loving will of Animas' that the children of the land reap the benefits of the earth. Animas even granted us the blessing of the sacred wolves, those who produce growth from nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam rubbed his belly. \"So then that trial...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarga nodded. \"The trial was also the will of Animas. You were presented with a blessed excess of nourishment and absorbed all of it, accepting it as part of your being. It is said that among the select few who pass the trial, one shall rise to be the champion of Animas and lead the world into a new age where all life blooms! That is our mission, and you,\" he turned to William, \"could be that hero. Maybe. There are other aspirants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how come not everyone in here is super fat then?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarga laughed out loud. \"Well, not everyone has as strong an appetite as a champion eater! And as an elder high councilor, I'm sworn to delivering life and growth unto others. I may partake in the sacred growth when the world shares in the glory we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving learned many things about The Stewards, William was told he was free to come and go as he wished. However, should he want to lend a hand and persue the path of the aspirant champion of Animas, there were always quests to pick up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William spent the night in one of the tents in The Garden. It was warm and humid, and smelt of smoke, but the fox fell asleep soon enough. In his sleep, he dreamed of a garden, not \"The Garden\" where he was, but a palatial garden with stone paths and trees reaching up to a black sky where stars and the sun coexisted. Each stone on the path he walked was not held in place by earth, but floated as if there was no ground beneath. Looking around, William leaned in and studied how each tree and flower pulsed with energy, waving and swaying to an unknown heartbeat.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nThe path stretched on, and as William floated along a gentle hum filled him. Streams of clean, glittering waters appeared, flowing from a source further down the path. A breeze blew by, ruffling William's fur. The waters met in the center of the garden, where seven streams and seven paths met. The branches of the trees intertwined overhead, swaying against each other like so many hands grasping each other in friendship. The roots rose from the ground making steps in this gazebo of sorts, and in the heart of it all was a marble fountain, simple and clean. Atop the fountain, above where the waters flowed from, was a flower, rich in color and fragrance. Each petal was a hundred colors and from each pistil poured golden nectar into seven cups, which overflowed into the streams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam reached a hand out and grasped a cup. He lifted it and drank from it. The nectar was neither sweet nor sour, but it's taste filled his senses in a way not physical. As he drank, his frame swelled out, gurgling and bubbling with fat. Soft flesh expanded in all directions, dozens of pounds each second. William's belly pressed against the fountain and the waters ran against it, causing him to shiver in delight. His soft moobs rested on his chest, ample and squishy, each the size of a stack of pancakes. His rear rounded out, each cheek surpassing the size of his head and becoming dimpled with cellulite. His legs became thick so that his thighs folded over his knees to overtake them as did his arms at the elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cup was empty William stopped to feel himself jiggle, swaying in the breeze. He placed back the cup and instantly it was full again. Excitement filled William, knowing that if he wished, he could drink from the nectar forever and always grow fatter. It was a feeling that he had never experienced before. Such a desire to stay and grow, to drink and be one with this flower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached for the cup again, however, his eyes opened and he was once again in the tent. Sunlight pierced through the entrance flap, striking him in the eyes. William rose quickly, eager to discuss his dream with Barga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the old man sitting by the statue of Animas, meditating. William skid to a stop when he realized he was interrupting, but that didn't stop him from knocking over an empty bucket and causing a small clamor. Barga's eyebrow twitched, he peered over towards William and chucked. \"Come to tell me about your dream with the fountain, young one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam stammered for a bit. \"You, you knew I had the dream? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All aspirants have the dream of Animas' fountain when they come to realize their calling. And they all have the same reaction too...\" His voice trailed off as his gaze shifted down. William hadn't noticed until then that the entire time he had a rather strong erection pounding against his pants. \"Yes, the young aspirant usually feels the desire of Animas' will with their ENTIRE being!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam blushed hearing this. \"So... so what does this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you know,\" Barga responded. \"I've made the chieftain aware of your arrival. He told me that should you hear the calling, and it certainly seems you did, that you are welcome to enter his tent so he may tell you how you may proceed from here. Although, if I were you, I'd... relieve myself first,\" He said delicately. William cocked his head, unsure, so Barga elaborated. \"The chieftain is the leader of The Stewards, both literally and symbolically. Thus, he DOES benefit above all others from the blessings of Animas. Most aspirants get a little... antsy when they see him for the first time, and he hasn't gotten any less blessed!\" Barga laughed out loud. \"The chieftain's tent is the largest one atop the hill. Can't miss it. Off with you now! Do what you must! Chop chop!\" Barga prodded William along with his cane in the direction of the hill on the North end of The Garden.</span></div></div>",

The dire wolves, once sleepy and tired from their feast, got back onto their feet and left as quickly as they could in their present heavily-bloated state. The pack swiftly left the area leaving behind the remains of the bloated deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam wasn't sure what exactly was scaring off the dire wolves. But whatever it is must be dangerous to scare off such already terrifying creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur adventurer didn't have to wait long to see what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the tall grasses came what had to be the biggest tiger William had ever seen. It was just as tall as any of the dire wolves, but its girth would have put them to shame. The tiger, as far as William could tell, must have been seven or eight feet wide. Its furry, creme-colored gut hung a mere inch off of the ground and jiggled with each of the tiger's step. The creature sported an impressively massive rump and thick legs most likely grown from having to carry around such a huge amount of weight. And just under the tiger's bright red mane was a tire of fat that covered its entire neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam watched in awe as the one-ton tiger slowly made its way towards the deer's carcass with each step causing the earth to shake briefly. The massive tiger saw the remains of the deer and immediately began to feast of the rest of the deer's blubbery belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiger engorged himself on the carcass, William just stares at the tiger from behind the boulder. He had never seen a tiger that large before. It's astounding that the thing was still able to waddle around at its size. No wonder the dire wolves scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, William was struck with an idea. The tiger was massive and clearly had the size advantage over any opponent. But William had speed and agility. \"I should be able to easily give the thing the run-around,\" thought William. \"I could poke it in the rump and it will take a week for it to turn around and get me.\" A few quick stabs with his rusted sword and William should be able to best the tiger. And the bounty that big of a creature would bring him would be huge. Just the pelt alone should be able to fetch a nice price. Maybe some member of nobility needs a massive tiger-skin rug for the floor of his dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger was finishing the last of the carcass. If William was going to attack, now is his best chance. What does William do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After reviewing what he knew about the land, William felt compelled to go to the villages on the hills in the south. He wasn't sure why this was. The fox was never particularly interested in eating contests. These were events for bulky furs. A scrawny fur like him would never stand a chance in any kind of those contests. Nevertheless, he sensed an urge inside of him wanting to go south. Maybe this was adventurer's spirit getting the better of him. In any case, it wouldn't hurt to visit. Even if he found nothing especially exciting in the hill towns, then it wouldn't be a total waste of his time since they were only a day's travel away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam set out the next morning for the south following a winding dirt road. It was a rather uninteresting trip; the only other fur he saw on the road was a trader heading towards the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time William made it to the hills, it was already the evening.  In the distance was a ring of hills. Many of the local residents lived in homes they build on the hills. The majority of the commercial and community buildings were in the center flat plain that sat in the middle of the ring of hills. William knew that this is were he would most likely find an inn for the night and decided to head in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the town center, he noticed that there were no other furs on the streets. This worried William. He needed to find someone, anyone, to ask about the location of an available inn. As William stopped to assess his situation, he heard off in the distance the faint sounds of cheering and yelling. He rushed towards the noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the area's residents had descended upon the town square. On the far side of the square was an elevated platform with a long table on it covered in empty pie tins. Three furs were sat at the table, each trying to swallow more and more pie. William realized that he had accidentally stumbled upon one of the south's famous eating contests and, since most of the town was here, he might as well stick around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was the furthest away from the stage, William easily made out the three contestants because of their sheer size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far left sat a bull with thick, muscular arms that strained the sleeves of his shirt and boulder-like thighs that made his shorts skin-tight. The bull also sported a sizable paunch. A sliver of brown-furred belly stuck out from under his shirt stained with blueberry pig filling. The poor guy looked like he was going to be sick as he lazily shoved handfuls of pie into his mouth. A placard in front of him said 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSat in the center was a kangaroo with light red fur. He, too, had a belly on him although it wasn't as large as the bulls. The roo was extremely bottom-heavy. His legs were incredibly flabby and his hips were so wide that William would not be shocked to find out that he need two chairs to support his width. Even the kangaroo's tail was thick and pudgy and fought for space against his massive rump. He was muzzle-first in a pie pan. The placard in front of him said 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the far left of the table was a massive orange and white fox, just like William. This fox was easily three times as wide as William and easily just as heavy. In general, the fox was fairly chubby but his gut accounted for most of his weight and looked like a white, soft boulder attached to an otherwise overweight fox. He was happily eating an entire pie hold it in both of his hands. The placard in front on his said 25.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And time is up!\" yelled a another fur on stage, clearly the host. \"And your winner with 25 pies is Matthew! Give it up for your winner!\" The crowd cheered as the fox raised his flabby arms in victory and two other muscular furs helped me out of his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let's hear it for Troy and James! Nice try, guys! Better luck next time!\" Troy, the bull, rushed off staged looking like he was about to be sick. James, the kangaroo, gave a brief wave to the audience as he got up and shuffled off the stage, clearly disappointed. Turns out that William was right about the number of chairs the roo needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew, the massive fox, made his way off of the stage. A few members of the audience approached him in congratulations while the majority of the crowd dissipated. Just like the day before, William felt particularly drawn towards one of the contestants and he suddenly found himself searching for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matthew held open the door to the carriage for the smaller fox. When William was inside, Matthew wedged himself through the doorway and plopped himself down on the seat opposite of William. The carriage groaned under the weight of the obese fox before it slowly pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy my little show back there?\" asked Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show?\" replied William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That eating contest.

Especially considering that the massive fox was almost too wide for his carriage; his meaty flanks brushed against the interior walls and his heavy gut jiggled uncontrollably after every bump in the road. \"You used to be skinny? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know,\" replied Matthew. \"Maybe you'll find out. We're here!\" The carriage grind to a halt. Matthew was the first to get out, though it took him a few minutes to squeeze his huge frame out of the carriage. William didn't mind this since it gave it a solid glance at the fatter fox's ample butt. When William got out, he only had a few seconds to admire the exterior of Matthew's house before the bigger fox grabbed him by the wrist and started dragging him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you hungry for dessert.

He peeked out the window of his room and noticed the moon high in the sky. It must has been just after midnight. William didn't know what that noise was, but he wanted to investigate. The embers of the dying fire in the fireplace still provided a faint amount of light. The fox went searching for his clothes but couldn't find them. The servants might have taken them for washing, William figured. So he took one of the smaller blankets off his bed and tightly wrapped it around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully opening his bedroom door, the fox peered down both ends of the hall. On his right, the hallway extended off into the darkness. But on his right, around the corner, William noticed a light. He headed towards that part of the hallway, turned, and saw clear at the opposite end of the hall he stood in was a doorway flooded with light. Another clattering noise rattled down the hall. This must be where the noise is coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making his way down the hall, more bangs and clattering came from the room. William was nervous. This wasn't his home and he didn't know what kinds of things went on here. He reached the doorway and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam had found the mansion's kitchen. Dozens of cupboards lined the room's walls, a large kitchen island occupied the center of the room and on it were various kinds of knives and kitchen tools. Several sizes of cauldrons occupied another side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what immediately caught William's attention were the two huge furry globes of fat. Three feet across each, both looking as if they were made of bread dough, and an equally orange tail gently wagged in the air. Under the mounds were two thick tree trunks of legs. This was clearly the rump of a particular rotund fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew?\" asked William. The fox was leaning down and looking deep into one of the cupboards below him. Raising himself up out of the cupboard, William got a clear view of his fat back and haunches which formed into massive lovehandles. The obese fox turned around, hold two larges bowls, one in each arm. Matthew's front was just as bare as his backside, but at least his gut hung so far down below his waistline that any embarrassing situations were avoided. The fox's gut was a gigantic, white furred sphere with two pillowly moobs resting gently on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey William.\" The obese fox waddled towards the kitchen island and set both bowls down on it. William saw that they were filled to the brim with thick brown substance. Matthew grabbed a couple of the stools surrounding the island and set them right next to each other. The fox lowered himself onto the stools, each one bearing one of this oversized legs. \"You here for a midnight snack too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just heard something crash and I figured that I'd check it out.\" Our adventurer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was probably me.\" Matthew said. \"The servants hid the chocolate pudding from me, so I have to dig around to find it.\" He waved his pudgy hand towards a stool opposite to him. \"Please, sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam sat himself on the other side of the island. \"Why are your servants hiding pudding from you?\" he asked. The bowls Matthew had found were the size of standard salad bowls and completely full of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I'm starting to get too big.\" Matthew started. \"All of these eating competitions are catching up to me. I'm really getting too fat to move around. So my servants hide food from me to make sure that I don't lose my mobility as soon. But I just love food too much.\" The obese fox lifted up one of the bowls to his mouth and started pouring the contents into his mouth. William could do nothing but stare in amazement as he watched the fox opposite to him chug down the giant bowl of pudding in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew set the now-empty bowl down; chocolate stained his muzzle as he let out a low, rumbling burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I need your help.\" said the obese fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean? How I can help? Do you want me to help you lose weight or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew laughed, rippled were sent through his entire flabby body. \"Oh no. I'd never lose a pound. Here's what need. Some ways away from here, there is a sorcerer. Or maybe he's a warlock. Or a wizard. I don't know and I don't care. But this guy has some seriously great enchanted items. And there's one that I want. There's a particular necklace that he has that makes the wearer weightless. I think he may had made it for traders who carry with them heavy loads like gold or gems. Well, I'm not a trader but I'm carrying a lot of weight. So what I want you to do is get that necklace for me. That way, I can keep eating all I want and still be able to walk around on my own. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

So even if William didn't want to accept Matthew's invitation, he had the feeling that he would be dragged into it anyways. Matthew slowly waddled through his mansion, and this greatly annoyed William. He clearly recognized how massive the other was. But Matthew was moving at a snail's paces because of all the extra fat he was carrying around. William could have easily walked through the mansion faster if he wasn't being pulled along by Matthew, so he just had to endure the annoyance of having to walk alongside a much slower fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the two arrived at a lavish living room. Paintings of fruit bowls and natural landscapes covered the walls, plush red carpet covered the floor, and in the center of the room were two massive couches. Matthew let go of William's wrist and slowly plodded over to one of the couches. He lowered himself on the couch and William could hear the springs and frame of the piece of furniture groan under the weight of the fox. Matthew's flabby flanks touched both ends of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam settled into the couch opposite of Matthew. Suddenly, the doors to the living room opened and in came two other male foxes, one of whom was pushing a large cart with several covered trays on it. He immediately noticed two things about these other foxes: Both were just as skinny as William, and he knew this because both were wearing only black leather briefs equipped with a hole in the back of them to allow their tails to slip through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, both of these new foxes approached Matthew and started to undress him. They both pulled off the tent-like shirt the fox was wearing. This exposed Matthew's gigantic gut to William. The shirt was tight and didn't leave much to the imagination; William could have already made out every single roll on the fox. Now, he could see the white fur of Matthew's gut and the two pillow-sized moobs that hung on top of it. The servant foxes removed Matthew's pants, freeing his thunder thighs from the trappings of the pants. William didn't know if Matthew was wearing any undergarments, but it didn't matter since the obese fox's gut covered his nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this doesn't make you uncomfortable,\" said Matthew. \"But I felt like I was wearing a sausage casing all day in those things. Besides, this is my house, after all. And shouldn't a man feel free to show a little fur in his own him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would suppose so,\" began William. \"But...\" His eyes wandered to the servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, them? Well, I don't want to feel self-conscious. Besides, you like the uniforms, don't you, boys?\" The two foxes nodded in agreement. \"Well, aren't you going to serve dessert?\" The foxes went to the cart and uncovered several trays. Under each one of them were massive cheesecakes, each one easily sixteen inches in diameter. One of the foxes grabbed a couple of the cheesecakes and headed towards Matthew. The other took a single cheesecake and a fork and gave it William. Then, he also went over to Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant fox on either side of him leaning into his fleshy side, each with a cheesecake in hand. Matthew opened his mouth and one of them quickly grabbed a slice and shoved the entire thing into Matthew's mouth. He chewed a few times and swallowed the piece, opening maw for another piece. In an instant, one of the foxes had a piece ready for Matthew to chow down on. This process repeated until only a single slice remained. As the obese fox reached his mouth out for the last slice, he notice his guest staring in disbelief. Rather than eating his own cheesecake, William had only taken a few bites. He was instead mesmerized by the display of gluttony in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you're seeing?\" asked Matthew. \"I hope so, because...\"</span></div></div>",

Having the wind knocked out of him he gasped and tried to right himself, but found it more difficult than usual with the added weight. Weight which- his ears flattened as he observed- was still climbing, fat spreading out his stomach and elsewhere as his increasingly tightened clothes were indicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe it was a clothes shrinking spell?\" He muttered with delusional optimism as he stood up in a low crouch. His position in the ditch kept him out of line of sight for the shaman's magic, or at least William hoped it did. But what was he going to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Realizing that a simple sword wouldn't help him get very far if he faced a serious threat, William decided to walk into the shopping center. As he wandered in, he was approached by a mysterious round figure clad in a black cloak, who slowly walked by, motioning for the fox to follow him. \"Have you ever been here before?\", the cloaked figure grunted. \"No... wait, who-\" \"Don't worry about me. Got any money?\" \"No, I-\" \"You're a brilliant one. If you even look at someone wrong, you could end up with your ass kicked... or worse.\" The mystery fur thrust a bag into William's hands. \"Here.\" \"What's this?\" \"A small fortune. Just wanted to protect a newbie, can't have someone eating your butt up. Just so you know, I meant that literally, not figuratively.\" The cloaked figure began to walk away from the confused fox before suddenly tripping, his massive bulk slipping out of his black cloak to reveal a huge panda, sheepishly running away. You look at the gold again: looks like he fenced it from someone with the initials \"F.F.,\" as that's what the bag's side reads in marker. Glancing around to make sure this \"F.F.\" wasn't about to bumrush him, William grabbed a handful from the sack and dropped the rest still in the bag. If \"F.F.\" found it, he wouldn't be TOO mad, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of tents of every color, each with its own fur merchant selling his or her wares, spanned a vast plowed section of the field. As the fox wandered among the crowd, he heard shouts from vendors of every kind. One offered exotic treats and sweets guaranteed to put ten pounds on someone or their money back; another offered magical spells, the raccoon mage occasionally throwing a spell at a passerby, showing off his skills by shrinking, growing or transforming the confused target for about ten seconds before the effect wore off and they returned to normal. Others offered every kind of potion, clothing or trinket imaginable, all extolling that theirs were the best. Making a makeshift coinpurse out of an abandoned piece of cloth, William began to look for something to buy.</span></div></div>",

Well, get a taste of my favorite expansion spell...\" The mage waved his hands in a series of gestures. Suddenly, a cloud of blue sparkles popped into existence and flew right into William's face. William flinched back and brushed off his face. He waited a couple of seconds and found that nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Just a bunch of bunk.\" said William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" the mage asked. He glanced over the shoulder William's shoulder. William looked behind him and noticed that, in fact, the spell had worked; his rump was noticeably larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam's cheeks burned bright red in embarrassment. \"Okay, fine, what are you selling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon mage looked smug. \"Consider that a free sample. I'm selling anything that's on this table. Prices are in front of each item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam scanned the table and was disappointed to find that he could only afford three items: a plain gold ring, a throwing knife, or a simple black leather collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do those things do?\" He pointed out the only three items he could afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the ring is quite handy. It prevents the wearer from popping. So if you get trapped by a Syrup Vine, you'll be able to drain the thing dry before you pop. What you do as a giant, syrup-filled fox at that point is beyond the powers of the ring. That throwing knife is tipped with dire wolf poison. You know how dire wolves hunt, right? They stab their prey with their claws and the wound blows them up to massive proportions. The same will happen to whoever you use that on. It's a single-use only, and be careful not to poke yourself with it. And, well, I'm not sure what exactly that collar does. One of my men brought it back from an adventure, and I know that it has some magical properties, but I haven't pinpointed what it does just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that irresponsible to sell magical items that you don't know what they do?\" asked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking to get rid of it.\" replied the mage. \"So are you going to buy something or not?\"</span></div></div>",

Also, who wanted to really risk the collar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll take the ring I guess.\" He said while trading it for his coins. The ring itself looked decent with a green gem on the silver band. He slipped it on his middle finger as the raccoon let him go for a bit of advice. \"Just so you know, kid, you won't be able to digest anything until you sleep. Your body is pretty much infinite storage.

He hadn't had much to eat; he wasn't quite ready for a feast, but he could definitely eat. Plus, if he ate too much, he was skinny anyway; it'd be a while before the famed weight gain of the area could do any real damage, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked around, comparing prices, he saw a pattern. A sandwich was one gold, but three were only two; cake slices were two, but a full cake was only five. Most of the food was priced like that; the smaller portion was only slightly less than the larger portion... as far as some places' definitions of \"portion.\" The \"calzone\" stand just folded a pizza in half, adding multiple fillings and stuffing them with cheese. Donuts were nearly a foot wide, and were in bulk for low prices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs William re-counted his gold (it appears he had made off with about 60 pieces), his hands felt an odd sensation after they had handled the coins, the feeling spreading to his stomach after he took another whiff of delicious food smells. It went away after about ten more seconds, leaving William wondering what had happened. Was he hungrier? Had there been something up with the coins, or did he just imagine that? Taking a minute to sit down, he refocused his sights on his desired meal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The orange fox sauntered over to the donut shop he had seen, with the massive cakes that had looked delicious. The 350-pound wolf baker behind the counter seemed shocked when the lithe vulpine ordered a dozen, but when he took out his gold, the cook's expression changed. For four gold, William had himself a dozen donuts, all in a box two feet wide and four feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief walk outside the center's gates, William relaxed, sat down and opened the box. One dozen triple-glazed hubcaps, half stuffed with chocolate, stared him down. Meekly, William picked up the first choice- banana nut chocolate, one of the place's specialties- and chomped down. It felt like heaven for the young kit, who savored the first bite for nearly a minute before swallowing. Greedily, he began to tear away at the defenseless donut, vanquishing it in a minute. Hungrily, William snatched a second calorie-laden dish, this one filled with thick chocolate filling, and took a massive bite, sucking some of the cream into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath as he downed the final bite, the young fox snapped to attention for a moment, wondering what had gotten into him. Two donuts in two minutes was a record for him, especially when they were each the size of four themselves. Glancing at the box to examine the remaining ten treats, William did a bit of a double-take. It appeared that they had grown a few inches each! The box's sides were pushed close to their limits, and the fatty delights pushed against one another. \"That's strange,\" he thought, rubbing his belly. Though it had just been filled with two huge baked goods that should have given him a food coma, it looked slightly puffier, if not noticeable yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming the feast, William grabbed the third donut, giving it a glance-over before he downed it. It seemed a bit bigger, but not really, right? Assuming it was nothing, he savored his bites, though a growly stomach meant he finished it quick. He looked down at the box again. Yep, the donuts were growing, this time bigger than before. They were eighteen inches around... like the extra inch that had made its way onto his midsection. What's worse, he was hungrier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainfully hungry yet passing limits he didn't know he could pass, William forced down the fourth and fifth donuts, both stuffed with Nutella. Keeping his eye on the box, the fox could clearly see the remaining donuts bulge slightly bigger each time, and his body followed suit. The weight stopped going to his gut and started spreading out, slowly filling his arms and legs as he ferociously gained speed in his uncontrollable weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time William had gulped down the ninth donut, each of the three remaining pastries in what used to be a cardboard box were well over two feet in diameter, while the orange fox's general figure had done half that. His puffy, rounded gut hung a few inches off his chest and just as many out and around, while his tree-trunk legs and thick arms swelled. \"It had to have been the coins,\" he thought as he automatically tore the first few bites of the tenth. Shoving the donut in his mouth and carefully eating it, he grabbed the coins, each now emblazoned with a figure of a fattening fox. \"That panda must have done this to me,\" he thought, \"but since I'm finishing these donuts, I might as well enjoy porking out before I chase his fat ass down.\" Pushing himselff to the limit, William finished the eleventh and twelvth donuts, each three feet wide, in what has to be a world record for finishing two three-foot-wide donuts. Struggling at first to stand up, the fox had found out why the rumors were true about this place- thanks to the magic of a stranger, he had gone from 150 pounds to 550 in an hour.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William hadn't had a calzone in years. And while the calzones they served up here would easily be dinner for a skinny fox like William for the next three days, he felt like he was on the mood for one. Worst case scenario, he could eat it over the course of the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the calzone stand. Operating the stand was a polar bear, easily a foot taller than William with a sizable belly which strained his flour-covered apron. He was talking with another fur, a cheetah. The cheetah stood just as tall as the polar bear, but did not have an ounce of fat on him. Rather, he was heavily muscled and the cat's clothes looked skin-tight on him. William could make out every curve and ripple on the cheetah from his bulging pecs and define abdominals to his sculpted calves and luscious glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" William asked. \"May I have one of those calzones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear and cheetah exchanged skeptical glances with each other. \"A calzone? Did I hear you right?\" the polar bear asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a calzone! I'm really in the mood for one!\" replied William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah looked at William up and down. \"You sure you want one of those?\" he asked. \"I doubt a skinny little fox like you could take one of those on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't ask for your opinion...\" said William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was giving my opinion? It's just a matter of fact that you couldn't fit one of those monsters in that non-existent belly of yours. I can barely take one of those things on, and I've got all this to maintain.\" The cheetah gave his biceps a quick flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam blushed slightly at the cheetah's display. \"Whatever, I don't care what you think. I'm having one anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah gave a smirk. \"Well, look at you. Fine, get your calzone. Actually, you know what?\" He turned to the polar bear. \"Lou, get this guy a calzone on me. I want to see scrawny-butt over here take it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you say so.\" said Lou, the polar bear. The vendor got a calzone from the display case, quickly wrapped it in paper, and handed it to William who needed to hold it in both of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" William said to the polar bear before shooting a glare at the cheetah. He marched over to a nearby table, sat down, and unwrapped his calzone. William grabbed a chunk of it and started munching on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah sauntered over to the table and sat opposite to William. \"Tasty?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam shot him another glare. \"Yes.\" A few crumbs escaped his full mouth when he talked. The cheetah tisked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only pigs speak with their mouths full,\" he said. William didn't bother responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes, William was finished with only a quarter of the calzone and the cheetah mostly sat in silence watching him eat. The cheetah stuck out his hand. \"Luke. My name is Luke. I probably should have introduced myself before buying you lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam suspiciously eyed his paw, but shook it after a few second. \"William.\" he said, after swallowing another mouthful of calzone. Once more, he grabbed another chunk of the calzone and stuffed it into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fifteen minutes had past and William was only finished with half the calzone. But his gut felt absolutely stuffed. His normally flat stomach had bloated out to the size of a basketball and was just a firm. As he eyed the rest of the calzone, William just panted as he stared it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting full?\" Luke asked smuggly. William said nothing in response. Then, Luke reached his hand towards William's face and ran a thumb nearby his mouth. He pulled it back and Luke's thumb was covered in tomato sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you had a little something on your face.\" Luke said sarcastically before licking the sauce off his thumb. William blushed at this. \"So, do you need help finishing it, or do you think you can take on the rest?\"</span></div></div>",

He grabbed to half-calzone with both hands and started devouring it. Within seconds, Luke's muzzle was stained with meat and pasta sause, but that didn't slow him down. He swallowed mouthful after mouthful with haste; William wasn't sure he was even chewing at all. In a matter of minutes, the half-calzone was gone. Luke opened his mouth and a low, rumbling burp came out. He lifted up the bottom of his tunic to reveal a taunt curve that replaced his defined abs. A smirk appeared on Luke's face as he gave his belly slow, circular rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opps, sorry.\" said Luke with false sincerity. \"How are you doing, foxy?\" William was still majorly bloated and could only moan in response. \"Poor guy. One day you'll be able to take of these things on. Stay here, I know what'll help you out.\" Luke got up from the table and walked to another food vendor off in the distance. William took this as an opportunity to rest his head on the table and try to sleep for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slamming of the beer stein on the table woke William back up minutes later. \"Drink,\" asserted Luke. He hadn't bother cleaning the sauce off his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I'm still really fu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink.\" Luke demanded. When he sat back down at the table, he took a long drink from the mug, easily downing half its contents. When he pulled the stein away from his lips, he gave off another deep burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam looked at the beer mug in front of him. It look as if it just contained a simple ale. He meekly raised it to his lips and took a gulp. The moment he stopped drinking, he felt the sudden need to burp. He tried stifling it, but an eruption of gas still came out of his mouth. \"Opps...\" said William. He noticed, however, that his stomach felt a little better. Still present was the sensation of fullness having eaten such a massive meal, but the pain associated with it was going. In fact, William thought he might have been able to eat a few more bites of that calzone if Luke hadn't finished it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good stuff, eh, foxy?\" said Luke. Another series of gulps, another series of burps from Luke. William followed suit, finding that each drink of the ale made him want to burp, and with each burp his belly felt significantly less pressure. When he finished his mug, William's belly stuck out significantly making him look as if he was six month pregnant. Luke, too, was even more bloated than before, though William was quick to note how the curve of his belly complemented his bulging pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at us, a fox and a cheetah acting like a couple of pigs.\" said Luke, a paw slowly swirling around his exposed belly button. \"How about dessert, foxy?\"</span></div></div>",
