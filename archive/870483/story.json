The girl, who was wearing some ratty old clothes, had her long black hair tied in a messy bun, and was covered in filth, would have been very beautiful if she were cleaner and wearing nice clothes. \"Come on Daniel, lets go riding. I bet I could beat you in a race again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just letting you win,\" he replied as he readied two horses for riding. Daniel was wearing equally ratty clothes, for he was the stable boy and none of his clothes were any nicer. However, despite his tattered appearance he was still quite attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, then what about all the other times I've beaten you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just luck. I'll beat you this time,\" he teased her as he handed the reins of one of the horses to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just see about that,\" she laughed as she pushed him down and swung her leg over the horse's back. \"Ready, set, GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey no fair,\" he jumped onto his horse and chased after her.</span></div></div>",

Her parents, King Edward and Queen Jasmine, were beginning to worry. \"She is a royal princess and she is always off galavanting with the boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off Edward, she is a teenager, and she is a wild spirit who will not be contained. And second, Daniel is near the age of manhood and he is very responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jasmine, I know you are fond of the boy, but the point is that she is almost of marrying age and we need to find her a suitor. We need to get her to attend balls and dinners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but she is still our daughter and we should atleast try and think about what she wants. But you are right. We'll have to sit her down and explain all this to her. She's a reasonable young lady and she'll understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, unbeknowst to the King and Queen, Isabelle was standing on the otherside of the door and had heard everything. She was not happy, she ran straight up to her room and did not emerge for hours. When she finally did she ran straight to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle, whats wrong?\" he asked her dropping what he was doing looking extremely concerned for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she lied as she wiped the tears off her face. \"But look, I found this book about this treasure see. Supposedly, there is a lot of gold and not only that but somethings of the gods. There are things like a holy sword and armor, a magic mirror, fruit of the gods, and so much more. Come on let's go, let's go and find it. I'm already packed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dumbstruck. She wanted to go on this dangerous and probably deadly quest for some mythical treasure. \"But you can't, your parents would never let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need their permission to do this. I'm going whether they want me to or not. They don't even have to know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're just one person, you're a princess, how do you expect to get there and back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping you would come with me. Help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't Isabelle. It's one thing to let you ride horses and to disobey your parents around here, but that's too far, that's where I draw the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought you wanted to be a knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. No knight would let a princess go off on such a dangerous quest alone. And if we pull this off they'll have no choice but to make you a knight, and I can finally get some freedom. Now are you coming or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a few minutes to pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the late afternoon they were heading off on their quest. They had packed up the few things they would need and left without saying goodbye to anyone.</span></div></div>",

Where is my daughter!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter frantically searching the room, she came across a note telling of a quest. The Queen ran to her husband waving the note in his face.

Even though they were best friends neither knew what to say to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the castle, five knights were setting out to find the princess. \"Can you believe we've been sent off on this wild goose chase?\" asked the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, we should be with the others fighting the war, not off chasing after some silly little girl with dreams of being some hero or warrior princess,\" replied a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look at it this way,\" suggested a third. \"It's a nice break from real work. She's obviously not going to get very far, so we get to take our time and relax. This is just a paid vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and might I remind you guys that she is not just some silly little girl anymore. Have none of you seen Princess Isabelle lately? She has grown up, and mmm mmm mmm does she look good,\" said the fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet all of you,\" interrupted the fifth, who until now had said nothing since they had left. \"First of  all, she is only sixteen and a princess, you shouldn't be talking about her like that. Second, this is not a vacation, have all of you forgotten about Radigan?\" The joy suddenly left all the knights faces, they had forgotten about Radigan. \"He is still after the kingdom, and she is his ticket in. I don't want to imagine what he might do to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the silence was broken with the realization that neither Isabelle nor Daniel knew where they were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where were going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of fear on her face answered his question. \"Don't worry Isabelle, we'll figure out what to do,\" he reasured her. \"Look, you said that book told all about this treasure. Maybe there's a map.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're right, thank goodness you're here Daniel. Here's the book,\" she replied handing him the book. Just then they came upon a fork in the road. One path led to a quaint little village and the other led into a dark forest. \"Which way does the book say to go Daniel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let me see. Oh great, the book talks in riddles. It says, 'VERY FEW HAVE EMBARKED UPON AND NONE HAVE SURVIVED THIS QUEST. TO A RICH AND BRIGHT FUTURE, DOWN THE POETIC PATH IS THE BEST.' What do you think it means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, lets go this way.\"</span></div></div>",

Why would they write about something as ugly as the forest?\" she called over her shoulder without stopping or looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComfortable with you reasoning, Daniel followed.

In return, she pushed him, he push her, and they continued to poke and push each other until their laughter got in the way.

Besides, she knew how to defend herself. She had been helping Daniel train to become a knight for years and was very skilled at using a sword, although she was much better at a bow and arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Daniel pushed Isabelle aside and jumped infront of her. Before she even saw what was happening she heard the sounds of steel on steel. She stood with her back towards Daniel as more and more villagers began coming out of nowhere to attack them. As a villager lunged at her with his sword poised to strike she ducked out of the way and kicked his sword out of his hand. She looked for Daniel and saw him fighting several other villagers and knew that she would have to fight. So as another villager charged at her Isabelle dove for the fallen sword, grabbed it, and before she could even rise to her feet she turned around bringing the sword above her head to deflect the sword looming down upon her. His and her sword met in a loud crash of steel on steel. She quickly leapt to her feet to fight off the now numerous villagers closing in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Isabelle continued to fight valiantly and were now back to back and completely surrounded when a very comanding voice rang throughout the village ceasing the battle. A pathway through the villagers formed to let the person whose voice comanded so much respect pass through.

Mrs. Palonis is always cooking, if you ever get hungry you can visit her, but you may gain a little more weight than you might want. Also, if you need any food for you trip she'll be glad to give you some. There is where Mr. Gilani lives. He has a son who lives quite a ways away and sends him many items from the places he's been. Also they visit each other every now and then, so Mr. Gilani has lots of travelling supplies. Mr. Tomin lives right here, and he's the best hunter in our village.

Mrs. Palonis was a very jovial plump woman who doted upon them and packed them both a bag filled with food for their trip. Mr. Palonis was equally as jovial and yet surprisingly scinny considering how much Mrs. Paloni loved to cooked. While his wife began cooking another meal for them, Mr. Palonis was able to sneak Isabelle and Daniel out of the house before they gained too much weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they visited Mr. Gilani whose son travelled the world and sent him several rare items from the places he had gone. Every so often his son was somewhere close enough for Mr. Gilani to visit him, but since he never knew when that was going to happen he kept surplus travelling supplies which he was only too happy to share. He also gave them a few rare items that they could use for trading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left Mr. Gilani's they visited Mr. Tomin, a very strong and rugged looking man. Isabelle didn't like him that much because he put too much emphasis on how a man is supposed to be strong and be able to take care of the 'little woman'. However, he did give them, or rather Daniel, a couple small daggers, a bow, and some arrows. Along with Daniel's sword they were well equipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been given so many things by the friendly villagers that they needed to get a couple new bags from Deeter and Lucia. Deeter and Lucia were so generous, they even almost gave Daniel and Isabelle their two horses, but they graciously declined feeling a little guilty at how much they had already been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile packing their bags Isabelle found the book that had sent them on this trip. She had completely forgotten about it. So she opened it up and she and Daniel were surprised to see a picture of the village, along with a small riddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'VISITING THE WOMAN WHO MAKES THE POTION,<br>\r\nTO AID IN YOUR QUEST IS A VERY GOOD NOTION.'</span></div></div>",

After taking a quick look inside Daniel and Isabelle entered with the door slamming shut behind them. Soon they saw a desk in a room lit by a few scattered candles with an old woman sitting at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Isabelle, Daniel, I've been waiting for you. I wasn't sure if you would heed the book in your possession,\" her voice was soft, almost inaudible, and very soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you know we were coming?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I'm a princess? I haven't told anyone in town that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My child, how could I not know? I already know why you are here and where you are going. I have some gifts for you.\" Daniel and Isabelle suddenly noticed that she never looked directly at them. The blank look in her eyes told them that she was blind, but they could tell  that she had some other way of seeing. They weren't sure how, but it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old la-Miss Haverstein. You said you had some things for us. What kind of things?\" Daniel inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. These will aid you on your quest,\" she turned around and reached into the cabinet behind her pulling out object after object. She held up each one in turn as she explained what they were then put them in a pack. \"This my dears is a healing potion. You simply drip a couple drops on the wound, get some rest, and soon it will be healed. If there is interior damage, drink a few drops. I'm sorry to say that it does not cure a broken heart. Next we have an enchanted cloak. It can protect you from many attacks, fire, several bladed weapons, and most spells, but not all so be careful. This sheild is also enchanted. Not only is it extremely stong and can deflect most weapons, but it also increases all of your abilities. Here is a bow that any arrow shot from it will not fail to miss its mark. These seeds need only be planted and sprinkled with a little water and they will grow immediately. Each seed will give you enough food to last you a day. This key is capable of opening any locked door. Here I have two pendents that if you two are seperated can help you find each other. A small map of the area will appear on the back that will show where the other pendent is. When they get close enough they will begin to glow and once you are reunited the glowing will stop.\" Miss Haverstein gave them a few more supplies. Daniel and Isabelle thanked her for all the amzing gifts that she was giving them no questions asks.</span></div></div>",

They turned around and walked out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bye children,\" Miss Haverstein called after them as she looked after them, her eyes, blind no more, watching them leave. \"They are strong, and will not be easily detered by you.\" A dark form came out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are but mere children. How long do you think your's or any other's magic will shield them from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Radigan, you are a fool. Those who protect them do not use any magic that you can break. Their powers come from the days of old that have long been forgotten. We may not be able to keep them safe forever, but they will be given a generous head start,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the fools. Even with all you powers none of you were able to stop me, and now you send children to put an end to my rein. Ha, I am all powerful and not even the little treasure chest they search for will contain anything to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, there are powers in the world far greater than your's. They are the ancient powers, and there is enough magic in the 'little treasure chest' to stop you one hundred fold. As for these children, their destinies are great. They will accomplish wonderful things in their time, and will leave the world a much better place free of you and several other evils.\" After staring at the doorway refusing to look at Radigan, Miss Haverstein brought her eyes to his as she said her last sentenced. An angered, and slightly worried Radigan snapped his fingers and disappeared in a blinding flash with a loud bang, leaving behind nothing but a small cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside Daniel and Isabelle are...</span></div></div>",

As Daniel came to her side, she looped an arm through his, and hugged it briefly.<br>\r\n\"Wow.  Such an adventure already.  All these magic potions, and these tools . . . it's like  book from my father's library.\"<br>\r\nDaniel's handsome face looked worried.  Isabelle hadn't made mention of it when they arose, but Daniel, after he had washed that morning, had emerged as a striking figure of a man.  It had taken a moment for Isabelle to recall that this was her friend Daniel, the stable boy, for heaven's sake.  <br>\r\n\"Something doesn't feel right.\"  He said, shifting the load he wore on his back.  \"It felt like there was someone there.  Watching us.\"  He ran a hand through his hair.<br>\r\nIsabelle shook her head.  \"Where?  There was barely enough room for you and I in there.\"<br>\r\nA blast of sound from the other side of the square interrupted their conversation, and together they peered across the cobblestones.  Some sort of raised structure had been erected, and there was a crowd already around it.  Daniel and Isabelle joined the throng, but stayed at the back.<br>\r\n\"We should be on our way.\"  Daniel murmurred in her ear.<br>\r\n\"Hush.  We'll go once we figure out what's going on.\"  Isabelle's eyes were trained on the stage.<br>\r\nSuddenly, in a whirl of colour, a dozen figures burst though the curtain and onto the stage.  After a few moments, Isabelle realized what it was.  \"A festival!\"  She cried, her eyes shining.  She applauded excitedly.  \"Oh, how fun!  Daniel!  A festival!\"  <br>\r\nThe crowd around her were all equally excited, and music arose from around the square.  Turning, Daniel could see figures streaming out from all the streets and alleys into the square.  These tumblers and acrobats began to go through the crowd, and suddenly, the square was awash in light and sound, as the entire community began to dance with these figures.  He whirled when he heard Isabelle laugh, just in time to see her dragged into a fast dance with a masked jester.  He moved to catch up with her, only to have his own hands clasped.  He turned and saw another masked figure, female this time, grinning up at him.  <br>\r\n\"Come, young man,\"  She said, and whirled him around quickly.  \"Dance with me.\"<br>\r\nAlthough he tried desperately to keep an eye on Isabelle, it was futile.  He finally made it to the edge of the crowd, found a place in the shadows, and watched carefully the whirling figures, hopeing to catch sight of her.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air turned cold, and the music dies with a snap.  Daniel started forward, only to catch sight of the figures on the stage.  One, he recognized easily - Isabelle, still grinning widely, having the time of her life.  The other figure was dressed as a jester, his rags of bright cloth seeming at odds with his regal bearing.  Daniel began to elbow his way through the crowd, ignoring the mutters and curses in his wake.<br>\r\n\"Behold!\"  cried the jester on the stage.  \"This young lady of the town, has volunteered to be my assitant today.\"  A smattering of applause from the audience, and a rude whistle from the vicinity of the ale-house was the reaction.  \"I see you are not sufficiently enthused by this,\" the jester continued, the eyes through the slits of the mask narrowing, \"so, I, a great magician, shall only do one trick for you.\"  A series of groans arose from the audience.  \"Ah!  More than one trick then?\"  A cheer arose.  \"Very well.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, a crash, almost of thunder sounded above the crowd, and there were squeals of surprise as a shower of coloured sparks fell upon them.<br>\r\n\"Not enough?\" Called the magician, and suddenly, huge jets of green tinged smoke arose from the sides of the stage, accompanied by music - all eyes turned to the musicians - who were all in the ale house, their intruments abandoned.<br>\r\nAs the magician continued his tricks, Daniel's eyes scanned the square.  He watched as a number of the jesters slid silently away, melting into shadows and into alleys.  This seemed rather suspicious to him, and he continued to elbow his way forward.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" boomed the magician, \"my final trick.  I shall make my assistant\"  Isabelle curtsied \"DISAPPEAR.\"  A hush fell over the crowd as they waited in anticipation.<br>\r\nDaniel pushed forward in panic and jumped up on the stage.<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  he cried, running forward and tackling Isabelle out of the way, as the magician turned to her.  He got back to his feet, sword in hand, and approached the jester.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  he growled, the point of his sword resting against the man's throat.  \"Are you a simple jester?  Or, perhaps, an emissary from Radogan?\"  With that, Daniel ripped of the man's mask.</span></div></div>",

Feeling foolish, he attempted an apology. \"ummm...sorry, thought you were someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the audience recovered from the dramatic turn of the events and some started to get irritated. \"Boooooo!\" \"Get off the stage you spoil sport!\" \"Go pick on someone your size!\" The fruits start to be flung onto the stage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking from the flying fruits and heading towards the stairs of the stage, Isabelle has also recovered from the shock of Daniel's theatrics.

That was great!

And speechless with their mouths wide open. A fly flew into Daniel's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another little trick of mine. Sorry I am just showing off.  You can call me Geching by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was still speechless with mouths open.

She gripped the arms of her chair, her knuckles turning white from the pressure. Isabelle and Daniel had jumped to their feet but where unsure of what they should do. After what seemed an eternity her eyes closed and her head slumped forward. They inched closer to her to see if she was alright, and just as Daniel reached his arm out to her, her head rose and terror was written on her face. She rose to her feet and spoke with such force that almost knocked the stunned onlookers to the ground,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must leave now.

Anyone willing to fight wait in the square, everyone else inside your homes right now.\" Ushering Daniel and Isabelle to the edge of the village she warned, \"I can protect the village and its inhabitants, but you I cannot. I cannot interfere in a prophecy. Radigan will do whatever it takes to get a hold of you too, especially you Princess. He may not yet know about the treasure for which you seek, he desires you for another reason. Go, go now!\" With that she turned around and began to run back to the village square. Daniel and Isabelle stood watching her go for a few moments before acting. Just as they began to run blindly away they heard the voice of the seer once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beware the blue eyed child with blonde pigtails and freckles. She may look to be an angel, the picture of innocence, but do not be taken in. She is not what she seems, and if you are not careful she will be your downfall and the destruction of all that we know and love....\" Her voice faded and Daniel and Isabelle continued to run not knowing where their feet would lead them. They finally reached a small wood no larger than the town square. They ducked behind a few trees and leaning theirs hack on their trunks they slid down and rested on the cold dirt ground. Once they had caught their breath they stood and gazed in the direction from which they had come. They could see the red and orange glow of many torches and the exasperated screams of unknown creatures unable to capture and feed upon their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go back and help them, I can't just run away.\" Daniel turned around and punched the closest tree in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, the seer told us to go. She said she could protect the village. I...you're right, we should be helping them, not hiding.\" Her voice was filled with concern. Neither knew what to do. Suddenly they heard the voice of the seer, but they knew not from where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be foolish children. We will be fine. Do not come near here.

He couldn't bring himself to look back, he just kept his eyes infront of him at almost pitch black forest as he tried to navigate around trees and various other plants that seemed to be reaching out for them trying to grab them and feed them to whatever was behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle on the other hand couldn't take her eyes off the creature now in pursuit of them. She wasn't exactly sure what it was but she knew that if it ever caught up to them it would kill them instantly, but she couldn't bring herself to look away and run, so she just kept begin dragged along by Daniel. As she peered at the creature in pure terror she realized that this thing could have caught, killed, and eaten both of them in a matter of seconds, but it hadn't. It was holding back, not running its fastest, instead it was playing with them like a cat would a mouse. The chase was infinately better than the catch. This thought only horrified Isabelle further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBranches from the trees, protruding roots, and dangling vines grabbed at them both, ripping their clothes and cutting into their flesh. Then suddenly a root seemingly rises from the ground purposefully to trip them. They both stumble over each other and stop when they crash into the trunk of a tree in a small clearing. As the creature casually strides into the clearing looking a little disappointed that the chase is over and yet proud of what it has caught, Daniel pulls out a dagger he had packed and stands between Isabelle, who picks up the largest stick she can find, and the creature.</span></div></div>",

He raised his dagger ready to strike, and Isabelle stayed behind Daniel with a large stick in one hand and a jagged rock in the other. Both were terrified, but both watched as the creature neared them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was maybe a foot from them when the creature unexpectedly fell limp to the ground. Both Daniel and Isabelle were stunned. They looked at each other wondering what happened, then looked at the motionless body of the thing that almost had them for supper. Right away they saw an arrow sticking out of it's heart. Once they realized that someone must have saved them by shooting this creature they heard rustling fom the trees. They looked toward the sounds and out came a figure with a bow and arrows slung over its shoulders. Whoever, whatever it was wearing a long dark blue, almost black, cload and hood, and neither Daniel nor Isabelle could see much more of this figure, and neither laid down their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments a voice spoke from beneath the hood. \"You have nothing to fear from me.

But why do you appear now before in that form, why do you not return to your true form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice that came from this old woman's lips was not the same that she had used to speak the Daniel and Isabelle. Instead, it was silky smooth, melodious, eloquent, and extremely lovely. \"I choose to remain in this form as a precaution. If the children come here I do not want them to see my true form, also, I must continue to hide myself from Radigan. For if he ever found me, it would be catastrophic. You have done well Melish. I thank you for your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'Lady,\" Melish continued. \"It will not be easy to convince them to return to the safety of their castle, and I'm afraid that even if I can get them there, there they will not remain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good, for they must not return to the castle just yet.\" Melish was stunned, but remained silent. \"Our only hope is for them to reach their goal. For if they do not, Radigan might, and if he does he will be able to conquer our world and many others. These two, though they are but children, must obtain the legendary treasure, for contained within it are things that will help save our world. You must quide them safely out of the forest, but no further, for in the forest you must remain, which you already know. But once they are out of the forest there is another job you must do. King Edward has sent his five best knight after them to bring his daughter home safely, they must not succeed. If they catch up the the Princess and stable boy before they have obtained the treasure, the world as we know it will end. You must stall these knights, but do not  completely deter them, for on the return journey, these children will need all the help they can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do as you say M'Lady,\" Melish kneeled once more, and when he arose the old woman was gone.

He's erally nice and he did save our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I didn't like. Now where do we go from here?\" Daniel asked as he pulled out the book that had guided them into the forest. \"Hey, look at this.\" He pointed out a page to Isabelle who took the book and nearly dropped it when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be...can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it is. Look, it even has his name. Why would Melish be in this book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but maybe it explains why,\" Isabelle answered still in shock and began reading the passage below Melish's picture aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MELISH IS KNOWN AS THE KEEPER OF THE DRACOON FOREST. A POWERFUL FORCE KEEPS HIM WITHIN THE FOREST. NO ONE KNOWS HAVE HE CAME TO HAVE THIS CURSE PLACED UPON HIM. HE CAN NEVER LEAVE UNTIL IT IS LIFTED. NOT EVEN THE LADY DRACOON (see next page) HAS BEEN ABLE TO LIFT HIS CURSE, BUT SHE HAS PROMISED TO CONTINUE TRYING. UNTIL THEN HE DOES HER BIDDING AND PROTECTS THE CREATURES OF THE FOREST. HE IS ALSO A GUIDE TO THOSE WHO WISH TO PASS THROUGH THE FOREST. MELISH ONLY KILLS WHEN NEED BE AND CAN BE A VERY LOYAL AND VALUABLE FRIEND.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why he wouldn't come out into the sun,\" Daniel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Isabelle looked back at the forest as her words faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who do you think this Lady Dracoon is?\" Daniel asked jerking Isabelle back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dont know.\"</span></div></div>",

There was a small hill in front of them, and once they reached the top they saw who had screamed. A young girl was being attcked up ahead. Daniel unsheathed his sword, Isabelle pulled out a small dagger, and the two run to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's goin on here,\" Daniel demanded hoping that this could be solved without anyone getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your buisness boy,\" one of the two attckers snapped while the other put the girl in chains. Isabelle was looking at the girl. She was attractive and the same age as her. The girl just stared back into her eyes, silently pleading for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Let her go,\" Isabelle odered the men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a slave girl, she's no concern of yours,\" the second one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'm not. Please help me,\" the girl screamed before being slapped across face by one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that again,\" Daniel comanded as he raised his sword, Isabelle aslo raised her dagger. The two men simply laughed. They walked up to Isabelle and Daniel who braced themselves for an attack. Unfortunately, they weren't prepared for to more attackers to grab them from behind forcing them to drop their things. All four attackers just started laughing at them. One put Isabelle in chains, while the other three began attacking Daniel.</span></div></div>",

Now stop it, and release us at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A princess huh? You know, we could get a very large ransom for a princess,\" one of the attackers mused as he stopped kicking Daniel and walked over to Isabelle. He took her chin in his hand so that he could look at her face, then he dropped her chin and circled her looking her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, before we collect the ransom, we could have some fun. She is very attractive, so is the first one we caught. We could kill the boy and have our fun with the girls,\" said the third turning his back towards Daniel. Isabelle was disgusted at what they were saying and surprised that her plan had backfired so badly, but she hid it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no objections to that,\" said the fourth walking up to her, putting his arm around her waist, and pulling her close to him. Daniel was pretty badly hurt bad he had enough strength to take advantage of the fact that none of the attackerswere watching him. He swung his legs around knocking down the attacker who had his back to him and grabbed his sword. The girl they were trying to rescue had managed to get a hold of Isabelle's fallen dagger and was trying to break her chains. Having failed to break the chains she stood with the dagger in her hands ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go,\" he comanded as he raised his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing boy?\" The other three laughed as the fourth rose to his feet. His question went unanswered because the moment after he asked it Daniel, Isabelle, and the young girl attacked. Daniel spun around swinging his sword across the fourth attacker's stomach. The young girl threw the dagger into the chest of another one of the attackers. Isabelle elbowed the attacker, who had his arm around her, in the stomach and wrapped her chains around his next. She kept pressure on the chains around his next until he fell limp. While she did this Daniel plunged his sword into the chest of the last attacker. Once they were sure the attackers were dead they set to work at trying to cut through the chains. They eventually got them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to thank you for coming to my aid when most would have just walked by trying not to look,\" the young girl said. Just then the damage that had been inflicted upon Daniel took its toll as he collapsed.</span></div></div>",

Its quite aways, but we can take better care of him. Trust me, its the least I can do, you two saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. There's no where else we can go.\" They lifted up Daniel's limp form drapping his arms over their shoulders supporting his weight. The girl led them farther down the path then onto another side path almost invisible to the naked eye. They continued down this path and several other dirt paths until they finally left the path altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued in silence for about and hour before anyone spoke. Isabelle was startled when the young girl's voice broke through the silence,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name is Aurora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am Isabelle, and this dead weight is Daniel. Aurora is a beautiful name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Isabelle is as well. You two are skilled fighters. May I asked where you learned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel here is training to become a knight, and as his best friend I help him train. You're just as good. Where did you learn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At home everyone learns to fight. The men learn more techinques and such, women mostly just learn to be able to defend their homes, families, and selves. Though several learn more than is required, and some of even greater warriors than the men. We are a peaceful people, but we still must know how to defend ourselves, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand completely,\" Isabelle agreed, and they once again fell into silence. They walked on for another two hours with the silence only broken by the occasional stir or groan from Daniel. The sun was setting and the sky was an amazing blend of reds, pinks, and purples when Aurora's town came into view. There were several trees surrounging a shimmering lake. A spectacular waterfall sent mist through the air and magnificent creatures wondered around so gracefully. Houses were scattered by the waterside, there were some within the trees surrounding the area, and a few boats glided along on the surface of the water. The people all looked happy and content in their little village, isolated from the rest of the world. It looked as though these people rarely left their town and never had any visiters.</span></div></div>",

Aurora gathered some medical supplies and cleaned and bandaged Daniel's wounds while Isabelle sat by his side with his hand held tightly in hers. She sat there for just short of half and hour before Aurora was able to convince her to do otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will do neither of you any good for you to just sit here wearing yourself out. Tealom, our village, is very beautiful at nightime under the light of the moon and stars, maybe you should take a look around, or if you would like to rest you can stay in the room right next to this. You just shouldn't stay here all night. Daniel just needs his rest, he'll be much better in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I wouldn't want him to wake to a strange place not knowing where he is or where I am,\" Isabelle answered looking at Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unlikely that he will make up before morning, or even by tomorrow afternoon. Please, he wouldn't want you to worry yourself sick over him. The village knows you are here, and if you need anything just ask. You can wander around freely but do not leave the borders of the trees, it wouldn't be very safe. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, if you think its best.\" Aurora nodded and walked Isabelle out of the room who after one final look at Daniel hesitantly complied. She wandered among the trees and only came across a few other people, all of whom looked upon her with curiosity, distrust, fear, and kindness. Isabelle glanced up at a few of the houses she past and finally came to sit on the shore of the lake, looking at the waterfall, the stars, and the ever growing ripples on the surface of the glistening water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the home of Aurora, her father was not pleased that two strangers were in their village, in their home, especially these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But father,\" Aurora pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. You shouldn't have brought them here. Their ancestors where the ones to force us to leave to live in this hidden away and isolated little plot of land. We may have turned it into a spectacular oasis, but they had no right,\" he scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, they're different. They don't even know about our past. Besides, they saved my life, I had to return the favor, its a matter of honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful that you are safe, but with or without them your would have escaped, you have been well trained. You shouldn't have been that far from home anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been arguing only a room away from the one that now held Daniel, and he had been woken and was now listening to everything they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they can help us. After all she is a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n\"How did she know that, we haven't told her. I know that Isabelle wouldn't have told her. She doens't want anyone to know. But how does she know?\" Daniel thought now out of bed and leaning his ear on the door.<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this princess is too dangerous. Radigan is after her, and if he found us it would be a miracle for even one of us to survive. There's too much risk. The longer they are here the greater the risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all this father, but if they succeed we may finally be able to put an end to Radigan. And this Daniel is already on his way to being a great warrior. We wouldn't have to give them much help, maybe just teach them some of our ways, give them some supplies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait. I only wanted to let them stay the night. How did we get from that to helping them? In order to help them we would have to reveal who and what we are. They don't even know that powers such as ours even exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n\"Powers, did he just say powers? What are they talking about?\"<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to have to  go to another planet in a another dimension. I want Radigan stopped. With help Isabelle and Daniel can get the treasure and Radigan can finally be defeated. Please father.\"</span></div></div>",

I will try to explain everything as accurately as I can, and if you are still unsure of that which I will tell your shortly, you can ask when I am finished. Do you understand?\" Daniel nodded his head and Aurora continued. \"Centuries ago the world was filled with magic and spectacular creatures. Most of those creatures were hunted and exploited and now but a few remain. Those few reside here, within the boundaries of our land. There were also several forms of human who were born with various forms of magics. People in power sought to buy their services, but many more still simply forced their servitude, turning vast amounts of people into slaves. The many were forced into hiding, and others were banished out of fear. Many have left this planet, this dimension, but a few, like the ones that live in this village, including my father and myself have been able to remain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We look after the world, and when we can do so without being discovered we try to help people, but it is very rare that we can do so, especially with Radigan gaining power so quickly. Nothing goes on that we do not know about, with the exception of things that happen within Radigan's domain, we can only sense what goes on within his ever expanding borders. That is how we knew of Princess Isabelle and yourself. But Radigan is gaining too much power, and we fear that he will soon find us and try to use us, that is why we must leave. He will take over the planet, then he will reach throughout the galaxy, he will reach as far as he can. We will soon leave this dimension as did others of our kind, unfortunately we must leave humans and other nonmagical beings behind to fend for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The treasure you and the princess seek is called the Treasure of Higani, it contains several artifacts and magics, left behind by those who have departed this world. There was an ancient prophecy even that long ago, that an evil would rise, and it would be unstoppable, except for someone of immense powerful. It was decided that since it would not happen for many more years, and that the prophecy and magic would be lost through the generations, that enough powers would be hidden away until the time that they were needed. But it has been lost, and many believe it only to be a myth, but if you find it, for it is apparent that none other will search for it, Radigan can be stopped. I will try and help you anyway that I can. You must be very cautious of Radigan though, for he would use your princess for his own gain, and if he learns the location of the Treasure of Higani, then nowhere will be safe from him. I know this is a lot to take in, but it is the truth.\"</span></div></div>",

Aurora simply sighed deeply waiting for his mirth to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\nUnaware of what was going on inside Aurora's house, Isabelle had settled by the side of the lake. She had taken off her shoes and, now bare foot, Isabelle was admiring the beauty of the lake - and what a sight it was, for there were numerous lit candles floating on the surface of the water like stars. The waterfall seemed to give off an alluring glow by itself and the sound of the water falling and crashing into the calm surface of the lake was so soft and entrancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This place is so beautiful.</i> Isabelle thought. <i>I would love to live somewhere like this, wait...no, no I wouldn't. The fact that it is so rare is what makes it enchanting, so living here for the rest of my life would take away from it. But still, I would love to visit whenever things became too arduous at home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle...\" A light whisper floated on the breeze calling her name. Isabelle looked around but saw no one near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle...\" It called again. It seemed to be all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle...\" This time it sounded like it was infront of her, on the lake, and she looked at the ripples in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle...\" It was beginning to fade, as if it were heading farther out on the lake toward the waterfall. Again Isabelle looked at the ripples, and this time instead of them spreading out in cirlces they seemed to head straight for the waterfall, as if something was brushing along the surface, following the voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle...\" She was now sure it was going to the waterfall, for immediately following this last call all the lily pads and leaves and such floating on the lake came together and formed a walkway from where she sat to the waterfall. Even many of the candles lined up on the side of the walkway to light her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking Isabelle rose and stepped onto the walkway. Surprisingly it held her weight as if it were solid ground and she did not sink. So she continued walking toward the waterfall and the strange sing song voice which had called to her. There was something about it that Isabelle knew she had to go to it.<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's laughter finally began to quiet and Aurora cleared her throat to regain his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Daniel replied when he could speak once again, \"but you can't really think that I would believe something so outrageous. I know Radigan can do a lot of unusual things, but this whole story seems so far fetched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I knew you wouldn't believe me. So, I'll just have to prove it to you.\" Aurora sat down on the floor with her legs bent underneath her, and closed her eyes. Her hands rested in her lap, and she started mumbling something under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later Daniel looked through an open doorway and saw what appeared to be a kitchen, and inside the sink, filled with water, had begun to shake. The next thing he knew the water shot out of the sink in a wide stream and made its way out to where he and Aurora were sitting. Aurora still had he eyes closed and was still mumbling as the water landed in between them. It hovered about an inch off the floor and did not spread out more than three feet. Then once all the water was out of the sink and hovering on the floor, small cylinders of water began rising and turning into many different types of flowers. The water was becoming a garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was speachless and realized that he had forgotten to breath, so he took a deap breath. At this point Aurora opened her eyes and stopped mumbling. Instead she smile at the water garden, and when the flowers stopped growing she picked one and brought the bloom to her nose to inhale its perfume. As she did so, the flower ceased being made of water and became real flower, Daniel did not know what it was called, but he did know that he had never seen one like it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand the water garden splashed back into the sink, but Aurora still held the single flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you believe?\" She asked as she stood. Daniel nodded, unable to form coherent words, even a simple yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\nBy now Isabelle had reached the waterfall. She put her hand under the falling water and smiled, the water was cool and smooth to the touch. Then she walked through and when she emerged on the other side in some sort of a cave she was still dry, not a drop of water anywhere on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isabelle looked around at her surroundings. She was in a fairly large cave.  The stone walls were quite smooth and, despite the fact that it was the middle of the night and there were no candles or torches present, the cave was adequetely lit. Isabelle turned around to look at the waterfall from this side and saw that it was in fact creating its on light and casting the brilliant glow throughout the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Isabelle.\" She glanced over her shoulder but saw nothing. Isabelle calmly turned around and, if the sight frightened her she did not show it, there was a figure, a man, standing where once there was none. He had short curly red hair, was about five or so inches taller than Isabelle, and wore a pale purple, richly embroidered, regal looking tunic and trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle bowed her head and lowered herself in a curtsey, something which was usually done by others to her. Nothing about this situation surprised her, though were she an onlooker or when she reviewed this later on it might, but everything just seemed right, seemed like she had to walk along that path of lily pads and leaves and had to curtsey to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled and bid her to rise. \"I have been waiting for you young Princess.\" He motioned to a couple of small boulders curiously shaped like chairs, and they sat down. Something inside her told Isabelle that she was here to listen, to learn about something and not to speak until the right moment. So she kept her mouth shut and waited for her companion to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Princess Isabelle, as you already know, but I also know who you are, much more than you can imagine. As for myself, I am called Zarion and I once belonged to this town, these people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n\"I may be able to do a lot of things, but I nor my people alone can save this world from Radigan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why do you think that Isabelle and I can do any better?\" Daniel inquired. They had been talking since Aurora had demomstrated her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not underestimate yourself. Everyone has at least one if not numerous inherent abilities, it is just a matter of tapping into the them. You have already shown a natural talent for fast healing. After the fight earlier and other events from you past you were left physically and mentally exhausted, you should have been unconscious for another day at the very least. Yet here you are, conscious and completely lucid only a few hours later. As for Princess Isabelle, I am sure her skills will come to light soon enough.\"<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Isabelle, let me tell you about a prophecy foretold long ago. It was said that an evil would arise and sweep destruction and suffering throughout the world which would spread far throughtout our universe and in time into other realms. Also said was that nothing short of the combined magics of the world - for at the time of its foretelling the world was full of all kinds of magic - could defeat him. Fortunately it would not come to pass for many more years, unfotunately the people all knew that when it finally did come true the prophecy would have lost its truth, it would have become a legend, a myth, a fairy tale.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarion went on to tell her about all the spells and magical objects and such that were hidden away until the time that they would be needed. He told about how the treasure, as it came to be called, had been lost. At this point Isabelle knew as much as Daniel, as much as the people of the town. Zarion paused, waiting for something, and Isabelle knew she could now speak freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A truly amazing tale, but what does it all have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, once the treasure was hidden away and the moment its location was lost, another prophecy was foretold, but very few heard it. It told of four children, well no, children is not the right word, young adults, teenagers. Their parents and others might see them as troublemakers or annoying. But in disobeying their parents, these four teenagers will find a treasure which has been lost for a century, defeat an evil sorcorer, bringing down his corrupt and sadistic empire, over come adversity, and and their dreams will be realized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't think that I am one of these four teenagers can you? And if so, where am I supposed to find the other three?\" Isabelle asked a little incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid that is all I can tell you about the prophecies. But if you would like, there are some things I can give you and a few things I can teach you to help you on your way.\"</span></div></div>",

She took his hand, and he led her to the waterfall. Then one at a time he pulled several objects from within his coat, pausing only to explain the purpose of each before placing them in a sack. \"This lantern is enchanted and its flame cannot be extinguished in even the harshest of weather. To ignite a brilliant light, all you need do is sprinkle a little soil in its center, then the kill the flame merely one drop of water is needed. Two blankets that cannot be damaged, they can however get rather filthy, so cleaning them will be necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are two seeds which even in utter darkness need only a few drops of water to instantly grow into plants bearing enough fruit to provide a meal for two to three people each. When you eat the fruit that grows from these seeds, be sure to save the seeds of the freshly grown seeds, for they will grow as fast and in as poor conditions as the seeds I now give you. Unfortunately, each new seed will grow slower than the one before it, so be prudent when you use them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is a flower whose petals contain healing powers. Crush the petal; if it is to be used to heal an open wound merely sprinkle in on; if it is for an interior ailment it must be mixed with the drinking water. This plant grows throught the Shadow Woods. Beware, for though its petals can heal, its leaves are poisonous. Any contact with the leaves will incapacitate the person for several days, and if contact lasts too long the person may die. Not even the healing petals can save someone from the poison of the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I have a couple words for you to memorize. First is 'fiyerona'. If you find yourself being pursued, sprinkle a little soil into the flame of the lantern and recite this word. Thereafter a thick fog will begin to eminate from the lantern. Its light will be able to penetrate the fog allowing you to see your way, but your pursuers will not be able to see and will get lost until the fog dissipates. Lastly is 'ayutalidae pricando'. If ever you find yourself in grave danger, call forth these words and where ever you are help will always be there.\" He handed her the sack and repeated the words another time to help Isabelle remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Zarion, your assistance will not be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now Princess, there are many trials ahead of you. Go, rest, I'm sure Daniel must be waiting for you.\" Isabelle cursied once more, and when she looked up Zarion had disappeared into the air once again. She turned around and after admiring the waterfall from inside the cave one last time she walked through to the suface to the lake. After her encounter, Isabelle was not in the least surprised that the path had again formed leading her back to the shore.</span></div></div>",

Thanks for the nudge.</span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you suggest my healing is anything like the magic you just performed? Most injuries do heal after all.\u201d What Daniel had seen Aurora do left him with a feeling of inadequacy. No matter what she said he couldn't believe that he and Isabelle could find this Treasure of Higani and Stop Radigan when her people, with all their magic, could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes injuries heal, but not so quickly. As I said, your injury would have kept anyone else in bed for at least another day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may be out of bed, but I am not healed yet. You could simply have been mistaken about the severity of my injuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She was not wrong about his injuries, and she was ready to bet that he had never been seriously ill before either. Aurora knew there was more to Daniel. More than he was yet willing to accept about himself, at least for the time being. So she decided not to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence for a few moments each considering the other and what hidden abilities might lie beneath the surface. A tickle in his throat caused Daniel to cough and ask for some water, breaking the heavy silence. Aurora collected a cup from the kitchen but did not fill it. Confused, Daniel watched as she instead place the conjured flower into the cup, muttered a word under breath, and the flower gradually became transparent and fell apart. All that remained in the cup was clear water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what Isabelle saw when she walked into the room at that moment: Daniel sitting on the floor staring in awe at a cup of water. \u201cDaniel, you\u2019re awake!\u201d Isabelle\u2019s voice seemed to snap Daniel out of his trance. The display of magic temporarily forgotten he rose to his feet to greet his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Isabelle clasped hands for a moment before he guided her to a seat on the floor beside the glass of water. \u201cCome Isabelle, you must see what Aurora can do with water.\u201d Still awed by the demonstration of power, Daniel had not at first noticed the sack slung over Isabelle\u2019s shoulder. Gesturing to the bag on her back he asked, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle\u2019s eyes flitted to the glass as she remembered the look on Daniel\u2019s face as she entered the room. Barely hearing his question, Isabelle asked one of her own, \u201cWhat do you mean what she \u2018can do with water\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither question was answered, however, for at that moment Aurora\u2019s father came storming in the room. His labored breathing only amplified the odd combination of shock and urgency on his face, each emotion struggling to overcome the other and claim control of his actions. The slamming of the door as it first rebounded off the wall then crashed closed again was nothing compared to the pounding of his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather, what has happened?\u201d Aurora leapt to her feet, quickly followed by the others.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenmar took three deep breaths, trying to gain control of his breathing and erratic heartbeat. As he began to calm down, his mixed facial expression finally settled on shock, making the kids think they would get an explanation for his explosive entrance. However, this was instantly replaced by a resurgence of urgency revealing that it was not yet ready to surrender to shock. Instead of an explanation, all they received were several broken and hurried phrases as Tenmar began rushing about the house placing objects in sacks and taking them out again, opening and closing and opening cabinets, and generally trying to move in every direction at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelongings.\u201d       \u201cPack quick.\u201d                \u201cNo time.\u201d      \u201cWhy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather stop!\u201d Aurora grabbed her father by the arm, bringing him to an abrupt halt and shoved the glass of water into his hand. \u201cDrink this and then just breath.\u201d He simply stared at the glass for a second as if he had no idea what it was; then he drank it all down before taking a single breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow father, please tell us what has happened.\u201d Tenmar dragged his hands over his face trying to wipe away his scattered thoughts and regain his composure. One final deep breath, his biggest yet, brought him almost completely to himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the waterfall.\u201d He opened his mouth to continue but must of thought better of what he was about to say for he immediately closed it again. Daniel and Isabelle looked at each other in bewilderment; while Aurora experienced a flicker of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be better if I showed you.\u201d And with that Tenmar gestured for them to follow him out the front door. They had no choice, so they followed him in silence out the door and to the water\u2019s edge where a bridge of lily pads had only minutes ago led Isabelle through the waterfall. No sign of that bridge now remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the village they could see people running about urgently gathering up children and animals and packing anything they could get their hands on much like Tenmar had begun to do back at his house. However, just as many were standing at the shore staring at the waterfall in shock. Daniel saw that same shocked expression on Aurora\u2019s face. He could even see a glimmer of shock on Isabelle\u2019s face, though not nearly as profound. Clearing something had changed for them, but all he saw was a modest looking waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle, on the other hand, knew that something about the waterfall wasn\u2019t quite right, even if you couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. It seemed to have lost some of its magnificence. It did not spray as much glistening mist into the air. It did not roar as loud as the water cascaded down from its heights. It did not shine with the same ethereal luminescence as it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can this be possible?\u201d Aurora asked, her voice hardly about a whisper. \u201cIt is too soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know child. Never the less we must prepare. We haven\u2019t a second to spare.\u201d Without another word Tenmar turned on his heel and headed home, intent written in his every move to complete the job he had begun of packing up his life. Arurora glanced once more at the waterfall, heaved a sigh, and followed her father. No closer to understanding the cloud of impending doom falling on the town, Daniel and Isabelle did the only thing they could and fell in step behind Aurora. They walking in silence all the way back tot eh house where they found Tenmar already at work packing. Aurora moved to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, but what exactly has happened?\u201d Daniel asked unable to stay in the dark any longer. Tenmar ignored the question as he continued shoving clothes into a bag. Aurora gesture them into a couple of chairs at the other end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll have to keep this short; we don\u2019t have as much time as we previously thought. Basically, the waterfall is dying.\u201d Daniel opened his mouth to ask what that meant, but Aurora raised her hand to indicate she would answer his question if he would only wait and continued, \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen Daniel, water here isn\u2019t always simply water. That waterfall was imbued with powerful magic a long time ago, long before I was born. It not only shields us from the outside world, but it is also the only means we have of escaping this world into another realm should the situation become too dire for us here. We should have had many more years, plenty of time for us all the eventually leave when we were ready or to find a way of saving this world. But tonight it is clear that in no time at all the water will stop flowing, and with it our chance of escape and our greatest protection. We will become painfully vulnerable.\u201d It was a lot of absorb, for all of them. Aurora had never fully reconciled herself to the idea of leaving this world, and now the moment had jumped up out of nowhere and grabbed hold of her. She had to leave \u2013 soon \u2013 probably before this night was over or else lose the chance forever. There just wasn\u2019t enough time to wrap her mind around the idea. Daniel was likewise having trouble wrapping his mind around the idea that a waterfall could be so important and that it could so suddenly, simply die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one idea, however, that Isabelle\u2019s mind could not let go of until she gave voice to it, \u201cBut the waterfall was just fine a few minutes ago when I went through it and talked to Zarion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Tenmar dropped a wooden bowl he was about to pack. It spun around like a top on the floor. Tenmar left it there completely forgotten as he stepped out of the kitchen and marched into the main room, his eyes glued to Isabelle. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Daniel and Isabelle had risen from the seats when Tenmar marched into the room. Barely two feet from Isabelle, Tenmar stared hard into her face. She was more than a little scared. What had she done to provoke him like this? Even Aurora could not remember the last time she had seen her father in such a state. He did not appear angry or violent in any way, but there was a quiet authority surging just behind his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quiet voice Isabelle tried to respond, \u201cI said that the waterfall looked fine when I went through it a few minutes ago and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd? And what?\u201d Tenmar prompted when her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I spoke with Zarion,\u201d Isabelle managed to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenmar looked thunderstruck. He took a step back shaking his head before falling into one of the chairs and gesturing to the kids to do the same. Aurora and Isabelle took their seats, but Daniel instead chose a standing position right beside the latter\u2019s chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not a name I thought I\u2019d hear again, especially not from one ignorant of our people.\u201d Tenmar shook his head again. His expression softened, he turned to Isabelle and asked, \u201cYou are sure you spoke to \u2018Zarion\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle nodded her assent. \u201cIn fact he gave me this bag and everything in it,\u201d she added, indicating the sack at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere of the room finally calmed, the air no longer suffocatingly thick with tension. For a few moments everything remained still \u2013 just breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Tenmar asked of Isabelle, all thoughts of packing washed away as footprints are by the tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait. Who is this Zarion?\u201d Daniel interjected before Isabelle could answer. Aurora, also in the dark about the identity of this man whose mere name could inspire such awe in her father, sat up straightened in her chair poised to hear every word.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\u201cApologies, of course the name must mean nothing to any of you,\u201d Tenmar began. \u201cI do no believe even you Aurora would recognize that particular name. For many years now he has been known by another. Let me begin by saying that what you have seen of our people and of those rare creatures that live within the boundaries of our lands is but a shadow of what once was. In the days of magic long since passed, our clan was called the Nikken. Our people could not only bend water to our will, but they could themselves become water. This gave them a unique connection with nature, as water flows through all things living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, as will happen, there were those who sought to use the abilities of the Nykken and others touched by magic for their own purposes. None were immune to the temptation of quick and easy personal gain. Many of species of animals with magical properties were hunted to extinction as people sought to harvest them for their magic. What you have seen here are some of the only ones lefts. The people of the Nykken and other magical clans were also sought out for their abilities. Some desired to buy their services, but some were willing to use force to gain the benefits of magic. Luckily there were those with the wisdom and strength to fight the temptation whenever and wherever they could. They managed to keep the worst from coming to pass long enough for things to change. By this I do not mean that avarice was exorcised from the hearts of men, instead the weapon of that avarice was blunted. Magic began to fade from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows what cause the Decline. Some say that magical bloodlines were diluted by unions between clans, both magical and human. Others say that the source of magic, the world\u2019s soul, was corrupted by the exploitation of magic. Whatever the case, those born with the gift were less powerful and less numerous than those who had come before. The Nykken retain their ability to manipulate water, albeit to a lesser extent, but they lost the ability to transform their own shape into water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was during this Decline of Magic when the prophecy was made about the rise of a powerful and evil magic in the distant future. The elders of what remained of the magical clans feared that if magic continued to fade as it was, then there would be none left to combat this evil. So they began gathering precious magicks to be hidden away and hopefully protected from the Decline until such time as they were needed. They worked tirelessly to gather all remaining powerful magicks they could find and to find a way to place all the necessary spells and charms needed to keep the cache magically sealed and undisturbed indefinitely. Most spells dissipate once their casters die, but the elders must have found a way around this. They labored the rest of their lives to make this happen, and their children spent most of their lives finishing the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenerations after the Treasure of Higani, as it had come to be called, named after the man who had foretold of the coming doom, had been safely sealed away, a child was born. His mother came from the Nykken, while his father was human. They named him Zarion. And he was no ordinary child By no means was he the first child born of parents from different clans; at that point clan names were rarely ever mentioned. Direct ties to specific clans were often tenuous and at times only symbolic. They could be used to trace family lineages for those who wished to learn about distant ancestors. Or they could be used to identify a type of magical ability, but with magic in decline and seen as something to be exploited, it became pointless and/or dangerous to be identified with any magical clan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat set Zarion apart was that even at t young age his abilities were stronger than others his age, and he demonstrated a greater control of those abilities. As he grew, so too did his powers, until one day in his teens it was discovered he could transfigure his body into water. Generations had passed since the last person known to have possessed this power, and she only ever used it a handful of times in her life, for each time she did it used so much of her strength that it took weeks for her to recover. And here was a boy to whom the transformation came as naturally as breathing, just as it had for the elders long before the Decline. People believed \u2013 or they hoped \u2013 this was a sign of the rebirth of magic into the world. But as the years passed, no children were born with powers comparable to Zarion. Child were still being born with magic, but their abilities remained ever declining remnants of what they once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen people finally gave up hope and recognized that magic continued to fade unabated, some become even more desperate to exploit those with magic. They felt it was their last chance before magic disappeared entirely. Many sought out Zarion; they pleaded, they bribed, they threatened, they tired everything to usurp his powers for their own aims. However, not only could Zarion use his power to hide himself form the desperate people, he also possessed an inspiring strength and purity of heart and mind which guided him down a path where he never let his power be abused for selfish reason, not even his own. Cut off from Zarion\u2019s powers, focus turned toward anyone else with a talent for magic. Even those born without any recognizable magical qualities were not safe if it was known they were descended from one of the magical clans. Many tried desperately to hide the fact that countless generations ago they had a family member with a hint of magic. Others left everything behind and went into hiding. An unlucky few were caused untold physical and mental anguish when they were punished for not being able to perform the feats demanded of them. And then there were the charlatans selling potions to cure this and that, trinkets to ward off evil or to attract good fortune, and spells to ignite love or to punish enemies; charlatans who only fueled the flames of desire of real magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally Zarion could no longer bear to see such suffering. So he gathered those who wanted to live peaceful and quiet lives safe from exploitation here at this lake. He cast a spell that would hide the village from the outside world. We cannot be detected by magical or nonmagical means. Strangers can neither stumble upon us on accident nor seek us out with greed in their hearts. Only those with pure intentions can find us. Such was the way of Zarion. Power is meant to protect life, not to control it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople from all clans gathered here to live safe and harmonious lives with others who have shared their pain, though even to this day we fear we will be discovered and once again made prey to man\u2019s depravities, which is why we continue to train in the ways of combat. But in the years after Zarion established Te\u2019alom the people here lived happy, unmolested lives and the outside world returned to normal mostly forgetting about magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough most of the world had forgotten about us, at the end of his life Zarion wanted to make sure we would continue to be protected even after he was gone. So Zarion climbed to the crest of the waterfall, which at the time was but a piddling stream, and he gave all that he had left. He transformed himself into water and gave every drop of his remaining life force to the waterfall. His very essence flows throughout the waterfall and lake. As long as that waterfall flows, his spells live on. One spell keeps us hidden, even from the arts of Radigan. Another spell opens a doorway through the waterfall to another realm where several villagers have already journeyed to prepare the way for the rest of us. Both spells are far beyond our ability to conjure. His incredible abilities and the wisdom with which he used those powers has earned him a title once reserved only for the counsel of elders who united and guided all magical clans in the long ago. A title by which he is still known today while his birth name has been all but forgotten. He is known as the Nyx.\u201d</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isabelle could scarcely believe there was so much she did not know about her own kingdom. Her tutors certainly never told her anything like this. As a child she had once delighted in witnessing the fantastical presentations of travelling magicians, but for years she had been old enough to know what these were mere legerdemain, clever tricks to deceive the senses. It was color entertainment, nothing more. But just imagine, magic \u2013 real magic \u2013 had not only existed but had once thrived in these lands, and if they succeeded perhaps it could again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had always thought of the Nyx as some incredible character of legend,\u201d Aurora mused. \u201cHe was so powerful and did so much, he felt little more than a myth. I knew he had once been flesh and blood, but I never considered who he was as a person or what kind of life he had led before he gave himself to the waterfall. And to think you actually met him Isabelle.\u201d Aurora\u2019s eyes refocused as she lifted them from the floor to gaze at Isabelle as if reappraising her in a new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for Daniel to fully process. It went against so much of what he believed the world to be. He wanted to confront this new version of the world, but he didn\u2019t know how. First he had to let everything sink in. Once he could examine everything he had heard he\u2019d know where to begin. So Daniel kept his mouth shut and his mind open. He was particularly interested in hearing what Isabelle had to say about meeting this so called Nyx. It sounded like yet another unbelievable tale, and yet there was something about that name \u2013 the Nyx \u2013 that ticked at the back of his mind buried somewhere deep beneath all this information \u2013 the old as well as the new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments Isabelle closed her eyes, focusing solely on the sensation of her breathing. Feeling her lungs expand and contract as she breathed in the fresh air. Isabelle summoned up the final reserves of her energy. Dawn had come and gone as they listened to the story of how young Zarion became the Nyx. After leaving Melish in the woods yesterday morning she had fought brigands, entered a world beyond a waterfall, spoken with a legend, heard a tale which strained her imagination, and slept not a wink. But she could not sleep yet; first she must repay a story with a story. So she opened her eyes, and, beginning with the voice whispering her name and the formation of the bridge of leaves, Isabelle told of her encounter with Zarion the Nyx, while three sets of ears eagerly listened to her tale, enraptured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At the same time five knights attempted pursuit of the wayward princess and stableboy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis simply is not possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Andrew?\u201d asked the second of the three knights trudging through the Dracoon forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third knight jumped out of the brush onto the hard packed dirt, cheering, \u201cHallelujah. Look Bernard, an actual path!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching by the path, examining the tracks in the dirt, Andrew felt like doing anything but cheering. \u201cThis path should not be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more bugs and mud in my boots, the third continued to cheer as he found a tree stump by the edge of the path to sit on while he shook said bugs and dirt from first one boot then the other. \u201cNo more branches swinging out of nowhere to strike me in my face. No more roots rising from the group to trip my feet. No more \u2013 \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJonothan, enough,\u201d Bernard demanded. Though still smiling, Jonothan kept quiet. Returning his attention to Andrew, Bernard asked, \u201cWhat is wrong with this path?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should not be here,\u201d Andrew reiterated. They had been forced to abandon their horses where they came upon a section of the road which had been damaged by a rockslide. The horses could not safely cross the debris and that particular part of the forest terrain was too dense and hazardous for the horses. They were branded with the royal seal and the knights had no doubt they would quickly be found and returned to the castle. The three knights had cautiously gone around the debris on foot and continued journeying on the main road until they were attacked by wild dogs, forcing them into the woods. They escaped the dogs and immediately retraced their steps but were unable to find the path. Orienting himself based on the moss growing on the trees and other nature landmarks he had learned over the course of a lifetime spent developing a thorough understanding of the land, Andrew had pointed them in the direction they needed to travel: east. They bedded down that night somewhere in the woods. They spent several hours hiking and being driven off course by animal attacks the next day before eventually coming to the river that flowed from one end of the forest to the other, they followed its path believing it would soon guide them to out of the forest. But night fell and once again they were diverted from their course when attacked by other forest predators. Once again, however minutely they tried to retrace their steps, they could not return to the river. They lost the river, but had somehow stumbled upon this path. \u201cThe river only comes close to one forest path: the main road, and they only approach each other in one area of the forest. The river takes a more direct route through the forest, but it so passes through some of the more dangerous parts of the forest which the established paths all try to avoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps this is merely an animal poor or migratory path. Or it could be a path newly formed since last you visited these woods,\u201d Bernard suggested, hoping the answer could be so simple. The truth is he hadn\u2019t felt right in these woods, as if a cold breath had been working its way up his spine which he now felt clearly on the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Andrew insisted. \u201cDespite being diverted by those animal attacks, I have kept us moving in a more or less easterly direction towards the opposite end of the woods from where we entered. Look around, doesn\u2019t this look familiar?\u201d Bernard and Jonothan looked around. They couldn\u2019t be sure if it did indeed look familiar or if they were just incapable of telling one tree apart from any other tree. Few people had spent as much time studying the natural landscape of the of the kingdom as Andrew; Bernard and Jonothan did not count among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the main road we left yesterday. At this precise spot. This is where we were chased off by those dogs. These are our footprints leaving and road and running into the woods. Either I have gotten lost for perhaps the first time in my life, or something unnatural in this forest has led us back here.\u201d Looking at each other, Andrew and Bernard were at a loss. Neither man suspicious by nature, but both men had learned to trust their instincts, instincts that now told them something was wrong and this forest was not what it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver one to jump feet first without thinking, Jonothan chimed in with a comment he thought sure to break the tension with a laugh or a smile at least, \u201cMaybe it was Melish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be s \u2013 \u201d Bernard began to say only to be quickly shushed by Andrew. With one hand raised warning Bernard and Jonothan to remain still and quiet, Andrew\u2019s other hand gestured to the woods directly opposite. Thus on alert, they immediately identified what had drawn Andrew\u2019s attention: at distinct rustling of the underbrush suggesting movement of a living creature or creatures, the volume of which indicated something fairly sizable. As the sound neared, the three knights readied themselves not looking forward to yet another animal attack. They placed hands on the hilts of their swords, silently freeing them from their scabbards, and adjusted their positions, prepared to either fight or flee the moment they ascertained the nature of the unknown danger before them. Tensed for action they watched as two figures leaped from behind the cover of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the glint of sunlight off of scabbards alarmed the three knights, but those fears were quickly allayed when they recognized the faces of two comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThomas, Donovan,\u201d Bernard began to greet his fellow knights only to be interrupted by a call of \u201cto arms\u201d from the former. As one all five knights drew their swords and faced the woods from whence Thomas and Donovan had emerged. They listened. Indeed there was again the sound of rustling in the underbrush before them. Though lighter than the recent sounds of the knights\u2019 boots, it was unmistakably the sound of something alive moving just beyond their view. However, the sound was moving neither toward nor away from them. Instead it seemed to be pacing. So they waited with drawn swords for the creature to decide its next move. After a time the decision was made clear when the noise began to fade as the animal drifted away and the men heard the frustrated howl of a wild animal denied its prey. Evidently, while confronting two men amounted to sport, facing five armed men proved too great a risk for the animal. The threat gone, swords were sheathed and greetings were resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are well met gentlemen,\u201d greeted one of the two newcomers. \u201cHe had been harried by those beasts most of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good to see you Thomas,\u201d Bernard replied. \u201cYou as well Donovan,\u201d he greeted the second. \u201cBut when we parted at the fork I did not expect to see you so soon. Have you some news of the Princess?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIndeed we do. The day after we parted we reached a small village where, after questioning several villagers who had seen nothing of the princess or her faithful stable boy, we encountered an old woman who had. She described the children so precisely she must have seen them. According to this woman they entered these woods shortly before dark the first day of their absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe immediately turned around and returned to the fork. There we discovered your horses and the note saying you continued on foot. Hoping to catch up to you quickly we hastened our pace and chose to press on when it grew dark. Like you we abandoned our horses at the rockslide, but as soon as we left the road we were attacked by wild dogs. Besieged and lost ever since, this is the first time we\u2019ve managed to find the road again,\u201d Thomas explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Donovan insisted with his hands raised palms forward before him. \u201cIt is not my fault we got lost. We all know Andrew is the tracker of the group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d Thomas agreed, \u201cHow comes it that you three are still in these woods? If I am correct this road shouldn\u2019t take more than a day, even on foot, to traverse. It\u2019s now been nearly two since you began.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to hide his chagrin, Andrew defended himself by ominously stating, \u201cThere are forces at work in these woods which defy nature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot speak for the unnatural forces, but the natural ones have definitely led us astray,\u201d Bernard offered in conciliatory tones. \u201cWe have, like you, been attacked on numerous occasions by the predators of the forest. So unpredictable have been their attacks, it has been difficult to gain our bearings. It seems they have been leading us in circles for the better part of a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you Bernard,\u201d Andrew insisted, \u201ceven with the constant animal attacks, I would know if we were travelling in circles. We may have returned to where we began, but I guarantee we have been travelling steadily east since leaving this road from this spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan did not attempt to hide his mirth. \u201cFinally, the great tracker Andrew has gotten lost,\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Donovan\u2019s pointed beaming, Bernard addressed his concerns to Thomas, \u201cWhether we got lost or not, I have not felt at ease in these woods since we were forced to abandon our horses. If I were a more superstitious man I might accept Jonothan\u2019s suggestion that we are being led astray by Melish himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonothan replied, \u201cThe keeper of the forest, or so the legend goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the Lady Dracoon was supposed to be the keeper. It is called the Dracoon Forest, is it not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe woods are named for the Lady,\u201d continued Jonothan, who always enjoyed telling a good story, \u201cbut it is said that when Melish was cursed to the shadows, she named him keeper of her woods, giving him dominion over all within the forest boundaries. She may even have blessed him with the use of magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy was he cursed?\u201d Donovan asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone really knows. Except of course for Melish and whoever conjured the curse. All I know is that supposedly even the Lady Dracoon hasn\u2019t been able to lift it. Now he spends his time living in harmony with nature; protecting travellers from the animals, and protecting the animals from hunters. Usually he guides lost travellers out of the forest. But I\u2019ve never heard of him trapping them inside. Perhaps we have done something to displease him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were engrossed in the tale, almost believing, but Thomas had heard enough. \u201cEnough of these silly legends, we have a job to do. Let\u2019s focus on what is real and in front of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not be so quick to disregard \u2018silly legends\u2019,\u201d Bernard advised. \u201cLegends may be intangible, exaggerated stories from our past, but every legend is a great tree frown from a very real seed of truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd watered by the faith of gullible fools,\u201d Thomas countered. \u201cThey are meaningless stories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not underestimate the power of story,\u201d persisted Bernard. \u201cSometimes it is all we have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Trying to put an end to the discussion, Thomas began walking down the path joking over his shoulder, \u201cNow can we get back to work before the imaginary cursed man from Jonothan\u2019s fairytale arrives to whisk us away to the bottom of the lake or up into the clouds to a birthday party for Father Time where \u2013 \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis diatribe was cut off by a resounding crack echoed by a splintering of wood and rounded off with a deafening crash as an ancient and enormous tree fell across the path immediately before Thomas forcing him to leap back several feet or else be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~  *  ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was awfully close wasn\u2019t it my dear Melish?\u201d her melodious voice asked as a woman appeared by Melish\u2019s side hidden in the shadows of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a noticeable jerk of Melish\u2019s body as the Lady Dracoon\u2019s disembodied voice preceded the appearance of her body. \u201cM\u2019lady, I would never have allowed the tree to harm him, in accordance with your wishes, but he could do with a splinter or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Dracoon smiled as she wrapped her arm in Melish\u2019s. \u201cSir Thomas is a brave man, but much of that courage comes from his faith in his ability to control his own destiny. He is not ready to accept the existence of those of us so far beyond his control. Have you enjoyed toying with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has given me an opportunity to learn more about the character of each man. I can see why King Edward would trust his daughter\u2019s safety to them. If what I have heard whispered on the wind is true, she will need their help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she will,\u201d the Lady conferment, clasping Melish\u2019s hand in her own,\u201d but not yet. Keep in the woods overnight. Let them continue on their way in the morning. One more day head start will give the children the time to get to where they need to be unhindered without getting too far away from the aid of the knights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish M\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Melish.\u201d She hesitated and looked into his eyes. \u201cIf events unfold as we would wish, it will bring us a step closer to freeing you as I promised.\u201d After briefly squeezing his hand, the Lady Dracoon vanished as quickly as she had appeared, leaving Melish to return his attention to the five formidable knights.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Distraught, the queen sat on a chaise lounge in the sitting room of their private suite of rooms. The king paced the room, caught between his own distress and his desire to comfort his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has been two days, Edward. Where is she?\u201d Queen Jasmine demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my dear. They can\u2019t have gotten far. The knights will find her and bring her home,\u201d King Edward insisted, kneeling before his wife and covering her hands in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known better, that she wasn\u2019t ready for marriage,\u201d she chastised herself as fresh tears began to fall from her bloodstained eyes. \u201cI knew she wouldn\u2019t have been happy with the idea of getting married so soon, but I never thought she\u2019d run away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that Jasmine,\u201d Edward consoled, gently wiping the tears from her cheeks. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have known she would overhear our conversation. Nothing had even been decided yet. We were just talking. She knows we would not force her. That we only want what is best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she? Does she really? Oh Edward, if anything were to happen to her\u2026\u201d Unable to finish the thought, Jasmine attempted to choke back a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not think such thoughts. Of course Isabelle knows we love her. And weren\u2019t you the one telling me what a responsible young man that Daniel is. Surely he is looking after her. And if the knights have not yet found her, they will soon.\u201d It was hard for Edward to see the woman he loved like this. His own eyes began to mist; he fought the tears, fought to stay strong as a husband, as a father, as a king. But the idea that something could happen to his daughter nearly broke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why haven\u2019t we heard anything? Maybe we should send out more knights,\u201d the queen begged. At that moment was a mother first and queen second. For a queen must not beg, but, for the sake of a child, a mother will do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must be patient. Of all our knights, I have sent the very greatest.\u201d He knew this was true. There were perhaps none other to whom he would trust the life of his daughter. And yet, no matter what precautions taken, what parent ever feels they have done enough to protect their child? Especially now that reports had reached the castle that Radigan\u2019s forces were approaching his kingdom\u2019s border. Even if he felt these five knights might fail, he could not spare another man. They all needed to prepare for war.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  After helping Tenmar pack the few things he planned on bringing through the portal, Daniel and Isabella quietly followed behind Aurora and her father. No one spoke on their walk down to the lakeside. Isabella had a feeling that Aurora, while still determined to stay and help, was starting to realize just what staying meant. Her father on the other hand was proud of his daughter and her will to stay and fight Radigan. He would have stayed himself, but because he was to take over as elder, he knew that the village would need him more than ever on the other side. As they reached the lake front they saw several of the other townspeople gathered around the lake. They had already finished packing and were waiting for the Elder to open the portal. Daniel and Isabella looked around and saw an older man approach the water. When he reached the edge he stopped and knelt to touch the water. As he did so, he muttered something, than backed away. Isabella watched as for the second time that night, all the plant life gathered together to form a walkway. Daniel stood awestruck, as this was his first time seeing this and magic still fascinated him. As soon as the path was completed people began moving across it and into the waterfall. Tenmar told them to wait there for a bit as he went to speak to the elder. When he returned the elder was with him.<br>\r\n\"So Princess Isabella, I hear that you had the honor of speaking with the Nyx.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes sir, he told me of the treasure my friend and I are after, as well as some of the prophecies behind it.\"<br>\r\n He then walk over to Aurora and asked \"What is this about you wanting to stay behind?\"<br>\r\n \"I am tired of our people running from Radigan, sir. Someone is finally standing up against him, and I want to help them.\"<br>\r\n\"You always were a strong willed one, I wish you luck on your journey.\"<br>\r\n\"And you must be Daniel. I do hope you have learned not to laugh at magic,\" the old man said with a grin. Embarrassed, Daniel replied that he had. After the elder had spoken to Aurora her father had taken her closer to the water to speak to her alone. While they were talking, the elder turned to Daniel and Isabella with a stern look on his face. \"I know that Aurora won't be dissuaded from helping, so I want you to both promise me to watch after my grand-daughter.\"<br>\r\n  Shocked, Isabella and Daniel gave him their word to do so and turned back to a softly crying Aurora.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"What is it father, what did you want to say?\" Aurora asked.<br>\r\nHer father had turned and knelt in front of her, \"You still have time to come with us. I understand why you want to stay, but as my daughter I will miss you.\"<br>\r\n\"Father, I will miss you too, but I feel that my place is here.\" <br>\r\n\"If that is how you feel, than I want you to have this.\"<br>\r\nAs he said this, he reached around his neck and removed a silver chain necklace with a blue gem that almost seemed to glow.<br>\r\n As he took it off,Aurora gasped, before saying,\"I cannot take mothers necklace.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you can,\" her father replied,\"because she had told me to give it to you when you were older. I know I may not act like it sometimes, but I am very proud of you and I know she would be too.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n By that time most of the villagers had made their way through the waterfall and there was a bright pulse that emanated from it. Turning to it the Elder and Tenmar walked along it. Before they passed through it, they turned and shouted to the three,\"Good luck, help yourself to whatever you need in the village, and be sure to check in my cabin. Though I would hurry and move on before morning comes.\"<br>\r\n  \"Before they went through, Aurora quickly shouted,\"I love you father and grandpapa.\"<br>\r\nAs they walked through they returned the sentiments, and there was a blinding flash.</span></div></div>",

This drew all of the knights attention from what they had been doing.<br>\r\n  As usual, Jonothan was the first to speak up, shouting.\" What was that!\"<br>\r\n  Bernard was the first to reply,saying\" In all of my travels I have never seen anything like that.\"<br>\r\n  After he spoke all of the knights stopped to see if anything else would happen. While they stood still, they each felt something shift in the air.<br>\r\n  \"Did you feel that?\",Thomas asked the group.<br>\r\n  \"It felt like some kind of breeze blew past.\" Donovan said.<br>\r\n  \"That wasn't any kind of breeze I'm familiar with. It wasn't the air moving, but something else.\" Bernard said.<br>\r\n  \"Whatever it was we need to keep moving, we lost to much time in that blasted forest.\" Andrew said, snapping the others out of their wonder.<br>\r\n  Thomas stood up and said,\"He's right, we'll have plenty  of time to talk about this later. Now we just need to move.\"<br>\r\n  They had not made it much farther when they stopped again, this time to inspect several bodies they saw on the road.<br>\r\n  As they search the bodies, Donovan called Bernard over and asked him,\"Have you seen this emblem before?\"<br>\r\n  \"Indeed I have. This is the emblem that slavers from the south use. Though they almost never come this way.\"<br>\r\n  \"Men, I fear you all have seen this emblem.\" Thomas said gravely as he held up a piece of cloth bearing their kingdoms seal.\"Andrew see which way the Princess might have gone.\"<br>\r\n  It didn't take long for Andrew to find a path of disturbed brush to indicate which way they had gone. Donovan pointed out that this is the direction they had seen the flash. Worried what this might mean, they entered the forest with Andrew leading the way.</span></div></div>",

Isabella looked over to Aurora, before asking,\"Are you going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n  Aurora nodded, then quickly turned away from the lakeside and began walking to one of the villages huts. Daniel and Isabella quickly followed after her.<br>\r\n  \"We need to hurry now, Radigan will have felt that burst of magic and will definitely be curious as to what it was. I don't know what my grandfather has in his house, but it must be important. He almost never let anyone in there, even my father has only been inside it once.\"<br>\r\n  Upon arriving at the hut, Aurora lightly pushed the door open. The inside of it looked like some sort of wizard's tower from different stories Isabella had been told about when she was younger. There were bottles of all sorts all over the place, and two of the walls were covered entirely by book cases. While most of the place was a mess there was one table in the center with a satchel and a book on it. Aurora walked over to it and began to read aloud a note that was next to the book.<br>\r\n  \"These should help you get along on your journey Aurora and friends. Use it wisely and make haste.<br>\r\n  Love, your Grandfather<br>\r\nAlso, I always knew you would do great things someday.\"<br>\r\n  After she read the note and Isabella was next to her she opened the bag to reveal that it was full of gold coins. Daniel had opened up the book to reveal a map. After examining it for a moment and comparing it to their book, he came to the conclusion that it was a map of the area they were in with a red line going across. He looked on the front of the book, and saw the title embossed on the front in gold,\"The Treasure of Higani\".<br>\r\n  \"This should help out too.\" He said as Isabella and Aurora came to look at it.<br>\r\n  Aurora pointed to a spot on the map, near the edge of the page, and said \"We are about here.\"<br>\r\n  Turning the page to see if the map was continued on the next page, Isabella sighed and asked,\"How can it help if it doesn't show the rest of the map?\"<br>\r\n \"I don't know, but lets hold onto it anyway.\" Daniel replied.</span></div></div>",

As they began walking through the woods, Aurora stopped and looked back. She felt a hand on her shoulder and turned back to see Daniel and Isabella looking at her.<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry I'm fine,\" she said as she started walking again,\"we need to get away from here though.\"<br>\r\n  They began to walk through the forest, with Aurora leading the way back to the path that was on the map. They walked on in silence for an hour before Daniel broke it and asked. \"What are we going to do when we get back to the path?\"<br>\r\n  \"According to the map in the book you were heading the right way before you came across me so I think that  we should go back to that path and keep going.\" Aurora told them. Silence took over again as the three walked through the forest for a few more hours. Finally they broke through the tree line and began walking along the road again. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  \"I don't understand why we had to go back into another forest, I mean we just got out of one that tried to keep us in it.\" Jonothan said.<br>\r\n  The five of them were following Andrew as he lead them through the forest.<br>\r\n  \"At least this forest doesn't have some fairy tale to go with it.\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n  \"Actually while its not a legend there have been strange occurrences in this forest.\" Bernard said.<br>\r\n  \"Like what?\" Andrew asked.<br>\r\n  \"Most of the hunters I know say that after walking through the forest long enough they end up at the same spot on the road they had left. They said that some of them have even tried to walk straight forward and the same thing happens.\" Jonothan said.<br>\r\n  \"So they basically get turned around?\" Donovan asked.<br>\r\n  Andrew wasn't happy to hear this and told the rest,\"Don't worry we are following their path perfectly. Though it looks like they have a companion now, and that two of them are almost dragging the other.\"<br>\r\nBy this time the knights were halfway to the abandoned village.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  Isabella, Daniel, and Aurora found themselves in another predicament. It was almost noon now and they had covered a good distance, but they were at another fork in the road. One went east to the city of Arrya. The other went north through the plains region, before leading into the mountains bordering Radigan's realm.<br>\r\n  \"Which way do you think we should go?\" Aurora asked, looking at the two paths confused.<br>\r\n  Daniel had pulled the book out, and started flipping through the pages when he stopped and said \"Amazing\". Seeing the amazement on his face, Isabella asked \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n  He only responded by turning the book around and holding it out to the others. Isabella and Aurora looked to see that Daniel was holding the book open to the map page, but the map had changed. It now showed the area they were in, and the path was leading to Arrya.<br>\r\n  \"And so the magic continues.\" Daniel said as he puts the book up and they head down the path to Aryya.</span></div></div>",

Daniel entered to ask about some rooms, while Aurora and Isabella waited outside. While they waited Aurora spoke.<br>\r\n  \"What are you going to do if someone in this town recognizes you?\"<br>\r\n  \"I don't know, but the only people who might realize its me is the baron or his family, and I plan to avoid that part of town.\" When she had finished speaking Daniel had returned and told them the rooms were ready. They followed him back in and turned in for the night.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  The next morning as the three ate a light breakfast in a corner of the inn, they poured over the book. The map had again changed, this time showing the layout of the city. There was no red path on the map though. Instead the entire city was covered in a shading the same color red. Daniel was the first to speak up, saying,\"What does this mean? Is their a clue or something in the city?\"<br>\r\n  \"Maybe what ever it is will come to us, and all we have to do is wander around the city.\" Aurora practically stated.<br>\r\n  They agreed that they would need to gather some more things before they went further on their quest, so they went to the market district to purchase supplies.<br>\r\n  Upon arriving there they found that the streets were already crowded and began making their way through the clustered streets.<br>\r\n  Isabella was leading with Aurora following her and Daniel behind them. Isabella was carrying the bag Zarion had given her, Aurora had the coin purse, and Daniel had a back pack with the book and the things they would need to travel. As they made their way through the streets a young man bumped into Aurora and stealthily reached into her bag. He was interrupted when another hand grasped his wrist and pulled his hand out of her bag. The would be thief looked up to see Daniel looking down at him. Daniel told the thief,\"What is ours stays with us.\" After he said this he held his hand open underneath the thief's, and giving a light squeeze coaxed him to open his hand dropping several gold coins.  Daniel turned and handed them to Aurora, then turned back to the thief and said,\"Don't try anything like that again.\" He then released him and watched as the young thief ran and disappeared into the crowd.<br>\r\n  \"Thanks for that Daniel.\" Aurore said as Daniel turned back to them.<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry about it. I might just be a stablehand but I know when to be on the lookout.\"<br>\r\n  Isabella looked in the direction the thief had went. She then said,\"We should go, just in case he doesn't listen to your warning.\"<br>\r\n  With that said they continued on through the market.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIn an alley in the market place Anton sat on a ledge, confused and angry at himself for being caught,\"This is the first time I've been caught.\" Anton hadn't  been in this trade for very long, only about a year, but he was always cautious and his small stature always helped him move towards and away from intended victims. But there was something else that was bothering him. The other girl that was with them looked familiar somehow.<br>\r\n  \"Your not still hiding away in here because one person caught you, are you?\" A male voice asked. Anton looked towards the street to see his uncle and mentor, Ronald walking into the alley.<br>\r\n  \"No sir, there was just something odd about one of them. The other girl looked oddly familiar.\"<br>\r\n  \"I wouldn't worry about it, you remember just about everything you see so you've probably seen her before, just not up close.\"<br>\r\n  \"I'm gonna go look for them. I'm curious now and if I see them again I might remember.\" Anton told his uncle, getting up.<br>\r\n  \"Are you sure that is a good idea Anton. What if one of them sees you?\" Ronald asked, only slightly worried.<br>\r\n  \"You taught me well enough to know that won't happen.\" Anton said, before going into the street.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  The three had finished their trip to the market and were making their way back to the inn to discuss what to do next. They arrived and as they were about to enter Daniel stopped and turned around, then told Isabella and Aurora to wait and look around.<br>\r\n  Anton was on a rooftop across the street when the three stopped and looked around. As the familiar girl turned and he saw her face clearly he immediately remembered from where he had seen her.<br>\r\n  Isabella stopped and looked around, and then looked up only to see someone ducking down out of sight on the roof. She whispered to Daniel and Aurora,\"It's that thief from earlier. I'm going to try to get him to come down, Daniel don't do anything okay.\"<br>\r\n  \"What if he tries to hurt you, though.\"<br>\r\n  \"Just let him come down, he must have a reason for following us.\" Isabella replied. <br>\r\n  With that said, Isabella called out.\"You can come out, my friend won't hurt you.\" There wasn't any response for a moment, then they heard someone say \"You promise?\"<br>\r\n  Isabella looked at Daniel who nodded, before replying,\"We promise.\"<br>\r\n  After he climbed down the four went into a single room at the inn. After they had the shut the door, Anton spoke,\"Are you Princess Isabella?\"<br>\r\n  Taken aback, Daniel asked,\"I'm sorry what did you say?\"<br>\r\n  \"Don't try to play dumb. I know she is. I remember almost everything I see and I remember her.\" He said to Daniel.<br>\r\n  \"Ok you know who I am, but how do you know me?\" Isabella asked.<br>\r\n  \"That is a long story, but I guess we have time.\" Anton said as he went to sit down.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  Anton was running as fast as he could from the other boys. He always was their favorite target, mainly because he was much smaller. He was tired of them picking on him, and he was getting exhausted from running. As he turned a corner he looked around for somewhere to hide. Seeing an alley he hoped he could make it before anyone saw him. Running into it, his hopes of escape were dashed as he heard someone yell \"He went into the alley.\" It wasn't long before he was cut off and surrounded. He cringed and closed his eyes to wait when he heard a girl yell \"Leave that kid alone!\" Both Anton and has attackers looked to the voice to see a girl about two years older than Anton standing in the street staring at the older boys.<br>\r\n  The leader of the group asked \"And what will you do if we don't?\"<br>\r\n  \"I'll get Daniel to make you.\" was her reply, just as a boy the same age as the others walked up beside her.<br>\r\n  The leader then told his gang,\"Come on, lets teach these people a lesson. Starting with this Daniel.\" After they had left Anton, the girl ran up to him and asked \"Are you ok?\" He only nodded to her as he heard Daniel yell \"And don't try to pick on him again.\" After he stood back up and went back to the street, they all heard the sound of several armored footsteps against the road, and then someone calling for the Princess Isabella. He looked at her in shock as she said \"Oh no they've figured out I've gone away again. Come on Daniel we've been found,\" then turning back towards Anton said,\"You be careful and don't let them just pick on you.\" After she said this, she and the boy ran off towards the incoming guards.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  \"That was two years ago, when I was twelve.\"<br>\r\n  \"I remember now!\" Isabella exclaimed.<br>\r\n  Daniel then asked \"Did they try to mess with you again?\"<br>\r\n  \"No, they left me alone after that encounter.\"<br>\r\n  Aurora, who had been silent until then, asked \"But why did you try to rob us, where are your parents?\"<br>\r\n  Anton visibly winced at this and Aurora quickly added \"you don't have to tell us if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n  \"No, it's okay. They both came down with a fever a year ago, and didn't recover. My uncle takes care of me now, but he is poor and has to steal to survive. He taught me everything I know.\"<br>\r\n  As Isabella and Aurora talked to Anton and told him of their quest, Daniel had taken out the book and turned to the map. He called them all over to look as the map had again changed, this time leading down the path they had taken to Arrya and through the plains region.<br>\r\n  \"Aurora, Isabella come look at this. The map has changed again.\"<br>\r\n  \"What could have caused it to change again?\" Aurora thought out loud.<br>\r\n  Anton was curious by now and as he came around to look at the book, a look of understanding came across Daniel's face. \"Anton your fourteen now right.\"<br>\r\n  Nodding Anton replied \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n  Turning to Isabella he asked her \"What was that other prophecy Zarion told you of?\"<br>\r\n  \"The one about the four teenagers who will find the treasure?\" she asked.<br>\r\n  \"Do you really think that I am this fourth person.\" Anton asked.<br>\r\n  \"I don't see why not,\" Aurora said,\"the map only showed the city of Arrya when we last checked it, and now it shows that we must backtrack.\"<br>\r\n  \"Ok, if you are sure and its okay with all of you I'll come with you. You wait here while I gather some things and tell my uncle.\" he said, then left wondering what to tell his uncle.</span></div></div>",

Deep inside the cave there was another opening which showed a similar scene, but this village was not abandoned.<br>\r\n  He stood there with an unwavering gaze, as if waiting for something to appear. There was a brief gust of air, and without even looking away Zarion said \"I am not as easy to sneak up on as others, Lady Dragoon.\"<br>\r\n  A form gathered from nowhere beside Zarion and said \"It was worth a try.\" as the shape of the old woman fully appeared.<br>\r\n  \"You can also drop your guise, the spell protecting the village may have ended, but this cave is permanently enchanted to block any outside view.\" He told her as he turned and showed her to the chairs that he and Isabella had sat in. She nodded then concentrated a moment, her form fading out and then back. Standing where the old woman had been was a tall, beautiful woman with long white hair that was giving off a soft aura. He offered her a seat. As they both sat down Zarion spoke \"I presume you are here about the Princess and her friend.\"<br>\r\n  \"Indeed. I assume you know about the knights that were sent to recover her?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes, and I am already planning was to stall them. But I fear there is a new player. The magic wave that came from the portal collapsing has gotten Radigan's attention, and by my guess some creature under his control will arrive very shortly after the knights.\"<br>\r\n  Alarmed by this news Lady Dragoon asked \"Will the knights be able to handle it?\"<br>\r\n  \"I believe they can, but I have some surprises planned just in case.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  As the knights walked out of the forest they looked around amazed at the village hidden in the forest.<br>\r\n  Thomas was the first to speak, saying \"Donovan, Jonothan you two go to the left. Andrew, Bernard you go right. I'll check this building. Meet back in five.\" The others moved off to search their designated part of the town. Thomas walked into the elder's home, where he found a piece of parchment on a table in the middle. Upon inspecting the parchment he saw handwriting he recognized as the Princess's. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  To the five knights,<br>\r\nIf you are reading this, than you are on the right track. Daniel, Aurora, and I have set out again. Aurora is a girl from this village who is coming with Daniel and I to aid us on our quest. You must keep following us, but you can't and won't stop us on our journey. I have a feeling that we will need your aid on our return trip. I am also writing this to let you know that I am fine, and that Daniel has been doing a fine job guarding me and keeping me safe.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPrincess Isabella<br>\r\n  After reading the note Thomas quickly looked around for any more ideas as to where they could have gone. Seeing none he returned outside. While waiting for the others it finally struck him as odd how he had not seen a single person, besides the knights. As he pondered this, the other four knights returned. They all had the same news.<br>\r\n  \"Every where we looked was the same scene. The people who lived here had to pack in a hurry, but no signs of fighting of any kind.\" Donovan said.<br>\r\n  \"Same thing for our side of the village, but no sign of the Princess.\" Bernard said.<br>\r\n  \"I found this note from the Princess so we are on their tail. And it seems that they have a companion.\" Thomas told the others as he passed the note around.<br>\r\n  When the note got to Jonothan he grinned and said \"I knew that giving that Daniel boy a little bit of training would help someday.\"<br>\r\n  The others looked at him and Andrew said \"You did what?\"<br>\r\n  Jonothan nonchalantly replied \"Oh quit your worrying, it was just some sword and hand to hand stuff. I figure as much time as the Princess spends around him he might as well know how to properly fight.\"<br>\r\n  \"I can't believe you gave a stableboy any amount of knight training.\" Andrew said in disbelief.<br>\r\n  Their arguing was stopped by Donovan who held his finger over his mouth, then said \"Listen\"<br>\r\n  Stopping what they were doing they heard a faint screeching sound that was quickly getting louder. They all recognized the sound and looked up to see ten winged creatures, each about seven feet tall overhead, slowly circling towards the ground. Thomas whispered \"Gargoyles, what are they doing here?\"<br>\r\n  \"Radigan probably sent them here for some reason.\" Bernard said.<br>\r\n  \"Then lets take them out so they can't report back\" Jonothan said as he drew his sword.<br>\r\n  \"I agree with Jonothan, for once.\" Thomas whispered.<br>\r\n  \"Great, get ready, I'll get their attention.\" Jonothan replied, before looking into the sky and yelling \"Down here.\" This got there attention as they looked down and one dived towards Jonothan. As it sped towards him he readied himself and as it reached him he quickly ran it through and spun out of the way as the creatures corpse hit the ground hard then pulled his sword out laughing. There was a thud behind him and he quickly dodged a blow from another gargoyle. The others had landed and were fighting the knights. Despite being outnumbered the knights fought off and killed the rest of the gargoyles.<br>\r\n  Their fighting had taken them closer to the waters edge of the lake, and after the last one had fallen the knights made their way to the lake to clean their blades.<br>\r\n  After they had done that, they sat to rest for a moment. As they sat looking over the lake they all heard a faint whispering come across the water.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  \"How much do you think I should tell them?\" Zarion asked. <br>\r\n  \"I would tell them of the quest and its importance. And about how they will be needed soon.\" Lady Dragoon said.<br>\r\n  \"Very well then.\" Zarion said before whispering the story to the knights.</span></div></div>",

They had made great time the first day, making their way back up the road that led to Arrya and starting through the  the plains region. This region was responsible for most of the kingdoms food supply. The view was unobstructed for miles, and the view was rather breathtaking. They had traveled for several miles, but the plains were vast and to get anywhere would take several days travel.<br>\r\n  As they walked along they spent most the time getting to know each other and talking about the treasure.<br>\r\n  While they knew they would have to eventually, they avoided telling Anton about Auroras abilities for as long as they could. Daniel thoroughly enjoyed Anton's laughter, than stunned silence when Aurora tried to tell him, only to have to prove her magic to him.<br>\r\n  While they had stopped for a moment to let Anton calm down, Isabella asked him \"What did your uncle say about you leaving and coming with us?\"<br>\r\n  \"Oh, he wasn't too happy about it and he tried to convince me to stay, but he let me go.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  Back in Arrya there was a commotion in a back alley, near the residential area.<br>\r\n  Ronald was carried and then thrown into an alley by five men in full plate armor after having been caught picking the lock to a rich merchant's house. He had been working on how to escape when he was thrown into the alley. As he stood back up he dodged a blow from one of the knights, before one the oldest one walked up and said to the other \"Donovan I'd like to try to keep this civilized as possible, I'll let you know if he needs some convincing.\" He then turned to Ronald and said \"I assume you are Ronald?\"<br>\r\n  \"I might be. Who's asking?\" Ronald replied, brushing himself off.<br>\r\n  \"I presume you need some convincing as well.\" Thomas said as he produced a small bag of gold, then threw it towards Ronald. Ronald caught it, and as he inspected the coin said,<br>\r\n  \"I have some questions of my own. First does this have to do with my nephew? Second, what is going on, and last how did you find me?\"<br>\r\n  \"If you nephews name is Anton, then yes. As for what is going on all I can say is it in involves the Princess. And you of all people should know that the beggars of a city are a have a wealth of information to give, for a price though.\" Thomas replied. \"But I believe that answers all of your questions so I'll ask you mine now. Where did your nephew go?\"<br>\r\n  \"He didn't say much about where, he just ran into our home and grabbed a few of his personal things and a travel cloak. He was inside and then he was gone.\"<br>\r\n  \"Did he stop long enough to tell you what he was doing?\"<br>\r\n  \"He was pretty excited when he spoke about it, and all I could gather was something about a quest. I didn't hear much else, so I must be on my way now. My wife must be worried sick be now.\" Ronald honestly told the knights.<br>\r\n  As he said this he walked towards the exit of the alley way and after the other three knights moved, he made his way down the street, disappearing into the crowd.<br>\r\n  \"Did you learn anything new?\" Andrew asked walking up.<br>\r\n  \"No, he didn't get to speak to his nephew for long. But from what I can gather from everything that has happened so far, we are constantly one step behind them.\" Thomas replied. He looked away in the direction Ronald had disappeared, before looking back and telling the other knights \"Split up and we will each go to a gate and ask around after that we will meet up at the barons castle to discuss what we found and get a good rest. I have a feeling that we will need it.\"</span></div></div>",

As they sat they spoke about their plans.<br>\r\n  \"Ok, the map in the book says that we just need to head north. But the map also changes when we leave a region.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n  Anton was looking at the book along with Daniel and said \"If it does that, then it could lead us on forever.\"<br>\r\n  \"I don't think so. If I were one of the ancient elders who hid the treasure, I would have hidden it in the mountains to the north.\" Aurora said.<br>\r\n  \"Do you mean the mountains that border Radigan's empire? Because if so, then this is going to be far more dangerous then I anticipated.\" Isabella asked.<br>\r\n  They all sat thinking for a moment, but Aurora broke the silence saying, \"Even if it is in the mountains bordering his kingdom, we will be able to prevail.\" They agreed, and after Aurora put out their fire, went to sleep.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  The next morning, after they had gathered all of their things, they set off down the path. They had just begun to walk when Daniel asked Anton, \"You said in Arrya that your uncle taught you almost everything you know.\"<br>\r\n  \"Well he taught me everything I know about being a thief. My parents taught me to read and a little bit of writing, and my dad taught me how to use a dagger and bow real well. He had been a soldier before he was wounded. My uncle taught me how to pick locks and pockets, and how to move about unseen. I hadn't ever been caught before running into you.\" Anton replied.<br>\r\n  \"What did you get from your uncle's home?\" Isabella asked.<br>\r\n  \"Well I got my cloak, my bag, and most importantly my father's dagger. I always try to pack light so I can move fast.\" Anton said as he patted each item, as if to make sure he still had them.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  It had been several hours since that conversation and the sky had become dark and cloudy. Aurora and Anton were confused by this, as the storm seemingly came from nowhere.<br>\r\n  \"The plains are known for their inclement weather. It's one of the reasons they are called the Skyfall Plains.\" Isabella responded.<br>\r\n  \"And having traveled through this area before, I know we are going to need shelter and fast.\" Daniel said as the winds suddenly picked up.<br>\r\n  The group moved along, though at a faster then usual pace. They had only gone on for another half hour when the rain began to fall. It started light at first, but grew heavier and heavier. Soon it was almost as dark as night, and the wind was so loud they had to yell to hear one another. It wasn't helping that the temperature was plummeting as well.<br>\r\n  Aurora, who was in the rear, shouted to the rest, \"We have to find some kind of shelter before nightfall. If we don't we'll freeze.\"<br>\r\n  \"In that case we are in luck.\" Daniel said pointing to a small square of light in the darkness.</span></div></div>",

Edward walked towards her to comfort her, only to stop as there was a knock on the door of his study. Opening it, he was greeted by a young courier from Arrya, who presented to him a letter. Thanking and dismissing him, the King took the letter and opened it.<br>\r\n  \"Who is it from?\" the Queen asked, after she saw the look on Edwards face.<br>\r\n  Now deep in thought, Edward handed the letter to Jasmine as he turned to a bookcase that extended across the side of the room. Jasmine turned her attention to the letter and read it for herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      King Edward and Queen Jasmine,<br>\r\n\"I am writing this to inform you that, while the other knights and I have not yet caught up to the Princess, we are hot on their trail. From what we can gather, we are consistently a day and a half behind them at the most. It would seem that they have gathered some companions in their journey thus far.\"<br>\r\n     The letter then described what they knew of Aurora and Anton, including Aurora's apparent aptitude for \"illusions\",(as Thomas called it) and Anton's former profession. It also told of the quest she had undertaken.<br>\r\n     The Queen had finished skimming over the letter when she noticed that there was a smaller note attached at the bottom. \"We found this note from the princess in the village that this Aurora girl was from.\"<br>\r\n     Edward had been scanning  over the shelves of books when he found it.<br>\r\n  \"Ah, here it is.\" He said as he took a book off of the shelf.<br>\r\n  \"What is it?\" Jasmine asked as she got up to see what her husband had been searching for.<br>\r\n  It was a old looking book, one that had surely changed hands many times. The cover was somewhat faded, but embossed on the cover in ornate writing were the words, \"Tales of the Ancient's.\"<br>\r\n  \"What is this?\" The Jasmine asked, glancing towards Edward.<br>\r\n  \"This is the book that tells of this treasure that Isabella seeks. Well, it's the original copy of that book anyway. I had scribes make another copy for the castle library. I'm sure that Isabella brought the new copy with her.\" He responded, as he flipped through the pages. He finally came to the faded page that told of the ancient treasure.</span></div></div>",

Isabella was leading the way as best as she could. The light was the only indication of their direction. Suddenly she stopped, almost causing Daniel to bump into her, and yelled to the others \"Wait, I just remembered something\". She then reached into her pack and pulled out the enchanted lantern Zarion had given her. She knelt down to the ground but then said \"Wait, I don't know if mud will ignite the flame. Zarion said sprinkling a little dirt starts the fire.\"<br>\r\n  \"Let me see.\" Aurora said as she walked over.<br>\r\n  Isabella handed the lamp to Aurora and she knelt down and with little concentration drew the water out of a small patch of soil. She quickly took a pinch of the soil and dropped it into the lantern. A flame sparked immediately, illuminating the area around them. Even though the wind was blowing with full force, the light didn't flicker at all, just as Zarion had said.<br>\r\n  As they approached the light, it became steadily larger. Eventually they were close enough to tell that the light came from the window of a small farmhouse. They considered what to do for only a moment, before a large bolt of lightening light the sky and urged them to seek shelter.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  Bundled up in their home, the members of the Regana family sat in front of the fireplace. Helena sat in her rocking chair, mending a coat, while Gregory sat in his chair. The twins sat in front of the fire with a blanket around them, and the eldest son was in his own chair, whittling away at a stick while watching the fire burn. The tranquility of the scene was broken by a sudden sharp knocking at the door. \"Who would be out in a storm like this, especially at this time of night?\" Gregory asked as he got up from his chair to answer.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n  They did not have to wait outside of the house for long. Not long after they knocked a man opened the door and after a second of confusion quickly ushered them in and showed them to the fireplace. Upon seeing the unexpected guests and how cold and wet they were, Helena quickly rose and exclaimed \"You poor things, come sit by the fire and warm yourselves. Gregory go get some more blankets. Jackson, go start some tea. Catherine, Catalina give one of them your blanket.\" The twins ran over to Isabella and draped their blanket around her shoulders, then ran and each got another from their father who had returned with three more. After she was sure they were drying off, Helena went off to the kitchen to take over the tea for Jackson.<br>\r\n  The four adventurers had no chance to get a word in once Helena took over. They had been quickly ushered into the den and were sat down in front of the fire. Gregory returned to his chair and got comfortable, then began introductions, \"Well, since you probably want to wait this storm out, I think we should all introduce ourselves. I'm Gregory Regana, this is my son Jackson,\" he said as he nodded towards the boy,\" and those two are the twins, Catherine and Catalina. My wife's name is Helena.\"<br>\r\n  Daniel was the first to respond, saying \"I am Daniel, this is Aurora, Anton, and Izzy.\" It had occurred to him that he should not tell Isabella's full name, just as an extra precaution.<br>\r\n  \"Well it's a good thing you got here, this storm is only going to get worse. It usually slacks off in the morning, so y'all are welcome to stay in here until then.\"</span></div></div>",

Oh how she wished she could submerge her head in the tepid waters and drown out their rumors. She had learned long ago how to ignore the injurious gossiping of nosy servants. Back then it had been about her black eyes and cut lips. She never thought that Daniel could ever cause their family to become a target of such salacious talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrederica, the Queen asked for you to bring her tea today. Take this tray up  to her parlor,\u201d commanded Marta, the kitchen matron. Freddie dried her hands on her apron and collected to indicated tray of tea and cakes. A practiced look of indifference on her face, Freddie pretended not to notice the hushed whispers and sideways glances as she marched through the kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie was hardly surprised the Queen had asked for her. Ever since news got out about the princess\u2019s disappearance it was all anyone could talk about. It and the stable boy who had also gone missing, and the mother of said stable boy. Honestly she was surprised she wasn't hauled in before the King and Queen days ago when they first discovered the children gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she knocked on the door to the Queen\u2019s parlor and was bid to enter, Freddie half expected to be greeted by royal guards upon entering just waiting to arrest her for conspiring to kidnap the princess. Instead, she found the only occupant of the luxurious room was the Queen, sitting alone in an armchair gazing out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie place the tray on the stand beside the Queen and prepared her a cup of tea. Finished Freddie took one step back and waited as Queen Jasmine began to sip her tea. A servant\u2019s life involved an awful lot of waiting and simply being at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think they are alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled Freddie didn't know what she was being asked, \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur children. Do you think they are safe wherever they are?\u201d There it was. The guards were bound to show up any second now to take her into custody for questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear I don\u2019t know where they have gone,\u201d Freddie blurted out. Then added as an afterthought, \u201cyour majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Jasmine turned in her seat and gripped Freddie in a piercing gaze. \u201cIf I thought you had even an inkling of their whereabouts, Frederica, you would already have been made to tell us.\u201d Freddie stood frozen, unsure how to respond, having no doubt the Queen meant what she said. \u201cHave a seat Frederica. Tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie carefully sat down in the armchair opposite Queen Jasmine and simply nodded as it dawned on her that maybe the queen just wanted to have a conversation. As incredulous as that thought was - a queen wanting to have a real conversation with a servant - these two women were connected through their children. Though they had been obliged to interact at times due to their children\u2019s friendship, those interactions had never amounted to much more than a few cordial words. As adults they did not know how to bridge the gap in their statuses with friendship the way Daniel and Isabelle found so natural. Jasmine could never call Daniel\u2019s mother \u201cFreddie,\u201d and Freddie could not break the habit of referring to Isabelle\u2019s mother as \u201cyour majesty.\u201d And yet they knew each other nearly as well as they knew themselves. Their children were always telling them stories about the other woman that very few were privy to. This fostered a mutual respect between the two mothers that they could not express to the other for the sake of propriety and for fear of betraying the other\u2019s privacy by revealing how much they each knew about the other through their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pray for their safe return every day, your majesty,\u201d Freddie began hesitantly. When Queen Jasmine nodded her head in agreement, Freddie took that as a sign to keep talking. \u201cI only wish I knew where they had gone.\u201d It was slightly more emotional than her previous statement, but still a relatively safe comment that could be said to a person of any class. \u201cThe one thing I know for certain, your majesty, is that wherever they are, my Daniel will protect the princess with his life if need be.\u201d Freddie didn't say this to garner favor with the queen or because she thought that\u2019s what the queen wanted to hear. She said it because it was true. Daniel cared too much for his friend to ever let anything bad happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I believe that to be true,\u201d the Queen responded, knowing it beyond a doubt. He may have only been a stable boy but his heart and courage more than equaled that of any of the king\u2019s knights whose ranks Jasmine knew he so desperately wanted to join. How else could he stand before the king and queen after getting into some mischief or another with the Isabelle, often times trying to claim all blame for himself? Isabelle could not have a more fiercely loyal protector, and she would need one when she became queen. Jasmine knew Isabelle usually deserved most of the responsibility for whatever she and the boy had done; afterall she far outranked a lowly stable boy and Jasmine had made sure she knew exactly what was and was not acceptable behavior for a princess. And yet, time and time again, there was this young boy facing the wrath of not merely two angry parents, but two angry monarchs, and trying to claim he was the one truly at fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women sat in awkward silence trying to decide what else they could say and contemplating the friendship between their children. It was an unlikely friendship to say the least. Neither knew exactly how it had come about in the first place. They knew the two would not be able to remain friends for long; since birth their lives were set on two different paths that would ultimately create a distance between them. But for now, despite their misgivings for the future, both mothers were secretly glad their children had each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you take your tea Frederica?\u201d Jasmine inquired, not sure how else to break the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jasmine picked up the teapot and began pouring a cup, Freddie leaped out of her seat, \u201cYour majesty! Please let me do that for you.\u201d Freddie was barely able to contain herself and refrain from yelling it at the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now Frederica. I am perfectly capable of pouring a cup of tea. Please sit.\u201d Jasmine was shocked and bemused to have elicited such a response. Freddie on the other hand was mortified and confused; she didn\u2019t know what to do. Which would be worse: allowing the queen to serve a servant or arguing with the queen over who should pour the tea. The former as definitely improper, but the latter could very well be considered treason. So Freddie slowly eased herself into her chair, ready to spring back to her feet at a moment\u2019s notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned that she had caused Frederica discomfort, Jasmine decided to let her pour the tea from that point on. It was Frederica\u2019s job after all. Jasmine should have known better than to break the bounds of propriety like that. She was beginning to think this whole idea had been a mistake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her story complete, Isabelle took a deep breath and released her shoulders. She had not noticed how tense her muscles had become as she recounted the event, but it now felt as if speaking the words had released a burden. She had watched her companions closely as they listened, and she now wished to know what they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving begun during the telling, Daniel continued to pace behind Isabelle\u2019s chair, occasionally shaking his head as he tried to put all the pieces together in a way he liked. Aurora examined the contents of the bag which Isabelle had brought out when she listed Zarion\u2019s gifts. Aurora handled each item as if it were a priceless artifact, which they were in a way. These objects represented magicks and knowledge that had been lost to her people during the Decline. She had either never heard of them or had never met anyone capable of conjuring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Daniel and Aurora were visibly moved by all they had been presented with in the past several hours, Tenmar appeared to have finally collected himself. \u201cMore of Zarion\u2019s life force must still be conscious than we ever thought,\u201d Tenmar mused. \u201cOnly magic, his magic, could have brought you to him. He has not had a physical body or appeared in any form for decades. And there is no cave behind the waterfall, only sheer rock face. Zarion must have created that bubble for you to speak. The magic expended on that meeting and these gifts may very well be the reason for the accelerated death of the waterfall.\u201d A flash of realization crossed Tenmar\u2019s face as he remembered the fast approaching deadline on their only guaranteed escape from Radigan\u2019s sinister reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for telling us about Zarion, Isabelle. I hope you realize how special such a meeting is.\u201d Tenmar rose from his chair and began mentally checking off items on a list of essentials not to be left behind. \u201cAurora, time grows short, we need to finish packing,\u201d Tenmar instructed. But, while he stooped to retrieve the wooden bowl which had rolled into the doorway, Aurora remained firmly in her seat, deep in thought. See that his daughter was moving to obey his command, Tenmar gently admonished, \u201cAurora, go and pack. I\u2019m sure there are things you\u2019d rather not leave behind when we cross through the waterfall. You won\u2019t be able to come back for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Aurora did not rise from her seat. She did not move a muscle except for her lips. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tenmar asked when no sound escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should stay.\u201d She was finally able to force the words out loud enough to be heard, but Aurora still could not bring herself to look at her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay where? The waterfall is about to die and leave us wide open to detection and attack. Radigan must not find any of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if the Treasure of Higani is found; Radigan can be stopped. We would all be safe,\u201d Aurora argued, her voice slowing growing in volume and confidence while her eyes remained glued to the contents of Isabelle\u2019s bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>IF </i>the Treasure is found by someone other than Radigan. <i>IF </i>it even contains something capable of stopping him. <i>IF </i>the finder knows how to use it and is willing to risk his or her life. The danger is too great to chance on <i>IF</i>. Crossing through the waterfall now guarantees our safety. So that is exactly what we are going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said so yourself, it must have taken an incredible amount of power for the Nyx to appear to Isabelle. He wouldn\u2019t have done that if it wasn\u2019t important. If he didn\u2019t believe she and Daniel could succeed.\u201d Both Isabelle and Daniel were overwhelmed by Aurora\u2019s faith in their ability to accomplish a mission which had only begun as a frivolous jaunt to get away for awhile. But all they could do was watch as father and daughter debated their chances of saving them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let them do it. Or better yet let them go home to their families where it is safe. Like you they are children after all.\u201d Incredulous, Tenmar could not believe what his daughter was saying. Gripping the bowl in his hands, his knuckles began to turn white from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwept up in her passion, Aurora rose to her feet and finally found the courage to face her father and utter a singular statement, \u201cThey would have a better chance with our help and you know it is the right thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching the gravity of her tone, Tenmar replied, \u201cAnd you know exactly why we have to go. Or do you want their blood on our hands?\u201d Tenmar gestured out the window. \u201cIs betraying them the right thing to do?\u201d Aurora\u2019s eyes flickered with doubt as her resolve began to falter. Seeing this Tenmar softened his voice and drove home his point. \u201cDoing the right thing isn\u2019t always so cut and dry. It can take many forms. We have responsibilities we cannot ignore.\u201d Tenmar and Aurora remained with their eyes frozen on each other as if a staring contest would decide their fate. Isabelle and Daniel stood by waiting to see who would break first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Aurora dropped her eyes to the floor, Tenmar did not loosen his viselike grip on the bowl. Instead he waited, and hoped, for confirmation that she understood and acquiesced to his position. Aurora\u2019s shoulders visibly drooped as she realized she could not dispute her father\u2019s point, but neither could she concede her own. She struggled for a response, and the others waited to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to think,\u201d stumbled from her lips, and then Aurora marched straight out the front door without looking at anyone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone else remained frozen until the slamming of the door had ceased echoing in their ears. Tenmar made his way to the front door, but with the wooden bowl still gripped tightly in his hands he could not open it. He simply moved his gaze back and forth between the door knob and and the bowl. He seemed to have lost control of his hands. He did not know how to make his hand release the bowl and turn the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle followed Tenmar to the front door and placed her hand on his rebellious right hand, \u201cIt may be a good idea to give her a little space. Why don\u2019t I help you pack while we wait for her,\u201d Isabelle offered. Looking at Daniel, she implored him with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I will go check on Aurora,\u201d Daniel chimed in understanding immediately what Isabelle meant to communicate. So Isabelle guided Tenmar back into the kitchen, and Daniel went out into the village in pursuit of Aurora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle and Tenmar worked in silence. She pulled kitchenware from cupboards and lined the up on the counter. He chose some to pack away in bags and boxes and others to be left where they lay according to an indecipherable list apparent only to him. Only after double checking all the items on the counter, ensuring they were neither needed nor wanted did he address Isabelle who sat in a chair at the kitchen table cluttered with items to be left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not that I don\u2019t trust Zarion or you and Daniel,\u201d Tenmar stated as he stood before the sink, his hands gripping the edge. \u201cI just believe it is too great a risk, and one you and Daniel should not have to bear.\u201d Turning his head to look Isabelle in the eye, Tenmar asked a questions Isabelle couldn\u2019t yet answer, \u201cAre you prepared to accept the burden of all the power hidden away with the Treasure of Higani?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle had fled her father\u2019s castle and all the responsibilities of a princess. This quest had no goal beyond one last hurrah before submitting to her duties as her father\u2019s heir, including the political marriage her parents had decided she was old enough for them to arrange. Despite everything she had heard in the past day and a half about the importance of finding the Treasure and the prophecy, she could now allow herself to acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did not set off to save the world. I\u2019m not sure I even believe these prophecies about the Treasure. Whatever Aurora decides, whether or not we find this Treasure, I do not intend on personally confronting Radigan, no matter what powers we find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel found Aurora sitting beneath a tree on the edge of the clearing watching the other villagers load their belongings into small boats. Piles grew and shrank as families argued over what to bring and what to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve known for years we would have to leave our homes,\u201d Aurora mused as Daniel sat down beside her with his legs stretched before him and his hands planted behind propping him up, \u201cbut in the panic and rush they\u2019ve forgotten the plans they made and rehearsed long ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve also for years that you would be leaving,\u201d Daniel pointed out, \u201cWhy fight it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of the day we could go beyond the boundaries of our village without fear of persecution or exploitation, but I accepted it was only a fantasy. When I met you and Isabelle on the road, that was the furthest I had ever ventured out of our lands, and I don\u2019t even know why I did it. With the appearance of the Nyx, though, and everything he told Isabelle. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m beginning to feel hope that it could truly happen; that you and Isabelle could save us all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy us?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do still plan on going in search of the Treasure do you not?\u201d Aurora asked in reply, continuing to watch the frantic movements of the villagers by the waterside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. I don\u2019t think either of us are ready to return home. Especially after learning there is still so much about the world of which we are ignorant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora turned her body so that she was sitting cross legged facing Daniel straight on. Then she asked one simple questions, \u201cWhy not you?\u201d Fumbling for the words, Daniel tore his gaze from Aurora to scan the surface of the lake to buy himself time. \u201cFrom what I have seen,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou both have good hearts, sharp minds, and are more than capable. Who else can be trusted with the powers of the Higani Treasure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are only two people,\u201d Daniel insisted. \u201cYes we will search for the Treasure of Higani while we feel it is safe to do so, but Isabelle is my princess as well as my friend, and I will not put her in such mortal danger. How can we be expected to go up against the obstacles put in place to the protect the Higani Treasure let alone against Radigan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith some help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course your chances would be greater with help. And, honestly, with discipline and training, Aurora\u2019s abilities may be stronger than either of us know. Recently they have come to rival any surviving Nykken we have met, and they are still growing, but that isn\u2019t saying much considering the Decline and what Nykken powers used to be,\u201d Tenmar\u2019s words came tumbling angrily from his mouth at such a speed they began to run together and it was all Isabelle could do to separate them. It sounded as if his mouth had betrayed him by giving voice to those thoughts, but perhaps by saying them fast enough, the words would pass right by without stopping to interrupt his well reasoned argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unthinkable risks involved and the extremely low possibility of three children succeeding where so many others - people who had greater skill and faced less threat from Radigan - had failed was a perfectly practical objection. Admitting his faith in his daughter\u2019s abilities, however, made it less so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing one line of argument come apart, Tenmar fell back on the most basic and most powerful argument he knew, \u201cNo matter how strong she becomes in power and in will, I am still her father. It is my duty to protect her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you truly believe that,\u201d Isabelle suggested, \u201cthen why not join Aurora in her quest. Surely your knowledge and experience could only help ensure our success and safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf all those still in the village, only Aurora and I are able to activate the gheestone and open the portal. And whoever opens the portal is automatically transported to the other side.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I have no right to force that upon them. Especially with no guarantee that we\u2019ll even find the Treasure of Higani, let alone read it before Radigan. Even if we find it first, who\u2019s to say we\u2019ll be able to use anything we find to defeat Radigan once and for all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you fighting so strongly to stay and try?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief hesitation, Aurora quietly uttered the only answer she had, \u201cBecause I feel it is the only thing I can do and what I must do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I cannot stop her from staying behind and joining you in your journey,\u201d Tenmar admitted in resignation, \u201cbut how do I say goodbye to my only daughter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it is what she needs to hear. The truth is that while we say the words, \u2018goodbye\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean what we think it does. We may part ways - for a few minutes or for an eternity - but those we love and who love us never really leave us. She is your daughter Tenmar. You are a part of her just as surely as she is a part of you. Every piece of advice you gave her, every lecture you scolded her with, every tear you wiped from her eye, and every smile you brought to her face now lives within her. As I am sure every one of her scraped knees and childhood nightmares, her hopes and dreams, her victories and defeats all live within you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should just go,\u201d Aurora mused. \u201cLeave and begin my journey without saying goodbye to anyone. Maybe that would be easier for everyone.\u201d She hugged her knees to her chest as she considered this. She couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say to convince her father, and Aurora didn\u2019t want to risk him changing her mind. Worse, she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him not changing her mind, of him letting her go, of him saying goodbye. \u201cHaving to say goodbye would be too painful, for both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was seven my father walked out on my mother and I. Packed up one day and left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised out of her thoughts of running away from home, Aurora fumbled for something to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Daniel wasn\u2019t looking for sympathy. He just wanted her to listen, and she did. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a good man. Never meant to be a husband or father. In fact, when he left, my greatest fear was that he would return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe never said goodbye,\u201d Daniel explained. \u201cI never missed him once he was gone, and I put behind me everything he had put us through before leaving. The one thing I can\u2019t seem to forgive or forget is the fact that he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to tell us goodbye, not even in a note. Didn\u2019t we deserve that much? Some acknowledgement that we had been a part of his life, that we were more than part of the scenery?\u201d Daniel looked Aurora in the eye. \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising really, he was ever a cruelly selfish man who never saw us as people, but imagine if we had loved each other as you and your father do. Then tell me saying goodbye is too painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaying goodbye is about closure. It lets them know you recognize they are a part of your life. It gives them closure so that they can go on with their lives even if you are no longer there. Goodbye is our final gift to anyone and everyone who has ever been in our lives. A gift that should never be denied to those we love most, if at all possible,\u201d Isabelle didn\u2019t know if what she was saying really meant anything, but it felt right. She wanted to ease Tenmar\u2019s mind, but she couldn\u2019t imagine what he was going though. For his part Tenmar couldn\u2019t believe how wise she was for her age and inexperience.</span></div></div>",

Edward did not want to inadvertently provide Radigan with justification to attack, but they needed to be ready just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, station men in these outlying villages. Have them lie low; claim to be there on a routine inspection. Do not worry the residents, but be prepared to evacuate them in the event of an attack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see to it immediately. Any thing else sire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the map before him, King Edward couldn\u2019t help but wonder where his daughter was at that moment. He wanted to send more knights after her, but he had a bad feeling that every man he could spare would soon be needed. All he could do was hope that the five he sent would find her soon and keep her safe. \u201cNo commander, that is all for now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Their heads leaning in and foreheads touching, Aurora and Tenmar said their farewells at the edge of the lake. Isabelle and Daniel stood a short ways off to give them their privacy. Daniel thought of his father and tried yet again to say a final goodbye to the man who abandoned him, the man he secretly feared one day seeing in the mirror. Isabelle thought of her grandmother who had passed away a few years ago. She had been a truly tenacious woman and had thrived well into her twilight years. As a result she had had to say goodbye to a good many people before giving her own final farewell. It was she who had first given the speech Isabelle gave to Tenmar about goodbyes. At the time Isabelle couldn\u2019t understand what her grandmother tried to convey. She had very little experience in really saying goodbye to loved ones. Even now she still couldn\u2019t grasp much of it, but in seeing how those words and ideas touched Tenmar, Isabelle began to feel some of its meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Isabelle didn\u2019t hear anything of what passed between father and daughter until the end when they pulled their heads apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStubborn just like your mother,\u201d Tenmar smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, like my father,\u201d Aurora returned as they embraced one last time. Then Tenmar climbed into his boat with his belongings and rowed out onto the lake with the remaining villagers. Most were in boats, some treaded water beside boats carrying their families and/or belongings, and others stood in shallows submerged only up to their waists. Isabelle, Daniel, and Aurora were the only ones not in the water. Careful to stay dry on the shore, they watched the curtain of the waterfall part as Tenmar approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was mildly surprised to see that Tenmar was right - the cave was gone and all that was left was a solid rock face. With his boat pressed up along the cliff, Tenmar passed his had in front of the rock wall. As he did so, a stone Daniel and Isabelle had not noticed before began to glow a pale indigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenmar glanced over his shoulder at Aurora, mouthed \u201cgoodbye,\u201d and placed his hand on the stone. Aurora barely had time to return her father\u2019s goodbye before he vanished before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone the waterfall returned to normal, once more concealing the gheestone behind. In the cascades of the falling water an image began to appear. Aurora took a step forward when she saw Tenmar in his boat floating on the surface of another lake in another world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a heartbeat the villagers closest to the waterfall similarly disappeared from the lake and reappeared on the other side of the waterfall with Tenmar. They were soon followed by the next villagers closest to the waterfall. Some waved to the three on the shore; others held their breath and braced for the journey. As the power of the gheestone rippled out from the gheestone toward the edge of the lake transporting wave after wave of people to safety, the waterfall decreased in flow and strength. Aurora retreated from the water lapping at her feet just before the last ripple of the surface of the lake was transported. She and her father gazed at each other through the faltering waterfall until the moment it sputtered out its final drops.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isabelle, Daniel and Aurora spent the night in the house she had shared with her father. The place looked as if it had been ransacked - items strewn about helter-skelter, cupboards and drawers left open and bare, and a deeper emptiness filling up every available space, saturating the household with the absence of its former occupant. This house was no longer a home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how to comfort her, Daniel and Isabelle gave Aurora her space. It was hard to say if she regretted her choice to stay or not. She didn\u2019t say a word all night. There were no tears, no screams, no sighs, no stiff upper lip, no talk of plans. She simply packed a few supplies for the road and returned everything else to its proper place before laying down to sleep. Except for a few bare spots, the house almost looked like nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving the next morning Aurora had taken one of the remaining boats out to the base of the now dried up waterfall. All that remained of the gheestone was a handful of sand collected at the base of a small recess in the rock face where the pale indigo stone had once resided. Aurora gathered this sand in a pouch and hung it around her neck, then left the place she had called home with Daniel and Isabelle without once looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~     *     ~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a time, Daniel could no longer take Aurora\u2019s silence. He didn\u2019t want to press her too soon after her loss, but if they were going to be travelling together she would have to speak eventually. Curious, Daniel decided to ask about the contents of the pouch around Aurora\u2019s neck. Daniel and Isabelle had watched Aurora collect the sand, but she still hadn\u2019t said a word since saying goodbye to Tenmar. Since the leaving the lake Daniel had observed Aurora occasionally reach up and clutch the pouch in her hand, unconsciously reassuring herself it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any power left in that?\u201d Daniel inquired as Aurora\u2019s hand again grasped the pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, her fingers gently brushing the pouch, Aurora gave an unequivocal, \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why hold on to it?\u201d Daniel persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had hoped more of the gheestone had survived than this. That I could still tap into some of its power however small. Unfortunately not enough of the its power survived. Still, even though it can have no use, having this small bit of the stone is comforting. It somehow makes me feel that my father and people aren\u2019t completely lost to me forever. Foolish really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not. What is a gheestone after all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to walk, Aurora explained that at the moment of death, if a person with magical abilities had the strength and will required, he or she could channel what remains of their life force into creating a gheestone. After that person is gone, the gheestone continues to possess what magick that person was able to pour into it. Once gheestones were passed down through families lines. They were remembrances of that person, a way for families to feel that their lost loved ones were still there with them. Some even believed that the stones contained the soul of the person who created it. This is why gheestones are sometimes called Spirit Stones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, however, it was discovered that gheestones were much more than mere tokens used to remember someone, the magick within the stone could be tapped into and used by whoever activated the stone (whether that person had magick of their own or not). This made gheestones very valuable and extremely dangerous. Like any tool, these stones were not inherently good or evil based on whose life force it contained, but it could be used for either based on the desires of whoever wielded it. And if a person with malicious intentions amassed enough gheestones, he or she could use those combined powers to commit unspeakable acts completely unchecked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of the exploitation of magick, fewer and fewer gheestones were created. At the moment of their deaths people either did not have time to even think  of creating a gheestone as their deaths came on too suddenly, lacked the strength of mind and/or body to focus their energy into a stone due to their mistreatment, or chose not to create the stone for fear of what a stranger might choose to do with that tangible piece of their soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gheestone behind of the waterfall was different,\u201d Aurora elaborated. \u201cWe believe it was created by the Nyx when he gave his life force to the waterfall and the spells he left to protect us. When it was originally discovered no one knew what it was because the first few people who touched it could not activate it. And from what we knew about gheestones, we thought they could be used by anyone. However, eventually someone did touch it and managed to accidentally activated it. Unlike other gheestones we had heard of, the person who activated it had no control over it. The stone immediately carried out the spell  you saw it perform last night: it transported everyone in the lake somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally we were terrified. We didn\u2019t know if they had been killed or if they had been sent somewhere or if that somewhere was safe or if they could ever return. We couldn\u2019t even be sure it was the stone that had caused their disappearance. People were scared to put so much as a toe in the water lest they disappeared too. But we had to know what had happened. So one by one people were sent to the waterfall to see if they could get a reaction from the stone. It was discovered that when certain people got close enough to the stone it would start to glow. This let us know that these particular people could activate the stone by touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know why the stone only responded to only those specific people, but our best guess is that the Nyx implanted safeguards into his gheestone. He was so powerful and so determined to ensure our safety; it must have taken a tremendous amount of effort to make sure that stone could only be used to protect us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce we determined who could and could not use the stone, volunteers agreed to risk themselves by activating the stone to discover what had happened to the others and to see if the stone could do anything else. This time, since we knew what was coming, as soon as the volunteers in the water vanished we saw them through the waterfall. The window remained open long enough for us to see that they were all safe and happy and creating a new home there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, more and more people wanted to cross through the waterfall. It wasn\u2019t long before we noticed the gheestone shrinking with each group that went through and we began running out of people who could activate the stone. So plans were made to ensure we\u2019d all be able to move on in our own time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you saw how well that worked out,\u201d Aurora concluded, a hint of bitterness and sorrow in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this Treasure of Higani is truly filled with such incredible magicks, surely there is something there that can reunite you with your people once again,\u201d Isabelle tried to reassure Aurora. \u201cSo the sooner we find it, the sooner you will see your father again. Though I personally am in no hurry to see my father again, for I am certain is will be very cross with me; my mother even more so. Maybe there\u2019s something in the Treasure that will help me soothe their tempers, some magic elixir I can slip into their tea perhaps,\u201d Isabelle joked. A small smile pulled at the corner of Aurora\u2019s lips, but it may have been slightly forced for Isabelle\u2019s benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel thought Isabelle sounded quite optimistic about finding the Treasure and getting Aurora back home. He, on the other hand, felt even less sure about this little adventure than he did when they had first set off from the castle. Aurora had left behind everything and everyone she knew because she thought Daniel and Isabelle were going to save the world and she wanted to help. He suspected Isabelle was beginning to have doubts as well and was putting on a brave face for Aurora and trying to convince herself that this was still some kind of game. Daniel couldn\u2019t so easily deny that this bit of fun was becoming more complicated and potentially more dangerous. Still, they weren\u2019t in any danger yet, and they couldn\u2019t very well turn around now and tell Aurora that her sacrifice had been for nothing. For now, they continued walking the path they had chosen.</span></div></div>",

Daniel blinked, but then he remembered that he had already fought the creature, a werecat under the control of Radigan, and lost Isabelle to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Radigan?  He recalled Isabelle's shout of fear and recognition at who and what they were dealing with: Radigan and his unholy minions.  Why, the old spell-caster had been hell-bent on taking over King Edward's and Queen Jasmine's dominion for as long as anyone could remember.  But why Isabelle?  Why the princess?  Why did he need her?  Then, slowly, it dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Isabelle was the key to Radigan's control over King Edward and Queen Jasmine.  If Radigan had Isabelle, he could hold her for ransom at any amount he wished.  It was conceivable that the King and Queen would pay a handsome bounty for the return of their only daughter--a kingdom, perhaps, if the old villain asked for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And he, Daniel, had allowed one of Radigan's underlings to kidnap poor Isabelle without putting up even a decent fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guiltily, he looked up at his savior to see not one, but five.  \"You must help me,\" he babbled, fighting back the tears that threatened to flow down his cheeks.  Thankfully, Daniel recognized the five men as being King Edward's best champions.  Somehow or other, the King and Queen must have realized the princess's absence and set Sirs Thomas, Donovan, Jonothan, Andrew, and Bernard to reclaim her.  \"Please,\" Daniel begged, trying to work up the energy to kneel in a pleading gesture.  He could hardly talk, let alone sit up.

Daniel couldn't make out any of his features.  \"Oi, lads!\" he cried to his companions.  \"The stable boy!

What've you done with her, you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Taken,\" Daniel croaked, trying to free himself of the murderous grasp.  \"He took her, and did this to me.

It had torn her to bits to see Daniel--her brave, loyal, handsome, stable boy Daniel--fall to the ground in agony, clutching his right arm to his chest as if a lightning bolt had run through his body in stabbing the werecat.  Her captor had seemed unfazed and uninjured, and, as the two traveled, she unwillingly leaving her only true friend far behind, probably dead, the werecat explained to Isabelle what had happened to poor Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am naturally protected,\" he had growled, eagerly licking his lips and staring at her with narrow, cat-like eyes, \"by Master Radigan's magic.  What happened to your handsome little lover back there is that he broke one of those barriers in trying to kill me.  In doing that, I tapped into one of my stores and forced poison through his arm.  That poison is potent and, if it hasn't killed him already, has left him so debilitated that he'll probably be unable to come to your aid again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The creature's dark laughter rang in her ears still.  Isabelle couldn't help but feel that drowning helplessness or grief and guilt steal over her.  Why had she even suggested this ridiculous treasure hunt?  All she had wanted to do was escape the boring duties of royalty and experience the wonderful, clear taste of freedom rushing through her veins.  She had just wanted to have an adventure with Daniel, to enjoy her time with him.  But he didn't want to; she had coerced him, and now, he was either dead or half-dead, and all on her account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>'Why was I so selfish?'</i> she thought, sobbing quietly.  <i>'Why did that have to happen to Daniel, of all people?  He's an innocent party!'</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For an instant, Isabelle thought of rushing into the night, in the direction she thought they came from.  Then she would go to her Daniel and apologize and hope he hadn't or wouldn't die angry with her.  But the werecat had become its animal form once more, and Isabelle caught its form lurking in the shadows.  There could be no escape for her tonight.</span></div></div>",

EVERYONE knows who the princess is. and nobody cares about those who don't.\"<br>\r\n \"Why are you here?\" Daniel inquired suspicously. he still hadn't relaxed around the creature.<br>\r\n \"Why are YOU here?\" Sabel countered, standing up again and starting to pace. \"Not all things in life have a reason, bub.\"<br>\r\n Isabelle sighed. \"Why are you following us?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Why are you walking in front?

Oh well.\"<br>\r\n he trotted off into the forest. \"I'll keep watch,\" he called over his shoulder. \"And make sure you get a good night sleep.\"<br>\r\n Daniel threw his knife again, which again bounced off with an loud THUMP!<br>\r\n \"Have fun with that,\" Sabel said. \"Goodnight, Princess.\" <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Daniel placed the palm of his hand on the flat of hte blade and held it up to block the soldiers blow. he watched carefully has he brought his weapon down with a clang on Daniel's sword. he noticed that his feet were in a certain position, and it seemed that the other hand was important for balance. Daniel gave it a try and thrusted at the next soldier. he easily blocked it. just as Daniel expected, he immediately struck out with his own blade. Daniel dodged and buried his own sword into the man's chest. then he swooped down and grabbed his knife. he aimed carefully and threw it at the unsuspecting general's neck.

Now get up, we have to eat before we get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more mintues Daniel finally woke up and the two ate their breakfast. Most of the meal was spent in silence, but after awhile neither of them could keep quiet any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" the said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Isabelle, I shouldn't have tried to....But we can go back to the castle and just get on with our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Danny it wasn't your fault. And you misunderstood why I couldn't. Danny, I'm a princess, you're a stable boy, no one would let us be together. But I've been thinking. It's important for us to find this treasure, and maybe on the way we can get closer, a lot closer. But we have to be careful and not go too far. I couldn't stand it if we hit it off and then returned home and were torn apart. What do you say? Do you want to give it another go, want to go with me to find the treasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just looked at her. After much deliberation he finally spoke...</span></div></div>",

But whenever Daniel sees him, he has the appearance of a very old man with a long white beard and a sparkle in his ancient eyes. Radigan can change his appearance at any time. He told Daniel that his name was Raven, so that Daniel wouldn't figure out who he really was. <br>\r\nThe thing was that Daniel had been in love with Isabelle since he had first come to work in the castle at the age of ten. And all he wanted from Raven was a whole day with her so he could tell her how he felt. Whenever he came even close, they were always interrupted by one of the servants or her parents or SOMEBODY. So Daniel was travelling to the little hut where he thought Raven lived to ask him to cast a spell so that everyone would leave him and Isabelle alone for a whole day so he could finally profess his feelings. He didn't expect the outcome to be good, but he just had to get it out of his system. It was worth the risk of revealing himself to her. <br>\r\nThat evening at about eight o'clock Daniel left the castle grounds and made his way to the hut halfway up the side of a nearby mountain.

When? What do I have to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Daniel.

However, I have come up with a solution, one that should work to your advantage.\" Daniel once again perked up. \"I need a specific artifact; however, long ago it became part of a treasure.

Little did the Queen and King know that the two teenagers had no intention of going to Transylvania; they had treasure to hunt. The map played it self inside Isabelle's thoughts: Follow New Rhode to the split, turn east on to old Rhode, through Greenly forest, across Santher meadow, and on to Jagged Mountains.<br>\r\n     \"I'm having Sir Andrew and Sir Thomas escort the two of you to Transylvania. I have business there for them.\" Said the king.<br>\r\n     \"Father . . !\" gasped Isabelle, then she turned on her charming smile,her dimples showing. \"You don't need to trouble the knights with us--Daniel is capable of seeing us to Auntie's house.\"<br>\r\n     King Edward leaned in to whisper in his daughters ear. \"Your mother will not let you travel without the knights. You know how she worries.\"  <br>\r\n     Indeed, she did. But this couldn't have been worse timing. Isabelle flashed Daniel a 'Now what?' look. Daniel's brows were furrowed in a slight frown at this news of the knights accompanying them. Isabelle kissed her parents and set off for Transylvania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Isabelle and Daniel rode along side one another with Sir Andrew and Sir Thomas bringing up the rear. Daniel could hear snatches of the knights conversation as they rode, and took this advantage to talk to Isabelle about their new prediciment. \"I don't know how we're to get away for our treasure quest.\"<br>\r\n     \"We'll just wait for an opportunity and then slip away from the pair. You know I'm the best horse rider.\" Isabelle teased. Daniel rolled his eyes at her, but smiled any how. It was true that Isabelle was a good rider, but Daniel wouldn't think of running from the knights--it would be shameful--and these two were part of King Edwards best knights. They wouldn't stand a chance at escape and all their plans would be ruined.<br>\r\n     \"We'll just have to journey on to Transylvnia and see what happens from there.\"<br>\r\n     \"Once we're in auntie's hands, we'll never be able to leave.\" Isabelle pouted, which Daniel found most attractive, as it made her full lips fuller.<br>\r\n     Isabelle and Daniel rode in silence; each one thinking their own thoughts. Daniel wanted very much to be alone with Isabelle, but he couldn't betray the knights either. He may not be a knight, but Daniel prided himself on following the code of knighthood. Now he was torn between the two.<br>\r\n     Isabelle's thoughts were thinking up every kind of scenario that could come up and how she and Daniel could counter them in order to escape and begin their quest for the treasure. When the group came to the split in the road, Isabelle and Daniel each look wistfully down the path of the Old Rhode, knowing that was the start of the quest for the treasure. Daniel and Isabelle caught one anothers eyes and laughed. Isabelle knew that it would work out somehow.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Cresting the small hill, they came upon the town of Transylvania. A town completely surrounded by stone walls and a single entrance gate, where they headed even now. The knights were saluted as they passed though the gates; everyone knew King Edwards champions. Isabelle had just about giving up the idea of their getting away, when Sir Thomas came along side her mare.<br>\r\n     Sir Thomas was middle aged, with brown hair and a well groomed mustache. \"Princess, we must part from you here. Daniel is most capable of escorting you to the Duchess' home.\" Thomas bowed at the waist, gave a curt nod to Daniel and trotted off in the opposite direction. Isabelle could hardly believe their luck.<br>\r\n     \"Luck is with us.\" Daniel flashed Isabelle his dazzling smile, the one that made her heart skip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Within minutes, Isabelle had procurred an errand boy to take a letter to her aunt, the Duchess, with instructions to not deliver said letter until fourth watch; late afternoon. Pressing a silver grint in the boy's hand, Isabelle watched the young lad skip away, she hoped he didn't take the silver and not deliver the letter. Well, she couldn't do any more about it, without taking it to her aunt herself. Now that would be a folly.<br>\r\n     Quickly Daniel had Isabelle dress as a boy. She wore brown breeches, rust colored shirt of linen, and knee high boots. A wide brimmed hat covered the coiled braids of hair. Daniel studied Isabelle, sure enough she looked like a boy--a pretty boy at that. Quickly scooping some mud, he smeared it upon her clear skin. Eyes the color of jade green sparkled with amusement.<br>\r\n     \"There.\" Daniel said, brushing the mud from his hands. Isabelle studied her reflection in a hand mirror from her saddle bag. \"Excellent! I'll be called James. James the younger brother of Daniel.\"<br>\r\n     Daniel shook his head in amusement, watching the trusting look in Isabelle's eyes. She truly believed in his protection of her. A dark cloud entered his thoughts. 'Could he protect her if they came into trouble?' For a split second Daniel considered taking Isabelle to the Duchess, but it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Daniel had located a small trail that would lead them back to the Old Rhode, away from the main highway. It was still early afternoon. They had a couple hours before the letter was delivered to Isabelle's aunt. Dear Isabelle; always sticking to her responsibilites. Telling her parents and aunt that she was safe with him and off to find a treasure, and would return soon. <br>\r\n     Daniel knew he'd better enjoy every minute of their time together, because once they were found, Isabelle's parents would no longer be letting their daughter and heir, wander around with a stable boy. Surely he would be sent far away, forbidden to return. Shaking the gloomy thoughts from his mind, Daniel brought himself back to the present. They were coming to the Old Rhode now.<br>\r\n     \"Here we are! The beginning of our quest!\" Isabelle exclaimed with glee. With excited thoughts, the two teenagers trotted away towards their quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Meanwhile, as Isabelle and Daniel were happily beginning their quest, a spy of Radigan was apprehending the letter to the Duchess. Radigan had sent his spy Talimis, to follow the group and make sure Isabelle didn't make it to the Duchess' home. Everything was going along perfectly! Foolish Daniel--love sick fool--how little he knew that by taking Isabelle on this quest, he furthered Radigan's plan of taking over King Edward's kingdom. Of course, Isabelle would never return from her treasure quest. Talimis had orders to follow the pair, and once they had found the treasure, to kill them both.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Back at his abode, Radigan received the messanger falcon from Talimis with the note: 'All is set in motion ' The only signature was the signet of a raven.<br>\r\n     \"Perfect.\" Purred Radigan. He went to his coops to retrieve another bird to send to King Edward with a note that Isabelle was now Radigan's prisoner.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Each were in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was consumed with thoughts of Isabelle. He wanted so badly to confess his love to her. He just couldn't bring himself to do it. He imagined the scene a thousand times over in his head, but no matter how many times he tried he just couldn't bring himself to come out and tell her. She was so beautiful, even in her disguise. All he wanted in the world was her love, but he knew she really couldn't love him back. She had a duty as a princess to marry a prince and then produce more heirs with him. The very thought enfuriated him. Another man, with his Isabelle, he just couldn't bare it. But when he tried to tell her his throat closed up and his stomach flipped and he felt light-headed. \"Oh Isabelle, I wish you could only love me.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she doing? What was she doing! Was playing over and over again in Isabelle's mind. Oh what a fool she was! Oh what a fool! She was riding around with a stable boy off to who-knows-where on an adventure for a treasure. What a fit mother would have when she got back! How mad father would be! She knew all of this, and yet she couldn't resist going with Daniel. He was her very best friend. The only person that ever understood her and liked her souly for who she was. She thought that if he asked her to jump off a bridge she would do it if he was there with her. Oh, but who was she kidding. Daniel and she could never be lovers. She had a duty to her country and family to marry a prince, and she was never one to flake on a duty. Several times she tried to talk to him. It seemed that they had ridden the entire way in silence. But every time she looked at him her heart skipped a beat and she couldn't bring herself to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both still silent when they got past new Rhode and onto the road leading to Greenland. Finally Daniel said,\"It's getting late and it is too dark to travel these roads at night time. We should stop in Greenland and continue our journey in the morning.\"\"Must we stop?\" she asked. \"I know that it has been a long ride, but if we ride through tonight then we will be even closer to the treasure.\" \"The roads are dangerous at night Isabelle. I don't want to get involved with bandits. Even if you look like a boy they may still find out otherwise, and I don't want you hurt.\" She didn't answer for a moment, a little caught up that he cared for her safety, but shaking herself out of her fantasy retorted, \"Oh please Daniel. I will be fine, I promise. Can't we just ride through this one night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The truth was that she <i>was</i> scared of bandits, and the cruelties she knew they were capable of. Many travelers through Greenland fell at the blade of their swords, or the tips of their arrows. She conceded to set up camp with a petulant \"Fine!\" which Daniel was amused by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two set up camp like a bickering old couple, getting in each others way as they constructed a lean-to out of the saddle blankets and sticks. There was no fire, so as to not attract any of the outlaws or brigands that might be in the area. By the end of all their fussing over the camp, it was deep night and the cold was settling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were freezing, and the night was not made for deep and comfortable sleep. Isabelle woke many times, shivering herself awake. Daniel did not allow himself to shiver, he did not consent to let his flesh prickle with goose bumps from the cold. He didn't want to appear weak to Isabelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning brought new challenges to them. After packing up camp and mounting their horses, they spotted a group of mercenary soldiers huddled around a fire in the nearby wood. The soldiers spotted them and set out to capture Isabelle, seeing though her disguise that she was a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to carry her off, but...</span></div></div>",

She was sat in front of her dresser brushing her long, dark hair before she prepared for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin broke out on her face when she realised it was Daniel. \"Hi,\" she whispered.

The boy began walking along the walkway and a large bald man with a beard stepped through the door and threw another pan at the boy, who stopped and took one step tot he side just barely moving out of the way of the flying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man went back inside slamming the door, this time it did fall off its hinges and the man could be heard cursing his misfortune at ever giving that boy a job.

You have to talk fancy if you 'round knights and the like all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but I'm sure the horses couldn't care less how we talked as long as they get fed,\" Daniel commented and Isabelle smiled. \"Well, I guess we should get going, we don't want to be too far from home when night falls. Saladeen, you can take my horse and Isiah and I will share his, we're used to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aight.\" They swiftly mounted their steeds, Isabelle seated behind Daniel just barely on the saddle and they started down the road. With the sun rising higher and higher into the sky, they talked and joked and quickly became friends. It turned out they all had a lot in common, especially in that they all prefered not to do what the adults in their lives wanted them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour they were startled when a rather bruised and bloody body wearing torn rags stumbled in the road before them. Even more shocking was that Daniel and Isabelle recognized him as one of the servants in the castle. Daniel immediately dismounted and telling Isabelle to stay put went to the fallen man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dillan, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, is that you? Thank God I've found you. Is the princess with you, I cannot see that well?\" Daniel was glad that he spoke so quietly otherwise they would have to explain everything to Saladeen, unfortunately it meant Dillan was nearly out of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The castle...the castle was attacked late last night. You and the young princess must have just left, you are lucky for that. The king and queen immediately knew that the two of you must have gone out and when they had a moment to spare they sent me to find you, to tell you that you must not return to the castle. Our defenses... just could not hold against Radigan, his sorcery and black magic was just too powerful. They t-told me to tell you that you must protect the princess. You two must lay low, hide until a later time when an army can be ra-raised to reclaim the castle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stop as he was overtaken with a nasty coughing fit. Daniel was just about to go to get him some of their water when Dillan grabbed his arm. \"You must protect the princess. If the king and queen fall, she will be our only hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel opened his mouth to say something, but was interrupted as they heard the sounds of nearing hooves on the ground. \"I've been followed, you must go now. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you? We can't just leave you he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now! Protect the princess! It is too late for me. Save yourselves!\"</span></div></div>",

Both Saladeen, with a look of mild confusion and slight curiousity, and Isabelle slide from the saddles of their steeds. Isabelle held the reins of the horses looking on with concern as Saladeen made his way to where Dillan layed and Daniel began trying to get a grip on him so tht he could bring him to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering all his remaining strength, Dillan shoved Daniel from him knocking him to the ground. \"Go!\" He didn't know what to do, Daniel couldn't just leave him there, but he obviously wouldn't let him help either. Saladeen had just reached Daniel when the two horses began to buck and nay with Isabelle frantically trying to hold onto the reins and calm them. Unfortunately none of them saw the three riders until they were dismounting and coming after them. One unsheathed his sword and ordered them to kneel, whether or not he knew who they were they couldn't tell, all they knew was that they had no choice but to obey him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one knee with their heads bowed, none of them could see anything of the riders but their feet as they hovered over them. Feeling around her, Isabelle felt a rough, rather large rock and without thinking, jumped to her feet and slammed the rock into the face of the man before her with as much force as she could. At the same moment the rider hovering above Daniel had been raising his sword to strike Daniel, who took the opportunity of the distraction to swing his leg around kicking the man's feet right out from under him. Following suit Saladeen punched the thrid man in the gut and when he fell the his knees locked his arms around his throat cutting off the air until his body fell limp. Daniel had immediately taken the first riders sword and ended his life. Isabelle had also done away with the last rider with a a club she had picked up after dropping the rock, and with her eyes closed was still blindly swinging it unaware that she no longer had a target. Exhausted she dropped the club and fell to her knees to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving the swords from the remaining two men Saladeen remembered the badly bruised servant and went to examine him. \"Daniel, I don' tink he made it. Durin' he fighting he must o' kicked the bucket. Sorry.\" Daniel bowed his head with exhaustion and with mourning. \"We'd better get out of here before more come,\" he said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey strapped the swords to the saddles and mounted. Deciding it would be best to get off the path, they made their way into the forest. At dusk they found themselves beside a river and made up their minds to rest there for the night before following the river in the morning. Saladeen it seemed was quite adept at living in the outdoors and while he started a fire and set up camp Daniel and Isabelle unpacked the meager portion of food they had thought to bring (it would barely be enough for a late night snack).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fire roaring Isabelle noticed for the first time that all their clothes had blood on them, suprisingly hers was stained the most. \"I'm going to go get some water and tried to wash off all this blood.\" Halfway through the sentence Isabelle remembered that she was supposed to be using a male voice, but fortunately Saladeen had not noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaiah wait up, I need to tell you something.\" Isabelle waited as Daniel walked up to her and whispered so that Saladeen would not hear. \"I've got some bad news. You probably noticed that it was Dillan, one of the castle servants back there on the road. It seems that after we left last night,\" he paused unsure how to break it to her, \"it seems that...that the castle was attacked. Their defenses were failing, and your parents sent Dillan to warn us not to go back. Isabelle, we'll figure something out. I'm sure your parents are ok, we'll find them. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, I really need to wash this blood off and we all need our sleep. So if you'll excuse me.\" She turned around and walked a short distance to a secluded part of the riverbed with tears in her eyes. Isabelle sat with her arms around her knees for a time before wiping her eyes and taking a deep breath. She removed the hat from her head allowing her hair to fall where it would across her back and in her face and plunged it into the cold water scrubbing away the blood. Once she had cleaned off as much of the blood from the hat as she could, she hung it on a tree branch to dry before beginning to strip the rest of her clothes to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was pleasantly warm and Isabelle decided to take a dip in the river to wash away the dirt, blood, and the events of the day. Stepping into the cool water, Isabelle shivered for a few moments before her body adjusted to the cold and started to relax. She closed her eyes and submerged her head washing away the blood, dirt, and tears. When her head returned to the surface of the water and night air she heard the crackling of breaking twigs and leaves nearby.</span></div></div>",

Did ya fall in the river 'n drown or something'?\" came the recognizable voice of Saladeen from the shadows, his form quickly following. He stopped when he saw Isabelle in the water. \"Looks to me like ya did fall in, and ya turned into a girl.\" More joking to himself than addressing Isabelle. \"So, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Isabelle,\" she replied hoping that he wouldn't recognize her and soon leave. It didn't seem that he recognized her, but he didn't leave either, instead he moved closer to the edge of the water. \"Who are you? And what may I ask are you doing all the way out here?\" Isabelle tried to act as casual as she could, which was hard considering that the water was quite clear and she was competely nude. She was also trying not to sink as she had her arms crossed over her chest hoping that he would not see her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Saladeen but you can call me Sal, or Dean, but don't ever call me Lad...\" his voice trailed off as his eyes fell upon Isaiah's clothes hanging on a tree branch. Isabelle followed his gazed and silently cursed to herself, now he was going to find out and she'd have a lot of explaining to do and he'd probably ditch them not wanting to get involved or else start fawning over her like everyone else does which would just drive her completely insane. \"You see, the reason I'm out here,\" he began, not taking his eyes from the hanging clothes, \"is that I am looking for a friend of mine.\" Saladeen finally peeled his eyes from the clothes and stared directly into Isabelle's eyes, who found herself unable to look away. \"He goes by Isaiah, is 'bout yay high,\" he gestured to a height just above his shoulder, \"wears a hat and is covered in a lot o' dirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saladeen, Isaiah, what is taking you two so long? We need to get some rest and try to get out of here at day break before any more of those men find us. And...\" Daniel stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Saladeen staring at Isabelle who was no longer disguised as a boy. \"What's going on here? Saladeen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Daniel, good o' you ta join us. I just met Isabelle here, and was askin' her if she's seen Isaiah. Isaiah - I mean Isabelle, was just about to answer. Weren't ya?\" Saladeen never moved his eyes from Isabelle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Alright, I'l explain everything, but do you mind giving me my clothes so I can get out of the water and we can move into the light and warmth of the fire?\" Saladeen's eyes opened wide with the realization that she was naked and that he had been staring at her for quite awhile now. He turned his back and went to the campsite. Daniel retrieved the clothes from the branch and held them out to Isabelle with his back turned. \"You know its all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say a word Daniel. I had to get the blood off, its not my fault,\" she interrupted him as she yanked the clothes from his hands and hastily threw them on, once again disguising herself like a young man even though there was no longer a need since Daniel and Saladeen were the only other peope around and they knew she was no boy. Together they went back to their makeshift campsite and sat down around the fire with Saladeen. He merely sat there waiting for them to tell him why Isabelle had been cross dressing.</span></div></div>",

One of the king's advisors had it in his head that we were trouble, and one way or another he found a way to throw us out. Of course no one dared stand up to a king's advisor, seeing as how his orders usually come from the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, we are brother and sister,\" Daniel continued, used to creating stories on the spot to tell people at home, \"it just seemed to make sense to travel as two boys rather than risk mercenaries viewing us as vulnerable and setting their sights on Isabelle, though she is anything but vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see we did not have enough time to collect any supplies on our way out, and when we met you we were looking for somewhere to stay. Then Dillan showed up, but that did not change much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dillan was a fellow servant at the castle. He informed us that the castle was attacked late last night and fell to the forces of Radigan. Its really a miralce he escaped and got as far as he did. But all that means now, is that there is definately no chance whatsoever to return to the castle, not until Radigan is defeated, which who knows how long that could take. Now, that we've got that all sorted out, I suggest we get to sleep so we can leave before any more of his minions find us.\" Saladeen seemed to accept there explanation, at least for now and he and Daniel stood to go to sleep on the brushed off saddle blankets and leaves and branches that made up their beds. Isabelle remained by the fire still soaking wet, and, now that she was alone, shivering, for she did not want Daniel to worry or to appear weak before Saladeen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blazing fire danced and entranced Isabelle that she barely even noticed the cold seeping into her every being. Shadows surrounded her, cast by the flames of the fire, that she could not see the shadow looming behind her reaching towards her head. A moment later a hand reached out and took the hat from her head. \"Hey!\" she harshly whispered, hoping not to disturb the sleep of her companions, and jerked her head around. \"Saladeen, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya gonna get sick 'n die in them wet clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for putting it so delicately Saladeen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth 'n ya know it.\" Saladeen stepped into the light of the fire and sat down beside Isabelle, who was now able to see him saw that he had no shirt on. \"Take me shirt, change inta somethin' dry. Leave of the hat, and let ya hair dry too. I'd give ya me pants, but then I'd be walking 'round completely neked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you? Won't you be cold without your shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I'm used to sleepin' out in the cold, once I did have ta sleep without no clothes outside. And let me tell you, it weren't atall conforteble with all them twigs 'n rocks 'n leaves 'n bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Saladeen.\" He began to walk away as Isabelle changed her shirt, it was too big for her, but she was used to wearing boys clothing that did not fit. \"By the way,\" Isabelle gently called after him, he turned around and waited for the rest, \"I've noticed that sometimes you speak perfectly proper, and other times it gets difficult to know exactly what it is you're talking about. Could you explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't tell nobody, but I have had some schoolin'. There was this girl at one of the places I worked, she lived there for awhile, well she decided to help me learn some stuff. So I started to learn to talk well 'mong other things, but in between lessons I had to talk like I was stupid, 'cause otherwise my sentences really would make no sense, half proper, half stupid. So, she taught me to talk all nice 'n respecable like, but there ain't no one gonna believe a lowly little homeless servant like me talkin' so good. It's just easier to talk like I ain't got no sense. 'Sides, it's lots a fun watchin' the faces o' nobles and such when I talk to 'em like this 'n they have no idea what I say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I see. It is sort of like me and dressing like a boy, I could dress like a girl and get all dolled up if I so choose, but its just easier, not to mention more comfortable this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, well I'll bid ya good night then young sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle smiled, \"Good night.\" In a few moments all were asleep and the forest fell silent except for the occassional cricket's song or owl's hoot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the early hour of dawn before the sun had completely emerged from beyond the horizon Isabelle awoke. She was used to waking early in order to sneak out of the castle before anyone saw her, so she was rested, refreshed, and wide awake. Isabelle sat up and remembered that Saladeen had given her his shirt to wear over night. The fire was still burning, though significantly less brightly as the night before and it had thoroughly dried her shirt and hat. Daniel and Saladeen were both still asleep so she was free to change without fear of either of them seeing her. As she put on her shirt and hat and dirtied her face with dirt and ash, Isabelle let Saladeen's shirt finish drying and warming by the fire. Once Isabelle felt she again looked like a young man she retrieved the shirt and draped it over Saladeen's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle sat by the fire watching it slowly extinguish and when only the glowing embers were left and the sun in the sky she rose. Seeing that both boys were still deep in sleep she thought, <i>Those two. How can they sleep so late? And I thought my ladies in waiting and the other ladies of the court were lazy</i>, and she decided to explore the immediate vicinity of their campsite. A few yards away she found some berries that looked exactly like those sometimes served at the castle. She washed them in the river and packed them in one of the saddle bags after tasting a few for herself, all the while listening and humming a tune along with the birds singing good morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fire completely extinguished and not a sign of heat left in the fire pit, Isabelle was ready - not to mention eager - to get going. An amusing idea in her head Isabelle hid behind the horses and called out, first in her own voice, \"Daneil! Saladeen! Hlep me! No! Ahhh!\" then in a much deeper raspier voice, \"Shut up girl, don't make me hurt you. Radigan wants you alive.\" Daniel and Saladeen awoke with a start and leap to their feet frantically looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything happens to her I'll never forgive myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find her. We have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good morning boys. A girl could get kidnapped,\" Isabelle smirked as she walked from behind the horses, \"waiting for you two to wake up. You're just lucky I know how to take care of myself. Oh and I found some berries and packed them along with a canteen of water in the saddle bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle don't you ever do that to me again,\" Daniel sternly commanded. Saladeen simply smiled and mounted his horse. Daniel mounted his shortly after and helped Isabelle onto the saddle behind him. None of them talked for awhile, they merely rode in silence. After an hour or so Saladeen finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a brilliant prank Isabelle. Our faces musta been a sight ta see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They truly were.\" They both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not at all funny. Do you have any idea how much trouble we'd be in if you really had been kidnapped, and what if it was Radigan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Daniel. It was just a joke.\" Saladeen couldn't know how much danger the kingdom would be in if Radigan did get a hold of her. Isabelle knew, but she was not yet prepared to accept that possiblity, so she just smiled and shrugged it off.</span></div></div>",

Daniel grunted, but then said \"Who are you?\" \"Why I was just about to ask that myself. My name is Slash Bird, yes I know it was weird and cool for my parents to name me that.

Start at the stables, across the King's field, to the forrest's edge, and back. They never dared venture into the forrest. Rumor had it the place was haunted. Others said it was cursed.

Within an hour the entire staff was searching for the King and Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you found them yet?\" Isabelle inquired of a couple of servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry your Highness, but we still do not know where your parents are,\" they bowed their heads in remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, it was concluded that the King and Queen were gone, and that no one knew where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Isabelle was quite perturbed. She was sitting on her parents' bed wondering what had happened to her parents. They weren't on any diplomatic missions or any pleasure trips. And what was she to do if they never returned? Isabelle wasn't ready to be Queen and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her thoughts were interupted by a servant entering her parents' bed chamber. \"Pardon the intrusion your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame, we have found no sign of what fate has befallen the King and Queen. What is it that you would like us to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she supposed to say - Isabelle wasn't ready to give out such orders. She never paid attention to what her parents did when they were working. \"Well, I suppose...I mean, summon my father's advisors immediately. Have them meet me in my father's conference room, there is much to discuss.... You are dimissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed and left. Well, that didn't go too badly. Isabelle was going to have to get used to all this. Until her parents' return she would have to be in charge.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, she was awoken early that morning when the advisors finally arrived. She got dressed and went to the conference room. \"Good morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stood as she entered the room, \"Good morning your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the head of the table and motion for them to sit. There were about 8 advisors. Isabelle had often seen them in here at the exact same seats the were now. The only difference was that is was her father sittng wher she now sat. Even though she had often seen them and even sat in during some of the discussions, she knew none of their names. As she sat there in her reverie the advisors began agruing on what to do. She didn't even notice until it got too loud for her to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence,\" she comanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all stunned, none of them thought she had it in her. \"Sorry, M'Lady,\" one of them spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, but we do have a lot to talk about and it might go better if everyone wasn't speaking at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we begin? What should be done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room immediately erupted in discussion once again. This time Isabelle stayed silent looking around the room. After a few minutes the advisors finally caught on that she was waiting and they quieted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne finally spoke, \"Well, I think that we should try to keep this all quiet. If the kingdom found out that the King and Queen are missing there will be mass hysteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" another argued. \"The people should know. Maybe one of them knows somehting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third then chimed in, \"I agree, besides they will catch on when we assemble the army. They'll know somehting is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth, \"Who said anything about assembling the army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. The King and Queen may have been kidnapped. We are vulnerable to attack with them missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the King and Queen gone, Princess Isabelle would be left as high commander of the army. Assembly the army will unnerve neighboring kingdoms, they may even think we are preparing to attack them and make the first move and attack us, and, no offense your Highness, but she is no where near ready for a full scale war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" she replied. Since, the advisors were once again arguing, almost screaming at each other, she sat in silence waiting. After several more minutes they caught on and ceased their arguements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your Highness?\"</span></div></div>",

There were normal humans, humans who could do magic, elves, fairies, sorcorers, dragons, unicorns, pegasuses, and so much more. All lived in peace and harmony, but as time went on, humans became greedy, and sought to exploit the powers of others. Magnificent animals were hunted out of fear and for sport. those with powers would enslaved and forced to use their powers against others.  Soon magical beings and animals were forced into hiding, it is even said that some left for a distant galaxy in another dimension, and over time existance faded into mere myths and legends. However, before they left, the Ladys of the Stars, who are said to have of been stars before they came to our planet and still visit there kin at night, foresaw an evil that would rise and destroy everything. So, as a precaution, all took their most powerful items and put them an enchanted chest and hid it for future generations to find when the evil finally arose. Soon after they were forced to leave their homes due to the human threat. Leaving behind the Treasure of Romosa for when it would be needed. The Treasure of Romosa contains all forms of artifacts and magics, no one except for those who put together the treaure knows what it contains.\" The mysterious book went on the describe that which the treasure supposedly contained, and rumors of where it was said to reside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe an of this could be true. But there's something about it, something in the pit of my stomach telling me that it is,\" Isabelle commented aloud. Just then a thought struck her. \"Maybe this Treasure of Romosa holds something that could aid me in locating my parents, and bringing them home. Not only that, but once they're home, it could be a great advantage in the war with Radigan. Its perfect, there are several places listed where it was said to be, I'm sure that with some help I could find it.

However, right now it was the only blessing.

A black rider, magnificent on the jet horses every messenger used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she abandoned her notes to the wind and raced out to where the guards were questioning him, almost tripping on her skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, noble messenger!\" She shouted in her best 'I am royalty' voice.

This room was used mostly for talks of war, taxes, and the like, but today, it seemed it was for talks of myths, legends and treasure seeking. Curious to learn what had the king so intrigued, Isabelle and Daniel hid in the passageway and eavesdropped into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward, why are we even having this conversation? It's a myth, an old wives tale, its not real,\" came the soft voice of the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you see Jasmine, there's finally proof that it isn't just a myth, that its real and that its everything that it is said to be,\" the king insisted as the queen let out an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward, my darling, I know you want to believe this, but this so called proof is probably fake as well. Just some local peasant trying to entertain himself,\" she continued to try to conince him, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, I know for a fact that it is real, and it's contents can help turn the tides on this war. We will finally have the upperhand over Radigan. Now I know that it is real, and I know it can help us win this war. So can we please stop arguing about it,\" he concluded refusing to argue anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the queen was opening her mouth to respond the king's advisors entered the room silencing her unspoken arguement. \"M'Lord, you wished to see us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I understand that you have found proof that the legendary Treasure of Malor exists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, M'Lord we have. This is all the information we have on the treasure,\" an advisor replied handed a packet over to the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wonderful,\" the king thumbed through the packet. \"Do you believe that with this information a small group of skilled knights will be able to reach the treasure and bring it back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course M'Lord, but only if they are the best, for there are several dangers and tasks that must be overcome to reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you that will be all,\" and he dismisssed them with a wave of his hand. They bowed and backed out of the room. \"Well, Jasmine what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to think. I can't believe that such intellegent men would make a mistake, but I can't believe that the Treasure of Malor exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do, and in the morning we will send out for our best knights. Once they arrive here we will prepare them to go and bring back the treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the king and queen left the room. Once it was positive that no one was left, Isabelle and Daniel came out of the passageway awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe...\" \"I know, a treasure...\" was all they could say for minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful to go on such an amazing treasure hunt,\" Isabelle finally replied dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Daniel came out of his reverie. \"That would be great, but only the best knights are going to be able to go. I wish I was a knight, its always been my dream, to become a knight and do knightly stuff like going on this treasure hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Isabelle jumped up as if where she was standing was suddenly on fire. \"Why don't we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous. Could you imagine, a stable boy and a princess on a real treasure hunt facing all those dangers? Eveyone would laugh at the thought. And could you imagine what your parents would do if we asked them to go? That would be so funny to see their faces,\" Daniel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said they'd have to know?\" The seriousness on her face ceased Daniel's laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. We could do it. We're smart, and from watching the knights and training you to be a knight we know how to fight. Not to mention this,\" she smiled as she picked up the packet with all the information about the treasure. This made Daniel smile as well.</span></div></div>",

And it's not like it is <i>that</i> dangerous in the outside world. A feeling of doubt crossed her features briefly, but she quickly pushed it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew where Daniel was, most likely in the stable quickly packing his things and would no doubt be waiting for Isabelle outside the barn. Even though the idea to leave was hers, she didn't know how she could part from her parents, without so much as a goodbye. However, she knew that Daniel would be waiting for her and that if she said goodbye to her parents that would lead to immeadiate grounding. Choices choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweeping her long black her into a low sitting ponytail, the princess pulled a peice of stationary from the notebook she always carried in her knapsack. Hastily jotting down a scramble of words, she slipped the letter onto the top of her un-slept bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think that it would be this hard to leave,\" Isabelle thought to herself, as she slipped out her window as she had done many times in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had always been her window to a world outside the palace, with all it's prim and magnificent beauty, and as Isabelle saw his shadow standing by the barn, waiting for her, she never appreciated him more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, on \"borrowed\" horses, the two friends carefully and quietly made their way out of the castle walls and into the real world.   </span></div></div>",

Well, she has no time to worry that something may be helping her, at least not until she saves the Magician.] Quickly, she grabs it and puts it on the floor in front of her.

[Anna isn't sure, but she is probably wise in her decision not to look too closely about exactly how the demoness is holding the rat.]  \"Don't you worry, darling, we'll have you back in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's the right rat?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Of course.  You doubt me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, I was wrong, so ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You are not me.  Now bring the drink over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Anna does, and sets it down as indicated.  Then the rat is encouraged to drink, in fact almost forced to.  And this rat too begins to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later, the rat is an almost generic picture of an elderly mage.  Then he is a picture of a very startled mage, due to the demoness leaping all over him.  \"Darling!  You are back!  And at last we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Anna in the meantime is trying not to look in the corner of the room where she somehow knows there is now a bed that wasn't there a few minutes ago.  There are just so many reasons she does not want to confirm that.  Instead she interrupts with \"Lord Magician.  The King demands your presence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He can wait a few minutes ... or maybe a week!... Can't he?\"  The look on the demoness' face would have been easily recognized by any well-trained husband as a demand he put her ahead of any mere royal duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grabs a potion bottle and throws it at the magician.  She misses, but the bottle simply floats back to her, and she throws it again.  This time her aim is better, but it comes to a stop an inch from his nose.  <br>\r\n   As it floats back to the demoness, she grabs other bottles and plates and starts throwing them.  These too are somehow blocked from actually hitting the magician, but he is wisely backing to the door.  Anna doesn't wait for him to exit, but is out in the passage well ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a \"I'll be back as soon as I can.\"  the magician slams the door behind him.  There is a crash of something hitting it.  \"That went better than I expected.\" is the magician's comment as he leans against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That went well?\" a still shocked Anna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh yes, I was expecting...Oh, that can wait.

She can't put anything close to a name on it, but there is some reason, some probably crazy reason, this is right for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, it really doesn't matter for now.

You may have guessed there are risks, but your king expects you to do your duty.\"<br>\r\n    \"Take her to the princess's quarters.\" The king commands the wizard.  \"One of Our daughter's failings was a tendency to sleep in and so you can do what is necessary and she can rise as my 'daughter', and nobody should be the wiser.\"<br>\r\n    \"In an hour, you should be reprimanding your 'daughter' for her laziness again.\" the magician answers.  After a bow that was hardly as deep as Anna feels it should have been, he straightens and holds up his hand.  A dazzling set of lights flow from it and flow down around him and Anna, cutting off all view of the room.<br>\r\n    When the lights vanish, Anna and the mage are in a different room, the princess's sleeping quarters, where she had found the princess missing, and her note, an amazingly short time ago.  \"Ah, good.  The princess left her sleep clothes.\" The mage announces.  \"Put them on, and climb into bed.  When you wake, remember you are the princess and just act as you think the princess would act, or perhaps better, as you think she should act.\"<br>\r\n    As Anna darts behind a screen to change, she realizes the mage is right.  She may not be able to perfectly imitate the princess, but she could be a better princess than the Princess.  Most everybody would deem any errors on her part to be the princess finally growing up and behaving properly.  This is not going to be easy, but it may not be difficult.<br>\r\n    There is one question she has as she climbs into the princess's, now her, bed.  \"Could you tell me about the prophecy?\"<br>\r\n    \"Not in full now,\" the magician partly refused, \"Harmon the Mad wrote a hundred very obscure prophecies and if you read them in just the right way, about half of them have been extremely accurate, tho I am not aware of anyone who has correctly figured out in advance what any of them meant.  One of those that has not yet come true talks of a princess of this kingdom doing a miracle in its hour of need.  Your 'father' is hoping that one is about to come true and is making efforts to see that it does, which requires that you be the 'princess' until the real one succeeds or fails in producing that miracle.  Now sleep.  When you wake, you will be the princess to nearly all eyes.\"<br>\r\n    Anna suddenly finds it impossible to stay awake and she is sleeping before her head can hit the pillow.  The next thing she knows, someone is almost whispering \"My lady.  It is time for your breakfast...\"<br>\r\n    A confused idea that she had fallen asleep on duty causes Anna to jerk upright and terrify the maid who was trying to waken her.  Anna recognizes her as Terra, a woman quite scared of the princess, and now scared of Anna, which gives Anna feelings of triumph and guilt.  If she had not become the princess, poor Terra would not be cowering in fright.  But the very fact she is shows that Anna is now the princess to the view of almost anybody.<br>\r\n   Today will be most interesting...     </span></div></div>",

Most of the day was spent travelling on horseback while talking about their plans, among other things. After coming to a fork in the road, some arguing, and double, even triple checking of the info packet they took the path into the dark forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the knights halted his horse and began looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Donovan?\" inquired another knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan looked around once more before he started his horse and replied, \"I guess it was nothing Andrew, but I could have sworn I heard something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute another knight stopped his horse and drew his sword, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what did you see Thomas?\" asked the fifth knight drawing his bow and arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw two riders in the woods. I believe I saw them earlier but thought nothing of it then, now it seems they may be following us. But they're gone now, Bernard,\" Thomas answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on without any further discussion of the two mysterious riders. After another half hour they reached a clearing and decided to make camp for the night and set off in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the knights know that they were being followed and the two riders were watching them and preparing to set up camp as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be a good place for the night. It's well hidden from the knights and we shouldn't be bothered by any wild animals,\" one of the riders, apparently male, spoke from beneath his hooded cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second continued to look around uncertain. From beneath the hood came a soft female voice, \"Are you sure we'll be safe? And that the knights won't see us? They almost did earlier and if they find us they'll send us home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine. Are you sure we should tell them we're here and that we want to help them?\" the male asked while starting to unpack some sleeping bags and other things needed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, if they find us they'll send us home. They may even take us home and lose valuable time that could be used to find the treasure,\" the female responded, helping him set up camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's the knights go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were looking at the knights' camp, but seeing no knights. \"I don't know, they left all their stuff there, maybe they went for firewood,\" the female suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they already have a fire, and look there's a large pile of firewood. Maybe we should check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait a few minutes. If they're not back in a few minutes we'll investagate, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and knights still had not returned to their seemingly abandoned campsite. So the two hooded riders ventured from their own campsite to inspect that of the knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as if they just dropped everything and left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wonder why.\"</span></div></div>",

Just as the two had reached the dying fire they felt cold steel pressed againsted their throats and could sense the two arrowas that were now aimed directly at their hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move, and you may live through this,\" instructed the knight called Thomas as he added wood to the fire to shine light upon the situation. \"Who are you and why are you following us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither riders answered. They tried to look to the other with a questioning look in order to try and decide what to do, but the swords pressed to their throats stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You refuse to answer then? Well, I guess we will have to restrain you,\" he signalled to the two knights with the bows and arrows, the two called Bernard and Jonothan. They then gathered some rope and tied the riders' hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets remove those hoods and see who you are,\" Thomas continued walking up to the male rider and removed his hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas,\" Donovan said. \"I know this boy, he's only about seventeen. He's the stable boy at the castle, Daniel. Why would he be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see who his partner is,\" Thomas replied reaching for the second rider's hood, but she squirmed out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izie, their going to find out anyways, there's nothing else we can do,\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izie?\" Jonothan repeated the name in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas finally got hold of the rider's hood and was able to remove it, but when he saw who was under it he nearly fell over in shock. \"Princess Isabelle!?!\" All the knights were stunned and didn't know what to do, they just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Isabelle finally spoke, \"Ahem, but now that you know who we are, do you mind untying us?\" She held up her bound wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knights just stood there, still stunned with shock. Andrew was the first to come out of it, \"Oh yeah, I'm so sorry Princess Isabelle, Daniel,\" and untied them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the knights had come back to their senses, they fetched Isabelle's and Daniel's supplies, brought them back to camp, and had prepared supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were all eating their meal Bernard was the one who was finally able to ask of Isabelle and Daniel, \"I apologize, but Daniel, your Highness, what are you doing here? Why were you following us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other knights all stopped eating, wanting to hear this explaination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Isabelle put down their plates and just looked at each other trying to decide what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they tell them the truth or lie?</span></div></div>",

She just kept thinking about her life, having to always be so proper, go to balls, have people walk on eggshells aorund her and mock her behind her back, and one day she would be married off to the prince of some neighboring kingdom, have children and force them to live the same life she had lived. This was something Isabelle did not want. She wanted adventure, freedom, and this quest could give her these things, if not it could atleast give her life some sense of accomplishment or make her be grateful for the life she has. However, it seemed that, that would not be possible. Deciding to take a break from her thoughts, Isabelle took a seat a few feet outside of their campsite and stared up at the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how wonderful it would be to be a star,\" she thought outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine the stars feel the same about humans.\" Isabelle was so entranced by the shimmering lights in the heavens that she didn't even notice when a figure came up beside her, and she slighting jumped at the sound of the knight's voice. \"Sorry princess, I did not mean to frighten you.\" Isabelle looked up at the face of the knight Andrew and saw that his eyes were just as alluring as the twinkling dots in the skies that had captivated her so only moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, I just wasn't expecting anyone else to be awake. What were you saying about the stars wishing they could be human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, well think about it. Stars don't get to meet new people, fall in love, look at something as beautiful as the stars, or anything else humans can do. Would you really be willing to give up such wonderful things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right, but I need some sort of escape from my life, especially since I probably won't be allowed to go on this quest for treasure.\" Isabelle stated as Andrew took a seat by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your life so confining that you would jump at such a dangerous escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Isabelle simply stated feeling that her answer needed no explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it is that important to you, I suppose I can speak with the others. I mean, the treasure would be very useful in the fight against Radigan, and having you and Daniel around could get us quite a few benefits on the way. We'll decide everything in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Andrew. You have always been so kind to me. Thank you, thank you, thank you,\" she repeated as she took him in a tight embrace. They stayed seated for awhile longer once again staring up at the stars, and soon they returned to bed, this time all slept soundly.</span></div></div>",

She sat bolt upright while a hand swiftly covered her mouth and a voice whispered in her ear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, be very quiet, we are not alone here.\" It was the voice of one of the knights, but Isabelle could not distinguish it between the others due to its low volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for her eyes to adjust to the dark. There was a hint of sunlight far off on the horizon, but Isabelle did not see anything in their immediate vicinity. The knight removed his hand and helped Isabelle to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\" Isabelle inquire, but was quickly silenced by the knight, now distinguishable as Donovan, brought his finger to his lip as a signal to hush. Looking around she saw that all the other knights were up and looked ready for battle, even Daniel was equipped with a sword and dagger. Donovan handed the princess a dagger, which she took, well educated in the art of sword fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel moved to Isabelle's side, and with Donovan there as well, she felt like a rare china doll they were trying to protect from scratches. It seemed apparent that she would not be able to get two feet of space from them, so she simply remained where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA petrifying screech invaded her ears, and a blinding light forced her to bring her arms to her face in order to shield her eyes. When Isabelle finally lowered her arms, she saw a battle raging on. The knights and Daniel, no longer by her side, were sparring with men dressed in black. She could not see anything of these strange men but the black cloaks they wore. They outnumbered the knights more than two to one, but they were fairing well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was shocked from her observations when Bernard called for her to watch her back. A second later she saw one of these cloaked strangers charging after her with his sword held high. Isabelle prepared herself for his strike and raised her dagger ready to return the strike. She dodged his sword and plunged her dagger into his side. As she was retrieving the dagger, Isabelle sensed someone behind her. She turned around just in time to see another man about to strike her being cut down by Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Isabelle saw that several cloaked men remained, but their numbers were rapidly decreasing. She had no time, however, to revel in the knights impending victory, as an eerie voice, seemingly floating in the air, hissed her name. The young princess spun around, but saw nothing before she toppled over the corpse of a fallen cloaked man. She tilted her head and watched as Daniel killed the last attacker. Isabelle sat up preparing to rise to her feet, but once she was sitting up she witnessed a strange sight. The body over which she had fallen turned to a dark mist and quickly dissapated, as did all the other bodies. Too shocked to stand Isabelle remained where she was until Bernard offered his hand, which she graciously took, and he helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle, they all were exhausted. Daniel was seated upon a tree stump breathing heavily. Donovan had his hand on Daniel's back breathing just as deeply, though less than Daniel. Jonothan had stuck his sword tip into the ground and was on one knee leaning upon it. Bernard stood beside Isabelle, cleaning and resheathing his sword. Thomas merely stared off into the distance. All were quiet, for a calmness had descended upon them all.</span></div></div>",

Perfect weather for the adventure they would soon embark on. With Isabelle's arms loosely dangling around his neck, Daniel was preparing to release her and let her fall the ground to repay her for turning him into a horse, a baby horse no less. Unfortunatly, he did not do so soon enough, for immediately Isabelle's hands were over his eyes blocking his view. He wandered around well enough for a time, but a root jutting from the ground soon brought him back to a place he has spent most of his time since he met the princess - the ground. Isabelle rolled off him onto her back beside him when Daniel fell face first into the soiled and held her sides in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just stay on the ground,\" Daniel suggested as he turned onto his back and laced his fingers behind his head. \"I'll live on the ground, crawl to get anywhere, and make the animals lay down so that I can clean them, though they'll just get dirty laying on the ground so there'd be no point in cleaning them at all. But you're always knocking me down so its futile to even try to stay on my feet for more than a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know you don't mind,\" the young princess replied while straightening out her skirt again before lacing her fingers behing her head and gazing up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. You're right.\" He followed suit and also looked at the balls of fluff in the sky. \"Hey that cloud there looks like a lion.\" Daniel pointed at a cloud, and Isabelle nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one there looks like a tree.\" Both took turns pointing to a cloud and calling out what it looked like, though neither saw what, if anything, the other saw in the clouds they pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, a castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one looks like a rainbow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, that is a rainbow you dolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, there's something poking me.\" Isabelle reached under her back and pulled a long stick out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey those clouds look like two warriors sword fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that too.\" Isabelle arose from the ground, stick still in hand. \"What do you say we sword fight? Or rather, play at sword fighting with sticks.\"</span></div></div>",

Finally finding one appropriate stick, he rose to his feet and standing before Isabelle poised himself to fight. \"On guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us begin.\" Isabelle made the first move, striking at Daniel a few times, only to have him block her attempts. In turn he lunged at her, she dodged the blade before once again attacking Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a short distance from where the two were play fighting, just outside the stables, five knights were packing several saddle bags and talking amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is foolishness!\" one shouted, obviously irritated. \"We are on a mission to locate and retrieve a treasure which may prove to aid our kingdom in the coming war. How can we be expected to baby sit two infants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas calm yourself,\" another responded. \"First of all, they are not that young, and Daniel is training to become a knight, he won't be in our way. And just think of the advantages we'll have passing through villages with the princess by our side. Second, King Edward himself asked us to allow them to come with us. It would be treason not to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew is right Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jonothan,\" Andrew interupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to gloat Andrew,\" Jonothan continued. \"Beside, its amusing watching those two. They are very odd and do random things. It is also interesting watching those two continually flirting, but it seems they do not see their feelings for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irritating is more like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that Donovan?\" Andrew inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are always all over each other. I wish they would just kiss or something and be done with it,\" Donovan replied. \"Am I right Bernard or am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're right at all,\" Bernard answered looking over at Daniel and Isabelle sword fighting with sticks. He smiled to himself and went back to packing a few more saddle bags. \"True, those two do everything together, but they are merely friends. They may even see each other as brother and sister, but nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think, but I still say those two have a lot of sexual tension to work through.\"<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel swung his stick and disarmed Isabelle of hers. She quickly turned around to reach for her fallen stick, but Daniel had already positioned his stick before her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I win. Do you want to try again?\" Daniel gloated. His satisfaction was short lived and ended with Isabelle's elbow in his gut. \"OW!\" He dropped the stick and clutched at his bruised stomach. \"That was unfair, and completely unwarranted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for gloating.\" Isabelle giggled and picked up Daniel's dropped stick pointing it at Daniel's throat. \"And who did you say won?\"</span></div></div>",

Though caught off guard, Daniel was able to swiftly raise his hand and catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a rematch Daniel, or would you prefer to quit while I'm ahead?\" Isabelle smirked. A moment later Daniel brought his stick down upon Isabelle who just barely blocked the blow. Neither said another word as they recommenced the process of attacks and blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\nBy the stables the knights had already finished packing several bags and were letting the horses eat and rest. They were now with their families spending as much time with them as they could before they left and saying their goodbyes, all except for Bernard. Bernard had already said goodbyes to the few people he needed to and was using his remaining time to rest, plan, and clear his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Bernard was once again watching Daniel and Isabelle play fighting. True they were very close, but he was almost positive that they saw each other as nothing more than brother and sister, if that. Bernard was the youngest of the five knights at twenty years old. His father and grandfather, and possibly farther back than that had all been knights, so he had been trainging since he could walk. It was always known that he would become a knight, even the king and queen knew it, they just had to wait until he was old enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow watching the two playing, Bernard thought back. As a child he and Daniel had become close, Daniel always helped him train and was practically a brother to him. He did not know Isabelle well, but she was a sweet girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready packed and having said his goodbyes, Bernard made his way toward Daniel and Isabelle, they would need to pack some things soon.<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, if you can't even beat me how do you expect to become a knight?\" Isabelle jokingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sell yourself short, you've been training about as long as I have. Besides, how can you be so sure I'm not going easy on you?\" Daniel contested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know how well you fight, and she's the one going easy on you.\" Daniel and Isabelle turned to see Bernard leaning against a tree trunk a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How true,\" Isabelle smirked. Daniel saw and used his free hand to push Isabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you today Bernard?\" Daniel asked. \"Are you ready for our little <i>treasure hunt</i> tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, what about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought.\"</span></div></div>",

Come have a seat by me.\" The advisors moved around so that she could sit beside her father. Before sitting down, Isabelle glanced at her mother, who smiled, but Isabelle could see that she wasn't really happy. Whatever her father wanted to talk to her about must be important and something she wouldn't like, otherwise he wouldn't have his advisors there to try and convince her it was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a very important issue to discuss.\" Everyone in the room remained still. \"Isabelle, you are sixteen years old, and we have been putting it off for awhile now, but its time for you to be married. We have just finished negotiations with the King of Callorn. His eldest son is nineteen years of age and looking for a bride. Contracts have been signed, and you and Prince Hector are now betrothed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Isabelle screamed and stood up so fast her chair fell with a loud thud silencing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle, mind your manners,\" the King told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry father, but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the thing is your Highness,\" one of the advisors chimed in, but quickly quieted at the glare he got from Isabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is that you are of age and must be wed,\" another braver advisor continued. \"Your father won't be around forever and before his time is up you need to be wed and working on an heir. The kingdom needs a king. No offense your Majesties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention,\" another added, \"that Radigan is still after the kingdom and we can't have any weaknesses any vulnerabilites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need some time to think.

This silence of yours could have the holy monks pleading with you to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward dear. I just can't help feeling that what we're doing isn't the right thing. It is not fair to Isabelle, and as you can plainly see she won't accept it. She has a strong spirit, and she's as stubborn as a mule. You're going to have to do your share of pleading to convince her to go through with this wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, she is rather incorrigible. But it would be nearly impossible to back out of the marriage contracts with the King of Callorn without starting a war between our already uneasy kingdoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly, but not quite impossible darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are right. Hopefully he will understand. At the least he may allow us to postpone the ceramony a fe years, long enough for Isabelle and Hector to learn more of each other and maybe even form a relationship on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word was said the door opened and a timid little servant walked in, refusing to lift his eyes off the floor to look at their majesties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begging your pardon for the intrusion your royal majesties. But a Prince Hector of Callorn is here seeking an audience with you.\" The king and queen lock eyes for a moment before signaling to the servant to let him in. Queen Jasmine resumes the chair she occupied when they broke the news to Isabelle while King Edward rises to greet their guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Hector walked in, in his richly tailored garments looking kind and generous, but there was something about his eyes that just didn't look right. They never seemed to stay one color - though most just played it off as a trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my unannounced visit, but there are a few things still to be arranged your majesties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite alright. And there is no need to be so formal, we are soon to be family.\" Kind Edward gestured for Hector to sit down, and once he had done so Edward also took his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. That is why I am here. You see, a wedding is a lot of work and we really should get started on the arrangments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the thing is Hector, we've told Isabelle and she is not at all pleased. So we have been talking it over, and we feel it may be better if we cancel, or at least postpone, the wedding.

She made her way to the door and asked one of the servants waiting outside to fetch them some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are pleased. No king wants to renegotiate a contract and we were not sure how your father would react to our altering our deal.

Now, no one in the room saw (and were you there you wouldn't have seen it either) but that prince put something in those drinks and he may have even said something under his breath, but it was even less noticable than what he did to those cups of tea. He only did something to two cups, and those he gave to the king and queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go your majesties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector, I've told you there is no need to be so formal with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I apologize.\" He brought the cup to his mouth, but he did not drink.

It didn't look like either he or Queen Jasmine were all there. They had blank expressions on their faces and their minds appeared to be in another world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we said Hector, Isabelle isn't ready to be married,\" Jasmine replied. \"But we can try to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking. If she doesn't learn some obedience no other prince will take her, and things won't be easy for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am willing to marry her, but it has to be right away. The sooner we are wed, the sooner she will learn to love me. It is all for the better that we be wed immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The sooner the better.\" Their vocies were emotionless, but Hector wasn't put off by this. He looked pleased and he kept pushing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can organize all the necessary preparations, and we could be wed, why tomorrow evening. All you have to do is have Isabelle there on time, and convince her to say 'I do' when the time comes. Do we have an agreement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king and queen nodded their heads, still looking off into the nothingless and meekly replied, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.

This would have softened any parent's heart, but unfortunately these two were still under the influence of their modified cups of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle, we need to speak,\" her father said in his empty monotone. Isabelle showed no sign of having heard what he said, or even of knowing they were standing a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have wonderful news for you.\" Her mother's voice echoed that of her father's. At hearing this Isabelle swirled around in her chair to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I don't have to get married?!\" She was leaping from her seat ready to jump into the arms of the king and queen and embrace them in a loving hug, but her heart shattered when they voiced their reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we have moved up the wedding date. It will take place tomorrow afternoon.\" Isabelle returned to her sitting position and again stared out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" she whispered. Whether is was whatever compassion they had for her, or lack there of, Kind Edward and Queen Jasmine obeyed their daughter's command. Tears once again stained the fair skin of the young princess. Supper was brought to her by one of the servants, and when he returned to retrieve her plate he found that not only had she not touched the food, but she had not moved from her place before the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the lights extinguished and only minute amounts of starlight filtering through the windows no one saw or heard when young Isabelle slipped into her bed for a peaceful night. She woke up rested and refreshed without a care n the world, that is until she realized that the events of the previous night had not been some terrible nightmare as she had hoped. Luckily she did not have long to dwell on this fact, for a moment later she found that her parents were seated by the window she had been so attached to the night before. Still clutching to her covers, Isabelle brought herself to an upright position and stared intently at her parents refusing to say the first word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Isabelle. We were cruel last night. We didn't try to explain anything or to comfort you, and for that we sincerely apologize.\" The king's voice held much sorrow and guilt, and it was obvious how much he cared for the daughter he had so severely wronged. Her mother on the other could not bring herself to say a word, and she looked to be on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you will reconsider, put an end to this marriage nonsense, and let me live my life?\" Isabelle's voice was not cold, instead it mirrored that of her parents' the previous night. At this point Queen Jasmine's silent tears began to fall. With his arm around his wife, Kind Edward replied:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that just isn't possible. Prince Hector already has the entire wedding planned out, everything is arranged. And from the impression I got from him last night, neither he nor his father will be pleased to hear that we wish to cancel at the last moment. If we do not go through with this, I fear that the kingdom of Callorn will declare war on us. Even if we win the war, the damage will be immeasureable, much of it will be unrepairable, not to mention the lives that will be lost. The kingdom will stand by our decision if it comes to that, but their is a small rebel force building, and a war could increase their numbers and power, and we will be forced to fight a war among ourselves. I can't let that happen, and as the crowned princess, neither should you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there for what seemed hours; Isabelle thinking the matter over, the king awaiting her decision ready to declare war if she wanted, and the queen silently weeping to herself afraid of losing her daughter either to this Prince Hector or both to war(whether if be abroad or in their backyard).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Isabelle?\"</span></div></div>",

Not to mention that one of the stars had been plucked from the dark blanket covering the air and made into the ring now resting on her finger. Isabelle sat before the fire in her new bedroom. It had been beautifully furnished and the canopy king sized bed looked very inviting, but Isabelle wasn't ready for sleep. Instead she was reminiscing on the events of the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Hector had been very effecient. He had every little detail planed for the wedding, given how short a time he had to do so it was quite the accomplishment, he'd even picked out Isabelle's wedding gown. She had to admit that she couldn't have found a more perfect dress if she could have pulled one out of her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had to do was to have her gown fitted. Then she merely had to wait for the big moment. She had spent her time either with her parents or with Daniel. Isabelle and her parents did not always have much time to spend together, but this time was tainted with the knowledge that soon Isabelle would be handed over to a stranger against all of their wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time with Daniel was refreshing, Isabelle could complain, reasure herself and Daniel that what she was doing was the right thing, and once she was finished they could go have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding had come and gone, more like a dream than anything else, a strange misty auror surrounding everything - except for the groom which at the time Isabelle had found incredibly odd - a cool breeze and the soft sound of music floating on the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd said there I do's, but Isabelle dreaded when the priest would finally say, \"You may kiss the bride.\" Luckily when the time came, it didn't turn into the nightmare she had expected. Prince Hector, her...husband, placed his hand beneath her chin and when he lifted her head and looked into her eyes, he kissed her so gently, just barely brushing his lips against her, and it only lasted a couple of seconds. It suprised Isabelle, but she was glad that this man, this stranger, her husband, had not tried to force it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe escorted her to the reception, a pleasantly enjoyable celebration, and she genuinely had a nice time. Prince Hector then escorted her to the room they would share from then on as a married couple. He had told her that he would say their goodbyes to the guests, that he had some things to talk over with her, rather their parents, and that he would be back later, that she could go through some of the gifts they had received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle had resigned herself to her seat before the fire thinking, <i>This is all so sureal. I am only sixteen years of age, I've never had any romantic feelings for anyone, or even any dreams where I was romantically involved with anyone. Now I'm married to a complete stranger, however, he does seem like a really sweet and chivalrous man. Maybe one day I can get used to the idea of being married to him, perhaps even grow fond of him. But whatever will I do when he comes back. What if like every man out there he wants to, umm, consummate our marriage?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the squeaking of Daniel emerging from the hidden passaeway concealed by one of the many tapestries in the room. He had his arm in front of his face shielding his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe for me to look, or are you and the husband, ahem, busy?\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Daniel, its safe. Prin - I mean Hector isn't here at the moment. And even if he was, how could you think I would do that the first day I meet the guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did marry him the moment you met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I had no choice. So then what are you doing here, for all you know we may have been in the middle of something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle, I've known you practically our whole lives, I like to think I know you better than that. Besies, I saw your Prince Hector speaking with your parents a little while ago.\"</span></div></div>",

You know, being married and all, I'm going to be experiencing so many new things. The presents never crossed my mind.\" She saw him shaking yet another present and smiled. \"If you're that eager to know what's in them, you can go ahead and open some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I think I will. Hmm...this one looks promising.\" Tearing the gift wrap to pieces, Daniel unwrapped one of the presents to reveal a slender box. Daniel removed the lid and smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And promising it is. Lookie here Isabelle. I think this is more of a present for the Prince than for you. This one looks nice though.\" He pulled an elegant satin night gown from the box and held it up for Isabelle to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one of the other hand, well, its more appropriate for a wedding night.\" The smirk on his face grew to unusual proportions as he pulled out some rather revealing lingerie and placed the box on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Why would someone give me something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Isabelle, you are married now. It only makes sense that you will wear something like this at least once. Why don't you try it on, see how it looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He put on his most innocent face and his biggest puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to put that on, for you or anyone, even if I wasn't, and especially because I am, married.\" Daniel looked so disappointed at first, but only for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I wonder what's in these other presents. You'll be sure to tell me right? Good, because it's getting late and I should go check on the animals before I go home. Besides, I wouldn't want your husband to walk in to find another man with his wife.\" And he bagen making his way to the secret passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Daniel.\" Isabelle stood and gave Daniel a light kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night your highness.\" Daniel bowed, smiled, and disappeared behind the tapestry into the passageway. Isabelle giggled at his formality and his bow, then sauntered over to the presents. She picked up the satin night gown and couldn't hlep but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was right, it is exceedingly lovely. Well, I guess there's no harm in just trying it on.\" She undressed and slipped on the night gown. \"This satin is so soft and smooth, and this night gown is so comfortable. I must remember to thank whoever gave this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should thank them as well,\" a deep voice came from behind her. Isabelle reached for blanket to cover herself as she spun around to come face to face with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're married now, there's no need to cover up such a beautiful form.\" He softly pulled the blanket from her fingers and allowed it to fall into a heap on the floor by their feet. Taking Isabelle's hands, Hector lead her to the bed and sat her down. He sat down beside her and, taking her face in his hands, he kissed her. To her suprise Isabelle found that she had no aversion to his kiss and was on the verge of returning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the surprise of Hector laying her down upon the bed and moving one of his hands down to her hips kept Isabelle from either kissing him back or stopping it. Before she knew it she was on her back with Hector ontop of her with and arm and leg on either side of her kissing her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector, Hector please. I, I don't know if I'm ready.\" He continued kissing her neck for another minute before looking up and into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Isabelle dear, you know you want this, you've been yearning for this, desiring it every since you laid eyes on me, ever since you found out that we were to be married.\" Looking into his eyes Isabelle saw something other than the unnerving color changing, lust. And yet, it was not simply lust she saw. This was something more, a deeper want and desire and - for lack of a better word - pure evil. \"And please, call me by my true name, Radigan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Radigan?! Oh my god! Get off, get off me right now! Oh please,\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, that is no way to speak to your husband.\" The sudden realization that she was not married to a prince from some kingdom who she hadn't met until today but to the evil Radigan sruck her like a boulder. And she began to weep with the knowledge that no one would believe him to be Radigan, that she was stuck with him until the day she died, and that she was his wife and as made apparent tonight he would take every marital benefit any time he wanted.</span></div></div>",

His body was then rolled off her onto the floor and Isabelle saw the worried face of Daniel looking down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Isabelle?\" he asked with concern as he offered his hand to help her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, thank you thank you thank you so much. He's, he's Radigan, he was going to, to...\" she took his hand and once she was on her feet she fell into his arms still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, it's alright. I'm here. He can't hurt you, I won't let him.\" Once her sobbs subsided Isabelle was able to stand on her own, and she asked how Daniel just happened to be there to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I got downstairs I saw your parents and Hect- Radigan having some tea, and you see the way his eyes never stayed the same color for more than a few seconds always made me a little uneasy. And then I saw him down there, and your parents had these strange expressions on their faces. They were completely blank and emotionless. He told them to go to bed and all they did was nod and wander off without a word, and nothing seemed right about it. I knew he was coming here, so I just had to check on you. I am so glad I did though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too Daniel. I owe you everything. I-\" she was cut short by a moan coming from the still motionless body of Radigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we had better get out of here before he comes to.\" Isabelle nodded, and Daniel led her to the hidden passageway, knowing that Radigan knew very little about the orientation about the castle and nothing about the passageways, which Daniel and Isabelle used to play in constantly and many of which even most of the staff did not know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither said a word as they made there way through narrow passages and down darkened staircases, with one stumbling on occasion only to be caught by the other. Finally they emerged into the cool air of the dark night. They make their way to one of the large oaks on the grounds and come to rest beneath it. Isabelle gazes up at the stars and the beautiful full moon and wonders how something like this could happen. Daniel notices that she is wearing the night gown that he had unwrapped and how enchanting it looks on her in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're wearing that sating night gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Isabelle looks down and nearly screams when she realizes that in the rush to get away from Radigan she had forgotten to grab something to cover herself with. She pulls in her knees, wraps her arms around herself, and turns away humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be embarrassed Isabelle. We've known each other since we were toddlers, I've seen you in less clothing, even if we were only five. And no one can blame you, after what just happened.\" She turned her head to once again face him and they both smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know you keep some extra clothes in the stable for whenever we go riding and what not. So, what do you say we go get those?\"</span></div></div>",

Just then he saw lights flickering in several windows of the castle, as if candles and torches were being lit throughout the building. Isabelle walked out of the stable dressed in boy's clothes with dirt on her face, neck, hands, any skin that showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should sully your face and retrieve any food or supplies you may have scattered in the stables.\" Daniel nodded and proceeded inside. It surprised Isabelle to see so much light coming from the castle, and it shocked her to see servants and knights rushing out of every exit most barely dressed. They began running around the gournds as if looking for something, the knights rushing to gather their supplies while still looking for whatever was evading all of them. Isabelle was sure they were looking for her, but she truly hoped she was wrong, so when one of the servants (she did not recognize him, he must have been new) came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on,\" Isabelle deepened her voice and tried to change it as much as she could while still making it sound realisitic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not completely sure. But what I hear is that the stable boy, Daniel, has kidnapped the princess. Prince Hector is outraged and has everyone searching for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, why would he kidnap the princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant thought for a moment trying to think of some reasonable explanation. Isabelle stood hoping that he would leave soon so that she and Daniel could escape. \"Perhaps he is working for Radigan. Everyone knows that if Radigan was to capture the princess he would be able to seize this kingdom without any trouble. When Daniel is caught, he will most likely be inprisoned, questioned, and shortly thereafter executed. You would do well to join in the search.\" And he ran off after all the others, probably thinking that they would somehow be rewarded if they found the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel,\" Isabelle whispered walking through the doorway of the stable. \"Daniel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Isabelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must leave immediately, the entire castle is searching for us under the belief that you have kidnapped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horses would draw too much attention. We have to go on foot. We can make our way to the back of the stables and if we can escape detection we can disappear into the forest.\"</span></div></div>",

Just then she grabbed her hand feeling that something had just bitten her. Once again Isabelle surveyed her chambers and found nothing in sight.

I am in dire need of your advice. Please, Isabelle, I need to speak with you.\" She rose from her bed and walked over to her window and looked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, what is it?

Not wanting to speak with any of the servants or her parents, Isabelle carefully and quietly made her way out into the yard. She finally found Daniel standing beneath the old oak tree, that as children they had, much to her parents' disapproval, climbed on many ocassions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Daniel, what is so important that,\" Isabelle started but was immediately silenced when Daniel turned to face her. His clothes were torn and filthy, his hair unkempt, and his face, atleast the parts not covered in filth, was extremely pale. \"Whats wrong Daniel? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father is dead Isabelle. I do not know what happened, so please do not ask. This afternoon I fell asleep under this very tree, and when I awoke I was at home in my bed. The house was silent as the grave and in complete disarray - bits of furniture littered the floor. As I was searching for my mother I peered into my parents' bedchamber. In there I found my father, or rather his rancid corpse. He's dead Isabelle, stabbed through the heart. I don't know what to do.\" Isabelle was speakless. She opened her mouth to speak several times, but closed it deciding against it.

Daniel had his hands on either side of him on the log, his head leaning back, and his eyes to the sky. Both merely sat there, content, for not, to rest and listen to their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n\"Rest little ones. You will need it for all you will soon face. Without even knowing it, you will do my bidding and hand your precious kingdom to me. Straight into my hands I will direct your path, and there is nothing you can do about it,\" a cloaked figure watches their every move in a swirling cloud of mist in a cold, dark, and damp room a long distance away.<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know what happened. I fell asleep under the tree, how did I end up at home? What happened to my father?\" Daniel appeared to be speaking to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you were sleepwalking,\" Isabelle opened her eyes and turned to look at Daniel, \"but you did nothing wrong. We will learn the truth of what has past. You need not fear. Do you remember when we fooled the physicians? You complained of lost time, spinning, itching, and several other symptoms. Laying in bed and moaning, mud and smashed berries on your face and body, and the physicians unable to determine what ailed you. I would sit by your bed concerned, and when they left the room, the laughs we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually they told our parents that I would not last long.\" Daniel smiled, still gazing toward the heavens. \"How wonderful it was to see their surprise when one morning I walked ouside perfectly healthy and we went to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such fun we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not nearly as much. My parents always have me attend all those balls and banquets, and you have much more responsibilities than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fret Isabelle. We will make time for fun.\" Isabelle joined Daniel in looking at the sky and imagining shapes and figures in the clouds. A few moments had passed when a sound was heard in the meadow on the other side or the road. It sounded familiar, but neither was sure of what it was. They rose and carefully made their way into the meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose it is Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know. It does not sound menacing. I know I have heard that sound before.\" Their pace slowed as they before searching to ground for the source of the noise. Suddenly Daniel stopped and stared at something before his feet. Seeing this, Isabelle joined him at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, it's a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that Daniel, and he's crying. Don't just stand there staring, pick him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a baby Daniel, he won't hurt you.\" Daniel kneeled and took the baby in his arms. He was wrapped in a blanket, and Isabelle saw a piece of paper sticking out of the folds. She grabbed the paper and read the messege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please care for and love this child. He is alone in this world. His name is Gregory.\"</span></div></div>",

We can't just leave him here, we have to take him with us.\" Daniel knew it would be harder to travel with a baby, but he also knew - having lived with four women and only one man his whole life - that there was just no arguing with a woman when it came to anything maternal, or feminine for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but when it gets too dangerous, too hard, we have to give him away. You have to be willing to give him up when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be ready to do what is best for him. We should be going now. The sooner we go, the sooner we will arrive at whereever it is we choose to go.\" Daniel smiled as Isabelle brushed her nose against Gregory's, bringing for a coo of joy from the infant, and held him close. While they walked down the road to an unknown destination, both forgot of the painful event that lay behind them. Isabelle hardly took her eyes from the baby, who after looking around for awhile was content merely to sleep in Isabelle's arms. Daniel was surprised at how well Isabelle handle Gregory, neither of them had every had to care for a baby alone (his sisters were younger than them, but not that young). <i>Maternal instinct, a woman's touch I suppose</i> he thought to himself. He watched the few scattered trees pass by and the meadows on either side of the road, and his mind was clear of all thoughts of his father and what was to become of him, only aware of his surroundings and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory in her arms and the peaceful environment around her, Isabelle forgot of any exhaustion she previously felt, as if this sleeping baby had rejuvenated her, given her energy. <i>Why would someone abandon this little baby?</i> It surprised even Isabelle that, judging Gregory's reaction to her, she was fairing well at handling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another half hour before they saw a town before them, a quaint, friendly looking place. They had been walking all night and this looked like a good place to gather some supplies and rest. The sun had risen above the horizon, but only just. Isabelle hoped it would not be too early to go calling on complete strangers in their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as if someone is awake in that house,\" Daniel pointed to the house closest to them, there was smoking coming from the chimney. \"Shall we see if they will help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory is in need of some milk and clothes.\" They walked to the front door of the medium sized cottage; Isabelle held Gregory closer to herself. Daniel knocked on the door, and in a moment it opened revealing a tall, rather lanky woman with red hair barely falling to her shoulders and a face filled with freckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there little ones. How are you this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are well, thank you.\" Daniel responded. \"We have been travelling most of the night and would be much obliged if you might allow us to rest here for a short while, and maybe supply us with something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course. How could I say no to those faces, and a baby. Come on in.\" She led them into the kitchen and they sat down at the table while she took the pot of soup out of the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really appreciate this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora. It is no trouble my dear, I always prepare extra food. He really looks like the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's not are son,\" Isabelle interjected. \"Actually, we've only just found him along the road with a note saying that he was alone and to care for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How kind of you to take him in. You say you found him near by?\" They nodded. \"Now that I think about it, he does bare a resemblence to Franklin and Amelia. What is his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The note said Gregory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is their son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know his parents? Do you know where we can find them, so we can return him to them?\" Daniel asked, Isabelle was looking at the sleeping babe in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid they have passed away. Young Gregory has no one. They used to live in this town. Franklin was killed in a dispute between another town right before Gregory was born, Amelia died in child birth. Several instances led the town to believe the young infant was possessed by a demon or something along those lines. Eventually the towns people were no longer willing to keep this child within its borders. Someone took him from the town, to save him from the people. Whoever it was, they must have left him along the road hoping some kind people would find and raise him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How horrible.\"</span></div></div>",

If the people of this town discovered that he is the son of Franklin and Amelia the consequences would not turn out well for either you or him. Perhaps you could say you are all siblings, but more than likely your situation would be taken advantage of and you would be put to work doing lord knows what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n\"We will do all that we can to bring the princess back safely your majesty.\" In front of the horse pen five knights knelt to King Edward on horseback before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you will do so, swiftly, while maintaining order among the people. Also, young Daniel's father is dead, so he may be reluctant to return. We all want to believe that Daniel is innocent, but alas, a man is dead and his killer is out there somewhere, it may even be Daniel. Caution is the key. The life of a princess is a very precious barganing tool, and though we are at peace with most of the neighboring kingdoms I would prefer not to give them any indication that they may be able to gain an advantage over me. Especially be wary and keep your eyes open, for Radigan is a powerful sorcerer and he has on many occasions given us reason to believe he wishes to claim our land as his own by any means necessary.\"<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n\"Melinda,\" in one of the many guest rooms within the walls of the castle Queen Jasmine tried to comfort Daniel's worry stricken mother, \"Edward is sending his best knights to find them. Soon our children will be in our arms once again. In the meantime your daughters are overjoyed to be staying in the castle, you will all be safe and well cared for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your majesty, who would wish to harm my Howard? And Daniel, to have found his father....\" What if he who has taken my Howard from me now seeks to take my Daniel as well?<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle walked around Nora's kitchen trying to soothe the screaming Gregory. \"I do not know what is wrong. He has been fed, burped, he has slept, he does not need to be cleaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a look my dear.\" Nora looked up from the bag she was filling with supplies for them. She checked Gregory's forehead, neck, chest, and finally his mouth. Using her thumb and index finger to hold his mouth open, Nora saw a baby tooth and sighed in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a tooth, what does that mean?\" Daniel asked as he stood from the table to take Gregory from Isabelle's tired arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he has a tooth, and many more on the way. The child is teething; his tooth and gums are in pain.\" She walked to the far wall and began rummaging through one of the shelves. When she turned around with jar in hand. \"Here, take this. These are strips of dried goat meat. They are not very filling, but chewing on them will ease the pain.\" She took one strip from the jar and handed it to Daniel, who gave it to Gregory to chew on, quickly silencing his cries, before placing it in the bag. Just as Daniel and Isabelle resumed their seats at the table and sound knock came from the door. They looked at each other worriedly, but Nora merely smiled and went to answer, they carefully followed behind.</span></div></div>",

Nora, come quick, please,\" she cried looking extremely distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the matter Mary? What has happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daddy, he's hurt. You have to help him. Hurry.\" She ran from the door out onto the lawn where they could now see a middle aged man collapsed on the ground appearing quite beat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora looked back to Daniel and Isabelle and with some urgency in her voice told them that there was bag under the table and asked if one of them would quickly go and fetch it. Daniel gently handed Gregory to Isabelle and went to get the bag. Isabelle followed Nora out to the wounded gentleman. Mary was kneeling over her father crying and begging him to be ok. After Nora sat down beside the man and began examining his wounds Mary stood and took a few steps back. Shortly Daniel emerged from the house with a large bag in his arms. He set it down next to Nora who immediately began rummaging through. Young Mary turned around and seemed to be about to run away when she stumbled and collapse into Daniel's arms. He was surprised at first, but when she began weeping he just stroked her hair and tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory soon fell asleep and Isabelle decided to put him down in the house for a nap. She thought it would be best if Mary was not present while Nora worked on her father; so she gently took Mary's hand and led her inside. Daniel stayed behind ready to offer any aid Nora needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about ten minutes Nora worked nonstop before finally repacking her bag and standing. \"Could you please help me carry him into the house?\" she asked of Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Together they lifted the man and carried him into Nora's room where they tucked him into bed. Daniel went to look for Isabelle while Nora checked on the man again and sat with him awhile. When he came out into the living room he found Isabelle sitting on a large soft rug with Gregory sleeping soundly beside her and Mary laying with her head in Isabelle's lap also sleeping. Daniel sat on the otherside of Isabelle and they comfortably sat in silence until Nora came in. They heard her come in and looked to her face silently asking a question. She smiled in answer and Isabelle tenderly woke Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, your father will be just fine. He is awake now, you can go see him,\" Nora said. Mary sleeping rose, smiled, then ran to go see her father. \"If you could not tell, I am a kind of medicine woman here, a doctor. The townspeople look to me when they feel ill or when their children get hurt or when they want a miracle drug to make them smarter, prettier, or wealthier. Walter, Mary's father, told me that he was out for a walk, he had walked quite a ways from town when he was attacked by some ungodly creature. From how he describes the creature I can only assume it to be one of the servants of that monster Radigan. He gets bolder by the day, soon he will attack the castle itself.\" This made Daniel and Isabelle a little uneasy just thinking that the place they called home for so long may be attacked some day soon and that Radigan's minions were so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me my dears, you look remarkably similar to the young Princess Isabelle. Oh my, we've spent all this time together and I never even realized that I do not know your names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have forgotten our manners Nora, not introducing ourselves after you have been so kind. And you are not the first to tell me how much I resemble the princess. I suppose it doesn't help that we have the same name either. I am Isabelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have been properly introduced, how long will you two be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think it would be best if we let before dark.\" Isabelle looked at Daniel curious as to why he felt they should leave so soon, but when he looked at her she realized that they were not safe with Radigan's servants so near. They would just have to keep on moving, else Radigan get his hands on her. \"We have a lot of travelling to do, and the sooner we set off, the sooner we shall reach our destination,\" Daniel concluded. <i>Though it is still unknown even to us,</i> he thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

They are going to talk to some of the servants and see if they can get them to take you in till your mother shows up, at least. Do you think that is something you would like to do? It\u2019s much better than staying by yourself. They are also going to get someone over to your house to dispose of your father\u2019s body. They figure you might need someone to help you this way. Is that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you parents I am grateful for their help.

Daniel spus his own beast on and quickly catches up.  For an hour they merrily ride through the paths around the castle.  There is never any danger as the knights guard the area, knowing the heir to the throne enjoys the freedom a daily ride allows her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      When they return to the stables, Daniel emplore her to get ready for tea, as she doesn't have much time left.  Feeling a bit guilty, Isabelle hurries off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That is not the way to become a knight\" comes a voice from the far corner of the stables.  As a startled Daniel turns he sees Bernard step out of the shadows.  \"You should never disobey a direct order from the crown.  I know you are fond of the princess but she does not yet sit on the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Daniel drops his head in shame.  The noble man standing before him is the only reason he has a chance in becoming a knight.  Nine years ago Bernard was merely a traveling sell-sword.  While visiting the kingdom, he witnessed Daniel's father beating the boy in the center of the village.  The other peasants merely looked the other way but he could not.  By just placing his hand on the hilt of his sword he dissuaded  the evil man from landing another blow.  Bernard knew that he only delayed the inevitable.  Once his boots hit the dirt path leading out of the village, the man would continue pummeling his boy until he was dead.  It was on that day he forsake his wandrelust and pledged his loyalty to King Edward.  He visited daniel as often as his duties allowed until he was able to convince the boy to become a squire.  Spending most of the day at the castle erased most of Daniel's bruises, but occasionally new ones would appear.  The day the young squire finally joins him as a defender of the crown would herald the end of his suffering.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Knowing that he had disappointed his mentor greatly, Daniel quietly said  \"My apologies, Sir Bernard.  There is no excuse for my actions.  Any actions you feel neccisary will be just.\"</span></div></div>",

That is not the job of royalty.

She checked the fields: no Daniel. He had disappeared. It was not his day off, which only came round at the end of the month, and he had definitely not been given a different duty that day. He had already told her it was the day for cleaning the stables, and that always took most of his working hours.<br>\r\n\"Adam!\" she called, recognising a farmer approaching, \"have you seen Daniel, the stableboy?\" She hurried forward, and stopped Adam in his tracks.

His raids had grown bolder with each passing day, pushing further into Edward's kingdom of Iylonra.  Iylonra's armies had fought hard over the months of war, but Radigan had a seemingly endless supply of mindless soldiers.  He cared not how many men he lost, so long as the land was his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not enough?!\" King Edward slammed his armored fist firmly down upon the oaken table.  He was a large man, tall and broad with thick red hair and deep green eyes.  His face was canyoned with deep wrinkles and old scars.  He looked much older than he was, though still with a youthful air.  He wore his finest armor, newly polished and draped with a dark green cape of thick wool.  At his side hung a sword, old and battered, but  deadly in the King's mighty hands.  \"Radigan has taken all the land from the south-eastern shores to the peaks of the central mountains and yet he still knocks upon my door, greedily waving his sword for more!  Our allies have all been crushed.  If Radigan could not bend them to his will through his false protectorate, he crushed them by the sword.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the status of our armies, Sir Thomas?\"  King Edward nodded over to the armored soldier sitting at the table across from him.  Thomas sat up straighter, clearing his throat.  \"My liege, our southern army is stretched across those borders and has suffered severe loses.  I've sent word for them to regroup further north at the city of Ferth and hold that ground until reinforcements arrive.  Sir Donovan is a fine leader and will hold out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of the armies to the west?\"<br>\r\n\"Sir Andrew and Bernard have not given news of their status since their defeat at Rindall, but I have sent riders to speed the word, my liege.\"<br>\r\nKing Edward nodded solemnly.

As much as it tears my heart, every able-bodied man and boy will be needed in this battle.\"  With a nod and a wave of his hand, King Edward gave his captains their leave and silently sat, pondering his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, an adventure!\" Daniel silently thought to himself, as he knelt down to tug the ripe vegetables from the dark soil.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but smile at the prospect of leaving the castle, especially seeing as Isabelle had asked him along.  He'd known her since he had first come to the castle as a boy, had helped teach her to ride the royal horses, in fact.  He chuckled to himself, remembering those first few times, she in her tiny, stiff court dresses trying to mount the huge beasts.  She had fallen more than once, though she'd never allowed it to sway her.  She was tough, strong, and she almost seemed to enjoy the dirt that had clung heavily to her velvet clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'ello there boy, finished picking me veggies 'ave ye?\" Daniel was startled back to reality by Adam's drunken voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked nervously over to the dozens of vegetables still planted firmly in the ground.  \"Ah, yes, all pulled and stored away for the day.  Well, save for those... they were too, er.. Those weren't quite ripe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam bent to inspect the plants, \"Eh? They look a'ight to me.\"  He looked up at Daniel, putting a hand on the ground to steady himself.  <br>\r\n\"May'aps you've spent valuable time conversin' with pretty maids rather than work, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Adam, dreaming of pretty maids again are ya?  I've been by myself this whole time.\" Daniel attempted to play at innocence, busily grabbing tools and putting them into the shed built against the castle wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I seen ya.\" Adam lifted himself heavily from the ground, not bothering to brush off the dirt.  \"Princess and you got all sorts o' plans eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I am, thinking you've been off drinking yourself into a stupor when really you've been sneaking about in the shadows spying on myself and Isabelle.

But here he was, on the Eve of what would probably be the greatest adventure of his life.  And he would have Isabelle there with him, which was more than anyone could ask for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was his greatest friend.  She always had been and he knew she always would be.

Would there be fun.  Probably yes, to all of those.  It only excited him more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise from outside made Daniel sit up. It was almost midnight, that was probably Isabelle coming.  He grinned and grabbed his packs, running to the horses he had hid in the stables.  He'd already gotten them ready for a journey.  He'd packed as much food and clothing and supplies as he could.  He only wished he could find a weapon to bring.  The only thing he had was a small dagger.

I was just about to call for the guards to have him escorted to the dungeons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a child Matty, and it looked more like you were frightening him to death.

I am not going to harm you. Are you hungry?\" His hunger, at least for the moment, seemed to outweigh his terror as he fiercely nodded his head. Isabelle gave a little chuckle as she rose to her feet, helped the boy to his, and led him to the table. Once he was seated she retrieved some clean food and placed it in front of him. Smiling as the child inhaled the food before him, Isabelle warned him to slow down so as not to make himself sick, he obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Isabelle. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mouth full of bread he replied, \"Dylan.\" Isabelle sat beside Dylan, contentedly watching him eat his fill. As she watched, she seemed to notice a kind of glow radiating from him, as if this simple meal had replenished his life and soul, and she was glad to have been able to help. After several more minutes Dylan pushed the food from him and his eye lids began to droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering how hungry you were, I suppose I can assume that you have not slept in a real bed in quite some time either. Correct?\" Dylan very groggily nodded his head.

Before they left however, they made Isabelle swear to at least try to behave while they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle saw them to their carriage and spent the next couple of hours trying to escape the various lady\u2019s maid, butlers, and assorted servants that seemed to be permanently attached to her ankles like dozens of high pitched talking balls and chains that never paused, even to breath.

I hope your room was to your liking.\u201d Isabelle gestured for Jackson and Dylan to seat themselves, but instead they bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, stand up. I believe I told you when first we met that in such informal company you need not bow, and I would much rather prefer you do not. Also, I understand it to be quite inconvenient not to mention uncomfortable for the back to bow so often.

There is nothing to my knowledge that has ever frightened Elias, not even the men who took him from the wild and tried to break his spirit before offering him as a gift to my father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was taken from the wild?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and at a very young age I\u2019ve been told. I was not much older when he came to us, but I have heard that he never lost his wild spirit even though many believed him too young to remember ever living in the wild. Just look into his eyes, however, and its plain as day that wild spirit still lives on within him.\u201d She looked at the stallion and Dylan witnessed Elias bow his head to Isabelle, who bowed her head in turn, in a mutual display of respect. Looking into Elias\u2019s eyes, Dylan saw that Isabelle was talking about, within those big eyes he saw pride, the same kind of look a beloved king would give to his subjects. \u201cDaniel was the first Elias would let near him and the first to ride him. I was soon allowed the privilege as well. None others have been given the honor of riding him, Daniel and I very rarely ride him, out of respect. He has allowed some more people to get near him, but mostly only other stable hands who must care for him. Elias must like you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In fact, I can almost positively say that he enjoys their talents. We have much enjoyed their company at the castle as both guests and paid entertainment. I am quite fond of a certain seer in one of the local bands of gypsies myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur mother and father died soon after Dylan\u2019s first birthday. Orphaned and left alone we wandered the expanse of the kingdom of Lain, your neighbor to the northeast. Soon a traveling band of gypsies discovered us and took us in. They raised us as their own.  However, little more than a year ago, the king of Lain decided he would no longer put up with the gypsy pests and outlawed anything related to gypsies.  One night, the king sent his knights to disband all the gypsies they could find.  Dylan and I escaped arrest, but were separated from our family. So we ran. In time, we found your kingdom but stayed in the shadows not knowing your king\u2019s opinion of gypsies. Alas, we could not stay hidden for long. Considering who discovered us, I\u2019d say fortune has taken pity on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen fortune has taken pity on us as well,\u201d Daniel announced as he friendly patted Jackson on the back. \u201cWe are glad to have met you and are more than willing to welcome two new friends. Lord knows I was beginning to tire of Isabelle\u2019s company.\u201d Looking at Isabelle, Daniel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have you beheaded for saying that.\u201d Isabelle smiled back as she rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the freedom that would grant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVocalizing an incredulous gasp, Isabelle dove for Daniel, knocking them both into a pile of hay behind.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laughing to the point of tears, the four friends stumbled into the light of a midday sun. Collapsing in the deep green grass to the side of the path leading from the stables to the castle, the laughter gradually faded into a collective sigh. The clouds passed as lazily above as Isabelle, Daniel, Jackson, and Dylan all felt. Hours seemed to pass before any words were spoken; with only the breeze rustling the leaves to break the silence, they appeared to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell tolling from within the castle called Isabelle back to her body and to the present. Propping herself up on her elbows, Isabelle gently invited the others to join her in reality, \u201cLunch shall begin shortly. It would be wise for us to give at least the illusion of attending to our duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean we get to eat now?\u201d Dylan asked as he excitedly sprang to his feet ready to make a mad dash for the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Dylan, but I am afraid there is a little work to do before  we can eat.\u201d Dylan frowned. \u201cHowever, you may be able to snatch a few bites while you work in the kitchen.\u201d With that Dylan\u2019s smile quickly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along Dylan, I\u2019ll walk you to the kitchen.\u201d Dylan gladly took Isabelle\u2019s outstretched hand and half skipped, half dragged Isabelle back to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel draped his arm over Jackson\u2019s shoulders and started for the stables. \u201cWe should make sure the horses have fresh water and something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate your helping Dylan and I. I do not know how much longer we could have continued on scavenging, trying to survive like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure Jackson, however, Isabelle really should be given most of the credit.\u201d Having returned to the stables Daniel tossed a pitchfork into Jackson\u2019s hands. \u201cIf you will give the horses some fresh hay and some oats, I will give them fresh water. Then, if there is time, we ought to brush them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working in silence for a few moments Daniel began to whistle a song he could not remember ever learning but came so naturally. Almost immediately, Jackson joined in. This continued for a while, both boys perfectly content despite their strenuous work. Not until Jackson reached Elias\u2019s stall did either even think of saying something, even think a complete thought. \u201cIsabelle was right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout Elias. There is something so regal, so commanding in his eyes. There is something else there, but what it is I cannot say. I never would have noticed if not for Isabelle mentioning it to Dylan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Isabelle has a way about her, a way of seeing things differently than all others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that. She is so unlike any other princess I have ever heard of. Isabelle seems to be more like us than a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat she does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness.\u201d Matty, the head cook, curtsied her greeting. An incredulous and bitter expression crossed her face as she saw Dylan peek around from behind Isabelle. \u201cWhat is that wretch doing back in my kitchen?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeace Matty. This is Dylan. I understand that you have been short handed since Samantha. Dylan shall fill her position and aid anyway he can in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, I can manage,\u201d Matty interjected, \u201cI really do not think that \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is my will,\u201d Isabelle interrupted her, \u201cthat Dylan be allowed to do his share and that he be treated as an equal. If you cannot comply with my wishes than I suggest you seek employment elsewhere. Am I understood Matty?\u201d Matty opened and closed her mouth several times, obviously wanting to erupt into a tirade she has long been withholding but fearing losing her position and the retribution that would undoubtedly accompany insulting the only daughter of the king and queen. \"As you wish your highness.\"</span></div></div>",

Ladies know better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her parents were away for a few days, Isabelle could still picture her mother at the end of the table with her father. \u201cYes mother,\u201d Isabelle would return.  Then aside to herself, \u201cLadies also know how to live uncomfortably and without any enjoyment.\u201d Though the rectangular table at which they sat was considerably longer than most, it was short enough that even with the king and queen sitting at one end and Isabelle at the other; they did not have to shout to be heard. Lucky for Isabelle the table was long enough that her parents could not hear any of her ireful mutterings. She would smile at her parents and begin eating her soup, careful not to accidentally slurp very loudly and incur another lesson in manners from her mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey often had such discussions at meals. Sometimes Isabelle sincerely forgot, but it was far more common for her to purposefully disobey the orders of manners in order to break the silences. Despite the absence of her parents, Isabelle was by no means alone; standing against the wall opposite her stood the many servants who seemed drawn to her by some supernatural force. While she had managed a couple hours freedom from them, it appeared impossible to avoid them for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the servants took away her nearly empty bowl of soup \u2013 she hardly ever had enough time to finish the food in front of her before it was taken away \u2013 she brushed a few strands of hair out of her face and behind her ear. This movement shook loose a couple straws of hay she had earlier missed, and they fell before her on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not even need to look up to know the servants were shifting where they stood and exchanging glances. Ordinarily she would respond with some sort of witty remark, but a positive outcome could no longer be obtained from such an act. Each servant had seen her acting in a way peculiar to that of a princess. True, this would add fuel to their gossip, but their imaginations were poor at best. No new rumors had begun to circulate for weeks; the old ones were merely being retold with the smallest of alterations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did they lack the creativity to invent new rumors, they also lacked the gall and imagination to enter into a battle of wits with her. This was one trait Isabelle loved in Daniel.  He was practically all too eager to make fun of her to her face. They often spent much time exchanging quips and poking fun at each other, all in good spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, Isabelle dove into the leafy green salad which had replaced the bowl of soup on the table before her. Not particularly in the mood for salad, Isabelle found herself marveling at the many various shades of green on a single plate, only to be interrupted by the slamming of the kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan came stumbling out with a pitcher of water, obviously having been pushed out and doing his best not to trip and drop the pitcher.</span></div></div>",

At the last moment, however, as if pushed by some invisible pair of hands, he lost his footing and accidentally poured the contents of the pitcher all over Isabelle. Immediately the servants gasped and all but one leapt to her side with towels and anxious expressions draped over their faces. The last, completely stone faced, hovered over Dylan where he had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I am perfectly capable of drying myself,\u201d Isabelle insisted as she snatched a towel from a servant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the circle of servants around Isabelle began to disperse and resumed their positions of wall ornaments, Isabelle noticed that one had taken Dylan by the collar and was escorting him to the door. She rose to her feet. \u201cIf you would be so kind, I would like a moment alone with the boy. You are all dismissed.\u201d Ignoring the questioning looks they gave each other, Isabelle remained motionless waiting for their departure. \u201cYou have been given no such order as to remain by my side every moment of every day. And despite what you may have heard or been told by my parents, I am the princess and in my parents\u2019 absence you obey me. I do not enjoy giving orders, so I shall ask again that you leave us. You may take the rest of the day as personal time if you so wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last questioning glance at each other and, as if in a trance, the servants abandoned their long held posts and headed straight out the door. As the river flowed through the door, Dylan\u2019s collar was let loose and his would be capture dissolved into the river of bodies. Once the room was finally clear of nagging servants, Isabelle stepped away from the table to help Dylan to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really do hate ordering them around. If only they would allow me some leeway, allow me to live at least part of my life without them. Perhaps this is an issue best left for another time. Are you ok?\u201d A short, barely noticeable nod from Dylan was all the assurance Isabelle needed to know he was still somewhat shaken from a second threat of being arrested. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take my seat and I shall serve you lunch?\u201d A second, more vigorous nod told Isabelle that the thought of food had quickly revived Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure Dylan was comfortable, Isabelle left him looking around at the many tapestries and paintings adorning the walls. As she entered the kitchen, she was only slightly surprised that the kitchen staff was nowhere to be seen. Often they prepare the meal then, while one or two remain behind to serve the meal, the others attend to other matters. When the meal has been finished, they return to clean up. Isabelle was no stranger to this; instead, what surprised her was the fact that Matty had opted to leave Dylan alone to complete the serving. <i>I do not believe she would trust such a task to Dylan, the miscreant she believes him to be,</i> Isabelle thought to herself as she ladled soup into a clean bowl. <i>No doubt she believes Dylan will fail his tasks. Might it be that she is expecting, even depending on his failure? It is quite likely that she hopes Dylan to fail and me to remove him from the service of her kitchen. I will not be manipulated so easily.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle proceeded to prepare a small salad, and, with salad and soup in hand, she reentered the dining room and placed the food in front of Dylan. He smiled and immediately began gorging himself. Smiling as well Isabelle returned to the kitchen to fetch two rather large, elaborate sandwiches. By the time she returned to the dining room, Dylan had finished his soup and was halfway through his salad. The astonishingly large quantities of food served at meals had always bemused Isabelle. She was never allowed to finish all that was put before her, but what she was given time she eat she could barely finish. Such being, there always seemed too much food used, to her at least. As both she and Dylan began eating their sandwiches, Isabelle could not help but notice how hungry Dylan had been. Perhaps the amount of food served was just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you have a voice Dylan; I have heard you use it quite freely. Why then at other times do you seem to lose the ability to speak and become somewhat of a mute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Isabelle heard a voice speaking to her from the doorway.</span></div></div>",

Standing in the doorway before her was none other than Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackson, you startled me.\u201d Isabelle smiled and rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no one else here Jackson, you may call me Isabelle. I rather prefer you call me Isabelle. Won\u2019t you join us?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but I am not hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least take a seat.\u201d Jackson complied and took a seat across from Isabelle beside Dylan. \u201cNow, I believe you said something about Dylan\u2019s seemingly selective muteness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes. Well, as I have said, our parents passed shortly after Dylan\u2019s first birthday. Babies often are not very in touch with the world around them, but Dylan appeared to grasped exactly what had happened. He ceased the incoherent babblings typical of a child his age; he ceased crawling and standing and trying to walk. For about a year, he merely sat detached from the world. However, when the life did finally return to his eyes, he began behaving as if he had not lost an entire year, as if by simply watching those around him, he learned what most infants learn through trial and error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom then on, he grew as any other child. Until recently that is. He never had a chance to know our parents, and now he has been separated from the only family he has known. Dylan receded once again. Fortunately, this time, it was not for so long. He only fell silent for a couple of months. However, since then his speech has been intermittent at best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Isabelle sighed. \u201cI cannot imagine what you two have been through. I can only hope that I be allowed to make things easier \u2013 if not happier \u2013 for you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have already done more for us two exiled gypsies than we could have hope. And you will be pleased to know that I have noticed that Dylan has begun speaking a lot more since you have taken us in.\u201d Both Isabelle and Jackson smiled. It was then they noticed that Dylan had recently finished his food and was silently walking around the room admiring its lavish decorations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dylan lingered before one of the tapestries, Isabelle left her seat, stood behind him, and placed her hands on his shoulders. He didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash. Pointing, Isabelle said in a soft voice, \u201cThis tapestry is one of my favorites.\u201d Jackson also took a place behind Dylan listening to Isabelle and examining the tapestry. \u201cIt tells the story of my father\u2019s father\u2019s father, my great grandfather Nicolai. You see, like you, he lost his parents at a very young age. So his father\u2019s advisors kept the kingdom from falling to pieces while Nicolai was given time to mature and learn how to rule. Nicolai did not believe he could rule an entire kingdom, but I am told he was one of the wisest, fairest, and kindest in the history of our kingdom. I have not suffered any hardships \u2013 though the lack of privacy and independence, the rules of etiquette, and the thoroughly uncomfortable gowns seem like that worst torture there is. I only hope that I can one day guide my people as well as he did then and my parents are doing now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Isabelle nodded for the servant to continue. \"Master Daelos requests your presence in the grand ballroom. It is time for your lessons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Tell him I shall meet him anon.\u201d With a quick bow, the servant disappeared as effortlessly and silently as he had appeared. \u201cAnd thus I am once again called back to the ever continuous chores of a princess.\u201d When Isabelle turned back around she found Jackson and Dylan moving to remove the plates from the table. \u201cYou do not need to do that. By the sounds of it,\u201d indicating the clanking of pans and swishing of water coming from the kitchen, \u201cit appears the kitchen staff has returned to finish the clean up. I\u2019m sure Daniel would appreciate your help and your company. Perhaps you would like to feed Elias, huh Dylan? He may even be able to groom him.\u201d The pure joy on Dylan\u2019s face persuaded Jackson to put the dishes back on the table, and with a slight nod to Isabelle they left the room and headed for the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle on the other hand headed for the grand ballroom, walking just fast enough not to be accused of dallying. She did not particularly dislike Master Daelos, but nor did she delight in attending his lessons. Master Daelos was in charge of instructing Isabelle on how to present herself in public and the numerous motions and dances she must know for various occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson proceeded in a dizzying blur of music and scattered phrases floating with each note. Relax your hands. Not that relaxed. Don\u2019t slump. You\u2019re stepping on my foot your highness. No no, the move is as such. A little faster here. Ow, that\u2019s my foot. This part should be more fluid. Again, my foot Princess. My dear, the gentlemen leads, not you. Isabelle was exhausted when it was over. They had been at the lesson far longer than usual. Perhaps her mind was elsewhere, for she didn\u2019t even realize how long it had been or how tired her body was until Master Daelos brought the lesson to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjourning to her chamber, Isabelle decided to rest a while before dinner. She closed her eyes for a moment, and when she reopened them Isabelle found over an hour had passed. It was as if she had blinked away a portion of her life. There was still quite some time before dinner, but Isabelle still lacked her usual energy to go find Daniel for a race or some harmless pranks. Instead she consented to contemplating the many cracks in the ceiling. When she could no longer find any amusing designs in the cracks, a bath seemed the perfect thing for her weary body. Afterward she would head down for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after dinner, again revitalized and on her way out the door did Isabelle learn that before departing, her parents had arranged extra lessons for her. <i>Goodbye freedom,</i> and with a sigh she turned in horse races for etiquette \u2013 for tonight at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Isabelle had barely finished her morning meal when she learned that she had lessons scattered throughout the day. Between the lessons and the servants stuck like glue to her all day, Isabelle was not able to slip away long enough check in on Dylan and Jackson or complain about the extra lessons and extra sticky servants to Daniel. <i>Why the sudden onslaught of proper princess behavior and caution being thrown at me?</i> Nothing came to mind. Her parents had gone away before without taking such pains to restrict her free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully tomorrow would be different. </span></div></div>",

Isabelle had had a restful sleep that night, but it was a dreamless night. It was not uncommon that Isabelle found herself unable to remember her dreams from the previous night. This was different. She felt certain that no glimmer of a dream had passed through her mind. It was as if for one night she had experienced the sleep of the dead. Isabelle was a little unnerved by this; she could not remember having such a dreamless sleep before. As she broke her fast that morning, alone (her parents would not return for a few more days), Isabelle contemplated this. The night had been both relaxing and disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Exhaustion. That must be the reason. My body lacked energy; my mind must have been equally as weary, too weary to dream. I suppose it is possible,</i> and thus she played it off as nothing and discarded her worries along the side of the path on her way to the stables after her day\u2019s lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stables she found Daniel shoveling some manure from the horses\u2019 stalls into a wheelbarrow to later be used as fertilizer, and Jackson was giving the horses some fresh water. Dylan was sitting off to the side eating what appeared to be his second apple. <i>That boy always seems to be eating. Breakfast was not all that long ago, and lunch will begin shortly.</i> Isabelle smiled to herself. <i>The appetite of a growing boy I suppose.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow nice of you to deign to see us today your highness,\u201d Daniel said in mock reverence when he saw that Isabelle had entered the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I would not pass up the opportunity to visit with such loyal and distinguished subjects as yourselves,\u201d Isabelle replied with equal sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you really needn\u2019t have bothered. We haven\u2019t had the time to clean up; your dress may be sullied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019ll just have to lie upon the ground that I might have something to walk upon, or else I could merely have you beheaded at the day\u2019s end.\u201d Dylan stopped mid bite, and Jackson glanced back and forth between the two in confusion. \u201cI thought the two of you were friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Isabelle smiled at each other, and Dylan returned to his half eaten apple. \u201cOf course we are friends, we just like to poke fun at how so many people expect a princess to treat someone in my position,\u201d Daniel explained. \u201cBesides, I would never respond so cruelly as to have someone beheaded for something so trite,\u201d Isabelle added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. The truth is that a friendship such as yours is rather unusual. And unfortunately, I have heard of royalty who have beheaded people for far less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where were you yesterday?\u201d Daniel asked as he leaned the shovel against the wall having finished scooping out all the manure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents arrange several more lessons for me without telling me before they left. Plus there were always a few servants around me, as if I might at any moment trip and shatter into a million pieces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that makes sense, does it not?\u201d Jackson inquired as he sat beside Dylan, who offered him a bite of his apple. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t princesses usually have a lot of responsibilities and things they need to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe right Isabelle, we\u2019re not kids anymore, we\u2019re both going to have to grow up sooner or later, take on more responsibilities. You parents probably want to begin teaching you how to rule a kingdom. I would not be surprised if they decide to present you society, start the process of finding you a husband and king to rule beside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. I had merely hoped it would not come so soon.\u201d Isabelle sighed and watched Dylan toss his apple core off to the side. For a few moments all were quiet, the three teenagers contemplating the fast approaching end of their childhood. Even the horses, as if sensing the solemnity in the air, were as silent as they could be.</span></div></div>",

You were just eating an apple, and already you\u2019re hungry again.\u201d Isabelle laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave most of the apple to Elias.\u201d None of them had even noticed that most of the pieces he bit from the apple he fed to Elias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be patient Dylan,\u201d Jackson admonished, \u201cremember we are guests here.\u201d Daniel ducked his head outside to check the position of the sun. When Daniel walked back into the stables he was attempting to wipe some of the dirt from his hands unto his already dirt covered pants. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t hurry, you shall have to be patient even longer. For if we are late to lunch my mother may just deny us the meal. Are you coming, or are the three of you just going to sit there and eat hay and oats along with the horses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*~*~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you all washed your hands?\u201d Daniel\u2019s mother asked she set a few extra places at the table and the four friends walked into Daniel\u2019s home. \u201cYes, mother.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cUh huh.\u201d  \u201cAnd be careful not to track any dirt or manure into my house. If you do you\u2019ll be the ones scrubbing the floors not me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confirming that nothing on their shoes would sully the floors, Dylan and Jackson took their seats while Daniel and Isabelle went into the kitchen to offer their help. Jackson had just risen from his seat to likewise offer his hand in the kitchen when both Daniel and Isabelle were shooed out of the kitchen. \u201cSit down all of you. Relax. I am perfectly capable of tending to lunch on my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle had long since become a part of Daniel\u2019s family, they were practically a second family to her as Daniel was like a son to the King and Queen (as much as their social positions allowed). As they enjoyed their meal and each others company, Dylan and Jackson were likewise adopted into the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*~*~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re parents are something Daniel,\u201d Jackson commented as they made their way back to the stables. \u201cFriendly, eager to offer whatever they can, and so perfectly content with they\u2019re lot in life. Most people are always wishing for more. They truly seemed as if they simply could not be any happier. Your father, though, he seemed tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s not in his smithery, he is in town selling his wares and services. It can be quite draining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Isabelle was walking between them and Dylan was skipping along a short ways ahead of them, \u201cnearly a year had passed before I was actually introduced to Daniel\u2019s father. I\u2019d seen him around, even been in his presence, but it was quite some time before I knew him as the father of my friend. Even more time passed before he was able to treat me as informally as you have seen, almost as his own child. You would not believe how many times I escaped my own parents\u2019 rebuking only to be thoroughly admonished by him and Daniel\u2019s mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDylan and I also found ourselves with numerous adults looking out for us, some barely older than myself filling the roles of mother and father. It could be quite irksome, but they took us in when we needed it, and they did know how to have fun. You two remind me of them - you and your families. One day I shall repay you all for your kindness,\u201d Jackson promised. \u201cI just hope we will also enjoy the pleasures of being with out family,\u201d he added much more for himself than his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be together again someday,\u201d Isabelle comforted and linked her arm in Jackson\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you need never repay us.\u201d Isabelle nodded her assent. \u201cIsabelle\u2019s a princess, and though my life is humble you said so yourself, my parents could not be happier. Besides, one day I shall be a knight and will be able to take care of them as they have cared for me these many years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the stables Dylan immediately ran inside and plopped down on a stack of hay by Elias\u2019s stall. \u201cYou seem very sure of yourself. Are you that certain of becoming a knight?\u201d questioned Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Isabelle stood beside Jackson, crossed her arms, and replied, \u201cI must admit he has many qualities desirable in a knight. Not to mention he fancies himself quite the terrific swordsman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good swordsman huh?\u201d Looking around Jackson found a decent sized stick and took it in hand. \u201cWhat say you to a friendly match then?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They took their positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment of the first resounding clash of their \u201cswords\u201d it was clear that these were not mere boys playing at knights \u2013 there was something there just beneath the surface waiting to be tapped into. Isabelle sat on the grass and even Dylan tore himself from Elias\u2019s stall to stand just outside the stable doors and watch the match. They had each trained in different styles, and yet they could equally anticipate the other\u2019s next move and react accordingly. Their techniques were markedly different from that of the knights under the command of Isabelle\u2019s father, but the same skill and precision was as evident in the two boys as in some of the more seasoned knights. This and more was there, though much of it lay dormant within their very muscles, yearning to be harnessed and put to use. For now at least neither could boast of perfect form and each made amateur mistakes that would need to be improved if either wished to truly excel. Despite this fact, their match made for a magnificent scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match continued for quite some time, with no sign of either Daniel or Jackson gaining the advantage. It was clear that they were both growing exhausted, but as true swordsmen \u2013 and, more importantly, young men - they were resolved to see the match to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it seemed both boys were ready to declare a draw, with a swift strike Jackson knocked Daniel\u2019s stick from his hand and had his own aimed squarely at Daniel\u2019s chest in mere seconds, his form silhouetted in the slowly sinking sun. After playfully stabbing Daniel, Jackson let his stick fall to their feet. Almost before the stick had touched the ground Jackson and Daniel had let themselves likewise fall to the ground laughing away the fatigue in their muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not quite epic battle finished, Dylan plopped down beside them, and Isabelle brought them a goatskin of water from the stables. \u201cDaniel, I must say you\u2019ve improved since our last match. Unless you have been allowing me to win out of some misguided chivalry either because I am a girl or, worse, because I am the princess. In which case you know how I feel about such behavior.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the most part,\u201d his breathing finally returned to normal, Daniel responded, \u201cno, I have not been handing you victory in our more recent matches; for I am well aware of how I would suffer for performing such a dastardly deed. I am not the only one to have improved as of late.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt pleases me to hear you say so. Thank you. Perhaps you will remember that next time you are inclined to treat me as a delicate flower that crumples at the softest breeze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit you are much more capable than most would expect of you, but you must also admit that your pride has made you believe your skills to be greater than in reality. For example, although you have bested me in recent matches, I am not so sure Jackson would so easily fall to your sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimmer of surprise briefly crossed Jackson\u2019s face, only to be immediately replaced by a good natured smile. \u201cI appreciate the compliment Daniel, as I assume that statement is meant to be, but after our match I thought your opinion of my ability to be somewhat higher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you also believe that you are better skilled with a sword than I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean no offense Princess,\u201d Jackson attempted to conceal his incredulity that a princess could possess any more than adequate knowledge of the sword while trying to assuage any affront to her pride, \u201cI have no doubt that your abilities more than surpass mine in matters of etiquette or court life, but as to matters deemed below and/or unsuitable for a young princess there can hardly be any question of the disparities between our expertise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course all are entitled to their opinions, mistaken though they may be.\u201d Looking to Daniel silently questioning whether the princess could really mean all that she is saying, Jackson is merely met with a resigned smirk. Whether it confirmed Isabelle\u2019s opinion or Jackson\u2019s was uncertain. Either it was mere talk or she truly was as skilled as she claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an out of breath servant stumbled towards them from the direction of the castle and spoke with some urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour-your Highness \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down. Catch your breath first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Highness. There is a knight on horseback approaching the front gate unannounced. As of yet he has not identified himself, nor is he displaying any colors or coat of arms. But the man walking beside him, presumably a page, has requested an audience with their majesties the King and Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackson, it seems we shall have to postpone the rest of this discussion. Now if you all would accompany me to the castle I shall see to this stranger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The knight is:</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gates opened to reveal the knight slumped in his saddle and the page using a walking stick to offset his noticeable limp. Both rather worse for wear. Isabelle was just about to ask the identity of her visitor and his purpose when she realized not only was the knight not looking at her, or anyone else for that matter, but he was completely limp. Looking closer she realized he was, in fact, unconscious, and the page had blood staining his hands and walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp them inside, and fetch the physician.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your highness \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t question. Just do as I say. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the strangers just in time to catch the page as he collapsed. The castle physician arrived immediately- - he had his own quarters in the castle so he\u2019d always be at hand for such emergencies. Once the knight and page were inside, the physician quickly shooed everyone from the room so he could tend to their injuries unimpeded. Isabelle, however, was not one to be shooed away. She insisted on staying to help and to be there the moment either regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physician first dressed the wounds of the knight as Isabelle began cleaning the wounds of the man who had come in with him. Now examining him closer, Isabelle noticed that he was not dressed as a knight\u2019s page, nor did his body or face show any of the usual signs of the wear associated with doing the bidding of a knight. Whoever he was though, he knew the meaning of an honest day\u2019s labor. From what Isabelle could see he had a strong spirit, and, whatever his injuries, he would survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with the knight\u2019s wounds and confident that he too was no longer at Death\u2019s door, the physician took over tending to the knight\u2019s companion, allowing Isabelle a closer look at the knight himself, his face no longer hidden by his helmet and a veil of dried blood. She recognized him immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Bernard?\u201d More to herself than to anyone else, speaking hardly above a whisper, Isabelle tried to make sense of the scene that had stumbled in from the front gate. \u201cHow has this come to pass? Who could have done this to you Bernard? You are one of greatest knight\u2019s in the land. The only time I have ever seen you sustain any serious damage was when you were thrown from Elias\u2019s back. And that was still not enough to keep you from breaking another stallion the next day. And now\u2026. If it had taken you any longer to reach us \u2013 I fear you may have been beyond cure. It must have been a mighty foe to have dealt you such damage. And how have you come to be traveling with this stranger? He does not appear to be of our country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving from the side of Sir Bernard, Isabelle again looked down into the face of the stranger. \u201cAnd who are you sir?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Highness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is nothing more to be done for them today, m\u2019lady. They need their rest, and when they awake they will require sustenance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen can I expect them to rise and tell me what has transpired?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry m\u2019lady, but there is just no way to tell. In the intervening time, the hour grows late. Might I suggest a meal and rest for your highness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. That can wait. One of the king\u2019s best knights has been brought nearly to death by someone or something unknown, a matter which must not be taken lightly. With my father abroad it falls to me to discover how such an event has come about. I shall remain here for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish Princess. I shall return to redress their wounds in due time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver an hour had past and neither Sir Bernard nor the stranger had stirred. If Isabelle hadn\u2019t known better she might have believed they had passed on since the doctor had left them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a chair a few feet from the sleeping men, Isabelle hadn\u2019t even realized she had fallen asleep when she was startled awake and noticed one of the figures was sitting up, his hands cradling his head. It was the stranger. Now sitting up straight in her own chair, Isabelle wasn\u2019t sure what to say or how to approach the situation \u2013 she was still young in the ways of diplomacy and nothing at all about the men before her. He could very well have been responsible for Sir Bernard\u2019s current state. And yet, Isabelle felt no sense of unease with being so close to what could potentially be a threat to her person. Instead, any uneasiness she felt stemmed from her fear of whether she could effectively handle the situation on her own while her parents were away. For a few moments she merely sat watching him. It wasn\u2019t long before he lifted his head and their eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Isabelle had not even noticed when she decided to speak let alone what to say; all of a sudden the words were just there, flowing as naturally as breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter. Thank you. How is the knight?\u201d His voice was hardly above a hoarse whisper, but the room was still enough to hear him clearly, the deep breathing of the unconscious Sir Bernard enhancing rather than disturbing the calm of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Bernard? He shall live; he is just resting now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are in the castle of King Edward.

A pained expression crossed his face and his hand shot up to his temples. Just as quickly Isabelle was by his side, worry coloring her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you ought to lie back down. It appears you\u2019ve been through quite an ordeal already and need your rest.\u201d No sooner had he lain down then they were startled by Sir Bernard who groaned in his sleep but did not wake. Breathing a sigh Isabelle was again startled, this time by the stranger sitting up straight as a board, the color drained from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong? Are you alright? I\u2019ll fetch the physician.\u201d Isabelle moved to leave, but was stopped by a hand on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, I need warn \u2013 They must know \u2013 \u201d The words came out so fast Isabelle barely understood. He took a deep breath before continuing, slower this time. \u201cWhere are the king and queen? King Edward you said? I need to speak with him. It is of grave importance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid that my parents are away at the moment and will not return for several days. If you would tell me what is so important I shall see what can be in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no the king\u2026\u201d He paused a moment as the words sunk in, his face softening as he looked at Isabelle as if only now really seeing her. \u201cDid you say your parents? You\u2019re the princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am Princess Isabelle, and I will help any way that I can. Now will you please tell me what has transpired here? What is so urgent?\u201d The stranger\u2019s eyes wandered to Sir Bernard\u2019s still unconscious form as he pondered his next move, his next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at first as if still debating his options but growing more determined with each word, the stranger began to unfold the events that had led him and the knight to her doorstep in their present condition. She may not be queen, may not even have any real authority beyond these walls yet, but it could do no harm to warn her. And people needed to be warned. Even if he could only warn them one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family and I\u201d a brief shadow of grief flickered across his face at the mention of his family, but he recovered quickly and continued with his tale, \u201cwere two to three days south of Lain\u2019s southern border in the kingdom of Tamor. We had been traveling some time so we did not notice when we started hearing the noises; we merely assumed our imaginations were running wild and quickly discredited the signs. Even now I cannot tell you exactly when we crossed their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA creature unlike any that has been seen in these lands for many generations emerged from the woods. A few of the men placed their hands on their weapons and kept their sense alert the creature, but we kept to our path. We hoped to make camp before nightfall. There was only one of the creatures, hardly a serious threat to us, but all the same it is not the kind of thing you want anywhere near you day or night. We just kept walking, and it continued to stare after us while walking parallel to us. Soon, however, one by one, more of those creatures began emerging from the woods and they all began creeping ever closer to our band.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were fierce creatures indeed \u2013 as big as bears, both canine and feline features, and, in their eyes, an insatiable hunger. But what they are called or from where they come, I do not know. When the second one came into view, the men slowly moved between the women and children and the creatures. But we kept walking. When the third came out of the woods, we drew our weapons. But we kept walking. When the fourth appeared, we ran and they charged\u2026.\u201d He pressed his palms into his eyes trying to erase the images permanently burned into the inside of his eye lids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe tried to stay together all long as we could and fight them off as best we could, but the creatures were too fast and too strong. I saw a few men fall beneath the claws of those beasts and told the women and child to run, to save themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy God.\u201d Isabelle didn\u2019t want to think about what it must have been like for him to see his family running for their lives and being unable to protect them or even keep them together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not know what happened next. We must have been close to your border because the next thing I remember is seeing this knight and running towards praying that he would help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your family?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure she really wanted to know the answer. The question came out hardly above a whisper. He looked down at his hands clasped in his lap, and there was such grief on his face it pained Isabelle to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I ran for what I hoped would be our salvation I looked around myself but not one of them was in sight. Neither were any of the creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then how did Sir Bernard get injured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of the creatures were in view as I made my way to Sir Bernard, but one at least not far away. I reached Sir Bernard and began to explain what had happened and to ask for his assistance. Neither of us saw where it came from, but we were both knocked to the ground in a manner of seconds. He fought valiantly; I would not be alive without him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he kill this creature?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger looked up into her eyes and Isabelle already knew the answer as unbelievable and terrifying as it was.</span></div></div>",

It was wounded but its power was in no way diminished. I believed it was about to make one final strike killing us both when a terrible rumbling call, I can only assume came from the others, rose up in the distance and the creature ran off and disappeared as swiftly as it had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sat frozen in shock for several moments before I noticed Sir Bernard doubled over at my side. Not quite convinced that the creatures were really gone but knowing we could not simply stay where we were in that condition, I tried to clean our injuries as best as I could. Then supporting as much of his weight as I could, I helped Sir Bernard into the saddle of his horse who after being frightened away by the creature had returned to its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long we walked, stopping often to rest, I do not know, nor do I have a clue as to how we found our way this castle.

How could something like this happen?</i> There had been rumors of strange occurrences in some of the eastern kingdoms, but nothing specific, certainly nothing like this. Isabelle stared off at the open window trying to erase from her mind\u2019s eye the quickly forming image of those creatures and the horrible scene of men, women, and children running for their lives but far too many unable to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes began to refocus, Isabelle noticed the sky beginning to lighten as the sun rose on a world that seemed to her completely different than the carefree world she lived and laughed in the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard the man sigh she tore her eyes from the brightening morning outside the window and was momentarily startled by what she saw. The man\u2019s face was cast in deep relief by the light slanting into the room through the window. He looked older and more worn down than she remembered at their first meeting some hours ago. Then again his arrival caused quite a stir and may not have gotten a very good look at him. And after all he\u2019s been through, it\u2019s no wonder the way he looks now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are safe now. I shall go get you some food and fresh clothes. Just rest for now. The is plenty of time to figure things out.\u201d Isabelle rose and patted his shoulder reassuringly before heading towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had walked several feet when she felt a cold tingling on her arm. Looking down she found that Sir Bernard had awaken and was reaching his hand out to her from where he lay. \u201cYour highness.\u201d He made a move to rise but fell back with a groan and gripped his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Bernard,\u201d Isabelle knelt besides the knight and held his outstretched hand in both of hers. Her mother would not have approved, he was a member of the court and he was in pain. \u201cRest now. How are you feeling?\u201d He looked confused and yet determined at the same time. As if he knew there was something important he had to say but try as he might he could not remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cValiant knight, it seems grace has decided to shine on us.\u201d The stranger rose and moved to the knight\u2019s side, smiling down on him as he spoke. \u201cAfter leading me to you who saved my life from those monstrous beasts, the fates led us here to our safe harbor at the castle of your king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a soft knock at the door, immediately followed by Daniel\u2019s head poking around the door. \u201cI thought I heard voices. Is everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. Come on in Daniel.\u201d Isabelle rose to her feet and dusted herself off before moving to the side allowing Daniel to greet Sir Bernard. Many of the knights of King Edward\u2019s inner court knew Daniel, not just as the Princess\u2019s best friend but as a young man determined to become a knight and few, if any, hesitations about incessantly asking them for advice and tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked over Sir Bernard once, and although he could not disguise the same disbelief they all felt that now crossed his face it was quickly replaced by a good natured grin. \u201cLooks like someone got the better of you old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Bernard could not help but return the smile. It was a pleasant change from the pain and confusion previous coloring his features. \u201cSo it would seem, but it was something rather than some one. Though I am sure you would have fared much better.\u201d Unfortunately the good mood did not last. Another stab of pain wiped the smile off of Sir Bernard\u2019s face. \u201cRest, Sir Bernard. This kingdom would not be the same without you. And I still have many more questions for you about becoming a knight.\u201d They exchanged wry smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle and Daniel moved off to the other side of the room and spoke in hushed voices so as not to disturb Sir Bernard or the stranger who now stood by the window looking out past the horizon. \u201cWhere are our new friends?\u201d Isabelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDylan was hungry. They went to the kitchens to get something to eat,\u201d Daniel replied, still distracted by the sight of so many wounds on the body of a man he once thought invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known.\u201d Pausing, trying to find the right words, Isabelle glanced back at the form of Sir Bernard. \u201cThe creatures this man described that attacked them. It is beyond belief Daniel.\u201d She briefly retold the story of the attack. The stranger continued to star out the window, the knight looked absently up at the ceiling, but both heard what passed between these two. \u201cDo you remember those rumors that have been circulating, about the strange incidents in the far Eastern kingdoms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It is possible, even probable, that these creatures are the cause. But what are they, and what were they doing there? They are farther West than any one of the rumors have placed them so far.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were an advance scouting party.\u201d Sir Bernard had managed to pull himself up into a sitting position without either Isabelle or Daniel noticing. The stranger merely continued staring out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Bernard, do you know what these things are?\u201d Isabelle was bewildered. How could he know about these creatures?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not what they are, but why they were there.\u201d Daniel and Isabelle each took seats across from Sir Bernard. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the rumors of unexplainable occurrences \u2013 the disappearances and slaughters of livestock and strange sightings. What you may not have heard are the rumors that Radigan is extending the reach of his power. We cannot be sure since none of those kings have admitted to any of it, but it is believed that Radigan has been stretching out and seizing control of lands in the kingdoms surrounding his dominion. He may even now have full control of any number of those lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he is not stopping there. I do not know how, but recently incredible creatures suddenly appeared apparently at his bidding such as those that attacked this man and his family, as well as many more we have yet to see but have heard tell of.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll remained motionless, the gravity of the situation bearing down on them. The same thought tortured them all: <i>Radigan and those creatures are steadily making their way here, and everyone who crosses their path will almost surely die.<i></i></i></span></div></div>",

We \u2013 \u201d There was a squeak as the door opened interrupting Isabelle\u2019s train of thought. In skipped Dylan, chomping on a carrot. Jackson followed him in carrying a tray of food. \u201cWe thought all of you could do with a little nourishment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both froze at the sight of the stranger who had spun around when he heard Jackson speak. Shocking Isabelle and Daniel, Dylan dropped the carrot, only half eaten, and ran into the arms of the man. Jackson looked as if he were about to dropped the tray of food. Sir Bernard, who was closest to Jackson, took the try from him and immediately placed it on the nearest end table unable to support it very long for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion filled the three faces of Isabelle, Daniel, and Sir Bernard. Pure joy filled the three faces of Jackson, Dylan, and the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Nathaniel!\u201d Dylan squealed with delight as he hugged him closer. Daniel and Isabelle were stunned. They had grown so fond of Dylan and Jackson in the past few days that they had almost forgotten they had had lives and known people before arriving at the castle. And the likelihood of one of the family members they had been separated from while in another kingdom finding his way here after passing through yet another kingdom was unfathomable. Getting over his initial shock Jackson joined Dylan in his embrace of Nathaniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my boys. How I have longed to see you alive and well. We never gave up hope.\u201d The smile took years off Nathaniel\u2019s face. He no longer appeared the same haggard man who arrived bearing the marks of incredible suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackson you know this man?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Daniel, Isabelle, I would like you to meet Nathaniel. His was the family that took us in when we had no one else to turn to. Nathaniel, this is Princess Isabelle and Daniel. They have been good to us.\u201d Unfortunately they joy of a family reunion could not last long. Nathaniel could not look into Dylan\u2019s eyes when he looked up at him and asked, \u201cUncle Nathaniel, where all the others?\u201d The pain returned to his face, though he tried to conceal it for Dylan\u2019s sake. He failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Nathaniel? What is wrong?\u201d He could not bring himself to answer Jackson\u2019s question. Instead he looked to first to Sir Bernard, than Daniel, and let his eyes come to rest on Isabelle. She was just as hesitant to tell Jackson and Dylan what had come to pass, but she simply could not ignore Nathaniel\u2019s imploring, despair filled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackson, Dylan, perhaps you should take a seat.\u201d Once everyone was seated they set about explaining what had happened, trying to soften the blow as best as they could. The farther they got in the story, the closer Nathaniel held Dylan. Jackson\u2019s hands clasped into fists, but he remained silent the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tale was over and no one said anything for several moments, hoping to take their minds off the grisly scene, Nathaniel asked how they had come to reside at this castle with two new friends. Dylan explained about how Isabelle had saved him from the crazed cook. Nathaniel smiled; he knew very well the extent of Dylan\u2019s insatiable appetite. He told of the fancy bath and comfy bed he got to sleep on. He talked about having lunch with Daniel\u2019s family, and of Daniel and Jackson\u2019s sword fight. Proudly he told Nathaniel how he helped in the stable, and of the majestic horse Elias. When he expressed his eagerness for the family to meet Elias, Jackson snapped out of his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go after them. We have to find them before\u2026. Before anything else happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackson, they could be anywhere by now.\u201d Nathaniel said the words, but it was clear he felt just as Jackson did and wanted to go find his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose animals are far deadly than anything you\u2019ve ever heard of kid,\u201d Sir Bernard warned. \u201cIf you were to cross paths with even one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason we need to find them before those creatures do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have only just now been reunited, Jackson. I will not lose you boys again. I will not watch more of my family torn down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried in vain to convey how dangerous it would be for them to jump headlong into a search with what they knew and, worse, with what they didn\u2019t know. Jackson wouldn\u2019t hear any of it.  \u201cIf you will not help me I will go alone.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But we must be smart about this.\u201d She had made up her mind the moment she heard that Radigan\u2019s forces were about to ravage the lands of her kingdom and kill her people. Now a plan began to solidify, and it was clear what she had to do. Isabelle sounded so sure and determined that no one else said anything. They merely waited to hear what she had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of disclosing her ideas, Isabelle silently walked to the door, opened it, and told the attendant standing outside to summon Sirs Thomas, Donovan, Andrew, and Jonothan immediately. He bowed and ran down the hall. When she returned everyone waited expectantly, Isabelle merely sat down and continued to contemplate. Was she doing the right thing? She had no idea, but something had to be done and with her parents gone, it was up to her. None could bring themselves to interrupt her reverie. They all remained motionless and their thoughts were so numerous and palpable one only had to reach up and pluck them from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She really is maturing into a bright young woman. Beneath the surface a true leader does indeed lay in wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t just leave them out there, not after coming so close to reuniting with my family. I will not lose another family. And Dylan must not be made to go through that again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Underneath all the games and mischief and boys clothes and layers of dirt, I never forgot she was a princess. But now, now I can see a glimmer of the queen she will one day become.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am overjoyed to find these boys alive and well. It seems I need not have worried. They are doing well, and seem to have made two incredible friends.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please let this turn out well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the four knights arrived. Isabelle had moved to gaze out the window, still working out what she was about to do, while everyone else was seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called for us your Highness?\u201d one of the knights asked. All four bowed as Isabelle turned from the window to look at them. When they rose and noticed Sir Bernard, surprised registered on the faces of Andrew and Jonothan. Jonothan recovered his composure sooner. Shock flickered through the eyes of Thomas and Donovan, but as more seasoned knights they were quicker to regain control of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I did. There has been an incident, and we seem to be on the brink of a great crisis. Sir Bernard experienced this first hand, and I will allow him to divulge the details,\u201d she said before returning her gaze to the window. Between her own jumbled thoughts, Isabelle did not hear a single word of Bernard\u2019s story. This was just as well, for she could not bear to hear it again. All of a sudden she noticed silence in the room and could not determine how long it had been so. The tale of the attack had long since ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Isabelle turned around Donovan, Thomas, Andrew, and Jonothan had taken seats around Bernard. They made to rise, but she gestured for them to remain seated. Isabelle sat down before them and took in a deep breath while the others watched her expectantly. Once she finally began to speak, her voice betrayed no hint of hesitation or doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonovan, Jonothan, and Andrew, I want you three to make all haste to our borders closest to where Sir Bernard last saw these creatures. As the fastest Donovan, you are not to hold back; Jonothan and Andrew will follow behind you. At a time like this, every moment counts. Get there as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are to scout the area, ascertain if this or another advance scout party or any others of Radigan\u2019s forces are nearby. If they are, do not engage. Whether or not you find any sign of them, warn the people in the surrounding area. They need not know everything, we do not want panic, but they need to be prepared for possible attack. While you are there, please keep your eyes and ears open for members of Nathaniel\u2019s family, and let them know we mean to reunite them with their missing family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThomas, I want you to intercept my parents, alert them of the situation, and hasten their return here. Upon their return, most likely, a new plan of action will be formed. Until that time, however, I believe this to be the best course. Tomorrow, I shall likewise make my way to the border towns accompanied by Daniel and Jackson and, since I can already see they will not be left behind for the world, Dylan and Nathaniel. That is if you feel well enough for the trip Nathaniel\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. And you have my sincerest thanks m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will search out your scattered family,\u201d she said to Nathaniel and the two brothers. \u201cAs well as warn and prepare the people of what towns we come across,\u201d this second part she directed to the knights. After a short pause she continued, \u201cIf there are no objections, I would appreciate it if you go to it immediately. Our people cannot be left defenseless and clueless of the fate that may shortly befall them.\u201d Without another word Jonothan, Andrew, and Donovan rose, bowed to the princess, and after a short nod from Thomas exited the room to prepare for their mission. Thomas remained seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all do respect your Highness, though your plan is much more sound than I would have expected, there is one rather egregious hole that should be addressed,\u201d he replied in all solemnity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will overlook that lack of faith in my ability to strategize and instead accept it as a compliment.\u201d Sir Thomas nodded to indicate that he meant no offense. \u201cNow, what issue do you wish to rectify?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs crowned princess, you should not be walking right into danger, especially not without proper protection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what you will I won\u2019t be deterred. And I won\u2019t be as defenseless as you may think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand completely. However, it is my duty to protect this kingdom and the royal family. I would be remiss if I let you go without accompanying you myself. Please listen,\u201d he implored before she could interject. \u201cI propose one simple amendment to your plan: I will accompany you and these gentlemen and we will send some other messenger to your parents. The King and Queen are in a completely other part of the kingdom; it is not necessary for a knight to fetch them. They will be quite safe with their own retinue. Besides, some of our fastest messengers travel faster than many of the knights. Not to mention your parents would kill me if I let you go without doing all in my power to keep you safe.\u201d He was right and Isabelle knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI too shall accompany you,\u201d Bernard spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sir Bernard, you are not well.\u201d They were all thinking it, but it was Nathaniel who gave voice to the thought. Their shared experience had bonded them, giving Nathaniel a unique license to be blunt with Bernard. They were already close friends though they knew nothing about each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt matters not,\u201d he addressed to Nathaniel. Then he resumed speaking to Isabelle. \u201cA knight knows his duty. If you say no I will still follow behind you anyway, and, should we survive this ordeal, I will graciously accept any punishment.\u201d Isabelle wanted to object, to say anything to keep him from potentially killing himself for her, but she knew nothing would work. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, you can think of it this way: that I am going to protect Nathaniel. It is said that if you save a man\u2019s life you are responsible for him ever after. I only just managed to save him from those creatures, I\u2019ll be damned if I let them or anything else finish the job.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She would expect nothing else from this group. \u201cSo be it. Thomas if you would please send a messenger to the King and Queen as quickly as possible. Bernard, if you are up to it, I would like to detail your encounter with this creature to the senior knights. They need to be aware of what they may soon be facing. All of the knights \u2013 novices and veterans alike \u2013 will need extra training to prepare for what is to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like no time at all before they were on their way. Dylan had packed plenty of food for the journey. Isabelle had saddled and was presently riding Elias \u2013 who seemed as eager as the rest to be on his way. Daniel and Jackson had been armed with brand new swords, Dylan was provided with a crossbow, and Isabelle, after much arguing, was allowed a dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now traveled the road out of the capital city two-by-two. Sirs Donovan and Andrew headed the group, while Sirs Thomas and Jonothan took up the rear. Daniel and Dylan rode side by side second; Jackson and Nathaniel rode third, discussing what they had been through since being separated; Isabelle and Sir Bernard rode next to last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan, Jonothan, and Andrew planned to accompany the others for the first day and then set off at a faster pace early the next morning. It was felt, among the knights mostly, that because they had set out from the castle close to midday they would not get much further ahead of the others before dark fell and that it would be more prudent for them to stick close as long as they could. Two of their number were injured, four were mere children (no matter how mature they thought they were or even acted in rare instances), and circumstances could easily change in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group set out with a sense of urgency, but after about an hour that urgency began to wane. Soon the mood began to morph into one of near frivolity. The pace slowed, and the chatter increased. They stopped once to eat and rest the horses and a second time to rest Sir Bernard and Nathaniel, despite their protests that they were well enough to keep going. Just before stopping a third time Dylan\u2019s voice cut through the conversation and all eyes followed the point of his finger. The young have a way of seeing things others may not \u2013 both real and imagined. They can see beyond the bounds of reality and they can see reality for what it is when others cannot. None of them noticed the dilapidated huts along the side of the path some distance from them until Dylan pointed them out. For some of the party, their eyes still did not see the buildings until they had traveled nearly a quarter of the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer they got, the more ramshackle the buildings looked. Once they reached the row of buildings, they almost immediately continued on, not one doubting that they had long been abandoned. However, as the other horses began moving forward again, Elias refused. He shook his mane, whinnied, and took a few steps backwards, completely ignoring Isabelle\u2019s directions. Sir Bernard reached out to take the reins from Isabelle\u2019s hands and lead Elias forward, disregarding the horse\u2019s protestations. As Elias stubbornly remained put, Isabelle heard a faint clatter. About to dismiss the sound as a breeze lifting a few loose leaves from their branches, Isabelle recognized a faintly metallic quality to the sound. Almost immediately she then heard Jonothan speak up, his words stopping them all in their tracks. \u201cWait. I see some movement beyond these cabins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on, hyper-vigilant for any hint of danger, they saw that there were more buildings farther from the road, and many showed signs of some recent repair. Continuing to watch, one by one, they all began to see some small signs of movement, what looked like people walking to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this township was abandoned years ago.\" Donovan and Jonothan put their hands to their brows to shield their eyes from the setting sun. Jackson squinted his eyes trying to see farther into spaces between the buildings. Isabelle watched Dylan wave his entire arm from side to side at whoever stood in the center of the township.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that is how its residents wish it to appear,\" Sir Thomas cryptically answered their curious gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go speak with them,\" Daniel suggested, \"it will be dark soon.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her latest being about her early morning rides along the royal cantor trail, which circled the grounds where the castle set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe observed the good and the bad in clothing that the guests chose to adorn themselves with. The Lady Corinth seated to her right wore a ghastly collar and the Duke of Trove, seated directly across from her bore a multi-colored vest beneath a hideous overcoat. His straggly beard was none too clean, which caused her to completely lose her sparse appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen had brought five different meats to each table. Wild quall was her favorite and there was trout from the bubbling spring the King\u2019s fishermen had pulled out of the water. Hunts men brought squirrel and rabbit to the table and the turtle soup was a delicacy. The vegetables were raw and roasted as were the apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was tired of smiling; all she wanted to do was to go to her room, but there was no hope of that, for at least another hour or two. The banquets were always so long; she dreaded every minute she had to stay, \u201cYou are a princess after all,\u201d her mother always said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle became very quiet as she dropped her napkin on her plate signifying the end of her meal. Queen Jasmine looked at her daughter and wondered if she was feeling alright. She spoke to her husband and then got up from her set and started toward Isabelle.</span></div></div>",

Their little kingdom was called Catsorama because there were cats everywhere. The kingdom was overrun with cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old king sighed. \"I guess I better hire a catnapper to come here and round up all these cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Daddy?\" asked Princess Moslyn. \"I like cats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do, darling, but there are too many of them. They ate all the mice and rats long ago and now they are sneaking into people's kitchens and stealing food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Daddy. The little kitties got to eats, don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king crossed his arms across his chest. \"I have spoken. The cats must go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Princess Moslyn put on her walking boots and her traveling cape. She packed a bag of sandwiches and a bottle of lemonade and a change of underwear. Then she went out into the night, softly whistling to her cat friends. When she had gathered them all together, she led them down the road away from the castle and out of the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the king woke up the next morning he was surprised to not hear any hungry meows. Soon the king and queen and all the townspeople were rejoicing. \"The cats are gone! The cats are gone!\" Everyone was singing and dancing and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the king noticed his daughter was not celebrating with them, so he sent a guard to fetch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard brought back a folded note, saying, \"I found this on her pillow, sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king felt a great foreboding in his heart.

Hands searching for the constriction, found only satin, pressing firmly to discover a corset beneath. Hands rising higher to the top found breasts. Cupping them, mauling them to only discover himself gasping in shock. They were damned sensitive. Wiping the last of the blurriness from his eyes, Daniel looked down to see a well presented cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he recognised, all too well. Though this was the first time seeing it from this angle. Looking over he saw his former body, standing with his hips cocked, and an amused smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do a better job to pass as me.\" His voice sounding reedy and high, as he addressed, the newly-minted princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar thoughts were passing through her head, as she looked the newest stable-boy over.
