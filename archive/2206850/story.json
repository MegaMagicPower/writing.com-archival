The stress of being the Heir of slytherin was getting to him. and it showed harry was definitely fatter than he was at the start of his 6th year having largely kept trim and fit his past 5 years. but this year the hate and fear against him plus the war caused him to just feel trapped like no one wanted to help him. even his friends were weary or too caught up with themselves to pay attention to him. So he was left all alone and he found only one thing that helped him in this time. Food the house elves being friendly was not helping his waistline either he'd go down to the kitchen each day intending only a snack after lunch leaving with a very bloated gut. He thought Malfoy would mock his weight but he was really cagey lately looking pale and closed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile harry was waddling trying to calm his stomach he heard the sound of running water and saw some leaking and he decided to go check out what was going on in the bathroom he found a mess he also saw something moving as fast as his fat bloated lethargic body would let him move he hobbled over to the item and found a book since it was obviously left here and he checked through it and it was blank. \"This is really weird\" he unintentionally said aloud probably too full to think to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled out quickly before anyone saw and as he walked a sound he was used to made itself known while he was thinking about what to write in it. His stomach somehow he was hungry and he could feel it to. So he waddled his way down to the kitchens. Tickled the pear and was once again greeted by the house elves waddled over to a table took out his quill and before he could get started nibble. Well he intended to nibbble but ate with wreckless abandon enjoying feeling happy and content if only just for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inked his quill and then began writing the text disappeared and thats when harry should have thought something was wrong but when it started to talk back. He was enjoying having someone to talk and vent even if it was merely just a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as he ate he wrote and spoke with the book. Told it everything on his mind. </span></div></div>",

Maybe the Diary was right he did enjoy his binges and he did feel happy while eating. It was true he was jealous of Dudley and Vernon. It was also true that he did look at Goyle sometimes in ways he interpreted as disgust but maybe the diary was right it was the jealousy of that big jiggling belly. The thought of it started to make Harry quite hungry. Maybe that's why he looked at Malfoy weirdly he was so decadently rich and yet was nothing more than skin and bones you could even see his bones. With how rich Malfoy was he should be struggling to walk under a mountain of flab. He thought before he could even really think and blushed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he really that kind of person on the inside? The thought of Harry being spoiled like Dudley Made him quite happy...Among other things. Maybe the Diary was right the real problem was that Harry just wasn't being who he really wanted to be. He just wasn't sure what kind of person he wanted to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he going to be a more Lazy slob type the thought of doing as little as possible and getting fat did sound really nice and his belly would certainly agree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor was he going to still try to live his life will getting fatter and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first however food he needed to eat. he had house-elves get him a feast to sate him and he ate more than he ever had before just enjoying each bite knowing that this was his future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut where shall his future lie?</span></div></div>",

Harry swallowed the rest of the sweets before heading out to find Crabbe and Goyle, Harry pulled on his shirt to make sure that it covered his belly, it was starting to get tight that he constantly tugged on it to make sure that it was covering his lower belly. Harry was pretty sure that the two of them were stuffing their faces at the Great Hall as usual, hopefully Malfoy wasn't there he had no time for that annoying twig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry made it to the Great Hall albeit a little out of breath. But he spied the two boys eating to their heart's content. Harry walked up to Crabbe and Goyle who responded by stopping what they were doing and looked up. At first they were agitated to see Potter walking up to them but then it was shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey Harry I heard you put on weight but I didn't expect you would put on this much!\" Crabbe said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry blushed taking it as a compliment. \"Well yeah I've been eating a lot lately gotta do something when everyone is avoiding you\" harry said as he began to tug on his shirt again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoyle stood up and stood face to face with Harry they were so closed that their guts slightly touched each other for a second. \"Why are you here Potter?\" Goyle demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought we could be friends\" Harry said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends with you?! Why!?\" Goyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because unlike Malfoy I won't treat you like some expendable henchmen!\" Harry shouted back, then something amazing happened Crabbe and Goyle actually seemed to be contemplating Harry's offer, even they were getting tired of how Malfoy was treating them. Also I want to have friends I can get fatter with. Harry said giving Goyle a belly bump who tumbled back not expecting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabbe and Goyle looked at each other not sure what to make with this but settled on an answer with a smile and they both looked at Harry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on we are about to have our third lunch\" Crabbe said as he ushered Harry to join them.

A red light hit Draco who fell to the floor paralyzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thee boys then surrounded the paralyzed Draco their bodies casting a shadow over Draco's helpless form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need you and more Draco\" Crabbe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you Harry treats us with respect, and sees are bodies as something glorious something you never did\" Goyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are tired of being treated as your goons, and once we are done with well be the ones that everyone will fear.\" Crabbe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled wickedly at Draco. \"All that wealth and prestige and you stay with having such a miserable lithe body how pathetic\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of tjem then proceeded to give Dracoa good beating and then leave him there till the spell wore off. Soon everyone would know. who was in charge of Hogwarts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, I'm sure we could go for a good meal after that\" Harry said as he and his crew went back to the Great Hall to eat again.</span></div></div>",

Every week or so he got larger robes from the school's clothing department, as each week would add another few inches to his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, the fat hanging off of his frame made him larger than his cousin Dudley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robes slipped over his large belly and huge ass, stuffed into a magically enhanced pair of undies that were still too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully enrobed, Harry exited the common room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt nearly six hundred pounds, he was grateful for having mastered the <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i> spell.

His clothes clung to his fat rolls as they were having trouble containing his soft plushy fat . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked over to Goyle. The first thing you saw when you looked at Goyle was his heavy man tits that were straining his shirt. Harry could spy his top buttons losing the fight to keep his chest contained. Harry couldn't wait till Goyle's shirt would give out and his tits being released from his prisoner. Though Crabbe also had a nice set of moobs, Goyle's didn't sag and were surprisingly perky, something Harry enjoyed when he would grope his love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry if you spend to too gawking at you, you're going to fall behind\" Goyle said with his mouth stuffed with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed \"I can't help it I have such to luscious boyfriends that just get sexier the more weight they put on\" Harry said flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Crabbe and Goyle blushed at the comment.

Goyle was tying Harry up. though Harry was all but willing to be fed, they found it kinky to have Harry tied up. Something Harry had no complaints about.

Harry started to get antsy while being tied up, he wanted to play with Goyle's fat too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rules Harry, no touching till you finish your meal\" Goyle said as he groped his moob, knowing Harry had a weakness for it.

Harry was gawking at his adipose Adonis. He almost fell out of his chair in excitement. Goyle then slowly sat in Harry lap. Their pale fat bodies pressed against each other as Goyle pressed into Harry's body. Crabbe handed Goyle a pastry who then placed it in front of Harry. \"Open wide bog boy\" Goyle said. Harry opened his mouth as Goyle stuffed the pasty into his face. Harry ate everything that Goyle put in front of him and even french kissed his lover in between. Both Harry and Goyle could feel as Harry's belly expanded pushing Goyle away. Harry was having a hard time keeping up, as the process lagged on. Sometimes Goyle thrusting another sweet treat in him before he was ready. It was finally when the last pastry was eaten that Harry collapsed in his chair, panting heavily after such a big meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Crabbe and Goyle decided to let Harry rest off his meal as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Urp* A burp escaped Harry who then let out a groan and rubbed his bloated belly. He was surrounded by empty candy wrappers and food crumbs. Though it was something that Harry was getting used to, his sixth year was strange, people were like weirdly nice to him, way too nice. Even Snape and Draco didn't even harass him at all though they seemed to have kept their distance from Harry. Professors would pass him even if he didn't do good on tests, people he didn't know wanted to be his friend and all the treats. Harry was sure he could just eat all the food peo[le gave him and not have to eat at the Great Hall. Though of course, he did both since Ron and Hermione were always pestering him to go to the Great Hall then shove food in his face. Every day he was going to bed stuffed, and it was starting to show. He had a small belly poking from his shirt, and his chest was sagging a bit. Though he'd probably lose all of it since he was going back to the Dursleys for the summer, who would probably starve him. If he knew anyone that wouldn't be nice to him it was them. And it sucked he had to go home alone since Ron and Hermione since Ron and Hermione went to Romania to see Ron's cousin Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow creaked was heard in the hallway of the train, as Harry turned his head to saw the old woman rolling the trolley car. She stopped at Harry's booth, grabbed some candies and placed them in the seat next to Harry, \"Compliments from the trolley for a growing boy\" she said as she continued on her way. Harry collapsed in his seat and groaned he was too full to even think about eating again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Harry was unaware that this was all happening due to a botched charm that a Death Eater had cast on Harry since he infiltrated the Ministry of Magic, it was a dark charm that made other people hostile to the person it was cast on, though it did the opposite and had people befriend the user though also it also caused people to passively want the charmed person to gain weight as well, and Harry had no idea that this would also affect the Dursleys as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry made his way home walking up 4 Private Drive, while also dragging his suitcase to the door. He wasn't looking forward being back, it was hell, it was always hell. Though Harry knew it wasn't something that could be avoided. He knocked on the door waiting for Vernon or Petunia to answer the door and look at him with disdain, or worse Dudley to open the door and harass him. Harry knocked on the door. A few seconds later the doorknob twisted and swung open, revealing his cousin Dudley. Harry saw the Dudley did look bigger than the last time Harry had seen him, which wasn't a surprise since Harry's aunt and uncle spoiled him.  But before Harry could process anything else, he saw Dudley's face changed to the excitement, \"Harry!\" Dudley shouted and then wrapped Harry in a bear hug. Dudley's wider frame making it look his body was engulfing Harry's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was shocked the last thing he ever expected was to see Dudley be excited to see him... or actually hug him. \"It's... nice to see you at Dudley...\" Harry said, still weirded out by what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDudley put Harry down and ushered him into the home, \"It's so glad to see your home, Mum and Dad were all excited to see you, but they had help Aunt Marge with something, but they'll be home soon.\" Dudley said. Harry's eyebrow raised hearing that his aunt and uncle... missed him. This day was getting weirder and weirder. Though Dudley didn't seem to notice Harry's expression. \"And look at this\" Dudley said giving Harry's belly a grab, making Harry blush. \"Man looks like you enjoyed your time at that school, finally becoming a man\" Dudley joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry politely removed Dudley's hand from his belly, he was having a hard time accepting what was going on but he didn't question it for now after all this was way better than being bullied by his cousin. \"Yeah it just kinda snuck up on my I guess\" Harry took a better look at his cousin, he was correct Dudley had gotten bigger since his time away. Dudley's belly clearly straining against his t-shirt, and there was no arguing his cousin's moobs had gotten puffier as well. But Harry's belly let out a growl, Harry was slightly shocked he was hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right you must be starving after the long trip home come on,\" Dudley said as he leads Harry to dining room, and in there was a giant spread of food, the entire surface was covered. \"Mum prepared this for you when you could home, just for the two of us, now come on before I only leave you scraps!\" Dudley said excitedly as he rushed to the table, with Harry following his cousin to the table as they begin to eat to their heart's content.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He waddled over to a seat and forgoing manners let his hunger take over. He tore into the pile of food like he hadn't eaten in days he probably made a bit of a mess but he didn't care it all tasted so good and filled him up so well. He was surprised at how fast he was eating compared to Dudley who while glutting himself paled in comparison to Harry's gluttony his belly ached but he didn't care he felt his pants were too tight so he reached below his belly and unbuttoned them feeling immensely relieved and his belly surged forward a little bit. He then returned to eating it was all so good thick meaty turkey legs, Ham and stuffing, various casseroles, a massive amount of mashed potatoes. and everything slathered in butter. Every bite he took butter and oil ran down his chin grease coating his hands. He enjoyed it all he felt so good here he was with Dudley eating with him as if he were family as if the years of neglect had never happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was happy to Have it he in the background heard Dudley Burp loudly before he leaned back. \"Ugh Harry how are you still eating? Its nice to see that school do something good for you\" *BUUUUUUURP*. Harry barely heard him he was busy drinking gravy shoveling casseroles into his mouth. His shirt was tight he didnt care he had to finish the food. He ate and tore through the last little bits of food he could find. Before finally finishing off with one final Swallow releasing a massive burp and his shirt forcing its way up exposing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh so full.\" Dudley looked a bit shocked but was smiling. \"Mum and Dad are going to be so happy to see you eating so well.\" Dudley waddled over to the couch feeling tired Harry was dangerously full his belly ached. yet in the pit of his stomach and at the back of his mind he knew one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe loved every second of this he loved how fat he was and how much he was allowed to gorge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Harry felt his belly gurgle slightly for more.

Did you eat this all by yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a burp before starting. \"No Dudley had a little but I have on question\" Petunia and Vernon both looked expectant. \"Did you bring any dessert?\" They both Smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first day was a trend for his first month with the Dursleys to say they spoiled him is to be an understatement harry barely moved the entire month and ate a ton.

They suffered the same as he did. he ate enough to feed an entire house back at Hogwarts and yet he only stopped because he was exhausted not that he was full. The table still full of food the 3 others in the family looking at the food hungrily their growling bellies in the background as they were so hungry. Harry still wouldn't give them food at this point harry was so greedy even the idea of someone else eating something made him feel starved. So as long as he was eating no one else got to eat.

He was furious he knew he should have kept them locked away while he slept. but he needed away of punishing them and without even thinking he grabbed his wand and shouted the first thing that came to mind \"Crucio\" the 2 fell to the floor writhing in pain and he didn't care he wanted them to feel terrible for this horrid transgression against him when he relented he felt really good but very hungry. and since there was still food. he yelled at the 2 wastes of space to get cooking as he tucked in to an ever increasing feast. his belly happy to be eating again made him less angry so he kept glutting. Food disappeared down his gullet and seemed to add to his ever increasing form. He wondered what the wizarding world would look at him like now that he in his mind was \"improved\". He thought about it as he drank down more gravy and felt his belly finally fully lay on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat in the back of the car belly growling as it hang heavy between harry's legs.

Was Draco was as fat maybe even fatter than he was but he wasn't alone he was surrounded by Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise, and Theo. All 4 of whom were just as fat and large as Draco. He knew this was odd but when he thought why his mind told him \"Any proper wizard was morbidly obese. and ate all the time.\" And if he were to think about it they fit that description. The Five of them were all gorging on food and when they opened the compartment.

It was a little weird but felt good he was among proper wizards, eating like a proper wizard, looking like a proper wizard. He ate like a man starved and even stole food out of the hands of others. Which only earned him a polite smile from Draco. \"I'd say if it weren't for knowing you these past 5 years.

He didn't inquire if it was like he suspected hagrid was probably far too fat to even ride the boats.

Which for good reason because they weren't actually Crabbe and Goyle but instead Harry and Ron. They had Herimonie create a polyjuice potion so they could talk to Malfoy and hopefully learn more about the Chamber of Secrets that was hidden at Hogwarts. Though it worked for some reason Herimonie was hesitant to go along and told them to go without her, and they only had an hour so they had to be quick about it before it was found out they weren't who they pretending to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I didn't realize how out of shape they were,\" Ron said getting winded on the way to the Common Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, it might have been a better idea to have picked people that were at least fit,\" Harry said annoyed. He could feel his gut, no, he could feel Goyle's gut shake as he moved. It was a weird feeling, something that he was trying to ignore. Regardless both and Ron continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a confrontation with Percy, Draco had snatched his goons and returned back to the Common Room, though Draco had some inflammatory remarks, Harry and Ron had to make sure that they kept a cool head. It was hard to get Draco to open up what he knew, and he would give Harry and Ron weird looks, mostly at their midsections. As Draco continued on he stopped conversing and rushed out returning what seemed like slices of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost forgot that I saved this for the both of you\" Draco said as he gave Harry and Ron the slices of cake. Harry and Ron looked at each other unsure what to do while Draco was looking at them waiting for something to happen, \"Well go on eat it you bloody gluttons\" He shouted at them. Which Harry and Ron swiftly, it was rich and filling they both wished they had more of it to eat. \"Well did you like it?\" Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah loved it\" Harry responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat I'll make sure that I buy more for the two of you, have to make sure you're properly fed and all, Draco said with lust in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't sure what the hell was going on but then he felt Ron nudge his side and as he looked to his friend he saw Ron point to his forehead and muttered \"Scar\" very softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich then Harry saw Ron's hair change back to bright red \"Hair\" Harry whispered. They silently agreed that it would be best to flee the scene, rushing out of the common room shielding their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you two going?!\" Draco asked shock by their weird behavior. But they didn't stop they kept running as they slowly began to change back, They rushed out of the common room and when they were a safe distance. Harry was surprised how out of breath he was. Harry was kneeling over panting. As he got up he was surprised he was still so large, the potion should have worn off by now, what Harry had failed to realize is that this was a problem with the polyjuice potion and although he had turned back to his old self, still carried the weight that Goyle had, though he couldn't tell himself. Harry looked over to Ron who was also catching his breath.</span></div></div>",

But then something clicked inside Harry and he felt really really hungry. His belly roared and he shoved chocolate into his mouth there were a total of 30 chocolates each one had way the botched potion in a way stronger dosage 3 times the reccomended. each Chocolate made Harry's new love for food deeper and deeper, and it also made his secret desires become more and more what he needed.

It created a tension and Harry just happy to have something in his life. Kept eating like this and his belly got larger and larger.

Harry's belly was sitting on his lap very flabby and he was hungry. Draco cleared his throat and asked. \"Potter where is Weasel and Granger. I'd have figured with you like this they be off getting you food or something\" The comment was mean't to be insulting but Harry wasn't offended and he could tell there was little venom in what. But still Harry was a little sad so he just stared at his belly as he couldn't see his feet anymore. Before answering out \"Not here, Over the break we had a falling out\" Draco looked unconvinced, \"No really Potter where are they? You can't possibly expect me to believe the golden Trio broke apart over a single summer\" He spat out dryly. \"But it is true they told me they never wanna speak to me again\" His voice was cracking now. And Draco really did react with shock. \"You're not kidding? Oh what could possibly drive you three apart? I honestly thought after the Weasels stupidity in 4th year nothing could break you apart.\" Harry started tearing up more but Draco stopped him. And let him calm down. He then breathed and rubbed his belly he was ignorant of how much Draco was staring at it and not in disgust but he ignored it for now. He then calmly explained what happened he guessed he must have needed someone to confide in because he even told Draco fully why he had fully been left by them and why he was currently fat enough Dudleys shirt was too small. He then paused to breathe as he was honestly getting too fat to rant like that. He then looked at Draco he seemed like he was gonna laugh but he then blurted out. \"no no not at you but at the Weasel and Granger. At least his mother has more sense then he does though if you say that Percy was the only Weasley child to treat you nicely. Maybe that explains it.\" It was now Harry's turn to look confused it must have been really obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it seems those Weasleys have been too exposed to muggles as Wizards dont have to deal with as many physical labor activities. While it isnt preferred no one is going to judge you for putting on a lot of weight. Percy's work in the ministry must have exposed him heavily to such things Why do you think Fudge is so heavy and yet it is rarely a topic how much he struggles at his weight.

Harry had been gaining weight since he had defeated Voldemort, a year ago, at first it wasn't that noticeable but now it was starting to show, when we went to Hermione about it she said that it was an aftereffect of being a Horcrux, now that Harry wasn't housing a sliver of Voldemort's soul within him his own body was out of order and was trying to fill what was missing, and it would manifest through weight gain. Whenever Harry ate it would instantly convert to fat. Harry tried to fight against the weight gain, he would exercise, watch his diet, but it was no use he would still gain weight. Depressed and defeated he just accepted it. Though he, unfortunately, became more pear-shaped with his gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's thighs got bigger, hips got wider, and his ass became two plump mounds that would jiggle every so often. Of course he still a belly that would hang over his waist, but it wasn't the main attraction. He felt like a woman with this form just made Harry feel even worse about himself. Though when he went to work at the Ministry, he was noticing he was getting stares, from his male coworkers. At first, he thought they were going to make fun of him but instead they looked in awe of him. They were paying attention to how his ass moves, his wide hips, and his thighs touching together, and it made Harry... feel good about himself. He was flaunting his weight gain, often putting on a show to his co-workers as walked into the Ministry, his co-worker's eyes lowered to his plump form. Harry was on his way to a desk when a certain admirer peered out from a column, it was Cormac Mclaggen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac had developed some feelings for Harry when he first noticed Harry's budding weight gain. Now that he saw Harry blossom with fat, he found him irresistible. But he was scared to confront him due to their history at Hogwarts, so for now, he admired Harry from afar.

So he had food brought to him and dug in but more than that he really started eating more as he felt really really good. He felt full but before he was gonna grab more he looked to Lavender and she was smiling a big smile. She had thoughts in her head she could make sure that Ron stayed her through one way. His stomach or his belly considering how much he is packing away. All she does is pick up a piece of bread and shove it into his mouth giving him the go ahead to eat to his hearts content. Little weird for her but she didn't care she just wanted Ron. Not whatever that mudblood Hermione thought was good for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 of them sat there for a bit until. </span></div></div>",

Ron pulled out his wand, waved it and said <i>Magnus Fiet!</i>. Suddenly a pale blue light enveloped Ron and he felt a little warm and then nothing.

He couldn't help but scowl at the house-elves but smelling all the food was starting to make Draco hungry, and he had a lot of time to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco saw a plate of turkey legs sitting on a counter by the wall, and he decided to grab it, only for a house-elf to grab his arm. The house-elf said, \"Students aren't supposed to be down here. You don't want to lose house points, do you?\" and Draco said, \"You aren't using it, are you?\" and the house-elf said, \"It's an order that a student changed their mind about.\" and Draco said, \"Then what's the problem with me taking it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house-elf said, \"Fine, but what's the magic word?\" and Draco nearly snapped at being treated like a child, but he said, \"Please\" through his teeth. The house-elf let his hand go, and he said, \"Thank you.\" and the house-elf said, \"That's better!\" as Draco took the plate and tore into a turkey leg, enjoying the great taste that he came to expect from something cooked in the Hogwarts kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at a nearby table and gorged himself on the turkey legs, finishing them down to the bone, leaving a small pile of leg bones. He belched loudly and patted his full belly, which was starting to press on his robes. The house-elf from before said, \"You sure polished that off, kid! If you ever want to take an unwanted dish off our hands, help yourself! We could use the extra counter space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco nodded as he looked around the kitchen, seeing quite a few dishes of various types of food dotted about the counters that wrapped most of the way around the kitchen.

The usual nervousness that come from being a Pureblood heir the weight of all that responsibility and power heavy on his shoulders. Now a new weight was upon him the weight of Voldemort he wanted him to fix a vanishing cabinet and he had no idea what to do. He felt like he was being given a task to fail and he was very much on the verge of breaking. His self serving survival instincts were kicking in he knew he would suffer under the Crucio he knew his parents would be killed he knew all of it but he was just tired of all the weight upon him. The only light right now was the time he spent with Blaise he understood didn't ask him questions and while their realtionship was still new it was the only thing keeping him from making what he knew would be a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one day in potions they were being asked to make a Love Potion a precise art that even one wrong move would cause a feedback loop. Exploding easily but Draco and Blaise so focused Draco not breaking down in the middle of class didn't stir right or add the right ingredient and before either could duck the pot exploded all over them. Draco felt humiliated potions was his expertise but they quickly left and went to get cleaned up. as they were walking however the potion mostly abosrbed into their bodies changing them in ways they did not know. Draco felt starved extremely hungry and much more nervous and fragile and Blaise felt his protective side of draco increase but also he kept looking at Draco and thinking of him as far far far too skinny. So after they got themselves cleaned up they both walked back to the common room to just be by themselves for a bit and Draco did something he'd never done but it just felt right. He sat in Blaise's lap. they were like that for awhile. Till dinner and draco's growling stomach made it clear they needed to get there fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the 2 of them arrived at the great hall Draco and Blaise sat down and almost the second they did after the food appeared Draco dug in and ate a lot. He ate more then he ever would and Blaise weirdly never stopped him. if anything he kept giving him more and more. after Draco had stuffed himself completely far more than either of them expected him too. Draco was bloated and had a nice belly on him and Blaise couldn't do anything but admire it and rub it when no one was paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 of them walked well Draco waddled his way back to the common room.

Their relationship wasn't exactly public maybe. But the eating, the thoughts entering his head he still couldn't help but smile at Draco's belly. Draco himself was playing with his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was a love potion that fell on us.

My father was forcing me too look a way more for his sake than my own.\" he kept rambling and getting quite heated up. Blaise just moved closer moving him into his lap rubbing his belly. And he calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and well yes I was hiding a lot.\" He melted into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaise wasn't surprised Draco was always someone who was very easy to fall into being pampered and taken care of.

Still this would explain why he was so desperate to just escape all this stress more than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 talked a bit more and decided that Draco would continue to fatten and indulge himself.

He continued to wander around the school with Eliot on his mind. \"Why I'm I thinking of that guy,\" he whispered, \"I'm not into guys, but he was so attractive. Maybe I am a bisexual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedric went to the library to do some homework as he sat down, he heard people talking behind a bookshelf. \"So what do you think of the people here?\" a female voice with a french accent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are nice,\" another female said with a French accent as well, \"There some cute boys here. What about you Eliot? You find any guys who fit your taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedric's head perked up and he wanted to listen. \"Well with my taste in men, there were two boys but with the way they look I thought they were crossed breed with trolls,\" Eliot said, \"But there was one boy that got my attention. I think he was a Hufflepuff.\" This got Cedric's attention, \"He was cute but too thin for me.\" Cedric felt slightly insulted, \"If he was bigger, I would ask him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bigger? Like how?' Cedric thought before Eliot answered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds weird, but I do like a man who is fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Cedric mouthed, surprised to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the library, he decided to swing by a prefect bathroom to relax a bit. He got undressed and had a towel around his waist. As the large tub was filling with water, Cedric was looking at himself in a mirror. He was going over what the Beauxbaton boy said liking fat men. Cedric was thin but still athletic. He was visualizing himself with a belly, flabby arms and legs, and his firm chest to getting softer. \"It might look good on me.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Cedric wanted to attract Eliot so he was going to get fat.</span></div></div>",
