She had her traditional outfit on, thigh-high black boots, matching skirt and detached computerized sleeves, with a turquoise tie over a gray sleeveless and untucked dress shirt. That wasn't the problem though. She ran a hand nervously through one of her floor-sweeping twintails, eyes wide as she looked upon herself and the scale below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read 180 pounds. And on her frame, she could see it clear as day. The buttons were straining on her top, attempting to contain a bloated potbelly and swollen chest, while her skirt was havin a difficult time covering her plush rump and thicker thighs. Even her face had visible changes, her cheeks a bit fuller and her jawline softened up by fat. She was chubby, rather cutely so, but the question on her mind was not of why, but how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ive gained at least twenty pounds since my last concert...and ten more pounds before that. I haven't changed my eating habits or anything really drastic...have I?' Miku thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, someone looked upon her plumpened backside with an evil glint in her eyes before sliding back into the shadows. she chuckled darkly as she headed back towards the kitchen, her scheme going smoothly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That of the Utauloid Akita Neru, a popular Utau in her own right, but nowhere near such as Kasane Teto, who was up near Miku in popularity. IN fact, oftentimes fans joked that she was simply an offshoot of the leek-loving twintailed girl, instead of at least having the dignity of being a fully-formed fan Utauloid. This led to the sour feelings which exist now, filling her down to her very core with the thought of being nothing more than a 'fake' Utauloid, especially from people on the net who knew nothing about such matters. It didn't matter-at that point when those comments started rolling in on her videos, the yellow-haired singer vowed revenge on the ones who had tarnished the career she had. And to accomplish this goal, she was going to ruin Miku's first, then work on Teto. She had to take care of the primary threat first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, what was better than making her fat? It was the catch-all to any popular girl: getting fat ruined your image for the rest of society. For a star as big as Miku, this kind of publicity and change would mean the end of her fandom and her subsequent fall from grace. Neru chuckled to herself at the thought of her rising up a rank or two as the bloated Miku simply grew bigger and bigger, even unable to sing because she would be so incredibly vast. The problem was that it wasn't going nearly the way she wanted at the moment. More than thirty pounds on Miku's frame over the last couple months or so hadn't done much to deter her fans, instead a lot of them supporting her 'cutely plush' figure despite her concerns. At this point, it was time to get serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, I ordered that new super-supplement from that pharmacy. I've heard some...good things about how potent it is from reviews,\" Neru said to herself as she made her way to the kitchen to find Miku's lunch. She had been doing this with the previous vitamin made to increase a person's bulk back to healthy levels, but to her now it was far too weak. 'This new one should be a hundred times more effective,' Neru thought, 'should be. If it isn't, well then...I'll just have to resort to drastic measures.' Drastic meaning a special formula that she had found a little ways back when she was first thinking of this plot. Unfortunately, it was clear, and smelled of sake and was stored in the fridge thanks to the directions. Yowane Haku had gotten into it and...well...needless to say that the house could literally no longer hold her. The white-haired, depressed Vocaloid had been sent to the hospital months ago, and the last that Neru heard was that Haku could at least fit through garage doors now. Thankfully, she hadn't drank all the formula-there was still half of it left, but...it was desperate times call for desperate measures thing that the text maniac didn't want to repeat. \"Now...what's she eating today..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the fridge was but a single bowl of tempura noodles, basking in delectable broth and garnished with negi, Miku's favorite. Chunks of beef, egg, beansprouts and other add-ins floated on the surface with the noodles, and though she was trying to go on a diet, it was easy to notice that it was the turquoise-haired diva's. Jackpot. Neru grinned evilly as she took the cellophane wrap off the top and pulled out a small bottle of the prescribed super supplement, popping the cap and shaking a pill out into her hand. Quirking her mouth a bit, however, she stared at the dissoluble tablet, noting how small it was compared to the first ones she used to get Miku this far. Going against the directions, she shook another pill out and dumped them both into the broth, replacing the cellophane and closing the fridge. Before she put the bottle in her pocket, however, the warning flap fell to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Warning: 1 tablet per meal limit. Side effects include: severely increased growth, increased appetite, increased fullness. Upon administration of exceeded dose, do not take another supplement for 24 hours. Side effects may double.'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew it would be a bit before that tab took effect so she may as well spend some time relaxing. So she did what everyone else with time to kill did; she went on tumblr. She decided just for laughs to type Miku's name in the search bar, see what she could find. She grinned as she imagined what would result, the pouring outcry of inane, but satisfying contempt for Miku's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru fervently scrolled down. Cute art, art, art, random post, art...ah, finally something about Miku...wait no, it was about the quality of her music, not her fat. Pfft! Who gave a crap about that? Ah, finally some posts about Miku's figure. Neru found herself grinning, the bangs of her blond hair casting shadows over her eyes as she closely read what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it weird Miku's new chub gives me a chub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Okay that was sort of what she could expect, but hey! There was still plenty more to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I heard Miku put on weight lately but she looks so cuuute! &gt;3&lt; Maybe she should rank up or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay now this was getting just plain weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey anyone else think it's weird Miku looks kind of cute chubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was getting annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Miku still looks kind of thin. Now if she got real fat, like a BBW...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an enraged expression, Neru gripped at the desk her computer sat on and flipped it over, sending the computer flying off and crashing against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn otakus, every one of them! Useless, mindless fans just...\" The rest was incomprehensible angry grumbling under the blond's breath as she pulled her cell phone out from a slit in her skirt that served as a pocket and fiddled with it for a bit. She walked back through the kitchen, seeing the bowl that once housed Miku's tempura now sitting empty in the sink. A wide, mischievous grin formed on the Utauloid's face as she passed through to check on Miku and...slowed as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was all the furniture? Come to think of it, there was a chair or two missing from the kitchen when she passed...through...no way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru rushed up the stairs to check on Miku, see if what she saw was real. It all felt so strange, so...surreal there was no way it could even really be happening. Well, then again tablets that made you get fat faster was a bit strange in and of itself, but this... As Neru approached the outside of Miku's room once more, she cracked open the door again and could only stare in a mix of awe and horror at what she observed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku was sitting there, eating...something, licking her fingers and humming to herself as she enjoyed whatever it was. She grabbed a chair in her plump hands and started to cram the whole thing in her mouth, making Neru almost drop her cell phone! Miku had blown up into a blubbery blob of a woman, barely able to even fit inside her room now! Her rolling back folds were plain as day, even as her outfit seemed to warp it a way that just barely covered her, her detached sleeves stretched and popping at the seams to contain the idol's thick arms. Her butt ballooned out immensely, wobbling lazily even from minor movements on Miku's behalf as her flared hips made her skirt useless, revealing her white panties stretched out over her jiggly buns with leeks printed on them. Even from this perspective, Neru could easily make out Miku's positively massive breasts, the swollen spheres in danger of ripping Miku's top clean in two with their plump, perky size. Neru found herself caught off guard as she fell forwards, planting her face against the floor as she fell. Miku turned around, swallowing the last leg of the chair poking out from her lips as she saw Neru fall into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Neru-kun? You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru almost instantly picked herself up, grinning innocently as she could manage while rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oopsie, I...better watch where I'm going when I'm texting, ahahahaha!\" Neru allowed overdone laughter to gush forth. \"W-well I uh...well, you look different, uh...how are you doing today, Miku-san?!\"</span></div></div>",

Miku Hatsune, of all people, was into all this fat. Her image, her record label, her fortune, her career...none of that daunted Miku's optimism and joy one bit no matter what sort of crushing reality may be brought about. Miku merely rubbed her currently full belly in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miku what are you saying...?\" Neru was sweating a bit at this almost surreal display before her. Frankly, she was surprised Miku could be this big, with a weight probably in the quad digits, and still be hale and hearty as ever. Miku sat her especially wide rear down on her bed, making it creak as her fat thighs oozed over a bit and her flared fat hips wiggled amorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...considering I have all this bulk, maybe I should eat the bed next.\" Miku mused with a smile on her chipmunk like fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru just sat there, defeated. Her plan felt like it had backfired. Miku was massive, but given how devoted her fans were, they would probably not pay much attention to it anyway. She could sing as good as ever, her clear voice ringing true enough she could put out records and songs at the same rate she always did and her cheery persona made it almost impossible to try and break her down if she could turn around becoming some blubbery behemoth and even make that another one of her life goals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere still had to be some way she could turn this around maybe. Something had to happen soon that could show that she hadn't failed so utterly as far as she had seen or at least just act as some kind of sign...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tension in the air was broken by the sound of Miku's blubbery gut rumbling deeply, the smooth wall of soft flesh quaking and quivering gently in the wake of the noise. The turquoise-haired diva giggled, patting her soft belly rolls and lifting her massive rear off the bed with ease that could be considered inhuman. \"Well, I guess I'm still hungry then! That settles it, the bed is my second lunch~\" The diva turned around, showing off her bulky, plush rear barely concealed by her black skirt and flashing her leek-print panties, lifting up one end of the bed and starting to munch on it. She let out a coo of satisfaction as her still rumbling gut was filled, her body visibly swelling outwards with fat, clothes stretching endlessly it seems as her already ponderous waistline swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unbelievable to Neru. The perfect plan she had, to ruin Miku's figure and her career, had fallen like a rock. The supplements she had given Miku, which were to be used to make her singing career tank, were now simply fueling her ever-cheery persona with the look and feel of a perfect, life-sized plushie. The yellow-haired Utau simply watched as Miku's bulky body fattened up even more, each bite of bed and bedframe causing dozens of pounds to add to her swollen frame, her clothes creaking as they held onto the waves of soft, supple fat that poured from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her worst nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up, eyes wide at the sight she had beheld, Neru retreated to the living room, seating herself on the couch and staring at the coffee table. She could hear the chomping and gulping coming from the other room as Miku devoured its contents, the sound of her growing flesh echoing throughout the currently-empty house of the Vocaloids. Seams popped, fabric stretched, clasps snapped, and still Miku ate, filling up her bulging gut as it began to swell across her chubby feet and across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru could only think of a fleshy behemoth filling up the room, smothering every cubic foot in fat before it started to eat at the walls. Surely, surely there must be some way to reverse this...?! She froze as she heard a stifled, petite burp come from Miku's room upstairs before the sounds of eating resumed, as well as the inescapable sounds of impossibly fast growth. Not even that special formula she got to turn Miku into a blimp worked this well! Haku spent a week blowing up into a parade-float version of herself and she drank only half! Biting her lip, the yellow-haired Utau grasped at one straw that she had left: the internet. She had to find information on those pills she ordered. That's where this had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing towards her smashed PC, with a little virtual power she had it up and running again within minutes, perfectly repaired. Slamming it back down onto the desk, she began to type furiously into Google, into forums, into chan boards, anything she could find related to this supplement that she bought. She could hear Miku's heavy footsteps in her room, stomping about as she moved from furniture piece to furniture piece. She didn't have much longer before the Vocaloid would move onto another room in the house. Finally, as she ran through another round of keyword searches, her golden eyes picked up something of interest to her. Clicking on the link, it took her to a page somewhere on the website where she had ordered the pills from, except this time it was a list of people who had suffered the side effects of an overdose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegurine Luka, the pink-haired, older Vocaloid who was more like...a loving sister to everyone in the Vocaloid residence was displayed. It was a before image, one of her looking like her normal self, outfit and all. The second image, however, is what shocked Neru the most. Gone was the svelte, curvy Luka-in her place was a mountainous blob, the little gif/video playing showing her massive, meaty arms shoving what seemed to be studio equipment into her mouth, speakers and microphones and sound tables disappearing into her gargantuan gut that spilled out across the landscape like rising bread dough. It even showed her backside, clad in pink, lacy, Tuna-embroidered underwear easily large enough to fit a circus tent. And she was VISIBLY growing as the video went on! She was stuffing her face happily with the electronic equipment, even as she bulged bigger and bigger like said bread dough baking in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed that it said 'live stream.' Neru's eyes bulged out of her head. The blurb at the bottom said that Luka had been trying to gain a little weight, since her current producer said that she was a little on the thin side. However, it noted, she had taken two or three pills more than necessary for her change, and the chemicals had simply exponentiated their effects, turning her into a mountainous, ravenous blob whose fat little feet could crush a person by now underneath their own weight. It was a warning, now disclosed on the newest bottles of supplements, that was to be heeded..unless, of course, you wanted to end up a titanic, bulging mass of plush fat that simply wanted to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing out, even as Luka started taking up the entirety of the little video screen, Neru heard a giggle from upstairs, followed by the &lt;i&gt;Crack&lt;/i&gt; of wood splitting from some ungodly force pressing against it. She clenched her fists, realizing that if this went on the house would be destroyed by a mountain of Miku. She had to find some way to stop it, even as the thundering footsteps moved towards another part of the house. </span></div></div>",

She wondered how she could stop Miku while they still had something to sit on within the house, nevermind making sure there was still a house to live in by the time she was done! Haku didn't display this kind of ravenous hunger since they last visited and she was still just barely large enough to fit in the garage, meaning that somehow there had to be a cure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet if that were the case, why would Luka still be eating so ravenously, in the livestream video that she had set her eyes on? Did she just refuse to take a cure, smitten by her own gluttony just as Miku had become now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had to take a chance. She could hear Miku taking bites at a time out of the drywall as she nervously hooked her fingers, quickly typing her question into the search bar. The results came in seconds, but Neru felt as if every little bit counted as the results started to load up. She clicked the first result she found quickly, looking on as the page loaded. It seemed someone had tried the same thing for some reason, but they needed a cure quickly before their girlfriend outgrew the bedroom thanks to her own hunger. Underneath was an answer some anonymous person had given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>The reason why this drug affects the subject so much is that it throws their metabolism out of whack, in addition to serving as a protein supplement, which is why it causes a fair amount of initial weight to be packed on as well. However, something that could help bring a bit more equilibrium to the subject's system, namely a large amount of fruits or vegetables, could help to straighten out her systems</i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru blinked, silently praising whatever gods above existed for this coincidence. Leeks, being as ironically associated with the pop idol as they were, did have a presence in the house. Granted, they weren't <i>as</i> prevalent as a lot of fans loved to think. There had been many a fanart drawing Neru had seen of Miku with her leeks, some admittedly cute, some...just made her shake her head and quietly mutter in confusion to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru snapped herself from her daze as she hot up from the chair, flipping the desk once more from her swift movements as she rushed back into the kitchen. The blond Utau ran for the fridge, slipping on the recently cleaned floor and ramming right against the door of the fridge as she fell on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" Neru groaned as the door to the fridge slowly swung open before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike finding a grenade on the field of war while running towards the closest trench, Neru's eyes glassed over at the sight of the leeks sitting within the crisper drawer of the fridge. Quickly, she pulled the drawer open and grabbed the leeks, bundling them under her arm like sticks as she slammed the door shut behind her. Neru then immediately opened the fridge back up, looking in the back of the fridge longingly at a bottle of beer sitting there. Slowly, she pulled the brown glass bottle out, closing the door behind her normally as she then rushed upstairs to check on Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, like some blubbery queen termite, Miku had already eaten just about everything in her room, a huge hole in her right bedroom wall leading over to Neru's as Miku started to eat everything in her room now! She had grown so huge, so immense, she actually had to take bites out of the roof so that she had room to rise like dough as her bulbous form swamped so much of the room around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no not my clothes! Not my plushies! Not my-okay, you can eat the trash, I don't really care about that.\" Neru stated as she watched the bulbous blob that was Miku move on to eat those aformentioned objects as well as whatever bundles of clothes the blond Utau had left laying on her bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Neru ran over to Miku, climbing up the folds of her flowing back fat in a way that reminded her of her first time playing Shadow of the Colossus. She slowly made her way around, planting herself within Miku's trembling bosom as the massive blob did what she seemed to only want to do best, which was eat anything in front of her that wasn't alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefuly, Neru climbed up Miku's immense breasts, which quaked and jiggled from almost any slight touch upon their creamy, round softness as she grabbed the leeks from under her arm, shoveling them down Miku's throat before she could even think of eating Neru's bed! Miku groaned a bit in surprise, blinking a bit as she gave in and swallowed up the leeks whole, surprisingly. She sighed, a dainty burp passing her lips, as her stomach began to gurgle loudly, the turqiouse-haired idol moaning as she rubbed her fluffy hands against the billowing sides of her trembling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh...I feel so full all of a sudden...\" Miku groaned in disappointment, pouting as she felt her massive ass fall to the floor, the fleshy mounds quaking as her immense thighs jostled and her huge saddlebags serving as her hips stood firm against both walls of the room on either side of her, her fleshy body wobbling to and fro as her adorably fattened face became awash with lethargy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru sighed as she leaned atop Miku's bosom, looking down at her before sliding down her immense, trembling belly and onto her feet, wiping a hand through her bangs to try and look cool afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you ate too much, stupid.\" Neru said cooly as she looked up at Miku's tired, pouting face, her immense bosom helping to give the cheery idol a serious case of half-open puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't feeling full before!\" Miku whined. \"I probably could have, I dunno, eaten the whole neighborhood if I wanted to! N-not the actual neighbors though, I'd never do that! ...Then again, that'd be inconsiderate; what if they had mortgages on their houses?\" Miku thought aloud, her mind trailing off a bit before she shook her head to snap out of her eccentric thoughts, her doughy spare tire of a second chin wobbling to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...don't eat like that again, okay? You coulda chomped up all my good stuff; my bed, my clothes, my TV my po-po-popcorn stash!\" Neru complained, tripping over her words as she tried to change the topic suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popcorn...stash...Ohh that'd sound heavenly if I had the room.\" Miku sighed, patting the sides of her immense gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru just stared, a large drop of sweat flowing down the back of her head as she wondered if she needed to call in a lift to get Miku's oh-so-wide ass out of her room.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that moment, the doorbell rang, snapping Neru out of her disbelief-induced stupor as she stared at the mountain of Hatsune Miku in her room, the yellow-haired Utauloid looking to the stairs outside of her room and back to Miku. Seeing the massive, turquoise-haired diva content for now with a fairly stuffed-feeling tummy that could occupy her hands and thoughts from hunger, she nodded curtly, heading out of her room. \"Be right back, Miku. DON'T. EAT. ANYTHING!\" she said forcefully, hoping that the leeks would last long enough until she could find another solution to her VERY big and hungry problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading toward the front door, still perturbed by the lack of furniture in some parts of the house thanks to Miku's once-insatiable appetite, Neru got it in time just after another doorbell ring, opening the double-doors wide for whoever was there. \"Okay, what do you want...want....want...WANT!?\" The trim Utau looked up in disbelief, staring at the fat face of Yowane Haku, covered in a scarlet blush about twenty feet away from her, a bulky, plush hand about to press the doorbell again. Somehow, SOMEHOW, the hospital had managed to get a version of her clothes that could fit her, massively oversized garments that barely managed to hold in the mass amount of cleavage spilling out, while her bulging, car-sized gut poured outwards and around her for feet, stopping just at the edge of the Vocaloid house's porch. Looking to the side, and squashed underneath thick, juicy lovehandles were a set of incredibly fat, saddlebag hips and thighs that could crush a three-seat couch easily, tapering down into fat little cankles that smothered her porky feet. Even then, this was barely visibly, only deductions thanks to her lovehandles being so ridiculously huge along with her titanic belly, Haku's massive ass resting on the ground and clad in a severely oversized version of her previous pants. Gawking at her, Neru can even see that her arms can't even rest by her side, simply resting on her bulging lovehandles and massive hips, and not even able to touch the sides of either. The white-haired Vocaloid's fat face made the once melancholy-looking Haku quite a bit cheerier-looking, although her mouth was stll set in that little frown as always. The Utau staggered back, looking at the massive mountain of a girl in front of her, who was still bigger than Miku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hakuuuuu! W-what are you doing back so soon? Ha ha, you've definitely lost a lot of weight!\" she stammered, wondering if Haku's porky feet were large enough to smush her yet like Luka's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually drunk Vocaloid managed a little smile, blushing darker still, trying hard to fold her fluffy arms and hands back behind her, only to be met with plush back rolls. \"H..hello Neru...M-may I come in? I think I can fit through the doors now...I just have to be careful. I-I want to get inside for a bit. P-please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This can't end well,</i> Neru thought to herself. Backing up, however, deciding to comply with this mammoth girl's wishes, she reached the back of the living room, waiting for Haku to step in. \"Come on in then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaku nodded, and slowly began to lumber in, her turgid thighs moving past each other oh-so-slowly thanks to how huge they were, her pants creaking and her shirt groaning as she started her laborious waddle. Somehow, even at thsi size, she was able to move and quite well despite being somewhere in the neighborhood of three or four tons. Ducking her head a little, the alcohol-loving Vocaloid started to shove her gargantuan tummy through the door, molding it gently and somehow managing to get the bulk of it through, along with her bulging bosom. Ducking her head a little and somehow fitting that in, the easiest part was over, and now the hardest was to come: fitting her massive hips through. Her car-sized tummy was soft and doughy, and was easily pressed and flowed into the room. But her hips and lovehandles, however...those would prove difficult, not to mention her titanic ass. Grunting softly, she shimmied her fat little feet in, clad in loafers that look fit to burst, trying to fit one large hip through the door and then the other. It was a slow, laborious process, marked by the sound of fat and flesh rubbing against itself, the creak of her clothes, and the groaning of the house as it struggled to hold up to her immense weight. Managing to shift her titanic hips in, the overblown Vocaloid panted gently, huffing at the amount of effort it took to move her enormous body. Still, she trudged on, somehow fitting ALL of her massive frame through the double doors...without breaking them or deforming the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru was in shock, seeing this gargantuan mass of Haku in front of her, bigger than the mountainous Miku in her room, resting in the middle of the living room and taking up a good third of the vast space. Staring up at Haku, she nods slowly, trying hard not to think about this. \"O..oookaaay! So! what are you here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm here for my antidepressants...t-they need my prescription at the hospital while they s-shrink me down,\" Haku replied, her head nearly planted against the ceiling.\"Do you mind getting them for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, no no no, I can do that! Should be obvious.\" Neru just wanted away from the bulky girl before she was swamped underneath meters of belly. Hearing something, however, as she headed towards the medicine cabinet, the Utauloid looked up at the stairwell, her eyes bulging out of their sockets. Miku, despite how huge she was, and supposedly FULL she was feeling, had managed to get up, probably smashing a few walls in the process, lumbering over to the staircase with a happy smile on her cute, puffy face. Her tummy still packed a bit full from the leeks she devoured earlier, the incredibly obese diva had heard Haku come in, giggling happily as she stomped across the upper landing. \"Noooooo! Don't do that, Miku, you're gonna break the floors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru's calls were fruitless, however, as one fat foot, clad in a black thigh-high boot that was splitting at the top on one of Miku's massive thighs, smashed through the second floor of the house, a small 'oh' escaping Miku's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the rest came soon after, a cascade of blubber falling from the next story onto Haku.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neru felt her heart sink as her eyes opened wide, beholding the pale, marshmallow like mass of Miku Hatsune falling from a hole in the ceiling, watching helplessly as the two blobs collided in a large, meaty impact as both their fat bodies rippled, wobbled and jiggled like a pair of giant waterbeds sent into a massive jiggling frenzy, the meaty, soft slapping echoing throughout the absurdly spacious living area as Neru looked on in horror, wondering if Miku had knocked Haku right out or hurt her. The impact actually caused the floorboards under Haku to give as her fatty feet sank into indents in the wood floor, her fatty arms wrapped around the blubbery popular idol, the depressive grey-haired girl shutting her eyes in fear as she prepared for the worst despite the fact the \"worst\" had long since come to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to calm herself after some time, her mind finally registering that what she had to fear for the moment was no more. Her immensity had finally settled down as the wildly wobbling mass that made up her body began to stop. She could feel Miku's own bulk becoming inert as well, feeling it's soft, plus warmth against her blubbery body and...it felt so oddly warm and soft, so...supple, it left an odd feeling of contentment within the nervous Haku's mind, bringing her a sense of calm. She also felt something pleasant and warm against her face as well, something that aided in soothing her mind. Slowly, Haku opened her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only for them to shoot wide open, like plates, as she saw Miku's plump lips locked against her own, the pair of fatty Vocaloids blushing tremendously as they beheld the scene before each other, their fatty faces turning deep crimson. Neru's jaw dropped open as she slumped forwards, beholding the scene before her, feeling herself in utter disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made things all the more surprising as Miku and Haku slowly pulled their soft lips apart, but stared each other in the eyes, as if they were each hypnotized. Then, slowly, Miku moved her lips forwards as she pressed herself against Haku in yet another kiss, a surprised squeak passing the normally timid girl's lips, her face deepening in its already crimson hue from the passionate lip lock as well as feeling Miku's own fatty breasts squish against her own, the massive spheres of flesh pressing together like giant, fluffy mounds of mochi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Haku felt herself swept within the pleasure swirling within her as she gently raised her fatty hands to Miku's plump face, cradling it in her hands as she slowly closed her eyes, cooing and cutely moaning as she and Miku continued their tender kiss, Miku sprawled atop her significantly more immense bulk like Haku was a giant, adorable soft chair for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru felt her right eye twitch as she stared on, unsure of just what she was supposed to be thinking as she beheld the scene before her. Miku and Haku, two people who were so opposite, albeit that didn't mean they didn't get along, locked in passionate bliss as they kissed and cradled each other's fatty forms. Neru pinched her arm hard to see if she was dreaming, leaving multiple small, red marks on her right arm as she desperately tried to wake herself up. However, she had to accept what she was seeing was real as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the corpulent couple broke off the lip lock, Miku giggling happily as she looked the grey-haired Vocaloid in her shy, nervous eyes. Haku herself looked a bit happier, her eyes opened a bit more, lacking the saddened dullness they had to to them, though she still wore her little frown, only made to look adorable thanks to her rounder, puffier face and fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maybe I don't need those antidepressants after all, Neru...\" Haku stated calmly as she wrapped her arms around Miku, the cheery idol smiling widely as she snuggled into Haku like she was a giant teddy bear, her face pressing against the not-so-depressed Vocaloid's soft chest as she innocently grinned, a little squee escaping in her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not real...this...this is just not real...\" Neru muttered as she held a hand up to her forehead. She looked down, remembering the beer she was holding in one hand as she proceeded to pop the cap off and take large chugs like she was drinking for a college frat house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to have you home, Haku.\" Miku chirped as she seemed to unintentionally ignore Neru, snuggling herself against Haku as she helped the porkier woman up onto her fatty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaku looked down at Miku as she nervously folded her hands in front of her, her arms colliding with her immense breasts, which squished up against her thick blubbery chin as her big, shy eyes stared down past her expanse at her newly anointed girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...glad to...be...back...\" Haku nervously muttered, losing her stutter as her words were muffled by the mass of breast flesh and her thick chin being pressed up against her face, the elephantine woman nervously twitching her fatty fingers.</span></div></div>",
