            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first being in the mutiverse, she calls herself Nymph. Initially a mindless spiritual energy, yet in time, she developed conscience and physical form. Maybe to her subconscious wish, different life forms were born in the mutiverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess looks young, likely in her early adulthood. Long silver hair fall all the way to her waist. She is not very tall, nor short, maybe 5'5\". Her large watery eyes and gorgeous face would be considered perfect to any being. At this moment, the goddess is staring at the void with her finger waving, as if she is writing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human Calendar, Year 1583 after apocalypse, Month 9, Day 23: Humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh. I do not understand. They seem to display a lot of other emotions as well. Strange.\" Lines of undecipherable characters appears under Nymph's finger tip as her finger moves through void. This is her journal. She has been observing earth for thousands of years, since the day she found a planet with life form similar to her in appearance. Yet these creatures are similar to her only in appearance, as they do not possess the divine power she does. Though, she has found that some peculiar humans do have talent to communicate with the mutiverse, and they call themselves witches and wizards. Clearly, her strong wish for companion has affected the mutiverse and caused it to develop life form similar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I am not alone.\" After countless times, Nymph once again imagines herself being within a society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish the earth could bear my divine power\" Nymph sighs. She has tried descending to earth, yet the last time she descended, 1583 year 9 month and 23 days ago, her presence caused catastrophic consequences and wiped almost the entire civilization out, leaving few survivors. Her heart was broken. However, humans are persistent. Generations later, a new civilization flourished. Currently, their technology level is in much similar to that of the medieval age, though their techniques in magical arts are much more advanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what if I seal my divine power and descend with my body only, the planet may be able to bear my presence.\" Nymph immediately acts. Under her hand, particles are attracted from all over the mutiverse, condensates into liquid, morphs into the shape of a jewelry box with and solidifies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This much Staranium should be enough to contain my power for a short trip.\" Her divine power concentrates and condenses into a tiny crystal in the center of her palm. Carefully placing it into the Staranium box, Nymph sets off her journey. With a snap of her fingers, a wormhole enshrouds her. The next moment, she is standing on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!!! I am not breaking the planet this time!!\" Nymph jumps around like a child, feeling the gravitational pull on her body. \"Today, me, Nymph is goddess, is officially starting my human life! People, be ready to know me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait....\" Nymph seems to have realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************Supplementing Background********************<br>\r\nIn this particular mutiverse, human beings, or in more general, creatures, have \"mana network\" within their body. This system functions similarly to our neural network. However, rather than being connected by omnipresent neurons, this system is consisted of numerous \"mana channels\". For most humans, their bodies contain only one or at most two of these channels, meaning that they have little to none potential in casting magic. Yet, for some humans, their bodies could contain up to ten of these mana channels, leading to tremendous potential in casting spells. These people are called witches or wizards. However, these mana channels bring one drawback. That is, the more mana channels one possess, the more sensitive one is. This principal holds even more true for females than males, meaning that witches could be 5-10 times more sensitive than a ordinary female human. As for Nymph the goddess, the number of mana channel is essentially infinite, as her physical form is consisted of almost entirely mana channels.<br>\r\n********************Supplementing Background********************</span></div></div>",

Wait, how am I supposed to get back if my no longer have access to be divine power?\" Nymph holds her palm against her chin, thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I could harness the power consisting my outfits, after all they are still divine artifacts made by me years ago. But hmm... the <br>\r\nconcentration of divine power constituting these outfits are fairly low - even completely annihilating them is unlikely to provide enough power to open the wormhole again. If I fail, this would resulting in me travelling nakedly until I reach the nearest town...\" Nymph stops her train of thought, shivers, as she does not wish to foresee what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about relic where I made my last descent? A tiny amount of my divine power was released during the conflict when the planet rejected my entry, and I am sure that would sufficient to support my trip back. I just need to find it. Speaking of places, where exactly am I?\" Nymph sighs. The trip was not exactly smooth as she planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howl----\" With leaves rustling and a growling noise, a wolf pounces towards Nymph while she is thinking about her next plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph!\" Nymph snorts, but the creature is not dying as she thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I sealed myself.\" Nymph realizes but the wolf has reached her. It all happens in a flash. The wolf pins Nymph onto the ground with its front paws. The wolf opens its month with its teeth shins under sunlight and bites onto Nymph's left shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwww\" The wolf growls in pain as its teeth shatters the moment they touch Nymph's clothes. In fear, the wolf turns around and runs away. Yet, before it could make its escape, a large ice spike pierces through its body, nailing it onto the dirt road. Though her divine power is sealed, magic is still an option on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasphemy. I declare you guilty!\" Nymph stands back up, dusting the dirt off her clothes and announces. For a brief moment she showed her dignity. As goddess, her pride allows no trampling. Though, she does not know, soon, her pride will be tossed into dumpster when her greatest weakness is exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame enshrouds the wolf's dead body, burning it into ash in seconds, leaving a shining crystal lying on an ash pile. Nymph walks over and picks up the crystal. Sensing the negligible amount of divine energy within, Nymph frowns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My last descent might have left a lasting influence on this planet...\" Nymph thinks to herself. At this point, she has no idea that this long term impact is going to involve her into a crisis that she has never encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My people...\" Nymph shakes her head, clearing the regret in her mind. She takes a moment to examine herself, noticing that her clothes appear to be slightly thinner than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! The shield against that bite and my ice spike involuntarily drew energy from a nearby source and my clothes happened to be closest source. Although the amount is tiny, over time my outfits will be consumed.\" Nymph sighs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooo---\" Her stomach rumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right... My body needs food since it needs an energy source. Better find a town nearby.\" Nymph rubs her foreheads, soon set off her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently on a dirt road going in North-South direction, where is she heading to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nymph randomly picks a direction. \"South it is\". Since the road has only two directions, either one will lead to a nearby town. It is just a matter of time before Nymph reaches it. Due to the limit of technology, traveling of ordinary people is highly constrained, thus distance between towns are usually quite short - reachable within one day. Nymph is bored. Walking down the dirt road, she looks left and right at her surroundings, nothing special but bushes, grass, and trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh it's been ten minutes, not even one person!\" The goddess yells at the zenith, upset. As she is yelling, afar approaches three bandits, one repeatedly tosses his knife up and catches it with his fingers pinching the blade, one with his hands in his pockets and one slowly pulling out his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember seeing a type of people who base their well-being on the loss of others' during my observation, and humans call them bandits. Those must be them!\" Nymph is so excited that her body is trembling as the bandits approach. Clearly, they have heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl over there, I heard you wanted to see people. Well, well, today is your lucky day, but for your luck, there is a price. Now, hand over your valuables!\" The leading bandit whose hands are still in his pockets yells at Nymph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, calm down, what should I do? Play cool or pretend I am scared?\" Nymph's head is lowered as she thinks. Her body is trembling in excitement, for this is the first group of real humans she has encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm talking to you! Look at me, that girl over there! HAND OVER YOUR VALUABLES! Or you will be hurt!\" The leading bandit pulls his hand out of his pockets. On them wears two gauntlets with blades pointing out. To them, Nymph is trembling because she is scared. Thus, the bandits grow more insolent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, after this, can... You know, we haven't got ourselves relieved for a while...\" One bandit grins and speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That crossed the line. You all shall die!\" Nymph raises her heads, looking down at the bandits with arrogance. Yet, nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I forgot I am no longer capable of eradicate someone with a thought.\" Nymph steps back and regrets, yet it is already too late. The leading bandit grabs Nymph by her right wrist and lifts her arm up. Nymph tries to resist, yet her body does not possess enough strength to break out. The other two bandits walks towards Nymph, one left of her and one right of her. A bolt of lightning suddenly shoot off Nymph's free left hand, turning the bandit left of her into ash. The bandits clearly were not prepared for this sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!! She's a witch!!\" The remaining bandit minion pauses and steps backward in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab her, moron! She cannot cast another spell that fast!!\" The leading bandit yells. Hearing this, the minion runs towards Nymph. Nymph tries to kick him with her left foot, but the minion hastily grabs onto her ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!!\" Nymph points her left palm at the minion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off her boot and tickle her foot! It will interrupt her spell!\" The leader yells at the minion while he punches Nymph's stomach with his bladed gauntlet. hoping to at least injure her. Yet, the moment the blades touches Nymph's clothes, in the bandit's astound, they shatter into small pieces and falls onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss they won't come off!\" The minion pulls Nymph's boot with his full strength but the shoe stays tightly attached to her foot, despite how loosely it seems to fit on her foot. In a haste, the minion takes his knife and stabs at her calf. Though Nymph is not wearing stockings of any sort, yet the knife shatters as it touches Nymph's bare calf. After all, this body used to contain the divine power. Though Nymph may not be physically strong, her body cannot be harmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a monster!!\" The minion releases his clenching hand and runs away without turning back no matter how his boss yells at him. However, before he could reach far, another bolt of lightning strikes him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me!!\" The leading bandit rapidly releases Nymph's wrist and kneels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late.\" Nymph rubs her wrist and stares at the bandit, ready to toss another bolt of lightning at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a moron blinded by wealth, please forgive me!! I will tell you everything I know and do everything you ask, as long as you do not kill me!\" The bandit begs for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Nymph do?</span></div></div>",

Now, tell me a little about this area.\" Nymph demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes Milady! We are currently in the territory of Lady Ledia within the Kingdom of Nordenheim. Lady Ledia is also a powerful witch, much like you. Her territory contains 33 village and towns, and the next town we are heading to, Hillshire, is one of them. If we ride a carriage down south from Hillshire for another day, we would reach the capital of Lady Ledia's territory, Ledia City. The city was renamed after Lady Ledia herself, for she is the most powerful caster within this region. From what I heard, she has 8 mana channels - that's the level of archmage! She...\" The bandit was interrupted by Nymph as he is about to continue the introduction of Ledia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! Powerful you said?\" Nymph snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of--Of course not as powerful as you are, Milady. You are the greatest! Even Sofia the Archwitch and Arken the Archwizard is not match of your power, Milady.\" The bandit flatters, though he does not know all the flattering was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not care who Sofia and Arken are, but you are right, I am the most powerful god.... I mean witch on this planet!\" Nymph almost leaked the fact that she was the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certain you are Milady!\" Though the bandit does not believe Nymph's words, he still flatters. After all, he is no match of her. Yet, in his mind, a lot of dark schemes are being plotted. As Nymph mindlessly admits his flattering, looking around while walking down the road, the bandit's eye have scrutinized her body. On top Nymph is wearing a shirt fitting tightly to her body, on bottom is a short dress fitting to her thighs, and on her feet is a pair of short boots that seems to fit loosely - her armpits are cover by the sleeves, her navel is covered by the shirt, her thighs may not be as ticklish, and thus her feet seem to be the best target. However, from previous experience, her boots do not seem to come off that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady, your shoes seem to be fairly loose, I'd imagine it is quite uncomfortable having sand and small pieces of stones falling into them once in a while. Why not choose something other adventurers prefer, like thigh boots?\" Seeing that Nymph remains silent, the bandit asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These you can call divine artifact, they are a product of low-concentration divine power. My clothes are made of the same material.\" Nymph replies with proud as she made them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--Wh--What?\" The bandit is astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Divine artifacts?\" Nymph replies with a rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For--Forgive me. How...How is that possible?\" The bandit is still astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, almost made a slip\" Nymph thought to herself, quickly making up a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My.. Umm.. My Master was once on an adventure to the site where the catastrophe took place 1500 years ago. He found a way to utilize the remnant energy and made this outfit for me.\" Nymph fabricates a fake Master and his fake adventure to hide the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great wizard! He must be one of those great wizards who seclude themselves. Can... can I meet him?\" The bandit seem to believe Nymph. He looks at Nymph with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm no. He passed away years ago in an experiment with divine power.\" Nymph replies nervously, afraid that her lie would be debunked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.. What a shame.\" The bandit seems to be upset, yet he is looking for loopholes in Nymph's words. However, he was unable to disprove what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady, have you tested how many mana channels you have?\" The bandit asks, as he has come up with another scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and you can call me Nymph.\" Nymph replies with impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific! You should totally run the test. From I could see, your talent must be unprecedented. You may even break the record! I know a massage store in town that runs such a test. They also provide the best massage service in the entire Ledia Territory. I heard rumors that the store owner have even provided service for Sofia the Archwitch.\" The bandit recommends with all his effort, as he wants to know how talented and ticklish is his \"master\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Nymph say?</span></div></div>",

After this, both Nymph and the bandit remain silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Milady. This is not a very large town, but it still have its protection against monster.\" The bandit points at the fences along horizon. Nymph nods again without saying a word. It is not because she is apathetic, rather, she is trying to suppress the excitement within her - as long as she speaks, she would expose her feelings, yet she wants to keep her mighty figure in front of the bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will lead you to the massage store immediately. There is nothing better than a good massage after a long trip. I am sure your body is starting feel sore after all the walking.\" The bandit ingratiates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\" Nymph rubs her calves. The walking has definitely been a little tiring. Besides, physical strength is not her forte. The bandit leads her to a large store with a sign standing nearby: \"Claire's Massage Salon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire is the best masseur in town like I mentioned. It costs a fortune to get a massage from her, but the other masseurs are also fantastic.\" The bandit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that chick over there, my lady here needs a good massage. Get your top-notch masseur. Money is not an issue.\" The bandit speaks to the receptionist rudely. Nymph turns over and throws a harsh stare at the bandit. He suddenly turns silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Just her?\" The girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me.\" Nymph replies before the bandit opens his month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way please.\" The girl leads Nymph inside. The bandit wants to follow, yet Nymph stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are spared.\" Nymph speaks to the bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" The bandit is about to say something but he is interrupted by Nymph. He wants to follow Nymph so that he could get his revenge in the future. Being spared is not exact what he is after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you are spared.\" Nymph speaks again, in a harsher tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" The bandit leaves with his fist clenching tightly. He will see her again, and the next time, he will get his revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looks at the two people with confusion, but she asks no questions. People have all kinds of secrets, especially power ones. Pretending nothing has happened is the best choice. The girl calms herself down and leads Nymph into a small room, inside which lies only a bed. The light is dim and the smell of incense spreads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This lady, please wait inside. Our masseur is on her way.\" The girl asks politely. Nymph nods, walks into the room and sits on the bed. The door is closed, and opens again a couple of minutes later. A young woman walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Silvia, and I will be your masseur today. Just a quick question: you are a witch, right?\" Silvia speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am. And you can call me Nymph.\" Nymph smells at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how many mana channels you have within you? This would help us decide the best massage style for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Nymph replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, why don't you remove your clothes and let me give it a try.\" Silvia speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. all my clothes? Including shoes?\" A blush of red climbs up Nymph's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just remove your top for now.\" Silvia's eye cannot move away from Nymph's face, for she is too cute with her shy looking. Hearing this, Nymph takes off her shirt and lies on the bed facing down. The next moment, she bursts into laughters the moment Silvia's hand touches her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha--Hahahaha--Stop--\" Nymph cannot resist the sensation even though Silvia's hands are barely touching her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nymph, I was just touching your back, relax.\" Silvia tries to relax Nymph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really tickled!\" Nymph complains. There is a little bit of tear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will increases the thickness of my mana gloves then.\" Silvia replies. As witches grow more sensitive with the number of mana channel in them, often upper class witches cannot tolerate people touching their skin - it tickles them. Thus, masseurs with a little talent in magic was born. They are not talented enough to cast magic, but they have the ability of control mana particles in air to form a layer of mana glove that reduces the ticklish sensation. The greater magic talent one masseur possess, the thicker their mana glove can be. Rumors have floated around that Sofia the Archwitch requires a masseur with at least four mana channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia carefully controls the mana flow and increases the thickness of mana gloves to the maximum amount she could handle. Her hands again touch Nymph's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe--Hehe\" Nymph giggles. The ticklish sensation is definitely much less severe, but it is still not fully relieved. Moments later, Silvia removes her hands from Nymph's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird. Your body is like.. like air, or earth. Mana seems to float within you without the need of mana channels. I have never seen this. Let me call my boss.\" Silvia speaks. Her fingers pokes lightly on Nymph's body before she opens the door - she cannot urge the impulse of  wanting to see the laughing face of this cuties ine more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha\" Nymph laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
